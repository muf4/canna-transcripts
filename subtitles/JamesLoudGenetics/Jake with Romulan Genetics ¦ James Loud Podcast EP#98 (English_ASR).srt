Jake from romul and genetics how are you

11
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,960
doing Jake doing great man thanks for

12
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:56,599

we've rescheduled this a couple times

15
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:02,440
we've been talking about doing podcast

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,159
for years yeah yeah uh you've been in

17
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:06,560
the breeding book we got photos thank

18
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,640
you for your photos thank you for your

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,000
contributions welcome brother uh thank

20
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,320
you for your contributions to the

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,640
industry we met online we met on

22
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:16,279
Instagram you have amazing photos you

23
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,959
right away when I saw your photos I was

24
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,879
like man this guy knows what he's doing

25
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:22,599
as far as photography and with flower uh

26
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,478
your growing is really good and I love

27
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:27,280
the way you breed because you've bred

28
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:29,200
Romulan into so many other cultivars and

29
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,478
you've really stuck with that whereas a

30
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,439
lot of people are Crea beting all these

31
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:35,000
different f1s you kind of had a game

32
00:01:32,438 --> 00:01:36,719
plan going into it and you know Romulan

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,280
is part of your history so let's start

34
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:39,560
with that can't I can't believe I'm

35
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,840
still here doing that like I'm still

36
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,600
here breeding Romulan and people

37
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,280
actually liking it and buying it and

38
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:47,438
it's people love it it doesn't make any

39
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,040
sense to me but it's working you know um

40
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:52,039
you when I started out with this I was

41
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,759
just uh I found myself like the steward

42
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,600
and the caretaker of this cut that had

43
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,280
been in my family for years and I

44
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:59,118
started giving it away and I ended up

45
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,478
gifting it to darkart nursery and Dan

46
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:03,000
got a hold of it right um he gave it to

47
00:02:01,478 --> 00:02:04,399
all the you know Legacy farmers and

48
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,759
luminaries all the people in the Emerald

49
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,478
Triangle and they grew it out for like a

50
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,080
couple years verifying it and going

51
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:11,000
through all that stuff um and I kind of

52
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,520
thought that was like the end of the

53
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,239
road for me I just wanted to get the cut

54
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,719
out get it in enough people's hands

55
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,599
darkart started selling it and they were

56
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:19,080
selling thousands of cuts every week and

57
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:20,878
then I had people in Canada and Europe

58
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,160
asking me make seeds because I can't get

59
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:26,479
the Clone right well I guess I'll I'll

60
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:28,439
buckle down and make some seeds and it

61
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,318
was all just kind of like a little side

62
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:32,120
quest thing I was doing and I you know

63
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:33,759
made little labels and created Romulan

64
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,239
genetics just kind of like as a joke

65
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:36,759
like I'm going to send these seeds out

66
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:38,680
and this is it though I'm done with it

67
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:39,878
I'm done after this I had a great career

68
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,360
soon as they got the seeds they were

69
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:43,959
like this is like the best Romulan I've

70
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,440
ever grown from seed make fems and you

71
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:48,080
helped me kind of pinpoint down with

72
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:49,598
some advice on how to get the fims made

73
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,920
and then as soon as I got the the Fe

74
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:53,878
feminized stuff out I'm like I'm done

75
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:57,000
this this is it and people said make

76
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:58,840
crosses so I started making crosses and

77
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,360
next thing I knew it just it blew up got

78
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,920
out of control and I retired about two

79
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,040
or three years ago from what I was doing

80
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:07,479
before and I do this full-time now

81
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,479
freaking love it yeah I mean there's

82
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:11,759
it's a beautiful place to be I mean some

83
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:14,518
people you know you hear different sides

84
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,959
of the industry but if you're passionate

85
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:17,760
about it it's it's a great time to be

86
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,479
alive yeah there is no bad time to be

87
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:21,359
alive as far as I'm concerned especially

88
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:22,919
with cannabis you know it's like with

89
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,840
all these crosses then to be able to go

90
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:26,639
back to stuff like Romulan and blue

91
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,360
dream and you're even doing Blue Dream

92
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,279
Romulan crosses you know what I mean

93
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,720
yeah it's great and I think working with

94
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,039
some of these older genetics they're

95
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:35,239
very stable what a lot of people don't

96
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:36,719
understand is some of these older things

97
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:38,680
man they are so much more stable Blue

98
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,799
Dream if you self it you get four

99
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,200
Expressions right it's basically four

100
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,000
Expressions four different phenotypical

101
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,759
VAR and and within that there's there's

102
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,759
some other things but like really you

103
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:50,560
have some outliers but it's mainly four

104
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:52,000
things but yeah it's mainly four things

105
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,640
and and then you'll get a dead ringer

106
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
for Blue Dream right and I'm sure

107
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:57,958
Romulan is similar to that where it's

108
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,959
super stable also when you breed it

109
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:03,640
you'll get

110
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:05,199
very uniform Expressions too and it'll

111
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:07,958
help stabilize with other things you can

112
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:09,719
stabilize stuff yeah I I the whole

113
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:11,479
Romulan thing for me was you know one it

114
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:12,799
was it was my dad and I felt like a

115
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:14,919
little bit of weight dad had pass and I

116
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,879
got the cut and I got to keep this alive

117
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:18,759
um once I started smoking it though it

118
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:20,759
was like it was life-changing for me it

119
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:23,000
genuinely was it was it was medicine I

120
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:24,280
got off at the time I've got a bunch of

121
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,079
nerve damage from my Marine Corps

122
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:29,079
Service and everything else um I was on

123
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:31,000
40,000 milligrams a day of Gaba penon

124
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:32,639
which is a nerve blocker so like I mean

125
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,639
I could slice my hand open grab a hot

126
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,360
pan I wouldn't even [ __ ] feel it it

127
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,918
was really dangerous doctor said you can

128
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,360
never wean yourself off this you can

129
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:40,918
never get off this medication people

130
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,639
that get on gabip Penton once you cross

131
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:45,839
over like the 10,000 milligram a day

132
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:48,720
Mark there is no weaning off of it wow

133
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:50,279
and I would have these episodes of of

134
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,080
nerve damage pain where I would just I

135
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:54,000
mean like be bedridden for a week or two

136
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:55,599
sometimes and it be really bad I'd feel

137
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,800
like I was on fire I feel like you it

138
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,080
was ice and Frozen it feel like stabbing

139
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,360
pain all different types and just

140
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:04,000
randomly over usually in my joints and

141
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,160
my hands um but like really bad

142
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,918
arthritis was what it was like and it

143
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,520
would just hit me out of nowhere and for

144
00:05:06,918 --> 00:05:10,240
like 10 years I couldn't really I didn't

145
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:12,359
have much of a life you know I I worked

146
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,120
from home doing electrical engineering I

147
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,038
couldn't really hold any kind of regular

148
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,240
job so I had to have something I had a

149
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:20,759
good career thankfully but it was really

150
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,680
bad yeah and uh I noticed after I you

151
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:25,439
know got through a couple harvests of

152
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,800
Romulan and I'm smoking it I would smoke

153
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:29,279
some and it was like a special occasion

154
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,199
weed for me cuz it was so good and and I

155
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:32,758
wouldn't have episode for like a week

156
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,000
and I started putting it together over

157
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:37,439
time told my doctor I want to get off

158
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,800
this stuff this Gaba penon and I got a

159
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:40,959
plan and she's like you're gonna [ __ ]

160
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,000
yourself up you're going to be in the

161
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:45,038
hospital you know you're going to be

162
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,319
back here and two weeks I weaned off the

163
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:50,000
gabop pen wow just by smoking Romulan

164
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:51,560
every day and since then I've kept

165
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,720
smoking Romulan start Mak crosses and

166
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,439
everything but I mean I'm like back on

167
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,600
mountain biking I'm snowboarding again I

168
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:58,360
hadn't done that stuff since I was 25 30

169
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,680
years old so it's like I'm I'm back to

170
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,360
living life again nice so there was a a

171
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,038
big part of me where it's like you know

172
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,560
it was there was a medical part to it

173
00:06:04,038 --> 00:06:07,439
where I wanted to kind of give this gift

174
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,759
back out to people and help everyone but

175
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,038
the breeding side of it you know I

176
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:11,759
really enjoy the smoke the breeding side

177
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:14,680
of it she's kind of like I think of it

178
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,960
she's like a a key like a genetic key so

179
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,639
I can breed her with pretty much

180
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:19,680
anything I want like three4 of the

181
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:21,280
things that I breed her with she'll open

182
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,639
up in just a beautiful way she'll make

183
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:26,959
something brand new or you know go off

184
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,439
in this new Direction type thing yeah

185
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:30,000
it's not like Jack where you breed it

186
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:31,478
with a lot of things you come out with

187
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,319
Jack right you can get different

188
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:36,038
Expressions that yeah certain genetics

189
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,560
breed really well and certain genetics

190
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:40,639
don't and I think a lot of people

191
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,199
they'll breed stuff in and like a lot of

192
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,160
the gelato stuff with gelato there's

193
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,400
phenotypical variation and there because

194
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,280
they're not stable for one thing right

195
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:51,598
but uh you know and you can only have so

196
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:53,159
much dilato in your life but with

197
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:55,478
Romulan yeah I mean I've seen some of

198
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,800
your crosses and the way they express

199
00:06:55,478 --> 00:06:59,839
the as far as morphology man some

200
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:03,478
amazing stuff you know you're Ross the

201
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:06,719
board cuz Romulan is a hybrid but it's

202
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:09,360
definitely leaning towards the indicia

203
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,599
side of the hybrid as far as morphology

204
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,400
right but it also you get big huge butts

205
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:16,159
like it's a big producer most people had

206
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:17,758
uh Joe's cut Joe slerman was what

207
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,240
everyone knows is Ramy and Joe most

208
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,199
people have experienced his cut um not

209
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,519
everyone has had the Vick high cut they

210
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:26,400
both acquired their cuts from people

211
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:29,198
yeah um viig High said where he got his

212
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:30,719
Joe never really told anyone um over the

213
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,038
years I've talked to so many people I

214
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,599
talked to Shawn who was uh Joe sl's best

215
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:36,079
friend you probably know sea he was one

216
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:38,079
of the early High Times Cannabis Cup

217
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:39,079
seeds guys right he was best friends

218
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:40,639
with him through all that time and he

219
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:42,318
was like you know he never said he bred

220
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,800
it he never really said where he got it

221
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,158
from but most people had his cut and

222
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,560
they didn't really try the Vick High

223
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:50,319
stuff and the Vick Kai is like a dwarf

224
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,800
sativa yeah it's it's got hybrid effects

225
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,520
if you smoke a little bit of it you get

226
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,120
energy if you smoke a shitload of it it

227
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:57,399
just put you down right I mean just out

228
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,079
it's it's really really good for that

229
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:00,878
you know I like it that I can I can have

230
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:02,560
like half a joint smoke a bowl of it in

231
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,840
the morning in the afternoon anytime I

232
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,360
want I'm centered I feel good but if I

233
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:07,878
really want to get over saturated I just

234
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,000
smoke a little bit more and I'm just

235
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:11,840
[ __ ] out of it yeah it's strong it's

236
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,680
always yeah it's been known for you know

237
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:16,198
I remember it from the 90s right like

238
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,918
90s early 2000s in the bay he was

239
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:20,919
floating around I mean there was clones

240
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:22,560
available of it Ken from Beyond bomb xjs

241
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:25,560
I'm not sure what his clone company was

242
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,240
but I believe he had it uh you know and

243
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,800
there was there was access to good

244
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,598
flower back then in fact I feel like the

245
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,360
flower back was better on average than

246
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:36,439
the flower today yeah a lot of people

247
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,320
might disagree or whatever but like from

248
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,399
my perspective I think there was a lot

249
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,479
more passionate people and it was all

250
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,720
craft you know back then it wasn't big

251
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,200
50 lighters it was six lighters four

252
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,600
lighters 10 lighters 10 lighters was big

253
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,200
back then it was you know there wasn't a

254
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,360
ton of 10 lighters a lot of stuff was

255
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,680
like six or less grown in the houses or

256
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,159
outdoor right yeah most people were

257
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:58,039
maybe in a garage they weren't blowing

258
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:59,838
up a condo on the beach somewhere you

259
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:01,480
most people were doing that in in the

260
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,320
totally I mean we had an eight lighter

261
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,560
you know my business partner had 12

262
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,480
eight lighters when I had one you know

263
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:09,639
so like it's it's one of those things I

264
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,240
you know but but now we got 100 lighters

265
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:14,600
and 200 lighters and thousand Watts or

266
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,519
thousand 40,000 square feet and yeah all

267
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,959
that good stuff totally and it's you

268
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,600
know we're in a different world but uh

269
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:24,199
there wasn't as much as far as genetics

270
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,519
there's thousands and thousands of

271
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,680
crosses right and and stuff available

272
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:30,159
names available but as far as the

273
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:32,879
diversity there was so much more

274
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:35,240
diversity back in the day yeah I I agree

275
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:37,439
I mean there's I don't feel like I meet

276
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,159
as many people anymore like I used to I

277
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,600
me I used to do Interstate trafficking

278
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:42,719
and travel to the farmers and pick up

279
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,560
and stuff and and you'd meet people that

280
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,120
had like this heirloom cut or they've

281
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:48,039
had it for 10 years no one else has it

282
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,480
but them right you know they bred it

283
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:52,838
their wife bred it some something like

284
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,519
that and and it was just the most unique

285
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:56,519
different thing You' ever you know the

286
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:58,000
smell the effects the taste every you're

287
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:59,600
like what is this and they're like yeah

288
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,480
yeah nobody else has that right you know

289
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,278
I'm like going to give you a really

290
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,959
small amount here you go yeah I mean I

291
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:05,399
think we're kind of trying to go back in

292
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:07,239
that direction a little bit I see a lot

293
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:08,360
of people even even big name breeders

294
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,639
that were breeding all this stuff are

295
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,079
kind of going back to working with some

296
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:14,799
of the older genetics but uh

297
00:10:13,078 --> 00:10:17,679
everything's really become homogenized

298
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:18,919
to a degree yeah you know with the

299
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:21,399
thought process of how do we move

300
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:23,479
forward from this so I think in Europe

301
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:25,440
the Hayes made their wave with the hay

302
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,079
and then everything got homogenized over

303
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,680
there and they lost a lot of diversity

304
00:10:27,078 --> 00:10:31,359
we definitely lost it starting with

305
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:32,838
cookies you know I think cookies was

306
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,919
really the beginning of the end in some

307
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:37,360
ways for our industry as far as

308
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:39,360
diversity uh in in the United States but

309
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,600
then I look up in the hills you know we

310
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,720
go up to Grass Valley or we go up into

311
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,600
the Emerald Triangle and they're still

312
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,360
cranking out amazing flower that's

313
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,440
diverse right yeah I just uh not too

314
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,159
long ago had a whole come to Jus Jesus

315
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,320
moment when I tried John's White Thorn

316
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:57,799
arose and yeah had to hit him up right

317
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,800
away and was like hell where' this come

318
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:01,799
from yeah and he's like oh beenin around

319
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:03,240
it's just you know it's been quiet it's

320
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:05,479
really good I think the white Thorn

321
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,200
Romulan would be amazing to be honest I

322
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,440
think that would be a great great cross

323
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:13,600
they have a similar kind of centering I

324
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,399
got special here actually the zdp is my

325
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,680
white Throne Rose it's the that was the

326
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:20,159
motivation when we were doing the fenal

327
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:22,399
hunt I found this one plant out of the

328
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:24,319
out of the fenal hunt we did we we got a

329
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,799
lot of Keepers right or a lot of stuff

330
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,959
that we want to grow again and see how

331
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:29,759
it does right maybe not winners but

332
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:32,078
definitely keepers

333
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:35,399
and within the progyny there was one

334
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:38,278
stand out this was just a far outlier

335
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:40,759
that has the GDP floral along with the

336
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:42,278
candy and it also has the the color too

337
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:45,958
so it's got that GDP color with that

338
00:11:42,278 --> 00:11:48,278
floral note that is very specific to GDP

339
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:49,679
with a little candy hint on it and so

340
00:11:48,278 --> 00:11:51,399
little sweetness yeah and I'm actually

341
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:53,278
gifting this cut to John so he can grow

342
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:55,159
it out and do some crosses with it and I

343
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,078
think I'm excited to collaborate with

344
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:58,439
Johnny he's he's really amazing him and

345
00:11:57,078 --> 00:12:00,399
Jason are doing you know they're doing

346
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,639
the Lord's work up there yeah still you

347
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,759
know it's really hard to do outdoor

348
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:07,200
production or Greenhouse

349
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:09,319
production uh up there the way things

350
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,200
have been so a lot of people have fallen

351
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,480
off unfortunately yeah but uh I feel

352
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,879
like a lot of the guys that are still

353
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,720
here are doing it because they love it

354
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,480
it's so it's a passion it's it's it's in

355
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,320
your freaking blood you know you can't

356
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,920
help it yeah and then when you see you

357
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,320
know in your life when you see cannabis

358
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:25,000
Miracles like when you're talking about

359
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:28,120
being able to cut out Gaba Penton I mean

360
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,559
it just makes it that much more real

361
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,000
that you're you're doing the you're on

362
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:34,000
the right path right and one of the

363
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,399
first things that I had of a cannabis

364
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,198
miracle was this guy hit me up and uh

365
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,958
his dad since he came back from the

366
00:12:38,198 --> 00:12:43,078
Vietnam War yeah it had night terrors

367
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:44,559
just couldn't function at night couldn't

368
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:46,120
sleep in the same room with his wife let

369
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:49,198
alone the same bed and they hadn't slept

370
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:51,000
in the same bed since 1978 wow and he

371
00:12:49,198 --> 00:12:52,759
made his dad some Rick Simpson Oil out

372
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,519
of either my Romulan I think it was my

373
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:57,000
Romulan feminized seeds or maybe it was

374
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:58,360
a cross gave it to his dad and within a

375
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,639
week they were sleeping in the same bed

376
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,440
together and he doesn't have Terror

377
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:03,560
anymore I mean it's like completely

378
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,519
changed his life for the better yeah I

379
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:07,958
heard that and it was like there really

380
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,919
isn't anything that I can do to help out

381
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:12,439
people more me personally you know what

382
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:14,360
I was doing with electrical engineering

383
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,800
I was doing Life Safety design

384
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,278
architectural design so it was like a

385
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,078
protecting people kind of thing and I've

386
00:13:18,278 --> 00:13:21,720
always been that way I've always kind of

387
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:23,439
steered towards that being a protector

388
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,278
and helping out but it was like that it

389
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,360
was so meaningless it was just it's a

390
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:28,559
fire alarm system [ __ ] they'll find

391
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,680
their way out of the building this

392
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:33,559
though actually change someone's life

393
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:34,759
completely yeah and uh yeah I don't I

394
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:36,838
don't know that I'll ever be able to do

395
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:39,319
anything else again yeah I mean it's so

396
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:40,959
hard to argue that it you know as far as

397
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,760
I see it making the world a better place

398
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:46,559
on a on a daily basis right so like I

399
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:49,559
see this plant making people's lives

400
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:51,719
better improving the world you know

401
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:53,119
tenfold and there's so many other things

402
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,360
that kind of take away from it but it's

403
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,000
so hard to argue that this plant is bad

404
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,199
and I think there's still people out

405
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,120
there that are like you know the plants

406
00:14:00,198 --> 00:14:05,240
the devil the freaking Devil's lettuce

407
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:07,159
all this stuff but uh slowly but surely

408
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,320
we're changing people's minds eventually

409
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:11,120
right yeah I think you only need to see

410
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,160
one cannabis Miracle to believe in it

411
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,360
you know what I mean it's like one of

412
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:16,000
those things like whether someone has

413
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,480
cancer and all of a sudden they can eat

414
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,159
again or it cures cancer right you know

415
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,759
but but even just the fact that when

416
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,879
you're on chemotherapy and you can take

417
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:25,839
it and now you can eat food how can you

418
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:27,600
argue that somebody doesn't e it you

419
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,360
know it's it should be their choice or

420
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,759
some kid who has seizures that needs CBD

421
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,879
to relieve the seizures how could you

422
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:36,360
want to take that away from a child you

423
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:38,320
know I think that's just cruel yeah

424
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:42,519
especially because it's a plant you know

425
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:45,560
it's it's one of those things yep agreed

426
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:48,278
so uh tell me about your father he was a

427
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:51,679
badass he really was I miss him he had

428
00:14:48,278 --> 00:14:54,198
his faults that's for sure he

429
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:57,679
uh he was born and raised in the 30s in

430
00:14:54,198 --> 00:14:58,879
Utah and he ran away go to Disneyland

431
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:00,679
stole a car and ran away and came to

432
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:04,320
colge California never went back when he

433
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:05,838
was like 14 15 or 16 um he always worked

434
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,360
in the oil field industry worked oil

435
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,839
rigs and stuff like that and at some

436
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:13,879
point in the 60s he started selling he

437
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:15,399
started selling weed coke LSD pills and

438
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:18,320
it was kind of like a progressive thing

439
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:20,639
I imagine eventually he was like

440
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,399
entwined with the Hell's Angels from the

441
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,120
Ventura Chapter all the way up into

442
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,958
Vancouver in the 70s he was like the

443
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,639
number one drug dealer in the Tri County

444
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:31,518
Area he was kind of like a a mini Jung

445
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:34,159
you know who that is yeah he was selling

446
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,039
weed to Fleetwood Mac and the Eagles and

447
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:37,399
Michael Jackson and he had all these

448
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:39,159
albums that were signing you know thanks

449
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:41,078
for bringing the party GDB from the

450
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:43,480
Eagles and all this stuff and that was I

451
00:15:41,078 --> 00:15:46,000
grew up you know in the late 70s around

452
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,360
that it was just a constant [ __ ]

453
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,839
party

454
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,440
nonstop um he'd go to work and he' get

455
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,959
home i' i' meet him at the fence with a

456
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,279
beer even you know when I was like three

457
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:55,879
and he'd get big beer and he'd come in

458
00:15:54,278 --> 00:15:57,240
and hit his bong and then the party

459
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:58,720
would start people would show up and it

460
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,440
was like that every damn night just

461
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,399
about but he was yeah he was a really

462
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,000
good guy he was a protector you know

463
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,198
that was what he instilled in me he was

464
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,198
the kind of guy where if someone went

465
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:07,439
tearing down the street in the

466
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:09,318
neighborhood hauling ass and the kids

467
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,920
were out playing he'd go find who that

468
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:12,318
guy was and break his jaw you know it's

469
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:13,559
just like you don't drive like that with

470
00:16:12,318 --> 00:16:15,479
kids playing in the street but he was a

471
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:17,638
really good guy but he had his faults I

472
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:20,399
didn't know until not too long ago that

473
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:23,039
him and my mom hooked up he was 36 and

474
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,559
she was 16 14 something like that you

475
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,599
know it was a different time back then

476
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:28,518
and all that but hearing that now I'm

477
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,879
like yeah my that was a [ __ ]

478
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:32,278
pedophile like freaking out about it my

479
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:33,919
mom's like no it was different like

480
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:36,000
everyone knew it wasn't like something

481
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:37,399
we were hiding but it's still you know

482
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
he had his faults he did a lot of

483
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:42,839
illegal [ __ ] but um he was a really good

484
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,720
guy took care of everyone around him

485
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:46,880
yeah and I don't still to this day don't

486
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,399
know how he pulled it off but he was

487
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:50,879
entwined with like the early version of

488
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,039
the Cali cartel the Hell's Angels really

489
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:55,039
dangerous people high level drug dealing

490
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:57,240
and he just stopped one day I don't know

491
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:59,639
how he got away with it but he just

492
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,240
walked away from it all I mean our house

493
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:02,560
got raided two or three times when I was

494
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,000
a kid and the phone would ring an hour

495
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:05,599
or two ahead of time and he'd clear the

496
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,240
house out like he was getting tipped off

497
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,639
that he was getting raided he was at

498
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,759
that high of a level wow and I was

499
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,919
across the street one time watching

500
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:14,199
through my neighbor's window you know

501
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,799
all these cops are coming in and the

502
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,038
last time he got rided I think it scared

503
00:17:15,798 --> 00:17:20,119
the [ __ ] out of him he forgot he had

504
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:22,359
books of acid wrapped in um he had

505
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:24,599
frozen meat in the freezer and then you

506
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:26,279
put you know uh aluminum foil around

507
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:27,838
that and then he put the acid sheets

508
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:29,599
over the over that and another thing of

509
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,480
aluminum foil so you'd have to open it

510
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,839
up to find him in there they're not

511
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,400
getting you know nothing's happening

512
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:36,319
with the meat and he was like there was

513
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,038
just you know three or four books of

514
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:39,279
acid in there and just one sheet would

515
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:41,558
have been enough to throw me in prison

516
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:44,879
the rest of my life yeah so I think that

517
00:17:41,558 --> 00:17:48,279
was kind of like the no I'm not going to

518
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,840
do this anymore wow yeah he was I mean I

519
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:52,079
was like five years old and he's telling

520
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:53,480
me how to people come in the house

521
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:55,199
here's where you get the gun and here's

522
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,519
the gun in the safe and if you're

523
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,720
standing here and I'm open in the safe

524
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:59,158
and there's a guy holding a gun I'm

525
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,759
going to pull this gun out and shoot him

526
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:03,120
so back up and right it was like 5 years

527
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:06,279
old I was learn a lot of stuff you don't

528
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:07,719
learn when you're a kid yeah makes for

529
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:10,879
interesting childhood though yeah yeah

530
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,519
it sure did and good stories yeah yeah

531
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:16,080
so yeah and then your father's

532
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:18,839
relationship with the Romulan yeah so he

533
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:20,678
uh is part of that he was he was growing

534
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:23,678
in the backyard and him and his buddy

535
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:25,759
Clyde started kind of breeding and stuff

536
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,919
um we'd go on these camping trips like

537
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:29,279
during the summer especially where we'd

538
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,000
drive all the way up to Oregon or

539
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:33,399
Washington just on the other side of the

540
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,759
border of Canada and there would be you

541
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,320
know shitload of Hell's Angels but the

542
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:38,879
main crew that my dad would be hanging

543
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:40,359
out would be all these older veteran

544
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:44,400
guys guys who had served in different

545
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:45,599
Wars and stuff and um this was all stuff

546
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,840
that I kind of picked up being around

547
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:48,599
him and stuff we talked about when I was

548
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:51,720
a little older but they would trade

549
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:53,279
seeds back and forth and so that was

550
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,120
this was like the early version of what

551
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:57,200
ended up becoming Romulan because Joe

552
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:58,199
called it Romulan but um back then they

553
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,798
were you know they all had like

554
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,720
different names for and stuff and pine

555
00:18:59,798 --> 00:19:04,440
Bud was one of them but they were

556
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,798
Canadian Korean warb bets had brought

557
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:09,759
back seeds of Korean Thai which was

558
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:11,079
probably just thae but who knows um and

559
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:13,558
they were growing it up in Canada in the

560
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:15,558
Vancouver BC area and because it was a

561
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:18,000
tie they just had a [ __ ] you know [ __ ]

562
00:19:15,558 --> 00:19:19,279
time growing it this was before I think

563
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,519
anyone was growing indoor back in the

564
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:24,000
50s and 60s um and so they started like

565
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:25,960
with this Collective and the camping

566
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,558
trips and everything they started you

567
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,400
know hey I crossed it with this back

568
00:19:27,558 --> 00:19:30,918
home I had this Mexican real good plant

569
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,200
and crossed it with that try these seeds

570
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:34,880
this here's the flower and they were

571
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:37,720
doing that for years and years and years

572
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,400
and um Dad was part of that he was you

573
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,440
know this small little sliver he didn't

574
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,360
some people kind of misconstrue things

575
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,000
like oh your dad bred Romulan no he

576
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:48,119
didn't at all he but he was a small part

577
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,720
small slice of this bigger Collective of

578
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:52,199
guys who were trading seeds back and

579
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,240
forth not really necessarily I mean it

580
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,798
sounded to me like they weren't really

581
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,640
intentionally breeding it was just kind

582
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:58,279
of like let's see if we can make it

583
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,919
easier to grow every now and then they'd

584
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:02,399
have something new to cross it with and

585
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,280
see what happened yeah um and they

586
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,960
crossed it with a Mexican sativa and

587
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:10,720
then a Colombian probably red colomban

588
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:13,159
sativa um then Afghan showed up on the

589
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,480
scene in you know 79 8081 something like

590
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:17,360
that they crossed it with that and they

591
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,240
hated the outcome and so they they went

592
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:21,558
and crossed it back the result to the

593
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,000
Colombian and it was just like Eureka

594
00:20:21,558 --> 00:20:25,440
that was everything all of sudden the

595
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,359
plant was a little shorter much heartier

596
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,000
could handle the cold didn't have this

597
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,759
crazy branching problem they had to

598
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,159
support every single thing out there

599
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:35,839
yeah um and then that was kind of the

600
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:38,679
Eureka moment for him and that was what

601
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:40,678
eventually ended up becoming ramyan nice

602
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:43,038
yeah it's pretty wild that you know it's

603
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:45,200
so funny because I feel like most people

604
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:48,879
see the genetics today whether it's the

605
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:51,880
gelados or the OG kushes and they don't

606
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,640
understand the lives that touch that

607
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:56,600
plant to get it to where it is today and

608
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:00,038
the Romulan is a great example of stuff

609
00:20:56,599 --> 00:21:02,519
that started you know 50s and 60s you

610
00:21:00,038 --> 00:21:05,079
know that's a long long time ago we're

611
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:08,158
talking about 60 years ago how many

612
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:10,199
people did it kept the plant alive kept

613
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,760
seeds we're all just stewards right at

614
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,120
the end of the day we're all just you

615
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:14,640
know we should look at ourselves as

616
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:16,798
stewards that are trying to pass this

617
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,640
plant on for another

618
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:21,879
600 200 years who knows where it's going

619
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:23,600
to go but like I think 200 years ago or

620
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,799
200 years from now they're probably not

621
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:27,000
going to look back and be like oh well

622
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:28,158
this person did this there might there

623
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,759
might be a handful of people that get

624
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,200
some credit now with technology a lot

625
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:34,000
more people will get credit but like

626
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,360
there's been people for the last 2,000

627
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
years that have carried this plant on

628
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:39,879
right and you know so we're really

629
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,038
working on the shoulders of giants like

630
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,440
we wouldn't even be messing with it

631
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:46,079
right now if it wasn't for shamans and

632
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,400
people you know th2000 plus years ago

633
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:50,439
yeah most of the stuff that ended up you

634
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,120
know it's it was semi land race at some

635
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,278
point right if it wasn't just full land

636
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:56,038
race but people were working with it

637
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:58,960
keeping it alive feral completely feral

638
00:21:56,038 --> 00:22:00,839
indigenous feral to stuff that went on

639
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,360
the Silk Road and went all over the

640
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:04,959
world you know I mean from Egypt to

641
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:07,678
Islands you know

642
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,038
Indonesia U and all over and all over

643
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,640
South America Central America and who

644
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:13,839
knows how long it's really been there we

645
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:16,360
we know I think we only understand it to

646
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:18,119
a certain degree so I think history we

647
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:20,079
only understand to a certain degree yeah

648
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:21,918
I'm withy on that one too I don't think

649
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:23,720
we know back far enough but same thing

650
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,799
with the Cannabis it's we keep finding

651
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:28,319
new things where they found you know

652
00:22:25,798 --> 00:22:29,839
some archaeological dig and they real oh

653
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:31,639
crap it goes back another 2,000 years

654
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:33,918
now cannabis use or it goes back another

655
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:36,320
3,000 years then so that that date keeps

656
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:39,000
getting pushed back further and further

657
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:40,918
of when they think we were using it we

658
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,720
just need some good time traveling now

659
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:45,360
yeah right go check it out for ourselves

660
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,319
go back string collecting seriously get

661
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:50,240
the real land race yeah before it got

662
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:51,918
all washed out yeah and well you know I

663
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,759
think there's a big confusion on what

664
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,520
land race really is I think some people

665
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:58,640
think land race is feral and feral is

666
00:22:56,519 --> 00:23:00,879
land they don't understand land race is

667
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,600
basically something that was cultivated

668
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,520
purposely cultivated and bred for a

669
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:07,678
purpose right right so land race from

670
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:10,480
Africa was breed whether it's for the

671
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:13,000
drug use or for certain plants were

672
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,880
grown for textiles right and then we can

673
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:20,278
take like crucifer like wild mustard for

674
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:22,080
example uh 2500 years ago wild mustard

675
00:23:20,278 --> 00:23:25,839
was just wild mustard and then they bred

676
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:29,000
it into things like kale uh things like

677
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:31,439
cabbage uh brussels sprouts

678
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,400
broccoli all these things are you know

679
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,558
they started out 2500 years ago as wild

680
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,840
mustard but they were you know they

681
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:38,798
selected the plants that grew for the

682
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:41,079
strongest leaves the most beautiful

683
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:42,158
leaves were were things like kale and

684
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:44,158
then when they went for the bud

685
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,679
structure or the flower structure you

686
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,120
know things like cabbage and if you look

687
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,880
at a brussel sprout it looks like a

688
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:52,278
miniature cabbage right right so it's

689
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:55,320
pretty wild like the history of what we

690
00:23:52,278 --> 00:23:57,079
can do just by we can do yeah yeah

691
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:59,079
intervening and and putting ourself in

692
00:23:57,079 --> 00:24:01,079
between things is uh

693
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:03,158
quite a trip yeah it's pretty pretty

694
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:05,678
amazing over time what can happen to

695
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:07,320
something you know on cannabis and we're

696
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,840
just scratching the surface of what's

697
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:10,879
possible with cannabis too I mean we

698
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:12,959
have a great

699
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,559
Foundation uh but the future is really

700
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,400
bright too and then as far as like where

701
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:19,119
we go in the next 10 years with

702
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,320
it um you know applying science to it it

703
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:23,879
could be pretty wild can be pretty scary

704
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:25,240
to some people and then uh I mean I'm

705
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,399
I'm pretty excited about some of the

706
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,200
stuff and the possibilities once we

707
00:24:27,398 --> 00:24:31,959
start understanding receptors and

708
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:35,480
cannabinoids and and how they work

709
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:38,240
synergistically along with tpin and

710
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:41,038
flavorants or you know th sulfur based

711
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,558
compounds yeah yeah I've been like Leaf

712
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:43,919
Works DNA if you know who they have been

713
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:46,319
talking to a bunch of the you know the

714
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,520
science head side of it and I love that

715
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:50,000
I'm a real nerdy guy anyway but you know

716
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:51,440
they've already identified interex

717
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,079
markers they've already identified a

718
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,320
bunch of different parts of the cannabis

719
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:58,558
plant that all of us right off the bat

720
00:24:55,319 --> 00:25:00,639
want to identify and um so yeah the

721
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:02,480
future is really bright as far as that

722
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,159
goes it doesn't sound great to a lot of

723
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,798
people as far as Gene editing and things

724
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,278
like that but it's I think it's you know

725
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:10,319
ignorance gets in the way of

726
00:25:08,278 --> 00:25:12,200
understanding the value of things like

727
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:13,720
that and it's probably not really even

728
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,240
going to be our generation it'll be

729
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,519
people while we're still alive we'll be

730
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:19,480
messing with it yeah but it you know a

731
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:21,440
100 years from now well and we don't

732
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,679
necessarily need Gene editing for

733
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,558
everything we can do data driven

734
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:28,559
breeding and you know it's like and then

735
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:31,119
AI can complement datadriven breeding by

736
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:33,240
giving us a path right so like you have

737
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:34,879
all your starting material you have all

738
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:38,200
the information there and then you want

739
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:41,440
to go from here to a specific trait yeah

740
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:43,759
you know and no matter how far that goes

741
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:47,440
we'll still have people in a basement or

742
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:50,519
a closet just breeding off of you know

743
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,080
tactile visual that kind of thing and so

744
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:53,599
we'll always have the old methods you

745
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:55,879
need the human aspect of it right

746
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:59,359
because it's it's so subjective right

747
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:02,120
quality from me to you can be completely

748
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:05,439
subjective right right I think that I

749
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:07,239
might like Skittles and candy or gas and

750
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,720
then you might like sativa or whatever

751
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,558
it is right it doesn't really matter but

752
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:15,200
it's subjective to the individual and

753
00:26:11,558 --> 00:26:16,839
what quality is can determine you know

754
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,278
what quality is can change from person

755
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:20,918
to person right so and location to

756
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:22,679
location certain places like look at New

757
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:24,960
York they love Sour Diesel there was a

758
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:26,960
point where it was like OG Kush was La

759
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:30,480
Sour Diesel was New York and then the

760
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:32,679
bay was cookies right and so and these

761
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,599
things change over time as they Trend

762
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:36,480
quality can change you know like purple

763
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:38,599
is an indicator of quality now

764
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,440
unfortunately which I'm not a huge fan

765
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:41,839
of the whole because because I feel like

766
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:44,399
a lot of the

767
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:46,720
phenotypes uh that are green if you look

768
00:26:44,398 --> 00:26:48,719
at the phenotypical expression the green

769
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,600
ones have better chirps or they're

770
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,159
louder I got to admit purplle got better

771
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:55,158
it has it has gotten a lot better 20

772
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:57,520
years ago I would if you pulled out

773
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:59,200
something that was purple I would have

774
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:01,158
no I don't want that no thank you yeah

775
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,319
like GDP was an exception right there

776
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:06,960
was good GDP and there was meno pers but

777
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:08,678
a lot of the per had no well I mean it

778
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,558
had flavor but it didn't have a high

779
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:12,038
right like it didn't have legs to it

780
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:13,720
that's what I my complaint was it didn't

781
00:27:12,038 --> 00:27:16,480
have legs to it and the flavors were

782
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:18,679
always like in the same territory yeah

783
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,798
you'd get the little miners you know but

784
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:22,278
it was mostly floral yeah right it was

785
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:24,960
mostly floral and it wasn't strong the

786
00:27:22,278 --> 00:27:27,278
Blackberry cush we didn't test for CBD I

787
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,360
wish we had that like we had testing

788
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:31,278
back then because the blackberry kush

789
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:33,119
the one that was up in Humble is the one

790
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:35,679
that didn't test high in THC it was like

791
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:37,479
CBD weed for sure yeah and it you you

792
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,919
would feel relaxed but it didn't get

793
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:42,399
like I could smoke huge bombers and that

794
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:44,038
stuff would not get me high yeah one of

795
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:46,959
the first plants I grew with a friend

796
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:48,879
you know back in high school beautiful

797
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,880
just the most gorgeous plant we're all

798
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,440
just psyched geed out and it finally

799
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,679
it's gets dry enough and I'm over it

800
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,919
just me and him and got this huge nug

801
00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:58,919
and we're going to smoke it and we you

802
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,919
know

803
00:27:59,558 --> 00:28:04,639
H it's weird you know like we smoke like

804
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,720
an ounce you know like to each you know

805
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,519
each one of us smoked like about an

806
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:10,519
ounce and we're just like I am not high

807
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:12,599
at all and we didn't even know that was

808
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:14,519
possible back then but we must have had

809
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:16,319
something that was just you know had

810
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:17,839
hardly any THC to it and he's like

811
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:20,319
blaming the light that he used he didn't

812
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:22,199
know what was going on what happened

813
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:23,839
yeah I remember back in the 90s we had a

814
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,600
guy that was growing and the stuff was

815
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:28,119
really good and it was like this lime

816
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:29,639
green bud and he had the he had some

817
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:32,199
purple and he had some lime green but

818
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,360
and the thing is is like from one

819
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,080
Harvest to the next it was always a

820
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:36,839
little bit different I mean a lot of

821
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:39,798
people had stuff that was like slightly

822
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:42,599
different it was all craft yeah

823
00:28:39,798 --> 00:28:45,440
but we had one time where it was like

824
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:46,959
just missing the cannaboids it was like

825
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,960
you would smoke and it was like how did

826
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,519
this go from it looked the same but it

827
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,960
was like smoking CBD we never even

828
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:54,960
thought CBD back then now if few people

829
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,120
like oh that's probably CBD and who

830
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,240
knows but like it completely changed to

831
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:00,639
something that got you really High to

832
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:03,319
something that got you a little bit high

833
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,960
and then eventually not high at all yeah

834
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:07,158
and back then we didn't know you know at

835
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,000
all what to think of it or what to call

836
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:10,559
it didn't know what to blame it on I

837
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,679
remember that was a trip he was selling

838
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:13,759
you know like QPS people for 25 bucks or

839
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:16,559
something he was like just use it for

840
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:18,158
joint fillers yeah tastes good just

841
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:19,440
doesn't get you high at all yeah we used

842
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,240
to have bubble hash back then too that

843
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:25,880
was really good you know this is before

844
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:28,558
all the the dabs and before you know BHO

845
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:30,159
before rosin before BHO we had good

846
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:31,398
bubble hash back in the and Keef there

847
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,720
was really good Keef back in the day

848
00:29:31,398 --> 00:29:35,359
occasionally you'd find someone with

849
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,440
really good Keef or uh we had scissor

850
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:40,879
hash if we grew we always had scissor

851
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:43,440
hash still Lov scissor hash to this day

852
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,240
yeah yeah me too I remember that back uh

853
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,640
before bubble man made the bags before

854
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,519
we really had easy ways to make bubble

855
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,960
hash it was like you know there was a

856
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:52,200
point in the early 90s where you had to

857
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,278
know someone that could get it from

858
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,840
Morocco or someplace else just people

859
00:29:54,278 --> 00:29:58,079
didn't really have hash that much around

860
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:59,879
here no and when I was younger that was

861
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:02,199
like to me that was it still is I still

862
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:05,039
think hash is just Primo it's the best

863
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,798
version of what you can get I still if

864
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:09,200
it's really good flow I don't even want

865
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:11,240
to [ __ ] it up I just want it as flour

866
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,159
yeah but if someone's like hey I've got

867
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,319
this and then I've got this full melt

868
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:16,559
hash right here do you want that or and

869
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:18,079
every time I'm grabbing the full melon

870
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:19,720
hash give me that well I feel like

871
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:21,240
there's good hash varieties and there's

872
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,640
good flower varieties and some flower

873
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:26,038
varieties do not make good hash and some

874
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,640
hash varieties do not make good flour

875
00:30:26,038 --> 00:30:31,558
the this one example is Gatorade

876
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:34,440
Frost it's this new one my buddy's got

877
00:30:31,558 --> 00:30:36,319
and it's special like the the extract it

878
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:39,159
it smells like Gatorade Frost like

879
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:41,678
literally the the rosin straight smells

880
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:45,600
like Gatorade wow the flour is like you

881
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:47,399
get it a little bit but it's not nearly

882
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:49,038
as strong and then it's it's real

883
00:30:47,398 --> 00:30:50,798
powdery like the bud when you grind it

884
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:53,480
up it's it's powdery but man it makes

885
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:54,558
amazing extract and so there's just

886
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,000
again we have these things we're

887
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:58,918
starting to breed in these different

888
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,558
directions like the Brussels sprouts and

889
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:03,000
the Cabbage right like I feel like that

890
00:31:01,558 --> 00:31:04,319
you know that's that's the future too

891
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,319
we're going to really go in those

892
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:07,918
directions even more so and isolate

893
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:09,240
stuff that works well for those because

894
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,639
a lot of the stuff now if you look at

895
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:14,000
the extract a lot of people are it's

896
00:31:11,638 --> 00:31:16,719
like GMOs or GMO

897
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,159
derivatives uh you know the papayas the

898
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,558
GMOs the stuff that really dumps and

899
00:31:19,159 --> 00:31:22,080
there's like all those within the

900
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:23,440
Spectrum but now people are starting to

901
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:25,240
get more stuff in those and they're

902
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,759
going to continue on that path for

903
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,558
another couple years we're going to have

904
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:30,240
some really special stuff yeah I I've

905
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:32,440
seen that myself too it's you know

906
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,399
there's a lot of um I I don't know what

907
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,880
the number is but there's a lot of

908
00:31:33,398 --> 00:31:38,239
breeders that are their breeding line is

909
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:41,519
focused towards Ros in production hash

910
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,000
making dumpers washing dumpers yeah yeah

911
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:45,240
and it's I always kind of crack up when

912
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,079
I see you know I have a lot of hom

913
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:49,038
Growers I have like a group of 200

914
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:50,720
testers that are mostly hom Growers that

915
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:52,000
work with me and help me out and I see

916
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,159
people growing different things you know

917
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,839
and they're like oh I just love this

918
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:57,399
plant and I'm I'm like kind of I got to

919
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:59,480
step back a little bit and not say you

920
00:31:57,398 --> 00:32:01,638
know that was meant to be washed you

921
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,278
know like the the breeder everyone

922
00:32:01,638 --> 00:32:05,199
across the board knows that's meant to

923
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:07,079
be washed and you know just take it that

924
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,720
next step you know but it's you everyone

925
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:10,798
do their own thing yeah my banana Z is

926
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,960
definitely one of those ones that was

927
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:14,720
meant to be watched the structure is not

928
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,679
complimentary to good flour it's very

929
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,480
open bud structure but that's great for

930
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:22,278
washing right and then bananas and Candy

931
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,919
you can't go wrong there no um you know

932
00:32:22,278 --> 00:32:25,398
and I there's there's other banana Z's

933
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:27,600
out there mine isn't the only one but my

934
00:32:25,398 --> 00:32:28,918
banana Z I believe was the first banana

935
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:31,398
Z made in

936
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:34,360
2018 uh we made a bunch of crosses with

937
00:32:31,398 --> 00:32:37,678
it so yeah it's it's banana punch banana

938
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:39,959
OG with Skittles nice and uh yeah I

939
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,679
wanted to get regular seeds and then so

940
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,880
I made I turned into RS put it with the

941
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:45,159
Skittles we got a lot of candy it's got

942
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,880
the open bud structure some of the

943
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:49,120
phenotypes we're we're at F3 with it you

944
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,880
know we haven't gone too far but with

945
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:54,359
the f3s there's some really amazing

946
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,360
washers in there House of cultivar is

947
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:58,319
phenoh hunted a bunch of the stuff

948
00:32:56,359 --> 00:33:00,079
specifically for rosin and then we put

949
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:03,200
the cross on a whole bunch of different

950
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:05,960
stuff I think 75 different plants nice

951
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,919
so but yeah nice but the the ones that

952
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,440
are really amazing are all banana so

953
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,399
it's like you can only you only need so

954
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,880
many banana right in your life there's

955
00:33:11,398 --> 00:33:14,199
only you know and there's there's

956
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,360
different types of banana too so you can

957
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:20,639
have banana cream banana custard you

958
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:22,079
candy banana banana nerds or banana runs

959
00:33:20,638 --> 00:33:23,959
you know those kind of TPS but there's

960
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:25,278
only so many bananas that you need you

961
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,440
know it's like within each one of those

962
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:29,599
things it's like how many colors of red

963
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,880
do you need a painter there's always

964
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:33,439
more but you don't need them no no you

965
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,639
only need the best ones and then then

966
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,558
it's like are you just hoarding or you

967
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:40,398
are you purposefully collecting stuff or

968
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:41,759
adding stuff to Your Arsenal but yeah

969
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:43,678
let's talk about photography for a

970
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:45,278
little bit because I feel like you you

971
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,399
you've gotten into videography too with

972
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:49,720
your videos yeah but your photography

973
00:33:47,398 --> 00:33:51,678
has been amazing ever since I've known

974
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:54,120
you you've taken amazing photos how did

975
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,759
you get into photography so initially my

976
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:57,199
my grandfather was a pretty famous

977
00:33:55,759 --> 00:34:00,119
photographer he's got a bunch of patents

978
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,840
and stuff when I was five um the rest of

979
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:03,879
the family hated me cuz he was like his

980
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:06,000
I was his favorite you know he came over

981
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,960
and he brought me this old you know

982
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,559
point and click and you can adjust all

983
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,599
the stuff on adjust the f- Stop and

984
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:13,559
everything and he taught me when I was

985
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:15,039
like five wow and um you know I was I

986
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:17,480
was always a pretty bright kid and ahead

987
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:19,199
of my ahead of my days um so he taught

988
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,878
me and I I messed around with it for

989
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,918
like three or four years but I was just

990
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:24,878
a little kid taking just you know little

991
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:26,838
things and I would go and bring my film

992
00:34:24,878 --> 00:34:28,918
roll to the Little Shack and get my

993
00:34:26,838 --> 00:34:30,918
pictures back and I love doing it but it

994
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:33,799
wasn't I wasn't serious about anything

995
00:34:30,918 --> 00:34:36,358
and then I didn't do it again um I

996
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,440
started doing you know breeding and all

997
00:34:36,358 --> 00:34:38,838
these other things and people are

998
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,960
telling you know I was giving away cuts

999
00:34:38,838 --> 00:34:41,519
and people are you know you got to go

1000
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,559
and join this forum and people in The

1001
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:45,280
Forum are like let me get a picture I

1002
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:47,719
was just taking shots with my cell phone

1003
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:52,480
camera for a while and then I bought it

1004
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:54,118
just a cheap Canon Rebel camera um and

1005
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,000
that's most of the stuff like all my

1006
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:57,760
early stuff was just with that cheap you

1007
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,039
know point and shoot kind of camera but

1008
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,480
I had a different way of looking at

1009
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:03,119
things I you know Grandpa helped me and

1010
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,480
I got an artistic guy or whatever I

1011
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,720
don't know if that helped I really

1012
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,599
should have in the early days found a

1013
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:10,838
photography Forum took some lessons or

1014
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:13,400
something because I just it's all

1015
00:35:10,838 --> 00:35:15,199
self-taught I just taught myself I got a

1016
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,280
great camera now I got really expensive

1017
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:19,960
lenses I got full light setups like we

1018
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,200
have in here um and and it's

1019
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:24,480
professional now but I had to make like

1020
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:26,719
every mistake along the way multiple

1021
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,559
times over and over again before I'd

1022
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:30,480
realize oh [ __ ] that's what I'm doing

1023
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:33,239
wrong you know I have the depth of field

1024
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,358
off I have this off um so it was all

1025
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:36,919
trial and error and it was just you know

1026
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:39,078
year after a year eventually I got into

1027
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:41,440
macro and I had like the little manual

1028
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:44,119
you turn it little macro stepper I was

1029
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,079
using that init initially and then I got

1030
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:47,519
you know one that's a motorized stepper

1031
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,079
and we'll do it for you and I've got a

1032
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:52,838
really great cognis one now and it does

1033
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:54,680
I've got a rotary so I'm doing all the

1034
00:35:52,838 --> 00:35:56,199
video stuff is actually stop motion it's

1035
00:35:54,679 --> 00:35:58,279
single image each thing and then I

1036
00:35:56,199 --> 00:35:59,799
Stitch it together so I've got a butt on

1037
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,519
a little rotary and it spins just a tiny

1038
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,160
bit takes a picture spins tiny bit takes

1039
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:06,159
a picture and just keeps doing that um

1040
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:08,039
with that I can use any of those still

1041
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:09,759
images but I can also put it together

1042
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:10,880
and make a video that's been like the

1043
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,720
past two years I've been trying to

1044
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,079
figure out how to do that and for a

1045
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:16,679
while it was you know I was using like

1046
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:18,880
just a manual turntable trying to figure

1047
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:20,519
it out so I was like started with the

1048
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,079
Grassroots you know and get to the point

1049
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:24,159
where it's like okay I need professional

1050
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:26,760
equipment cuz now I figured out this

1051
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:28,279
step this step and this step right I did

1052
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,560
the same thing with growing I've done it

1053
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:32,560
with a bunch of other things in life

1054
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:34,880
where it's I like learning by myself I

1055
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:36,719
like making the mistakes that helps me

1056
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,160
learn more if someone taught me exactly

1057
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:41,000
how to do it I I could do it over and

1058
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:43,078
over again no problem but I'll never

1059
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,239
know like the full spectrum right I'll

1060
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:47,839
just know this little pie slice and when

1061
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:50,118
you make mistakes you're like venturing

1062
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:51,719
out over here to figure out what mistake

1063
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:52,880
it is and you're learning all these

1064
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:55,519
other things you're learning the full

1065
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,640
spectrum of it so you know with

1066
00:36:55,519 --> 00:37:00,519
photography that was a huge help cuz you

1067
00:36:57,639 --> 00:37:01,960
now it's I can I'm lazy about it now I

1068
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:03,599
set the lights up really quick I know

1069
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,159
exact and I move the lights really quick

1070
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,119
I know exactly how to do it before I

1071
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:09,838
would be like four hours for a couple

1072
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:12,640
shots yeah you know now it's like

1073
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:14,039
I'm it takes me 15 minutes of work and

1074
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:15,679
the camera just does all the work for

1075
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:17,358
hours and I keep coming up and I change

1076
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:19,159
the memory card and start it over again

1077
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:21,880
and it starts its little spin thing or

1078
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:23,719
starts the macro thing and it's like

1079
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:26,240
almost effortless now but before in the

1080
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:27,719
past I mean I was porn sweat and didn't

1081
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:29,598
know what I was doing this sounds like

1082
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:31,318
my recipe for Life make as many mistakes

1083
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,240
as you can and you will understand

1084
00:37:31,318 --> 00:37:35,039
everything in the future and sometimes I

1085
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:37,358
feel feel like when you're passionate I

1086
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:39,279
I always have lived a passion Driven

1087
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:41,358
Life so I'm always following my passions

1088
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,680
whe whether it's weed or whether it's

1089
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:45,039
food or whatever it is I I follow those

1090
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:47,318
things and I do them because I love

1091
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:49,079
doing them but also yeah making mistakes

1092
00:37:47,318 --> 00:37:51,279
along the way is the best way to learn

1093
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:53,839
is by screwing [ __ ] up it's maybe not

1094
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,440
the fastest but sometimes you know I

1095
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:56,559
think it's the best way to get full

1096
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,880
understanding and it's great you know

1097
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:01,039
it's a it's a good life lesson is if you

1098
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,960
want to do something just go do it you

1099
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:03,599
know if you want to learn how to play

1100
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,800
the guitar go play the guitar there's

1101
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,960
nothing wrong with it even though you're

1102
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,400
going to suck in the beginning and you

1103
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:10,000
suck at almost everything right yeah

1104
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,519
whatever it is whether it's photography

1105
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,920
no start growing yeah it's like I mean

1106
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:16,599
my brother he had a green thumb Maybe

1107
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:19,159
started you know early on my brother had

1108
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:20,838
a green thumb but like for me it took a

1109
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:22,920
long time before I could grow stuff that

1110
00:38:20,838 --> 00:38:25,719
was amazing or even stuff that I

1111
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:27,519
considered was amazing but I also had

1112
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:29,598
friends that grew really where well

1113
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:31,400
where I could compare my stuff to you

1114
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,000
know my first couple harvests were not

1115
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,800
amazing they weren't right out the gate

1116
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,440
they weren't great but I really loved

1117
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,240
weed I really love flow I really really

1118
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,559
love the process of cultivating and I

1119
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:41,919
really wanted to get a good

1120
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:43,480
understanding of it yeah and so I just

1121
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,519
kept on doing it and I'm still doing it

1122
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,920
you know and it's still something I love

1123
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:50,759
doing and when it's not fun anymore I

1124
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,920
probably won't do it yeah I'm the same

1125
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:55,680
way it's uh but there is there's

1126
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:57,159
something special about you know a lot

1127
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:58,519
of people want to FastTrack the way to

1128
00:38:57,159 --> 00:39:00,598
learning things a lot of people want to

1129
00:38:58,519 --> 00:39:03,159
get as good as they can right away and I

1130
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:06,280
I I feel that I'm similar in that way

1131
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:08,559
but there's also just something it's so

1132
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:10,560
much better that you gain like you learn

1133
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:12,078
so much about yourself yeah if it's

1134
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:13,838
skateboarding or photography whatever it

1135
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:17,240
is you learn so much more about what

1136
00:39:13,838 --> 00:39:18,599
you're doing than just the narrow band

1137
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:20,879
that you would normally experience if

1138
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:22,400
someone said no this is how you do it

1139
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,358
yeah and you just go okay I'll just

1140
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,280
practice that until I get it right when

1141
00:39:24,358 --> 00:39:28,679
you're doing it off on your own you're

1142
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:30,560
making like mistakes that professionals

1143
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:32,239
like I've never heard of anyone even

1144
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:33,480
[ __ ] doing that like what are you

1145
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:35,519
thinking and you're like well I don't

1146
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:37,880
know right I'm just

1147
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:40,159
experimenting and and with that you you

1148
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:42,599
know you run into new ideas and new

1149
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:44,279
things so now you know that I've I've

1150
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:45,760
learned how to operate the camera I

1151
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,240
learned how to set up the lights I I

1152
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:51,119
know all this stuff now I'm still

1153
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:53,000
looking at it from that beginner point

1154
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:55,079
of view I I still have like a different

1155
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,400
eye for where the light should go right

1156
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:59,200
you know how the subject should be

1157
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:02,318
turned and and when you learn you know

1158
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:04,199
the way to do it yeah it's has to be

1159
00:40:02,318 --> 00:40:06,639
like that the light has to be here your

1160
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:08,439
camera has to be there yeah there isn't

1161
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:10,358
there's no room for experimentation this

1162
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,800
is how it's done that's the method yeah

1163
00:40:10,358 --> 00:40:13,838
right and so you know I'm in there now

1164
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,318
and I've got like you know photo cells

1165
00:40:13,838 --> 00:40:17,159
and a flashlight and I'm like putting a

1166
00:40:15,318 --> 00:40:18,480
streak of orange across my picture

1167
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:20,480
because I just I want to see what that

1168
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,639
looks like you know swinging Christmas

1169
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,280
lights behind it because I just want to

1170
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:26,440
see how it turns out um and that stuff I

1171
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:28,800
wouldn't be trying at all if I had just

1172
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,000
stuck to the book right well and growing

1173
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,318
is the same way and same thing with

1174
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,358
breeding it's like there's so many

1175
00:40:31,318 --> 00:40:35,159
different ways to make feminized seeds

1176
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:37,119
there's just you can you can collect

1177
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:38,639
your pollinated vs you can use live

1178
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:40,358
plants you can do a combination of the

1179
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:42,279
two which is what I do and I'm all about

1180
00:40:40,358 --> 00:40:45,960
redundancies but like there's so many

1181
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:47,839
ways to cultivate and there's no wrong I

1182
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:49,920
mean I there is wrong ways to cultivate

1183
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:51,880
yeah there is for the most part there's

1184
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,599
so many just different ways to get

1185
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:55,519
really good results right you can choose

1186
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,838
your own path yeah I used to love those

1187
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:57,920
Choose Your Own Adventure books when I

1188
00:40:56,838 --> 00:40:59,719
was a kid

1189
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,200
I love that part of life where we get to

1190
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:02,679
kind of pick and choose to do things how

1191
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:06,480
we'd like to do them yeah I was hooked

1192
00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:09,598
on those too same thing yeah it's uh you

1193
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:12,599
know this is I've grown a lot before in

1194
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:15,440
the past but it wasn't until like 2017

1195
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:17,400
2015 where I started my own grows and

1196
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,000
doing it all on my own and and again

1197
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,838
just [ __ ] it up left and right and

1198
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
experimenting and trying everything yeah

1199
00:41:20,838 --> 00:41:24,599
over the years I've I've grown under

1200
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,079
every kind of light you can grow under

1201
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:28,119
you know I've grown indoor outdoor I've

1202
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:31,039
grown in every kind of medium just about

1203
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:33,079
I haven't done DW dwc yet but I've done

1204
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:35,800
everything else yeah and and through all

1205
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:38,599
of that experimenting I've you know

1206
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:41,160
found my way that that works for me and

1207
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:43,519
is best for me and a lot of it now is

1208
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:47,199
you know my way before was you know full

1209
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:50,000
100% organic and under you know CMH or

1210
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:51,519
HID lights and you know no LED in more

1211
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,800
old school way and that's that's how I

1212
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:54,559
like my weight it's what I'm used to

1213
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,318
smoking I smoke just about every strain

1214
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:59,639
there is since the '90s still is that

1215
00:41:56,318 --> 00:42:02,199
how you grow no now because of breeding

1216
00:41:59,639 --> 00:42:04,358
I've steered towards I'm in Coco I can

1217
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:06,519
do you know crop steering I can all

1218
00:42:04,358 --> 00:42:09,199
these things where my main focus is on

1219
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:10,639
making stuff that a homeg grower who's

1220
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:13,480
never grown before can not get the [ __ ]

1221
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:15,400
out of the park yeah at the same time

1222
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,719
I'm not just making for a hom grower I

1223
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,960
want it to be good enough to where a

1224
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:20,639
commercial guy is going to go holy crap

1225
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,440
I'm finding so many keeper you know like

1226
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:26,000
I want it good for everyone but through

1227
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:28,519
my selection process before I release

1228
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,280
stuff I in intentionally grow them

1229
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:32,079
really really poorly I intentionally

1230
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:33,960
make most of the mistakes that new home

1231
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:36,359
Growers will make so I'm having

1232
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:38,119
temperature swings RH swings I'm stress

1233
00:42:36,358 --> 00:42:40,799
testing yeah intentionally bringing the

1234
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:42,559
EC up and down back and forth the ph up

1235
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,280
and down and I want to push the plants

1236
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:47,319
to right the edge of dying or going full

1237
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:49,040
intersect on me and I want to see which

1238
00:42:47,318 --> 00:42:50,639
ones I should never release that's

1239
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:52,440
that's my whole point but if I put

1240
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:53,920
something through just absolute hell I

1241
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,280
mean I take plants outside put them in

1242
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,639
the forest bring them back in the grow

1243
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,079
room so they're filled with thrips and

1244
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:00,879
leaf miners and everything else and just

1245
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:02,800
let the pest go I want to see what's the

1246
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,680
worst case scenario with this string I

1247
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,599
don't do that by the way but that's I'm

1248
00:43:04,679 --> 00:43:09,639
glad you do you're doing the Lord's work

1249
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:11,079
yeah wild I'm [ __ ] sterile facility

1250
00:43:09,639 --> 00:43:12,318
we try to keep this place as clean as

1251
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:15,160
possible yeah yeah I didn't bring

1252
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:16,920
anything with me promise yeah um but

1253
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:20,118
yeah no I I like I push him to the point

1254
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:22,119
where it's I can decide you know about a

1255
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:24,119
quarter to half of what I make gets

1256
00:43:22,119 --> 00:43:26,000
released and it's through that process

1257
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:27,800
where I look at a plant and go okay that

1258
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,920
survived and it didn't didn't Herm or

1259
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:32,880
anything that's great but it's [ __ ] weed

1260
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,559
and I want someone to just make every

1261
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,119
mistake possible and still end up with

1262
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:38,000
something that they look at and go I'm

1263
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:39,680
really proud of this this is so good you

1264
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,838
and I might be like I don't want to

1265
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:43,558
smoke that but they are really proud of

1266
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:45,480
it right for sure so I want something

1267
00:43:43,559 --> 00:43:47,800
that's got that survivability that's got

1268
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:52,318
that resilience um and can handle those

1269
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:54,359
things so that's why now I'm in Coco and

1270
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:56,679
and salt-based nutrients with reservoirs

1271
00:43:54,358 --> 00:43:59,000
that I can alter on the fly I can you

1272
00:43:56,679 --> 00:44:00,960
know I've got a I'm doing everything in

1273
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
my house but it's it's like a commercial

1274
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,599
facility shrunk down in my main testing

1275
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,239
room and growing room so I can alter

1276
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:09,838
stuff really really quickly easily and

1277
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:11,759
put the plants through their Paces so

1278
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:13,119
that way I know this stuff is there's no

1279
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,760
point in releasing this it sounded

1280
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:16,640
really great to me I was really excited

1281
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:18,800
about it but yeah people don't

1282
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:20,719
understand that that uh like the the

1283
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:23,280
breeding the real magic is in the feno

1284
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:25,598
hunting and in the selection process MH

1285
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:27,480
and a lot of stuff on paper looks great

1286
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:29,359
you know I think in life it's that way

1287
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:30,960
too it's like so many things sound good

1288
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:33,039
you put this with this and you get this

1289
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,838
it doesn't work like that with cannabis

1290
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:36,199
you know you're talking about recessive

1291
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:38,480
traits you're talking about dominant

1292
00:44:36,199 --> 00:44:40,000
traits and if you don't know the lines

1293
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,240
really well it's it's kind of a

1294
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,800
crapshoot right like you can have stuff

1295
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:45,558
where it's like man I didn't even know

1296
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,200
that would Express but because of we

1297
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:50,359
have recessive traits on both sides now

1298
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:53,358
we get expression right yeah even the

1299
00:44:50,358 --> 00:44:55,078
stuff that you know I'm excited about

1300
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:56,679
I've planned out ahead of time I know

1301
00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:57,960
I'm going to this cut and this cut are

1302
00:44:56,679 --> 00:45:00,639
going together and that's what I'm going

1303
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:03,838
to do um it's still only like you know

1304
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:07,039
at best one in 20 of those where it's it

1305
00:45:03,838 --> 00:45:08,960
ends up like you imagined most of them

1306
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:11,159
are it's totally different right you

1307
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,639
know you have this idea in your head and

1308
00:45:11,159 --> 00:45:14,480
um like Romulan I've read with it so

1309
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:15,960
much I know what to expect from her and

1310
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,559
and I've got certain things I can breed

1311
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,119
her with where I already know the flavor

1312
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:21,079
profile before I've bred it and it

1313
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:23,358
usually comes out correct yeah that

1314
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:25,400
doesn't mean that it's going to be worth

1315
00:45:23,358 --> 00:45:27,639
putting out into the world right you

1316
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:29,200
know as as breeders I I've told my

1317
00:45:27,639 --> 00:45:31,159
friend this and he's like I want to get

1318
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:32,679
into breeding and I I'm like why and I

1319
00:45:31,159 --> 00:45:35,358
want to be famous one day I want to be

1320
00:45:32,679 --> 00:45:37,279
really well known and I'm like H don't

1321
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:39,159
just don't you don't understand what

1322
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:42,400
this industry is it's totally different

1323
00:45:39,159 --> 00:45:45,239
but the most breeders our work with time

1324
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:47,480
just disappears we disappear we die and

1325
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:49,439
our work is gone right nobody has it

1326
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:52,000
anymore and it's it's gone there's only

1327
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,440
a few select of us that we can't even

1328
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,358
really be part of the equation where the

1329
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:59,240
community says that plant that cut we

1330
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:00,719
want to keep it around and you you

1331
00:45:59,239 --> 00:46:02,439
almost have no control over it as a

1332
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:03,598
breeder it's just what hits with the

1333
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:05,200
people and what doesn't you know some

1334
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:07,559
breeders put things out on their own and

1335
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:09,039
that helps but but this is devotional

1336
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:10,960
anyway and and it's like one of those

1337
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:13,000
things where you do it because you love

1338
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,960
doing it you put it out there and the

1339
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,800
world either accepts it or it doesn't

1340
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:20,318
it'll embrace it you know certain things

1341
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:21,720
um you know i' I've read a lot of stuff

1342
00:46:20,318 --> 00:46:23,239
that that's out there that'll probably

1343
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:24,799
be out there forever that I may never

1344
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:27,039
get credit for but it's not even about

1345
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,240
the credit right so like I've done

1346
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:32,079
contract breeding just a lot of amazing

1347
00:46:29,239 --> 00:46:33,919
stuff and uh it's still devotional for

1348
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:35,400
me and and I do it because I love doing

1349
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,200
it I'm going to continue doing it as

1350
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,480
long as I love it and it's just an

1351
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:41,078
amazing thing

1352
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:44,240
because we're stewards and we're able to

1353
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:46,240
take this plant from where we got it and

1354
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:48,399
move it along into the future we're just

1355
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:52,118
one small piece of this plant's

1356
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:54,358
progression yeah I I I very honestly

1357
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:56,079
feel not to be like you know hippie or

1358
00:46:54,358 --> 00:46:59,318
or spiritual or anything but I I feel

1359
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:00,680
like the plant Cho es us yeah like picks

1360
00:46:59,318 --> 00:47:02,480
people and is like I'm not letting you

1361
00:47:00,679 --> 00:47:04,919
go right like you and I will probably

1362
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,079
never be let go of by cannabis no and

1363
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,838
there's some people out there that it's

1364
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:09,800
just that's part of you forever some of

1365
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:12,239
them grew up with it some of them found

1366
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:13,680
it later um I grew up around it you know

1367
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:16,759
I was in my diapers playing underneath

1368
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:18,838
it and and around it but it hit me

1369
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:21,400
around you know seven or eight it was

1370
00:47:18,838 --> 00:47:22,799
like this light bulb I want to I want to

1371
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,680
get high time magazines and start

1372
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,160
reading them I want to and then I had

1373
00:47:24,679 --> 00:47:28,118
them and I want to be a breeder when I

1374
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:29,759
get older and I forgot about it as I

1375
00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:31,800
grew up but there was this period you

1376
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:34,280
know when I was a kid and now here I am

1377
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:37,318
and it's I already kind of had my dream

1378
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:39,160
career before this all started and once

1379
00:47:37,318 --> 00:47:41,519
I started really getting into this it

1380
00:47:39,159 --> 00:47:43,598
was like my dream career was nothing

1381
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:45,199
like it was so meaningless and I'd built

1382
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:46,599
this whole company up from the ground up

1383
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:49,960
and I was you know working jobs where

1384
00:47:46,599 --> 00:47:52,000
I'm making 20 grand Plus in a week yeah

1385
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:54,119
and I I didn't care I'm going to go and

1386
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,960
maybe go broke maybe end up homeless

1387
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:58,200
because this is what I want to do it's

1388
00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:00,199
what I've always wanted to to do right

1389
00:47:58,199 --> 00:48:02,159
and you know but going back to telling

1390
00:48:00,199 --> 00:48:03,759
my friend you know he's he's got these

1391
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:07,480
grandiose ideas in his head of what

1392
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:08,880
being a breeder is and most people don't

1393
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:11,079
understand that that part of it is like

1394
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:13,318
your your work as a breeder whether it's

1395
00:48:11,079 --> 00:48:16,400
five years or a year or 50 years as a

1396
00:48:13,318 --> 00:48:18,199
breeder most of it just disappears it's

1397
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,480
not what you think it's not like you can

1398
00:48:18,199 --> 00:48:21,480
make a cut and you give it to the

1399
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:22,960
community and the community goes oh yeah

1400
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:25,679
and then it's around

1401
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:26,800
forever not even original that's what a

1402
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:28,759
lot of people don't understand they're

1403
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,680
thinking well I made this cuz I crossed

1404
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:32,559
this with this and that doesn't mean

1405
00:48:30,679 --> 00:48:34,440
that it's genetically that different

1406
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:36,559
from so many other things you know it's

1407
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:39,039
like you know it's like hard to make

1408
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:40,640
something original right very hard to

1409
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:42,079
make something completely original and

1410
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:44,118
you know and there's people that have

1411
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:46,280
done it uh but we're still also working

1412
00:48:44,119 --> 00:48:48,079
on the most of the hard lifting and the

1413
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:50,599
heavy lifting was done in like the 60s

1414
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:52,200
and 70s we're able to you know work off

1415
00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:53,680
the fruits of the labor that was done

1416
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:55,598
Back Then There are very few of us

1417
00:48:53,679 --> 00:48:58,279
sifting through you know 18 weeks

1418
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:59,760
sativas and spindly little things and

1419
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:02,519
trying to get that down to something a

1420
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:04,599
little more smokable and I mean you had

1421
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:06,280
to have some patience you know and

1422
00:49:04,599 --> 00:49:09,440
there's still some guys doing it you

1423
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:12,160
know I just I I really I look up to

1424
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,838
these guys like Simon from serious seeds

1425
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:16,239
you know it's like he's done the real

1426
00:49:13,838 --> 00:49:18,400
work he made real true

1427
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:20,519
f1s you know I haven't gotten to that

1428
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,720
point where my f where I'm where I'm

1429
00:49:20,519 --> 00:49:24,239
making my own F1 hybrids and that's

1430
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:27,199
where I'm going to get right like in my

1431
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:29,519
lifetime that's my goal that's that's uh

1432
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:30,960
I've got similar my goals are not lofty

1433
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:32,719
yeah it's you know like a it's very

1434
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,960
basic base level like a lot of breeders

1435
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:36,159
are like I want to make this or that and

1436
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,519
I'm like I just want to get through

1437
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:40,000
breeding stuff with Romulan for fun yeah

1438
00:49:38,519 --> 00:49:42,440
because what I've been doing for the

1439
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,760
past eight years as a breeder it's just

1440
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:46,079
like everything else I talked about I've

1441
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:48,400
been experimenting and learning along

1442
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:50,400
the path um I feel bad for the people

1443
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,559
that got my first crosses even though

1444
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,680
most people love them I look at the

1445
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:56,160
early stuff I made I'm like [ __ ] I

1446
00:49:54,679 --> 00:49:57,879
didn't know how to test it properly I

1447
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:59,558
didn't I wasn't doing the right work

1448
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:02,318
back then you did have good foundational

1449
00:49:59,559 --> 00:50:04,200
genetics though so at least on one side

1450
00:50:02,318 --> 00:50:05,759
regardless of what else you crossed r i

1451
00:50:04,199 --> 00:50:07,598
mean I think that's a great starting

1452
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,960
point that a lot of people have missed a

1453
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:10,960
lot of people are taking these complex

1454
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,880
poly hybrids that have 50 different

1455
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:14,798
things in them that are genetically

1456
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,000
unstable and they're Crossing them with

1457
00:50:14,798 --> 00:50:17,639
something else that's completely

1458
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,760
genetically unstable that might even be

1459
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:20,039
related to the thing that they're

1460
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:22,799
Crossing it

1461
00:50:20,039 --> 00:50:24,279
with they all yeah a lot of people do

1462
00:50:22,798 --> 00:50:26,000
this thing called breeding that they

1463
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:27,880
think is making an outcross but really

1464
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,119
what they're doing is breeding it's like

1465
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:31,240
if you take gelato and and cross it to

1466
00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:33,240
Sunset

1467
00:50:31,239 --> 00:50:35,719
sherbet you know it's like you're you're

1468
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:36,798
making a back cross right right so but a

1469
00:50:35,719 --> 00:50:38,959
lot of people were like oh I just made

1470
00:50:36,798 --> 00:50:40,599
this new cross and it's like that's not

1471
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,199
that's not an F1 it's not even how it

1472
00:50:40,599 --> 00:50:44,440
works that's not how it works and

1473
00:50:42,199 --> 00:50:45,919
there's so many things out there where

1474
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:47,440
people have crossed this together with

1475
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,599
this and like they cross siblings

1476
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:53,400
together like you cross gelato 33 and

1477
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:55,039
gelato 41 you're you know it's like

1478
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,838
you're not doing the work like you think

1479
00:50:55,039 --> 00:50:58,558
you're doing and the thing is is like

1480
00:50:56,838 --> 00:51:00,599
even with the naming conventions the

1481
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:02,798
genetics you don't know what it really

1482
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:06,400
is so someone could give you gelato 33

1483
00:51:02,798 --> 00:51:08,559
but tell you that it's you know whatever

1484
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,559
right it's purple jagu that's funny

1485
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:11,559
you're hidden on one of the things

1486
00:51:09,559 --> 00:51:13,280
that's been like uh stuck around and I

1487
00:51:11,559 --> 00:51:15,319
wasn't planning on it but when I so when

1488
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,760
I released my first batch of Romulan

1489
00:51:15,318 --> 00:51:19,920
seeds they were regular seeds and I was

1490
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:22,480
working off an old batch of seeds that

1491
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:24,960
were like F4 F5 I hunted a male and a

1492
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:26,318
female from that and made Regular seeds

1493
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:29,519
and at the time I was like I don't want

1494
00:51:26,318 --> 00:51:31,599
to touch my family's cut like I'm not

1495
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:33,519
worthy you know I I'll try to make f

1496
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:35,359
with it but I don't want to I don't even

1497
00:51:33,519 --> 00:51:36,719
want to [ __ ] with that so I'll I'll pick

1498
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:38,078
a female and I'll pick a male out from

1499
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:39,399
these and I made rig seeds and I put

1500
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:40,440
them out there and I had all these guys

1501
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,599
who've been growing a long time and

1502
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:43,920
they're like it's literally the best

1503
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:47,000
Romulan version I've ever grown ever

1504
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:49,480
from seed it's so good wow make more and

1505
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,000
I'm like okay well I didn't keep that

1506
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:53,480
female around so I can't make more of

1507
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,760
those I got to make a different version

1508
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:59,119
now um so I ended up making it with my

1509
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:01,640
family's cut and the same mail I had

1510
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:03,680
selected for the first patch and I I

1511
00:52:01,639 --> 00:52:05,759
make them and I'm like you know okay

1512
00:52:03,679 --> 00:52:07,679
what do I call this you know and I start

1513
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,160
thinking about the I get some help from

1514
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:12,719
a friend and he goes well you know you

1515
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:15,000
took an F4 F5 and then an F1 the related

1516
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:18,159
that's an intergenerational cross called

1517
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:20,159
an ex I go okay so I go and Google it

1518
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:22,558
nothing and I'm like well if I call this

1519
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:24,440
an ex what's going to happen with the

1520
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:25,920
community like they're not even going to

1521
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:27,480
know what an ex is and then there are

1522
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,599
people like you

1523
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:31,519
but most of my customers would so I

1524
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:33,079
would just be get bombarded every day

1525
00:52:31,519 --> 00:52:35,920
with what's

1526
00:52:33,079 --> 00:52:39,519
an1 so I released it the name of the

1527
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:41,880
strain is Romulan bx1 yeah and then it's

1528
00:52:39,519 --> 00:52:44,079
an ex1 and that nobody asked me any

1529
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:46,000
questions and I'm still laughing about

1530
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:47,798
it I I've explained it thoroughly to

1531
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,519
everyone I was open about what it was

1532
00:52:47,798 --> 00:52:53,358
that the bx1 is just in quotes it's

1533
00:52:50,519 --> 00:52:55,159
literally the name it's Romulan bx1 but

1534
00:52:53,358 --> 00:52:56,639
like nobody had any questions after that

1535
00:52:55,159 --> 00:52:57,879
and there was a few breeders that came

1536
00:52:56,639 --> 00:52:59,480
to me and they're like what why is it

1537
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:01,160
bx1 in quotes I don't what are you doing

1538
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:02,639
and I go well it's an1 and you can see

1539
00:53:01,159 --> 00:53:03,719
on the packaging you can see on the seed

1540
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:06,440
listing everything says you know

1541
00:53:03,719 --> 00:53:08,199
intergenerational cross um but if I just

1542
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:10,440
put it out under just that no one would

1543
00:53:08,199 --> 00:53:12,358
know what it was yeah and at the time

1544
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:14,838
everyone was calling everything a backat

1545
00:53:12,358 --> 00:53:16,558
cross everyone everything everyone was

1546
00:53:14,838 --> 00:53:17,838
putting out these bx1 left and right and

1547
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:19,680
it's none of them were backat crosses

1548
00:53:17,838 --> 00:53:21,199
and I thought it was hilarious I'm G to

1549
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:24,078
make this little inside joke and call

1550
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:25,598
this a backat cross one right and uh

1551
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:27,039
it's still it's the people keep asking

1552
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:28,440
me for more of those seeds and it stuck

1553
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:30,838
around to this day and I I got to

1554
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:32,720
explain more what the backat cross one

1555
00:53:30,838 --> 00:53:33,519
quotes is than I had to than I would

1556
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:35,439
have had to explain what an

1557
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:37,199
intergenerational cross is so it's funny

1558
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:40,679
because uh I got an interesting story

1559
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:42,480
around brulin and Shaman my buddy had it

1560
00:53:40,679 --> 00:53:44,919
back in the day and it was should have

1561
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:47,240
been called the shaman right because it

1562
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:49,280
was Shaman cross with the Romulan back

1563
00:53:47,239 --> 00:53:53,479
to the shaman right so it's like a

1564
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:56,440
shaman bx1 right M but he called it

1565
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:59,079
Shaman and so if somebody has the real

1566
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:03,480
Shaman out there that we had back in the

1567
00:53:59,079 --> 00:54:07,160
9s um I believe it was Barney's maybe

1568
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:10,000
Barney's that had a shaman it it wasn't

1569
00:54:07,159 --> 00:54:11,480
Greenhouse but it was a European cut the

1570
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,318
shaman I've heard of and I know about

1571
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:14,838
but I I wasn't real from like the Shram

1572
00:54:13,318 --> 00:54:16,920
was something I came in contact with but

1573
00:54:14,838 --> 00:54:19,480
not the shaman so anyway if somebody out

1574
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:21,400
there has the shaman or has a shaman I'd

1575
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:25,039
love to get it so we could work on this

1576
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:26,680
Shaman chulan project and uh you know I

1577
00:54:25,039 --> 00:54:28,159
love the nostalgic stuff throw backs

1578
00:54:26,679 --> 00:54:29,639
where like can we recreate it we're

1579
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:31,719
trying to recreate the cat piss right

1580
00:54:29,639 --> 00:54:34,598
now I'm looking for cat piss you know

1581
00:54:31,719 --> 00:54:36,118
it's like roadkill skunk expressions

1582
00:54:34,599 --> 00:54:37,760
like you know we didn't have roadkill

1583
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:39,798
skunk as far as I knew back in the day

1584
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:41,799
we had skunk we had some skunky really

1585
00:54:39,798 --> 00:54:44,838
really skunky weed it would smell a

1586
00:54:41,798 --> 00:54:47,000
whole room up just one little small bit

1587
00:54:44,838 --> 00:54:49,558
but uh yeah so if somebody has a shaman

1588
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,440
reach out we got Mr Romulan right here

1589
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:53,240
we can make some amazing crosses I feel

1590
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,838
like those kind of projects are fun so

1591
00:54:53,239 --> 00:54:56,439
if somebody really has it but the thing

1592
00:54:54,838 --> 00:54:57,880
is is like just cuz it's called shaman

1593
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:00,400
doesn't mean it's Shaman just cuz it's

1594
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:01,920
called this doesn't mean it's that uh

1595
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:05,280
you know phos was one of those ones

1596
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:08,000
where you there there was 97 things in

1597
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:10,720
their Galaxy that were all OG cush with

1598
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,760
different names right so and it was all

1599
00:55:10,719 --> 00:55:14,719
exactly the same it all genetically

1600
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:16,960
identical yeah yeah there's there's a

1601
00:55:14,719 --> 00:55:18,679
lot of problems out there in in breeding

1602
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:21,519
I had no idea what I was getting into

1603
00:55:18,679 --> 00:55:23,598
coming into this I like had this whole

1604
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:25,119
you know we're a community and from

1605
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:28,039
being a trafficker and picking up from

1606
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:31,200
Farmers you know I I knew how people

1607
00:55:28,039 --> 00:55:33,039
treat each other and what to expect and

1608
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:34,358
I had no idea getting into the breeding

1609
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:37,359
side of it which I had never been

1610
00:55:34,358 --> 00:55:39,519
involved with at all um of just how much

1611
00:55:37,358 --> 00:55:40,960
[ __ ] there is and just left and right

1612
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:42,960
oh yeah people taking credit for other

1613
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,960
stuff I try to give credit where credits

1614
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:47,119
do somebody made a cross I use their

1615
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:49,519
stuff the thing is is if I bought your

1616
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:51,760
seeds and I made seeds with your seeds

1617
00:55:49,519 --> 00:55:53,318
you sold those seeds if somebody buys my

1618
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:55,480
genetics and makes seeds I'm actually

1619
00:55:53,318 --> 00:55:57,038
happy I love it yeah you know it's like

1620
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:58,559
there's guys who buy my stuff and don't

1621
00:55:57,039 --> 00:56:00,280
give me credit or they'll call it the

1622
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:02,200
cross rather than the name that I gave

1623
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:04,000
it they'll call it the cross and

1624
00:56:02,199 --> 00:56:05,639
whatever I mean I I don't care but the

1625
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,199
thing is is what I think is funny is

1626
00:56:05,639 --> 00:56:08,960
like guys that get butt hurt when other

1627
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:10,719
people use their genetics to make

1628
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:12,720
crosses it's joke it's like you sold

1629
00:56:10,719 --> 00:56:14,118
those seeds if that person if you gifted

1630
00:56:12,719 --> 00:56:15,279
them that might be a different story

1631
00:56:14,119 --> 00:56:17,119
it's not like I broke into your bedroom

1632
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,680
and stole a cup from you no you made

1633
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:20,519
money off those that's the whole purpose

1634
00:56:18,679 --> 00:56:23,639
of pushing the plan forward you know and

1635
00:56:20,519 --> 00:56:25,119
it's like uh yeah people get like like

1636
00:56:23,639 --> 00:56:26,960
it's their possession like they did

1637
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:28,720
something special nobody else should be

1638
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:30,119
touching it even though you bought it

1639
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:32,838
you should only be growing it out it's

1640
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:34,720
like that's that's a little pretentious

1641
00:56:32,838 --> 00:56:37,358
yeah no that's like for me that's where

1642
00:56:34,719 --> 00:56:39,439
it comes back to whatever I do in my

1643
00:56:37,358 --> 00:56:40,759
mind is going to disappear if it if I

1644
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:44,039
have a few things that I've made that

1645
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:45,599
stick around great um but that's I

1646
00:56:44,039 --> 00:56:47,839
encourage people to breed with the stuff

1647
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:49,760
I make I want to see other breeders work

1648
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:52,880
with it that to me is like the highest

1649
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:54,400
level of uh of Honor you know or the

1650
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,559
highest level of where I can be as a

1651
00:56:54,400 --> 00:57:00,240
breeder when I saw breeders years a ago

1652
00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:02,680
starting to without involving me um

1653
00:57:00,239 --> 00:57:04,239
buying my seeds hunting cuts out of it

1654
00:57:02,679 --> 00:57:06,118
and then breeding with that and then

1655
00:57:04,239 --> 00:57:07,439
giving me credit yeah and to me it was

1656
00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:09,160
like when I first when I first saw it

1657
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:11,000
come up I was like what the [ __ ] I'm

1658
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:12,960
[ __ ] nobody who why would you breed

1659
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,119
with my [ __ ] yeah I feel you I mean I

1660
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,119
think there's like there's this

1661
00:57:14,119 --> 00:57:19,358
entitlement thing with the industry

1662
00:57:16,119 --> 00:57:22,039
pretty good right like so when I first

1663
00:57:19,358 --> 00:57:24,960
tasted it the thing is I can taste them

1664
00:57:22,039 --> 00:57:26,319
both yeah definitely have the GDP we got

1665
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:29,240
that flavor like right in the front

1666
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:31,719
right I get this sweetness Z at the end

1667
00:57:29,239 --> 00:57:33,318
and it is out of the out of the whole

1668
00:57:31,719 --> 00:57:35,639
group of seeds that we hunted of this

1669
00:57:33,318 --> 00:57:37,440
cross this was the only thing like this

1670
00:57:35,639 --> 00:57:39,000
really yeah the other ones either lean

1671
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:41,200
too heavy towards one or the other and

1672
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,639
not in a good way Skittles really [ __ ]

1673
00:57:41,199 --> 00:57:44,318
up the structure of most plants people

1674
00:57:42,639 --> 00:57:46,279
don't understand it's like it's the

1675
00:57:44,318 --> 00:57:47,838
structure is terrible most people don't

1676
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:49,119
want to grow Skittles like the reason

1677
00:57:47,838 --> 00:57:50,960
there's not a lot of Skittles or the

1678
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:52,798
reason it's so expensive if you do see

1679
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,920
it is because nobody wants to grow it

1680
00:57:52,798 --> 00:57:57,960
it's an ugly finicky plant that doesn't

1681
00:57:54,920 --> 00:58:01,079
like being grown M um that basically

1682
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:02,639
flips you off the entire time and uh

1683
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:05,559
it's it's really interesting in that

1684
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:07,920
sense but uh when you breed with it the

1685
00:58:05,559 --> 00:58:10,599
stuff that has the real Skitty structure

1686
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:13,280
the stuff that's really candy the stuff

1687
00:58:10,599 --> 00:58:15,559
that's really Skitty in taste all leans

1688
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:17,359
to that structure so it's really hard to

1689
00:58:15,559 --> 00:58:21,119
find stuff that has better structure

1690
00:58:17,358 --> 00:58:22,880
with that candy profile right right

1691
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:25,000
every once in a while I come come across

1692
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:26,760
something that is a disruptor whether I

1693
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:29,000
bred it or somebody else Brit there's

1694
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:30,680
stuff out there where it's like okay

1695
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,679
this is something that the white Thorn

1696
00:58:30,679 --> 00:58:34,879
people can attach their pallet to or

1697
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:35,919
they're like oh yeah that's really

1698
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,880
there's a lot of people that like white

1699
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:40,838
Thorn rose right like that is huge right

1700
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:42,519
now like yeah I bet it's bigger than

1701
00:58:40,838 --> 00:58:43,480
they ever thought it would be you know

1702
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:45,159
because it's one thing it's like you

1703
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:46,679
share it and it's good but then like

1704
00:58:45,159 --> 00:58:48,798
when everybody's talking about it

1705
00:58:46,679 --> 00:58:50,279
literally everybody everywhere in the in

1706
00:58:48,798 --> 00:58:51,480
the in the I don't know about in the

1707
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:54,640
United States but definitely in

1708
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:57,639
California yeah I got in kind of early

1709
00:58:54,639 --> 00:58:59,159
and uh one of John Buddy's Tangled Roots

1710
00:58:57,639 --> 00:59:01,239
he's in Grass Valley he's not far from

1711
00:58:59,159 --> 00:59:03,279
me I went and met up with him he's like

1712
00:59:01,239 --> 00:59:04,598
so let me guess uh we're meeting because

1713
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,920
you want to you want to make a cross

1714
00:59:04,599 --> 00:59:09,720
with white Thorn Rose W and I was like

1715
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:11,639
no actually no I mean I do I want to but

1716
00:59:09,719 --> 00:59:13,838
like that's not why we're meeting that

1717
00:59:11,639 --> 00:59:16,118
wasn't my plan was I want to shake Jon's

1718
00:59:13,838 --> 00:59:18,920
hand his story hit with my story it's

1719
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:21,200
almost identical yeah um his is his mom

1720
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:22,680
and mine's my dad and then I smoked

1721
00:59:21,199 --> 00:59:25,038
white Thorn Rose and it reminded me so

1722
00:59:22,679 --> 00:59:26,719
much effects wise of the Romulan that I

1723
00:59:25,039 --> 00:59:27,920
was like I just to meet this guy and

1724
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:30,679
shake his hand you know and wish him the

1725
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:32,280
best of luck um so it really wasn't

1726
00:59:30,679 --> 00:59:33,960
about making the cross but I kind of

1727
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:35,880
kick myself in the ass now because if I

1728
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:37,679
had taken the time to kind of finish

1729
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:41,119
that out back now everyone's blowing up

1730
00:59:37,679 --> 00:59:42,879
and you I'm sure he's like I'm doing

1731
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:44,480
this with his phone yeah I think

1732
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:47,119
whitethorn is really

1733
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:49,798
special uh and really the

1734
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:51,480
effect so yeah you know I talk about my

1735
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:53,440
podcast a lot going back to breeding for

1736
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:55,679
effect it's like so that's a really

1737
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:57,599
normal part of my daily conversation

1738
00:59:55,679 --> 00:59:59,440
with everybody is breeding for effect

1739
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:01,880
like how is this making us

1740
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:04,280
feel you know being a chef I really have

1741
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:06,720
focused on Flavor over the years like

1742
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:08,680
it's been a flavor until like La last

1743
01:00:06,719 --> 01:00:11,318
year halfway through the year I really

1744
01:00:08,679 --> 01:00:12,558
started refocusing myself like that was

1745
01:00:11,318 --> 01:00:13,838
that was when I first heard you start

1746
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:15,760
talking about effects and you always

1747
01:00:13,838 --> 01:00:17,798
talked about flavors before that that

1748
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:19,640
was like your primary focus totally it

1749
01:00:17,798 --> 01:00:21,318
was Flavor Flavor Flavor being a chef I

1750
01:00:19,639 --> 01:00:23,239
love flavors right I love talking about

1751
01:00:21,318 --> 01:00:25,358
flavor combinations flavor pairings and

1752
01:00:23,239 --> 01:00:27,038
all these things but really when it gets

1753
01:00:25,358 --> 01:00:29,358
down to it if you break this all down

1754
01:00:27,039 --> 01:00:31,160
we're here for the effect of this thing

1755
01:00:29,358 --> 01:00:33,719
of this plant and I feel like the effect

1756
01:00:31,159 --> 01:00:35,519
is so important and going back to stuff

1757
01:00:33,719 --> 01:00:37,000
like when you're doing big large scale

1758
01:00:35,519 --> 01:00:38,519
fena hunts where it's like 600 things

1759
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,880
you're not able to smoke every single

1760
01:00:38,519 --> 01:00:41,199
last one of them but you can give them

1761
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:43,119
out to enough people to where you can

1762
01:00:41,199 --> 01:00:44,159
get a good percentage of them and then

1763
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:46,640
there's some stuff that has bad

1764
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:48,038
structure bad smell we had some vomit

1765
01:00:46,639 --> 01:00:50,318
smelling plants I thought that was

1766
01:00:48,039 --> 01:00:52,280
really wild yeah like I saved those just

1767
01:00:50,318 --> 01:00:53,400
so I can show them to people like dude

1768
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:56,319
like this is what you can get with a

1769
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:58,639
fena hunt M stuff that you don't ever

1770
01:00:56,318 --> 01:01:00,519
want to smoke it's just that yeah that

1771
01:00:58,639 --> 01:01:02,960
nasty smell in it well and the funniest

1772
01:01:00,519 --> 01:01:05,759
thing is like I had to smoke it because

1773
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:08,400
it was so funky bad smelling I'm like

1774
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:09,920
you got to see I got to I had to I there

1775
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:12,079
was no way around it I'm like I'm I got

1776
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:13,318
to smoke it I gota you know it's part of

1777
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:14,839
the research and development like how

1778
01:01:13,318 --> 01:01:17,480
does this make you feel and it got me

1779
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:19,880
high but not in a good way like the high

1780
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:23,159
was about as bad as the smell and it was

1781
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:25,400
like kind of like Curry

1782
01:01:23,159 --> 01:01:26,798
vomit yeah it's got you where you don't

1783
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:28,000
get any of the the visuals but you have

1784
01:01:26,798 --> 01:01:29,400
all the weird side effects like of

1785
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,599
mushrooms or acid or something you're

1786
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:35,200
just getting crawling and feel terrible

1787
01:01:32,599 --> 01:01:38,280
yeah as far as like Instagram social

1788
01:01:35,199 --> 01:01:39,838
media like I mean we we both been doing

1789
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:41,319
this for quite a while on social media

1790
01:01:39,838 --> 01:01:43,599
you know with Instagram it's like it's

1791
01:01:41,318 --> 01:01:45,639
such an interesting thing and it's like

1792
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:47,400
it's not the real world a lot of people

1793
01:01:45,639 --> 01:01:49,199
think they live in this Instagram World

1794
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:50,920
think that's the world and it's like you

1795
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:53,118
know what that is there it's its own

1796
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:54,480
little world but it's not the real world

1797
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:56,559
right in the real world it's much

1798
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:58,760
different you know there's always going

1799
01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:01,079
to be haters online I feel like if

1800
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:02,839
you're doing something right you're you

1801
01:02:01,079 --> 01:02:05,400
know when you have haters you definitely

1802
01:02:02,838 --> 01:02:07,078
mean something to somebody right and so

1803
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:09,240
you know it used to get to me a lot more

1804
01:02:07,079 --> 01:02:12,039
the haters and it's like I just

1805
01:02:09,239 --> 01:02:13,519
realized that especially recently I came

1806
01:02:12,039 --> 01:02:15,079
to the conclusion that I'm just moving

1807
01:02:13,519 --> 01:02:16,358
forward it's like people are going to

1808
01:02:15,079 --> 01:02:17,400
hate they're going to hate on you if

1809
01:02:16,358 --> 01:02:20,278
you're doing good they're going to hate

1810
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:23,680
on you doing bad whatever but like it

1811
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:27,559
it's not reflective of my life goals

1812
01:02:23,679 --> 01:02:29,519
yeah yeah I have uh only recently had a

1813
01:02:27,559 --> 01:02:31,559
you know an epiphany and and move

1814
01:02:29,519 --> 01:02:33,559
forward in that area I was just

1815
01:02:31,559 --> 01:02:35,079
constantly losing my [ __ ] online like I

1816
01:02:33,559 --> 01:02:36,798
just couldn't I couldn't go on I could

1817
01:02:35,079 --> 01:02:39,318
post and then I had to like walk

1818
01:02:36,798 --> 01:02:41,318
away and but I've always been like I'm

1819
01:02:39,318 --> 01:02:43,759
GNA actually communicate with people and

1820
01:02:41,318 --> 01:02:46,079
respond to comments and respond to DMS

1821
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:47,240
and I'm going to be engageable you know

1822
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:49,559
because a lot of breeders out there are

1823
01:02:47,239 --> 01:02:52,399
like they've learned not to because it's

1824
01:02:49,559 --> 01:02:54,160
it's it's actually really it's really

1825
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:56,440
problematic if you're actually

1826
01:02:54,159 --> 01:02:58,118
communicating with the Instagram crowd

1827
01:02:56,440 --> 01:03:01,119
and the Twitter crowd like they become

1828
01:02:58,119 --> 01:03:03,119
your customers in a lot of ways but it's

1829
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:06,599
problematic right sure I do it all the

1830
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:08,200
time and in the past I would I run into

1831
01:03:06,599 --> 01:03:11,200
a hater or whatever and then start

1832
01:03:08,199 --> 01:03:13,000
trying to I lose my cool kind of thing

1833
01:03:11,199 --> 01:03:14,879
but I would always try to I'm trying to

1834
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:17,719
explain myself you know like you've got

1835
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:20,119
the wrong idea let me give you my my

1836
01:03:17,719 --> 01:03:21,639
story sure you know I'm now at a point

1837
01:03:20,119 --> 01:03:23,400
where I'm like I'm just gonna let them

1838
01:03:21,639 --> 01:03:26,000
do their thing yeah I don't give a [ __ ]

1839
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:28,318
haters are gonna hate ainter gonna Ain

1840
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,798
realized the people the ones that that

1841
01:03:28,318 --> 01:03:31,239
got to me the most and bothered me the

1842
01:03:29,798 --> 01:03:32,920
most like if another breeder in the

1843
01:03:31,239 --> 01:03:34,479
industry was like [ __ ] this guy over

1844
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:35,720
here around me in him and he's talking

1845
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:37,719
[ __ ] whatever and I don't even know who

1846
01:03:35,719 --> 01:03:40,759
he was I just respected his work until

1847
01:03:37,719 --> 01:03:42,278
that moment um I realized a lot of them

1848
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:44,039
were coming from a point of they hadn't

1849
01:03:42,278 --> 01:03:46,440
really done any research they had heard

1850
01:03:44,039 --> 01:03:48,960
me say maybe one thing and didn't know

1851
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:50,480
that that's changed or whatever um and

1852
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:52,639
they they they set their mind to it

1853
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:54,719
right there and they're just now talking

1854
01:03:52,639 --> 01:03:57,118
[ __ ] down the road I I don't have time

1855
01:03:54,719 --> 01:03:58,759
for that no nobody nobody really has

1856
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:00,798
time for that nobody really doing the

1857
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:02,760
real work has time for like that kind of

1858
01:04:00,798 --> 01:04:04,719
[ __ ] and it's like and the funny

1859
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:06,520
thing it's not going to slow me down and

1860
01:04:04,719 --> 01:04:09,078
you know some of it's motivational too

1861
01:04:06,519 --> 01:04:10,480
it's like it motivates me to be the best

1862
01:04:09,079 --> 01:04:12,519
I can be you know what I mean and it's

1863
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:14,480
like the biggest haters pushed me

1864
01:04:12,519 --> 01:04:16,159
forward more than anyone else totally

1865
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:18,278
when I was you know first getting into

1866
01:04:16,159 --> 01:04:20,000
this well and the thing is the best way

1867
01:04:18,278 --> 01:04:21,318
to deal with haters is not to try to

1868
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,318
reason with them because you can't argue

1869
01:04:21,318 --> 01:04:25,719
with a fool right at the end of the day

1870
01:04:23,318 --> 01:04:27,679
you're not going to convince most people

1871
01:04:25,719 --> 01:04:29,358
of anything different you know it's like

1872
01:04:27,679 --> 01:04:30,838
yeah sometimes there's someone I respect

1873
01:04:29,358 --> 01:04:32,759
in the industry I'll reach out to them

1874
01:04:30,838 --> 01:04:34,000
like sometimes I you know I have their

1875
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:35,440
phone number I'll reach out to those

1876
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,278
guys and be like yo this is what's up

1877
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:38,720
you got a problem with me talk to me you

1878
01:04:37,278 --> 01:04:40,880
know it's but none of these haters would

1879
01:04:38,719 --> 01:04:42,358
say [ __ ] to my face and it's like come

1880
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:44,920
say [ __ ] to my face if you got a problem

1881
01:04:42,358 --> 01:04:46,358
with me but right it's just uh you know

1882
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:48,440
it's one of those things in life you

1883
01:04:46,358 --> 01:04:49,798
know as you become bigger and you get

1884
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:52,639
more in the spotlight there's going to

1885
01:04:49,798 --> 01:04:54,199
be hate it's like one of those things

1886
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:56,679
that doesn't bother me what does bother

1887
01:04:54,199 --> 01:04:57,960
me is it's kind growing and increasing

1888
01:04:56,679 --> 01:05:00,000
to some degree is when you start having

1889
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:02,119
people impersonate your company your

1890
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,719
brand and they're making fake accounts

1891
01:05:02,119 --> 01:05:06,240
the worst just scamming people out of

1892
01:05:03,719 --> 01:05:08,639
money and it's usually the dumbest stuff

1893
01:05:06,239 --> 01:05:10,679
and you know I'm I'm a fairly smart guy

1894
01:05:08,639 --> 01:05:12,440
but I get not everyone is fairly smart

1895
01:05:10,679 --> 01:05:14,000
right so when I when someone tells me

1896
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:16,000
their story and I'm like you [ __ ]

1897
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,679
idiot how did you fall for I'm I got to

1898
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,960
like stop and be like okay you know

1899
01:05:17,679 --> 01:05:23,440
didn't happen to me it's so shitty but

1900
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:25,159
we had somebody spend like $900 on seeds

1901
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:26,880
and breeding book and all kinds of other

1902
01:05:25,159 --> 01:05:27,920
stuff from the website not from our

1903
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:30,160
website but they thought they were

1904
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:33,079
buying it from us and they sent this guy

1905
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:34,480
money and it was slowly it it was like

1906
01:05:33,079 --> 01:05:36,798
these guys are so good some of them

1907
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:38,318
where it was like yeah just send me $300

1908
01:05:36,798 --> 01:05:39,798
for those packs and then it was like oh

1909
01:05:38,318 --> 01:05:41,400
dude I'm going to double the deal and

1910
01:05:39,798 --> 01:05:43,759
give you more seeds and all this other

1911
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:47,200
stuff if you send me 500 and then after

1912
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:49,920
that it was like oh man it's stuck in

1913
01:05:47,199 --> 01:05:51,318
customs shipping and the insurance yeah

1914
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:52,960
and I felt bad and I ended up sending

1915
01:05:51,318 --> 01:05:55,239
the guy a book and some seeds because I

1916
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:57,838
just feel bad but typically you know

1917
01:05:55,239 --> 01:05:59,479
it's like man it's just so shitty that

1918
01:05:57,838 --> 01:06:01,000
there's people out there creating these

1919
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:02,760
fake accounts too that are just trying

1920
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,358
to scam people with telegram and stuff

1921
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:06,799
like that it's like the only way to buy

1922
01:06:04,358 --> 01:06:09,519
my seeds is basically through our

1923
01:06:06,798 --> 01:06:12,838
website North American Seed Company

1924
01:06:09,519 --> 01:06:14,599
we're working with uh broccoli

1925
01:06:12,838 --> 01:06:17,440
brock.

1926
01:06:14,599 --> 01:06:19,318
luu and I think we're we're just doing

1927
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:21,440
mostly direct right you can get the B

1928
01:06:19,318 --> 01:06:23,199
you can get our book on Amazon you get

1929
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:25,559
it from Khalifa if you're in Europe you

1930
01:06:23,199 --> 01:06:28,199
can get it from Khalifa from kifa

1931
01:06:25,559 --> 01:06:30,240
gentics it's my boy over there like we

1932
01:06:28,199 --> 01:06:31,838
keep it small and you know it's like I'm

1933
01:06:30,239 --> 01:06:33,719
worried about counterfeits we've changed

1934
01:06:31,838 --> 01:06:36,000
our packaging now and it's like people

1935
01:06:33,719 --> 01:06:38,199
knocking off stuff it's kind of crazy

1936
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,719
people will knock off anything yeah no I

1937
01:06:38,199 --> 01:06:42,118
I I actually saw someone else I don't

1938
01:06:40,719 --> 01:06:43,439
know if it was Chris from compound or

1939
01:06:42,119 --> 01:06:45,440
someone years ago that dealt with some

1940
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,960
counterfeiting of their seed packs and I

1941
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:49,760
was like I'm going to just nip that in

1942
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:51,798
the butt now and I I've used can verify

1943
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:54,359
labels but they're you know they're made

1944
01:06:51,798 --> 01:06:56,079
with my logo on them you know they're

1945
01:06:54,358 --> 01:06:58,558
all you can scan it and it goes to this

1946
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:59,839
you can't fake that you can't cuz it it

1947
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:01,000
would be a different website there' be

1948
01:06:59,838 --> 01:07:03,400
things with it that would be wrong even

1949
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,480
if you went that distance so I I got

1950
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:06,920
that secured up years ago every pack

1951
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:08,880
I've got has got those on them even the

1952
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:11,159
freebie packs have this little QR code

1953
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:12,200
thing on there nice right now it's bad

1954
01:07:11,159 --> 01:07:14,159
enough that we have people who

1955
01:07:12,199 --> 01:07:16,199
impersonate and they use telegram but

1956
01:07:14,159 --> 01:07:18,440
most people out there have learned that

1957
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:20,480
it's like the I'm the Saudi Prince and

1958
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:22,679
email you know give me your money only

1959
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:24,159
500 bucks and you'll get 5 million most

1960
01:07:22,679 --> 01:07:26,318
people have learned about that by now

1961
01:07:24,159 --> 01:07:27,719
but not everyone has yeah so there's

1962
01:07:26,318 --> 01:07:30,400
still people that get scammed and that's

1963
01:07:27,719 --> 01:07:32,639
why they keep doing it um but you know

1964
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:34,000
for me it's like people recognize it

1965
01:07:32,639 --> 01:07:35,239
right away that that's not Ry and

1966
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,679
genetics and they come to me and oh

1967
01:07:35,239 --> 01:07:39,038
there's another guy faking your account

1968
01:07:37,679 --> 01:07:41,519
I've got I've got all the I've got an

1969
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:43,680
LLC and everything so I can go and ask

1970
01:07:41,519 --> 01:07:46,239
Instagram to take it down and it takes a

1971
01:07:43,679 --> 01:07:48,118
little time but totally well and it

1972
01:07:46,239 --> 01:07:50,038
helps that you're accessible too some of

1973
01:07:48,119 --> 01:07:51,798
the guys are not accessible on like even

1974
01:07:50,039 --> 01:07:52,720
the brands and companies and some of

1975
01:07:51,798 --> 01:07:55,079
these guys don't even run their

1976
01:07:52,719 --> 01:07:56,959
companies anymore yep you know it's like

1977
01:07:55,079 --> 01:07:59,359
big sh out to DNA genetics those guys

1978
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:01,039
still run their company right you know

1979
01:07:59,358 --> 01:08:03,838
yeah I've I've had countless people hit

1980
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:05,799
me up that are within the industry you

1981
01:08:03,838 --> 01:08:08,679
know I'll make your seeds for

1982
01:08:05,798 --> 01:08:10,759
you I'll make your seeds for you no no

1983
01:08:08,679 --> 01:08:12,000
no I make them yeah I grow them you

1984
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:13,920
wouldn't believe how many people I make

1985
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,158
seeds for and I've made seeds for over

1986
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:18,399
the years that that uh you know it's

1987
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:20,358
like because I can make them cheap

1988
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:21,879
enough typically to where it makes more

1989
01:08:20,359 --> 01:08:23,440
sense like I've done that that's where

1990
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:26,679
like I mean I used to charge a buck and

1991
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:29,358
now you know it just depends on volume

1992
01:08:26,679 --> 01:08:30,759
like these guys can still run a business

1993
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:33,279
you know with other people producing

1994
01:08:30,759 --> 01:08:35,759
their seeds but it's like is it's is it

1995
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:37,560
authentic yeah I wouldn't I'd be losing

1996
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:39,439
my mind thinking about the quality

1997
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:40,839
control I mean I know what I do and I

1998
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:42,399
know no one else is going to do that no

1999
01:08:40,838 --> 01:08:44,759
one else is going to be underneath

2000
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:46,158
almost every plant every day for the

2001
01:08:44,759 --> 01:08:48,119
first three or four weeks while you're

2002
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:49,719
making seeds in a room to make sure

2003
01:08:48,119 --> 01:08:51,318
there's no Herms there's no

2004
01:08:49,719 --> 01:08:54,960
cross-contamination no one's going to

2005
01:08:51,319 --> 01:08:57,319
have that bugged out mindset that I have

2006
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:59,960
have you tried under canopy lights yet

2007
01:08:57,319 --> 01:09:01,520
no but yeah you have thoughts on those

2008
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:03,158
oh yeah yeah negative thoughts no no

2009
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:04,560
I've been looking into it oh yeah I'm

2010
01:09:03,158 --> 01:09:07,439
going to send you home with under canopy

2011
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:10,400
lights today okay to test out in your

2012
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:11,759
tent some FV got a couple extra FV I'm

2013
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:13,599
getting a new electric panel I guess

2014
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:15,640
that's my main issue I'm like I'm maxed

2015
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:17,239
out I I need I need to bump up the

2016
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:20,359
electric service at my house when you

2017
01:09:17,238 --> 01:09:21,798
can run one per 4x4 or two for 4x4 but

2018
01:09:20,359 --> 01:09:23,039
as far as seed production now you know

2019
01:09:21,798 --> 01:09:26,798
on the bottom you get a lot of lighter

2020
01:09:23,039 --> 01:09:28,838
seeds mhm yeah just cut those I'm tired

2021
01:09:26,798 --> 01:09:30,838
of having to sift through that yeah I

2022
01:09:28,838 --> 01:09:32,519
cut the branches off at the bottom yeah

2023
01:09:30,838 --> 01:09:34,000
get rid of them I've got a nice you've

2024
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:36,319
got a really big machine I've got the

2025
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,880
smaller version yeah it just everything

2026
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:40,400
the same it's just doesn't thresh as

2027
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:42,679
much right um so it does really good but

2028
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:46,158
yeah I've learned over the years to like

2029
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:48,199
do it in a way where there's less work

2030
01:09:46,158 --> 01:09:49,879
at the end of sorting the seeds and so I

2031
01:09:48,198 --> 01:09:52,238
just cut the bottom branches off I don't

2032
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:55,159
even now I won't have to yeah but that's

2033
01:09:52,238 --> 01:09:57,119
why I'm limited you know if one plant

2034
01:09:55,158 --> 01:09:59,639
I'm already limited really heavily in

2035
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:01,760
space really heavily but for me I'm

2036
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:03,679
really happy if off of one plant I can

2037
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:05,239
get a couple hundred packs of seeds or a

2038
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:07,199
little bit more than that to me that's

2039
01:10:05,238 --> 01:10:08,559
like a real good day so and then so on

2040
01:10:07,198 --> 01:10:10,158
average if I don't have to cut the

2041
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:11,640
branches off I'd probably be getting you

2042
01:10:10,158 --> 01:10:14,000
know another 100 packs or something out

2043
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:15,719
of it oh yeah I mean and all that's for

2044
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,679
the same amount of well a little bit

2045
01:10:15,719 --> 01:10:19,198
more electricity right so right your

2046
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:22,480
inputs you might spend a little bit more

2047
01:10:19,198 --> 01:10:24,519
on inputs maybe a little bit more on

2048
01:10:22,479 --> 01:10:26,238
dehumidification you know electricity

2049
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:29,040
energy might be a little bit more but it

2050
01:10:26,238 --> 01:10:30,919
still pans out to more money right so

2051
01:10:29,039 --> 01:10:33,359
and I think the quality is just as good

2052
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:35,760
if not better uh the flow especially

2053
01:10:33,359 --> 01:10:37,759
from under canopy lighting is pretty

2054
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:39,320
impressive uh and just the increase in

2055
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:41,079
yield and if you can increase the the

2056
01:10:39,319 --> 01:10:43,399
seeds we're doing a trial right now with

2057
01:10:41,079 --> 01:10:45,880
under canopy versus Light Lift dialing

2058
01:10:43,399 --> 01:10:48,559
in the ppfd from above and below and

2059
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:50,679
then the combination of the two nice so

2060
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:54,440
it's going to be a fun one

2061
01:10:50,679 --> 01:10:56,520
nice yeah I uh I'm looking forward to

2062
01:10:54,439 --> 01:10:58,119
right now I'm doing it at my home you

2063
01:10:56,520 --> 01:11:00,080
know very small I've built a room from

2064
01:10:58,119 --> 01:11:01,760
the ground up and built a whole building

2065
01:11:00,079 --> 01:11:04,800
on my property to do it little tiny

2066
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:06,640
little thing um I hope one day to just

2067
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:09,039
be living in a different area because

2068
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:11,520
right now I'm where I'm at it's like 50

2069
01:11:09,039 --> 01:11:13,560
cents per kilowatt hour for electricity

2070
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:15,560
yeah it's just insane it's way too much

2071
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:17,640
money insane yeah that's California for

2072
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:19,560
you yeah so I'm hoping to at some point

2073
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:20,880
get you know I've got plans of moving a

2074
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:22,600
little bit maybe a little bit into

2075
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:24,079
Nevada or just someplace else and maybe

2076
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:26,079
the electricity will be cheaper and I I

2077
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:27,559
can do some more things

2078
01:11:26,079 --> 01:11:29,760
and not have to worry about that as much

2079
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:31,800
because for me there's there's an

2080
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:33,640
equation there where it's how much is it

2081
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:35,960
per kilowatt hour and then how much do I

2082
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:38,280
have to in the end sell a seed for based

2083
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:41,119
on how many seeds I get off of the

2084
01:11:38,279 --> 01:11:44,198
plants and everything else um because

2085
01:11:41,119 --> 01:11:45,760
right now my you know uh I sell my seeds

2086
01:11:44,198 --> 01:11:48,238
for as cheap as I can possibly sell them

2087
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:49,840
for and still make money yeah when it's

2088
01:11:48,238 --> 01:11:51,678
I sell them to a seed bank for 50 bucks

2089
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:53,159
a pack and there's only a little bit of

2090
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:55,600
money left there for me to make money

2091
01:11:53,158 --> 01:11:57,679
off of them if I obviously if I had more

2092
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:59,840
space I could grow more seeds and then

2093
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:02,440
that changes everything right but I'm

2094
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:04,520
limited where I'm at right now and it's

2095
01:12:02,439 --> 01:12:06,399
uh it's a good thing it's I'm still at a

2096
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:08,400
craft level and things are successful

2097
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:10,079
and I'm doing good but if at any point I

2098
01:12:08,399 --> 01:12:11,359
actually just get to move I can then I

2099
01:12:10,079 --> 01:12:13,479
can start having some more fun and

2100
01:12:11,359 --> 01:12:15,158
experimenting nice doing a lot of things

2101
01:12:13,479 --> 01:12:17,519
but I I was looking at that you know

2102
01:12:15,158 --> 01:12:20,479
building a whole new room setup with all

2103
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:24,000
underc canopy lighting and mix lighting

2104
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:25,678
up top and you know the my dream setup

2105
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:29,439
that I want nice

2106
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:31,319
yeah so if you had one piece of advice

2107
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:33,678
for younger guys that are coming into

2108
01:12:31,319 --> 01:12:35,880
the industry that either want to be

2109
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:38,279
cultivators or or they read High Times

2110
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:40,159
magazine or maybe I don't know if High

2111
01:12:38,279 --> 01:12:41,079
Times magazine is still printed but yeah

2112
01:12:40,158 --> 01:12:42,559
I don't know if it is if they're if

2113
01:12:41,079 --> 01:12:44,079
they're reading the internet they're

2114
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:46,000
reading social media and they get

2115
01:12:44,079 --> 01:12:47,479
excited about the industry what's your

2116
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,238
one piece of advice for them for

2117
01:12:47,479 --> 01:12:51,919
somebody who did it very organically and

2118
01:12:50,238 --> 01:12:55,799
you know has has done it for quite a

2119
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:57,000
while don't don't do it don't now that

2120
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:58,840
that's that's my first initial thought

2121
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:01,359
and I'm just trying to be funny um but

2122
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:03,039
that is seriously how most times if you

2123
01:13:01,359 --> 01:13:05,000
caught me alone just me and you and you

2124
01:13:03,039 --> 01:13:06,319
ask me hey man I'm really excited about

2125
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,639
I want to do what you do or get into

2126
01:13:06,319 --> 01:13:10,479
something about the Cannabis IND

2127
01:13:07,639 --> 01:13:12,639
industry I'd say don't don't there's

2128
01:13:10,479 --> 01:13:15,519
plenty of other things that unless you

2129
01:13:12,639 --> 01:13:17,279
need to get into the Cannabis industry

2130
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:20,320
that's where you should be with it it

2131
01:13:17,279 --> 01:13:21,759
it's it's really tough in a lot of ways

2132
01:13:20,319 --> 01:13:23,759
and there's a lot of stuff that it's

2133
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:25,159
kind of hard to even explain to people

2134
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:27,880
what you're going to deal with what

2135
01:13:25,158 --> 01:13:30,279
you're going to what's going to happen

2136
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:32,239
um and to me hindsight and stuff it's

2137
01:13:30,279 --> 01:13:34,719
not worth it unless you have what I have

2138
01:13:32,238 --> 01:13:37,959
right here like I can't do anything else

2139
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:39,319
yeah I love this too much um if I wasn't

2140
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:41,960
doing this I'd just be homeless

2141
01:13:39,319 --> 01:13:43,759
somewhere growing plants like gorilla

2142
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:47,439
grown and that's you know that's who I'd

2143
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:50,960
be if I couldn't do this anymore um what

2144
01:13:47,439 --> 01:13:52,439
I would say though is uh if I'm actually

2145
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:55,319
giving advice and it's not just don't do

2146
01:13:52,439 --> 01:13:58,039
it don't be afraid to fail that's the

2147
01:13:55,319 --> 01:14:00,399
that's the biggest thing that holds

2148
01:13:58,039 --> 01:14:02,279
people back in aot in a lot of areas of

2149
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:03,799
life is you're afraid of the failure and

2150
01:14:02,279 --> 01:14:06,559
the consequences you're going to Face by

2151
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:08,000
trying something um but what I've

2152
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:09,600
learned and you've heard us talk about

2153
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:12,439
this you know multiple times we brought

2154
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:15,679
it up when you make mistakes along the

2155
01:14:12,439 --> 01:14:18,000
way you learn things you learn stuff

2156
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:20,039
about yourself not just the subject you

2157
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,719
know you you start to realize who you

2158
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:24,880
are what your character is what your

2159
01:14:21,719 --> 01:14:27,840
soul is what really drives you forward

2160
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:30,920
and and there's nothing more valuable in

2161
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:32,880
life than you can learn than who you

2162
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:35,119
really are and most people never take

2163
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:37,960
the time to do that most people end up

2164
01:14:35,119 --> 01:14:39,880
70 80 60 whatever it is and they've

2165
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:42,439
never stopped to be like who the [ __ ] am

2166
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:45,480
I really not all this but who am I

2167
01:14:42,439 --> 01:14:48,719
really deep down for sure um and making

2168
01:14:45,479 --> 01:14:51,039
mistakes is what can open up doors and

2169
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:54,039
windows to you so you can learn who you

2170
01:14:51,039 --> 01:14:56,760
are along the way and so don't let the

2171
01:14:54,039 --> 01:14:58,600
fear of the failure keep you from doing

2172
01:14:56,760 --> 01:15:00,280
that so if you had one piece of advice

2173
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:02,039
for your younger self I bet that's what

2174
01:15:00,279 --> 01:15:04,319
that piece would be exactly what that

2175
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:06,158
would be I mean there's a lot of you

2176
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:07,719
know if I could go back in time there's

2177
01:15:06,158 --> 01:15:09,319
a lot of things that oh don't date that

2178
01:15:07,719 --> 01:15:11,239
girl don't take that job there's a lot

2179
01:15:09,319 --> 01:15:13,399
of those but if we're just talking a

2180
01:15:11,238 --> 01:15:15,238
generalization I would I would sit my

2181
01:15:13,399 --> 01:15:18,319
you know 10-year-old self down and be

2182
01:15:15,238 --> 01:15:20,439
like stop being afraid to fail nice just

2183
01:15:18,319 --> 01:15:21,719
for the rest of your life just let it go

2184
01:15:20,439 --> 01:15:24,359
yeah because you're gonna you're going

2185
01:15:21,719 --> 01:15:27,119
to fail at everything it's only every

2186
01:15:24,359 --> 01:15:29,839
now and then you have this rare little

2187
01:15:27,119 --> 01:15:31,319
it all lines up and you don't fail

2188
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:32,719
because no matter where you can always

2189
01:15:31,319 --> 01:15:34,439
look at something and find the failures

2190
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:36,840
in it find the things you didn't do

2191
01:15:34,439 --> 01:15:39,238
right you just got to let that go it's

2192
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:40,800
the easiest way to hold yourself back so

2193
01:15:39,238 --> 01:15:43,319
if somebody's looking to find out more

2194
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:46,039
about you pick up your genetics uh where

2195
01:15:43,319 --> 01:15:47,319
would they go website is www Romulan
