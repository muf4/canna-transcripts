00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:53,000
change and we come out of this uh cocoon

27

that we've been in we're going to be

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,759
beautiful but flies and here we are in

29
00:01:55,718 --> 00:02:00,679
the midst of a very tumultuous you know

30
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:03,159
changing environment and people are

31
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:07,439
taking time to get off the hill come

32
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:10,280

33
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,959
celebrate the plant absolutely I mean

34
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,400
you're celebrating the plant what did

35
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:16,120
you bring here today to show everybody

36
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,439
I'm just blown away by the flower that

37
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,640
you brought yeah I I've been coming to

38
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:22,840
events like this for a long time and

39
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:26,799
traditionally we show flowers and

40
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:30,080
tupperware and uh they were cured and

41
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:33,560
and it's post try and because of this

42
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,400
and it's timing I had early flowers and

43
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:39,400
I was able to bring flowers that James

44
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,879
gave me on the podcast back today and

45
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:48,000
show him his living flower that finished

46
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:50,199
in August and with no tarp so as the

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,680
situations change I think there's a real

48
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:55,598
Solution by us you know focusing on

49
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,400
these early photo beated plants and

50
00:02:55,598 --> 00:03:00,959
creating things so my idea was instead

51
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,039
of showing it um um like we have

52
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,319
typically that I had flowers that were

53
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:08,359
ready early with this being in September

54
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:12,399
perfect timing and to bring

55
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:14,280
flowers that are alive dude that's

56
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,480
amazing and it's yeah you got it in

57
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,640
water it's like a a flower like you'd

58
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,878
have in a vase right yes and you put the

59
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:23,679
little Rose horn on here and you come

60
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:26,679
out and we get to show someone and say

61
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,799
uh not only is this a beautiful plant

62
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:33,080
but this is it and they get the true rip

63
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:35,200
representation of the living flowers uh

64
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:38,439
and it elevates the way that we can

65
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:43,518
connect absolutely and so I brought this

66
00:03:38,438 --> 00:03:47,840
is one of uh James uh feminized plants

67
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:51,599
and it is amazing with beautiful

68
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,759
color uh really big nugs it it looks

69
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:56,039
like doesn't look like it is great for

70
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:58,759
extraction because it has open

71
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:01,359
structure and uh it checks a lot of

72
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:06,120
boxes dude a lot of boxes really

73
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:10,519
beautiful Tricom production and uh

74
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:13,799
fragrant sharp sweet notes of Rose gas

75
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:15,680
and candy yeah on this I love it I love

76
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,000
seeing that early finishers like that

77
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,600
it's what it's all about these days like

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,360
especially something that yields and can

79
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,879
produce I mean it's hard to get those

80
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,759
boxes checked when you want something

81
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:27,439
that finishes early and yields it just

82
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,400
typically doesn't go hand in hand but

83
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:31,800
like it's a great example of something

84
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:34,799
that can be produced in an impressive

85
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,560
way you know I think that's the most

86
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,639
amazing thing I've seen this year as far

87
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,319
as outdoor coming down off the mountain

88
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,519
dude great job and I was like I had to

89
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:47,079
ask James again to check in because I

90
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:50,680
wasn't sure about zeros or pink uh

91
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:52,879
animal crackers correct correct and I

92
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,560
knew that the animal crackers were

93
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:57,600
chunky with a lot of those crosses but

94
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,160
this isn't even like the biggest

95
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,400
structured nug where Su are

96
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:08,840
bigger than like football siiz nugs wow

97
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:13,279
and out of a 15g pot I got probably a 4

98
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:15,879
to 5 lb plant that's 10 to 11 ft tall Ro

99
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:18,318
it into the Earth out of the bot I grew

100
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:19,879
this in straight cocoa and there's

101
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,360
something to be said I think for the

102
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:25,519
quality coming out of that cocoa and big

103
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,280
up Royal gold I think you know them in

104
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:30,439
common they're here at using their tuer

105
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:32,279
or which which product uh I use their uh

106
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:35,160
Co straight cocoa infused with Michael

107
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:38,079
Risa nice and it was so fluffy out the

108
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,039
bag a 15gal pot is the most glorious

109
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:43,719
transplant I ever had where you just

110
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:46,399
slice the bag and dump it in I filled up

111
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,639
like 80 pots in like 20 minutes yeah

112
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:50,638
it's awesome it's done versus me dumping

113
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,439
It On The Ground mixing

114
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,879
amendments having a b up scoop them up

115
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:58,160
so yeah and not only do I have this

116
00:05:55,879 --> 00:06:00,159
flower but my specialty that I'm

117
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,160
focusing on now is a bre

118
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,000
early flowers so I also have some more

119
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:08,560
strains that I want to pull out and show

120
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,399
the planet dude that's amazing pretty

121
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,639
the purple Snap

122
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:16,239
Dragon I love that color I love that the

123
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:18,478
color the the subtleties of the color

124
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,960
beautiful color it's a little leafier

125
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:22,680
than some of the other varieties but

126
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:24,439
yeah I mean that blue that's it's almost

127
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,918
like a bluish purple underneath it's

128
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:29,038
really nice and with these new pitfalls

129
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:31,240
and changes in the market I think it's

130
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:33,598
important that all of us Farmers

131
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,918
consider extracting and with fresh

132
00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:38,120
frozen you know some of these things

133
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:42,478
about leave or this or that won't be any

134
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:44,759
Pitfall and will'll you know maybe get

135
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:47,879
more of what's selling or what the

136
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:50,199
people want so as the market shifts I'm

137
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:53,199
coming here to today and being like how

138
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:55,240
are people consuming the plant right and

139
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,319
we really need to you know pivot as

140
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:00,840
Growers and producers to cater to these

141
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,919
things so this is another beautiful

142
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:05,239

with dirty candy I really like this

166
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,560
we're coing that the dirty candy amazing

167
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:13,120
D what else we got here okay so this is

168
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:17,319
uh a cross of one of my skunk crosses of

169
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:19,840
Fifi which I just had uh Julia Carrera

170
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:21,960
right about in Skunk magazine so

171
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:23,799
everybody check it out because I went on

172
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:27,560
there and the thing that I saw was that

173
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:29,840
a lot of breeders tend to show females

174
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:33,000
and all the strain reviews were females

175
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:36,559
so I was like I'm going to show a dude

176
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,360
and his crab claws and on Fifi the skunk

177
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:43,119
that I use the Crab Claw jams are purple

178
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:46,839
wow coming out and I think that may

179
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:49,360
correlate to color and influence as well

180
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:50,959
for us you know doing male selection so

181
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,159
what I liked about this plant is the

182
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:55,239
commercial aspect of it that the nug

183
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:58,000
structures are all the size that people

184
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:00,320
want yeah and it's a real commercialized

185
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
kind of plant it's got nice chunky Bud

186
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,160
smell that one yeah yeah that's kind of

187
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,559
like gummy gummy bears

188
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:11,199
totally I get that it's definitely got

189
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:14,439
that sweet fruit on the

190
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,640
nose and our turps are a little wild cuz

191
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,519
this is my first time trying this so

192
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,439
last night my friend told me I left the

193
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:22,278
heater on him from in the hotel room and

194
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:25,680
he woke up and he was dying and he was

195
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:28,240
like bro I saved the weed and uh serious

196
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:29,919
he opened it up and we kept it going so

197
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,919
but when you say gummy bears this smells

198
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:34,399
like [ __ ] gummy bears it kind I love

199
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:35,879
it when it smells like gummy bears uh I

200
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,200
mean I like you know it's like and the

201
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:38,879
thing is is when you can relate it to

202
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,360
something you've smelled in your past

203
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:46,958
whether it's candy necklaces gummy bears

204
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:49,079
uh Oreos not not Oreos guys but uh yeah

205
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:50,759
other good things uh you name your

206
00:09:49,078 --> 00:09:53,439
favorite candy and if you can get

207
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:55,399
Twizzlers or an actual smell like that

208
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,000
to come out and express you know you're

209
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:58,480
doing something right and I feel like

210
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,600
that's right here especially look at the

211
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,920
structure yeah these beautiful chunky

212
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,800
buds it's like uh as far as the leaf the

213
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:09,240
density is nice as well the leaf ratio

214
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:12,039
is okay and it's

215
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:15,360
like like you said the bud the bud size

216
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:16,958
is great all and this is all seated like

217
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,759
heavily you could see that where I'm

218
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:20,518
like me and you make seeds so that's

219
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:23,439
another thing to share with the world

220
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:26,320
it's really scary for Farmers sometimes

221
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:29,920
to seed their patch or to make too many

222
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:32,680
seeds but with the extraction route

223
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:35,278
that's uh gives us another Lane so we

224
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:37,919
can grow seeds pull the genetics that we

225
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:41,078
need and then extract the rest and still

226
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:44,838
win so I encourage people not to take

227
00:10:41,078 --> 00:10:46,879
seeding your crop as a bad thing but

228
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,320
figure out the ways to make it work and

229
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:51,399
share that seed with the world dud

230
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,920

00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:34,839
man Immaculate seeds um we're it's a

268
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,399
seat Bank we represent a bunch of

269
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:40,399
different breeders from all across the

270
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:42,159
country um I really started it out of uh

271
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,480
I felt necessity at the time I've been

272
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:46,240
running Grow shops for 20 years um the

273
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,680
number one question I get after what

274
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,959
lights do I use what nutrients do I use

275
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:53,838
is where do I get my seeds right um and

276
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:56,039
so we wanted to um use relationships

277
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,720
that I have over my 20 plus years in the

278
00:12:56,039 --> 00:13:01,799
industry right and be able to provide a

279
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,800
easy way to get genetics for people who

280
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:06,359
you know in Missouri who just went legal

281
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:08,399
at the time so that's really when we B

282
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:11,639
birth uh Immaculate seeds was right at

283
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:13,360
the Inception of uh you know Medical in

284
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:15,079
the state of Missouri that's amazing

285
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,399
how's it going over there with medical

286
00:13:15,078 --> 00:13:20,159
oh dude it's great we actually have

287
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:22,198
Recreation now um this the state's Going

288
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:23,838
Bonkers um and you didn't get rid of

289
00:13:22,198 --> 00:13:25,879
your medical though medical still exists

290
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,000
along with wreck yes absolutely that's

291
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:28,039
how it should be I don't know about

292
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,759
these states that are getting rid of

293
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:33,319
their medical programs I that's silly

294
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:34,838
absolutely medical First Medical first

295
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,760
dude and people that are getting it for

296
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:38,639
medical shouldn't have to pay the tax

297
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:40,639
people are paying for recreational in my

298
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,159
opinion absolutely yeah they should not

299
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,480
be able to pay the tax they should be

300
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:45,919
able to go right to the front of the

301
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,159
line in my opinion schedule three is

302
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:48,559
going to change all that too so we'll

303
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,958
see what happens

304
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:53,039
absolutely so yeah what's what's hot

batt battling for legality they're for a

392
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,919

some of those things that you don't see

428
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:15,240
so often because they are a little bit

429
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:18,038
more uh difficult and uh time consuming

430
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:20,279

the plant is massive and I I basically

438
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:37,319
manicured it so it looks like a tree so

439
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:39,319
it's got the exposed limbs on the bottom

440

487
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,679
this plan are the coolest people I could

488
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:05,279
ever hope to know and be friends with

489
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:08,519
let alone work with collaborate with you

490
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:11,879
totally so how's SC Labs doing oh man

491
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:16,278
it's been a wild ride um 15 years kind

492
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:18,919
of uh we opened 2009 and um just uh yeah

493
00:21:16,278 --> 00:21:20,400
we're surviving you know we uh like it's

494
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:22,400
survival mode for a lot of us I mean

495
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,759
myself included it's like it's it right

496
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,480
now is it's about setting yourself up

497
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:29,519
for the future we've talked about this a

498
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,480
little bit before the interview and I

499
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:33,679
mean I think it's a beautiful time

500
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,200
because I see the future coming and I

501
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,960
feel like I'm prepared for it I feel

502
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,759
like companies like yourself you guys

503
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,679
are prepared for it you know and it's

504
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:42,359
like so many people are very

505
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:44,080
shortsighted and there like especially

506
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:46,439
with testing and testing is such an

507
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:47,839
interesting subject because a lot of

508
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,000
people want to get around testing they

509
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:50,519
don't feel like there should be as much

510
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,440
oversight I'm the complete opposite I

511
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:54,798
want more oversight I want consistency

512
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,120
across the board uh we need to have

513
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:58,038
transparency and honesty and you know

514
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:00,558
this is what's going to make the

515
00:21:58,038 --> 00:22:03,519
industry better place yeah no 100% I

516
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:04,798
feel like the U you know cuz I'm a um

517
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:06,720
I'm not a chemist I'm one of the

518
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:08,599
co-founders of SC Labs but I'm a culture

519
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,079
Anthropologist and ethnobotanist you

520
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:11,599
know and you know love study

521
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:14,278
appreciation of all people at all times

522
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:16,599
and all places and the tracked uh study

523
00:22:14,278 --> 00:22:19,440
of the medicinal traditional plants used

524
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:22,119
across cultures in time and um through

525
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,600
kind of the lens of analytical chemistry

526
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:25,399
and testing over the years I've kind of

527
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:27,119
really learned you know that it's helped

528
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,640
to provide a language of meaning to be

529
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:30,759
able to understand and interpret this

530
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,960
great plant and all the Wonders It

531
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:34,919
offers and and then through the testing

532
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,840
too it's like it's you know we're now

533
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:38,679
testing cannabis to a level nothing's

534
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:40,759
ever been tested and it's this great

535
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:42,759
bioaccumulator of the century totally

536
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:44,679
and so it's through the story of the bio

537
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:46,278
accumulation it's helping to uproot the

538
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:48,159
Legacy and the history of the Green

539
00:22:46,278 --> 00:22:51,400
Revolution and the shift from

540
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:53,440
prochemical uh you know nerve agents

541
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,320
developed by Nazi scientists that turned

542
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,440
into the modern pesticides of the future

543
00:22:55,319 --> 00:23:00,399
that have poisoned all life and the

544
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,240
planet and our bodies yeah that's

545
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,798
leading to all the chronic illness

546
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,159
epidemic you know and Cancers it's like

547
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:08,759
uh the Cannabis plan I feel like is

548
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:11,200
helping to bring this to to the to it's

549
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:12,919
a time it's a bringing the truth you

550
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,000
know and and I feel like this this year

551
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:15,919
particularly and going forward I feel

552
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,200
like it's going to be a really good year

553
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,880
for those with Integrity you know within

554
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:23,038
the you know kind of Integrity of this

555
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:25,919
plant and and uh you know it's there's

556
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:28,839
something about uh you know you can't

557
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,640
grow this plant around like agriculture

558
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:32,199
it's like if you look at a GIS overlay

559
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,919
of the State of California and all the

560
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:37,480
prime Agland

561
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:39,720
areas um the green zones those are red

562
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,440
zones for cannabis yeah you know it's

563
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,079
like you know you couldn't like it's a

564
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,720
good thing Napa Valley prevented

565
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:47,119
cannabis from growing in that area

566
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,400
because it would exposed that it's a

567
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:51,839
toxic Appalachian that you could never

568
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:54,679
grow clean cannabis that could pass a

569
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:56,319
test well the beauty of cannabis is soil

570
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:57,720
remediation that's one of the most

571
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:00,158
amazing things that I think is

572
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,798
overlooked a lot of but like you know

573
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,360
it's a beautiful and that's why they

574
00:24:01,798 --> 00:24:04,918
probably need to plant it up there I

575
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:08,119
mean we don't want to smoke that stuff

576
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:09,520
necessarily go grow rope years clean

577
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:11,839
thisit up maybe one day you can come

578
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:13,798
grow some you know medicine cultivars

579
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:15,240
but right yeah clean that soil and I

580
00:24:13,798 --> 00:24:17,798
think you know they're using it in

581
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,960
places like Chernobyl to remediate up

582
00:24:17,798 --> 00:24:20,960
there you know well dude it's and it's

583
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,600
so fascinating cuz like testing kind of

584
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,558
placed you know for public health and

585
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:26,519
safety yeah you know part of a regulated

586
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:28,480
system it's makes it the final check and

587
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:30,918
the Integrity of the supply chain right

588
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,960
and um when there's Integrity in it

589
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:34,720
which is now finally coming with this

590
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,079
like era of the recalls and the state

591
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,360
having their own Labs online where

592
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:41,079
they're testing the testers and you know

593
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:42,678
it's like this this kind of time finally

594
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:44,759
they failed over the last 5 years to do

595
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:46,440
anything you know that in California

596
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:48,240
especially right especially in

597
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,480
California yeah but now that there's

598
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,000
they're kind of getting in front of it

599
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,880
it's like there's I just feel like a a

600
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,960
great moment of Reckoning and for th

601
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:59,559
those that um are of the land and have

602
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,840
taken been stewards of land and you know

603
00:24:59,558 --> 00:25:04,038
in regions of like the Emerald Triangle

604
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:05,839
it's like like non-poisoned

605
00:25:04,038 --> 00:25:09,519
non-compromised you know and I feel like

606
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:11,839
the value uh the true value of a clean

607
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:14,720
quality herb and ingredients is about to

608
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:16,398
get a a value that hasn't gotten you

609
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,038
know

610
00:25:16,398 --> 00:25:21,479
um you know I'm excited for that part of

611
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:23,200
the industry and you know there's a lot

612
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,759
of people struggling right now but I

613
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,919
feel like we everything goes in waves so

614
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:28,440
there's going to be people struggling

615
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:30,240
again someday in the future and it's ALS

616
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:33,278
going to get better you know it's like

617
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:35,399
uh the beauty of an unstable market and

618
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:38,159
also you know like we're Pioneers a lot

619
00:25:35,398 --> 00:25:40,398
of us in our own right uh trying to

620
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,720
figure stuff out for the first time you

621
00:25:40,398 --> 00:25:45,038
know whether it's a legal Seed Company

622
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,519
in the United States or Laboratory

623
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:50,158
Testing uh you know Reggie Gino he wrote

624
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:53,639
the Ford for my book and he's an amazing

625
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:56,440
guy and uh yeah so I I tested stuff with

626
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:59,799
halent Labs back in the day and I use SC

627
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:02,919
Labs now so we do test for our seeds and

628
00:25:59,798 --> 00:26:04,440
for our clones and and our our genetics

629
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:06,759
through SC and I think you guys do a

630
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:09,278
great job I love that you guys are

631
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:11,038
standardized and I feel like when I send

632
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:13,480
lab tests or when I send my plant

633
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:16,038
material for lab tests I get honest

634
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:18,679
results and I mean Integrity is

635
00:26:16,038 --> 00:26:20,640
obviously a huge part of that but so

636
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:22,960
many companies are incentivized to give

637
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,799
higher testing results and that's got to

638
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,880
go away that has to be one of the first

639
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:28,519
things to go away yeah it's been like

640
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,480
horrifying cuz over the last 5 years you

641
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:32,679
know there became like a economic

642
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,919
disincentive for people to want to work

643
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:37,080
with us you know that we pride ourselves

644
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:38,799
in accuracy and precision and being

645
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:40,720
above reproach and helping keep those

646
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:42,240
that we serve above reproach but that

647
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,919
none of that mattered in a state where

648
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,880
you could just guarantee get a 50%

649
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,799
result every time from this lab and

650
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:50,600
never fail a test so why even chest it

651
00:26:47,798 --> 00:26:53,558
you know and so I saw a lab result for

652
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:55,639
over 50% THC on flower and that's not

653
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:57,759
even possible right it's not even close

654
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,759
to possible and it's so funny that

655
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:01,558
people would even have that because you

656
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:03,879
have to know nothing about the plant to

657
00:27:01,558 --> 00:27:06,678
have a test like that and show it yeah

658
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:09,399
it's like it's like I've had bubble hat

659
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:11,640
you know and so it's so funny we live in

660
00:27:09,398 --> 00:27:13,158
this world of misinformation as well and

661
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,360
there's people that they're educated

662
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:17,520
enough to know about a COA but they're

663
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:19,398
not educated enough to understand it

664
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:21,240
totally no that that's that's that's a

665
00:27:19,398 --> 00:27:23,239
huge thing you know cuz I think a proper

666
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:25,880
relation with a lab partner is like it's

667
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,558
a partner in solutions to help you know

668
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,799
expose where you're at and be able to

669
00:27:27,558 --> 00:27:31,480
through data help to like bring about

670
00:27:29,798 --> 00:27:32,879
data driven decisions so you can

671
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,159
understand how to optimize how to like

672
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,840
preserve TPS how to standardize the

673
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:38,640
canabo content across your canopy

674
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:41,199
through like leafing practices

675
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,038
methodically early in flower so that all

676
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,399
Sites develop the same you know cuz like

677
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:46,798
a lot of labs just you know that started

678
00:27:45,398 --> 00:27:47,558
kind of like right as legalization

679
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:48,879
happened they thought it was just

680
00:27:47,558 --> 00:27:51,599
get-rich quick kind of [ __ ]

681
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,960
guaranteed testing you know um but it's

682
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:55,359
like really quickly learned it's like

683
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,519
you you know and didn't have integrity

684
00:27:55,359 --> 00:28:00,398
to start because it's like if you fail

685
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:02,519
somebody this compliance testing for one

686
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:04,439
better be right you know and you better

687
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:06,640
be able to defend back it up show all

688
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:09,080
the like like work you did to kind of

689
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,120
ensure that fail is fail cuz you're just

690
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:12,359
somebody has to remor destroy thousands

691
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:14,199
hundreds of thousands of dollars a

692
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:16,398
product and so that's the end of the

693
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,880
relationship you know based on how it's

694
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:20,439
handled you know and so one of the big

695
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:22,799
things we learned early on is you know

696
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,600
kind of you can't just Auto email that

697
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:25,839
information to somebody like you know

698
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:27,319
that requires one of the founders to

699
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:28,639
come you can do anything but that's

700
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:30,119
probably not the best way yeah not the

701
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,640
best way that's so we Le learned you

702
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:33,518
have to immediately follow up to engage

703
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:35,240
to demonstrate the quality and precision

704
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:36,839
of the work and to be able to then shift

705
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:39,038
into a root cause analysis where you can

706
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:41,119
help kind of genuinely get to the root

707
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:42,558
and build systems to prevent that from

708
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:44,398
ever happening again turn the losses

709
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:45,759
into lessons and some of our greatest

710
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:47,879
success stories have been through that

711
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:50,038
helping people to kind of overcome

712
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:52,799
massive obstacles you know whether it

713
00:28:50,038 --> 00:28:54,519
was like you know um you know cuz like a

714
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:55,879
lot of like people would just go to

715
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:58,159
whatever lab is going to stroke their

716
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,919
ego and tell them they're crushing it

717
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,919
the same sample to five different places

718
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,840
before they decide who they're going to

719
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:04,799
use you totally but but instead of like

720
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:06,759
working with the quality lab to cuz it's

721
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:08,879
like sure you have a strain that up top

722
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:10,879
sure could test 30% yeah but does

723
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,159
everybody test that uh does the

724
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,240
compliant does the average across the

725
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:18,679
planet um the biggest thing I've learned

726
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:20,359
about potency variance from like you

727
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:22,080
know cuz people just will go find a lab

728
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:23,798
that give them a high number instead of

729
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:26,398
learn the critical nature of canopy

730
00:29:23,798 --> 00:29:29,119
management and leafing methodically at

731
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:31,239
the points that most matter most where

732
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:33,639
the flower sites are starting to develop

733
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:35,440
and all go to mature together at the

734
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,799
same rate with the same light you know

735
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,080
cuz like all of a sudden with that type

736
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:40,839
of an approach you know kind of removing

737
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:44,079
75% of finally at the start of flower

738
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:46,119
and day 21 day 56 you it's like all the

739
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:47,960
buds are top buds you know it's like all

740
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:50,158
Bud tests but the top Bud tests you know

741
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,360
it standardizes the you know so it's

742
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,039
like we've never been somebody just

743
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:55,479
stroke somebody's ego but but it's like

744
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:58,200
a standardization or achieving kind of

745
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,880
like uh like a goal of like all but

746
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,360
testing what a top of test we can help

747
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,120
people get there you know but it's

748
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:04,678
definitely a different approach right I

749
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:06,119
mean so my company is like a research

750
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:07,880
and development company I mean yeah

751
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:10,038
we're genetics all this stuff but at the

752
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,480
end of the day we're researching

753
00:30:10,038 --> 00:30:12,879
development because we want to empower

754
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,278
our customers and I feel like you guys

755
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,159
are the same way it's like all a lot of

756
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:17,759
it data collection and being able to

757
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,760
look at data over a long period of time

758
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:21,278
and go okay well this we can improve

759
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:23,398
here this we can improve here and how do

760
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:25,839
we improve that right totally and so the

761
00:30:23,398 --> 00:30:28,038
more I I figure that out I can Empower

762
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:29,439
my customers to get better results when

763
00:30:28,038 --> 00:30:31,278
they buy my genetics you know whether

764
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,360
it's licensing a genetic buying seeds

765
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:34,759
for their outdoor crop you know it's all

766
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:36,519
data driven and I think the best

767
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:38,440
companies are really data driven these

768
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:39,720
days and in the future it's going to be

769
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,759
even more important because it's so

770
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,440
competitive absolutely you know and and

771
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:45,558
also too just like selecting for things

772
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,440
Beyond THC right and that's why I really

773
00:30:45,558 --> 00:30:50,000
appreciate the diverse offerings you

774
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,038
have but you know so many you know

775
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,599
selections you can find could be like 5

776
00:30:52,038 --> 00:30:56,599
6% TPS right the average across hundreds

777
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:59,359
of thousands of tests of what We've ran

778
00:30:56,599 --> 00:31:01,879
over the years is about .4% average in

779
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:05,798
dread flour the potential when it's most

780
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:07,919
sticky chronic like 3 to 5 1 12% yeah

781
00:31:05,798 --> 00:31:09,839
the average herb on dispensary shelves

782
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,240
1% or less average pre-roll on

783
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:14,119
dispensary shelves like half a percent

784
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:16,839
or less you know it's like um you know

785
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:19,759
and so kind of like um on a cool note

786
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:22,519
like um some some epic Farm resilience

787
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:25,158
we've seen built up from uh a lot of the

788
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:27,519
leaders in Oregon market like instead of

789
00:31:25,159 --> 00:31:29,120
that you know having built and made it

790
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,720
built resilience through the most

791
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:33,398
flooded collapse times you cuz they blew

792
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,360
out the market first hit over production

793
00:31:33,398 --> 00:31:37,558
first you know kind of totally you know

794
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:39,359
they blew it out they just went crazy

795
00:31:37,558 --> 00:31:41,759
there was no limit to the licenses they

796
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:43,319
just everybody got licenses they

797
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:45,079
produced 10 times as much as they can

798
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:46,558
consume in the first year but that but

799
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:48,960
but I think they really showed the way

800
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:50,480
forward because it's like the people

801
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,079
I've seen kind of like through the

802
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:55,240
market collapsing and maturing like

803
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:58,119
those that I've seen succeed and build

804
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:00,278
Brands and loyalty consumer following

805
00:31:58,119 --> 00:32:02,558
yeah um you know instead of continuously

806
00:32:00,278 --> 00:32:03,960
ding down footage if scale back a little

807
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:06,119
bit Double Down tur preservation

808
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:08,759
infrastructure to treat herb like

809
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:10,398
lettuce like cabbage you know keep it

810

problems and these are all things that

828
00:32:44,038 --> 00:32:48,919
can be fixed right and and it takes data

829
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:51,398
and it takes people with Integrity to be

830
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:53,320

you also have a tent too I believe yes

957
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:17,879
yes yes crop tops Greenhouse is an

958
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,760
instant popup portable Greenhouse that's

959
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,920
definitely looks like a tent to some

960
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,880
people but it does look like a tent it

961
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:27,159
is it's a plant tent is absolutely it

962
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,440
has a you know it telescopes from ground

963
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:31,118
level to about 14 ft tall and it's made

964
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,599
out of polywoven plastics that we use in

965
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:37,000
green houses and I use that type of you

966
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:38,800
know Greenhouse material in um for 100

967
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,079
foot green houses for like 20 years so

968
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,519
that's why I chose it in my Innovation

969
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:44,960
it doesn't rip and so you can telescope

970
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:47,280
it at any point in time just put that

971
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,960
skirt on and it protects plants from

972
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,920
like ashes or use it as breeding

973
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:53,199
Chambers Pest Management um so many

974
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,240
different things right now we got a

975
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:57,159
couple of hippies hot boxing it which is

976
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:58,799
awesome we've had some other dudes you

977
00:38:57,159 --> 00:39:01,879
know using it for showers out in their

978
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,079
grow sces it's been all over the place

979
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,160
but it's really fun as a breeding

980
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:06,920
chamber to make sure that your genetics

981
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:08,719
have their own little private space if

982
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:11,318
you're doing little like home feno you

983
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:13,639
know hunts or things like that fully

984
00:39:11,318 --> 00:39:16,318
breathable too so absolutely we got some

985
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:18,000
ventilation with some aggro bun type

986
00:39:16,318 --> 00:39:19,960
meshing there to make sure that it can

987
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,079
be used in Pest Management and you know

988
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,920
breeding and all those good things nice

989
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:26,240
heck yeah pollen mitigation yep

990
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,800
absolutely awesome so how's Cana fist

991
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:31,239
for you uh it's been chill so far we we

992
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:34,400
did the judging last night and so we

993
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:36,639
were out till you know about 12 12:00

994
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:39,280
you know partying down in the Oldtown

995
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:41,440
Eureka and smoking a little bit too much

996
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:44,200
so our morning got off slow is there

997
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:46,400
such a thing I don't know dude I have no

998
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:48,759
idea I think when you start making it so

999
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,760
you can't talk at re on the river when I

1000
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:53,119
seen you when you guys were booths up I

1001
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:56,440
I couldn't talk for like 3 weeks I was

1002
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:58,039
hollering I was like yes Marlin [ __ ]

1003
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:59,679
I was just hollering so

1004
00:39:58,039 --> 00:40:01,759
I could not talk for 3 weeks so there

1005
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:03,759
was no podcasting for me at that time we

1006
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,640
just saw meno dope that was amazing they

1007
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,839
just performed got to love Daniel meno

1008
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:10,118
dope those guys are killing it they're

1009
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:12,199
they sound better than ever it's amazing

1010
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:13,960
so cool to see like the community like

1011
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:16,318
supporting each other so much and like

1012
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:19,039
people that bring music to the table

1013
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:21,639
offer like a whole niche of you know

1014
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:23,440
exposure that we don't necessarily have

1015
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:24,960
the ability to have on our own so I

1016
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,880
think the symbiosis of music and

1017
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,280
festivals and events like really helps

1018
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,440
Entre entrepreneurs of all forms kind of

1019
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,960
like move forward a little bit more and

1020
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,960
kind of get just one more set of eyes on

1021
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:38,400
it that may not have been without that

1022
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:40,318
music and meno Do's definitely [ __ ]

1023
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,318
culture excuse my language for sure and

1024
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:43,318
then we got lettuce tonight we got OT

1025
00:40:42,318 --> 00:40:45,480
and Friends

1026
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:48,239
tomorrow super special of course and

1027
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:50,039
Brian Swizzle I think is out here right

1028
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:51,759
I think so yeah we got object heavy

1029
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:54,279
somewhere up in this [ __ ] oh yeah we

1030
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:56,680
got Nick is here as well yes big UPS to

1031
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:58,920
Nicki T he's always in the culture dude

1032
00:40:56,679 --> 00:41:01,759
yeah he's always the events well at

1033
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:04,400
least we were at bre he was there

1034
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,200
absolutely over long time there's really

1035
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,639
good weed oh no seriously we've been

1036
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:10,960
burning all day all day yeah I mean

1037
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:14,159
we're seeing the best of everything I'm

1038
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:16,280
seeing good indoor amazing depths uh

1039
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:18,639
early finishing flower it's just all

1040
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:20,160
amazing yeah it's absolutely great

1041
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:21,960
because everybody from the surrounding

1042
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:24,118
counties has an opportunity to come too

1043
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:26,639
so we see like a lot of diversity and

1044
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:27,920
like high elevation growing or you know

1045
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:30,440
base elev

1046
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,519
sea level growing indoor outdoor like

1047
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,760
you said and the depths coming in the

1048
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:37,039
organic depths for regenerative farming

1049
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:39,560
are seriously always my favorite like

1050
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:41,440
100% always my favorite because it

1051
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:44,199
actually brings like this you know you

1052
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:46,000
can smell organic you know when you grow

1053
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:47,439
good genetics like yourself and Rare

1054
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,880
Breed and all these other guys that are

1055
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,159
really putting their heart and soul into

1056
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,400
growing good genetics yeah and to grow

1057
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:55,719
it organically in a way that you know is

1058
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:57,760
positive for the Earth is 100% our

1059
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:59,118
mission I think that it just tastes

1060
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,680
better it smells better and when you do

1061
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:04,240
it in depth when you have all that pure

1062
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:06,199
like Midsummer Sun at that highest

1063
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:07,598
elevation of sun I think that's when it

1064
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:08,838
comes out the best honestly there's

1065
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:12,000
definitely something special about the

1066
00:42:08,838 --> 00:42:13,318
sun it's it's hard to argue uh you know

1067
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,079
I think there's a lot of guys in San

1068
00:42:13,318 --> 00:42:18,480
Francisco Oakland big cities they all

1069
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:19,920
want that indoor yeah but if you've

1070
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,000
never had really amazing outdoor you

1071
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,800
probably don't have anything to compare

1072
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,480
it to and I love outdoor in its own way

1073
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:29,318
just as much as I like indoor and

1074
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,838
Greenhouse light is like amazing too I

1075
00:42:29,318 --> 00:42:33,358
feel like it's the best of both worlds

1076
00:42:30,838 --> 00:42:35,558
that's the future right uh you know we

1077
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:38,480
can argue that all day but I feel like

1078
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:40,839
Greenhouse mix light is the future you

1079
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,960
get the sun you get the the power from

1080
00:42:40,838 --> 00:42:45,799
the lights as well so you get more of a

1081
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,880
consistent product yeah the consistency

1082
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:50,079
is definitely a huge ordeal you know

1083
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:53,079
there's so many Elemental risks that we

1084
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:55,760
have with outdoor and even Greenhouse in

1085
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:57,760
a way where you know will you get all of

1086
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,480
a sudden mashed by a pest you know will

1087
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,040
mold come in is there going to be a hot

1088
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:02,838
day is there going to be a fire and all

1089
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:05,199
of a sudden your Greenhouse is full of

1090
00:43:02,838 --> 00:43:07,558
smoke there's so many different test

1091
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:10,039
other neighbors spray right there's so

1092
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:11,960
many things so you can mitigate by

1093
00:43:10,039 --> 00:43:14,119
having a greenhouse uh you have less

1094
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:16,318
variables to work with and so you have

1095
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:17,800
more control and I love that I mean I

1096
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:19,960
love outdoor too don't get me wrong

1097
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:21,559
outdoor has his place I don't ever want

1098
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:23,639
to see outdoor go away and I don't ever

1099
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:25,000
want to see indoor or anything else go

1100
00:43:23,639 --> 00:43:28,199
away I want to see them done as

1101
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,400
efficiently as possible uh efficiency is

1102
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:33,000
a huge thing and Earth friendly you know

1103
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:36,400
as a more that we can partner up the

1104
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,400
concept of organic growing even in an

1105
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:41,400
indoor situation where we have you know

1106
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,079
lower wattage usage of LEDs and HVAC

1107
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:45,160
systems and things like that like the

1108
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:46,920
more that we can minimize our carbon

1109
00:43:45,159 --> 00:43:48,679
footprint I think as an industry and

1110
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:52,480
optimize quality because we don't want I

1111
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:54,000
I feel like on one level we want to make

1112
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,920
stuff that's good for the Earth and we

1113
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,880
want to do things that are beneficial

1114
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,880
and I love that but also we don't want

1115
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:01,400
to sacrifice quality and some some of

1116
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:03,039
those things people don't see them as

1117
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:05,358
going hand inand but they can go hand in

1118
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:07,000
hand oh absolutely and so I think it we

1119
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:08,960
we have to be conscious about that

1120
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,039
because anymore it's so competitive you

1121
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,400
have to have the best quality so it

1122
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:15,519
needs to be looked at with integrity and

1123
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:18,680
I think that's a huge part of it mov

1124
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:20,440
keep Integrity is like 100% the real

1125
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:22,118
[ __ ] I mean if you want to grow the

1126
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:25,200
truth you got to be the truth Integrity

1127
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:27,559
Farms guys Integrity yeah

1128
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:30,519
America South Park Plus

1129
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:33,160
yes got to love it heck yeah so what's

1130
00:44:30,519 --> 00:44:34,800
been uh your favorite part of canest so

1131
00:44:33,159 --> 00:44:37,759
far as we bring this community back

1132
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:40,280
together um I really liked meno dope

1133
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,680
this morning but I I love just the the

1134
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:45,880
group of people that we have gathered

1135
00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:48,199
here uh a lot of people I know a lot of

1136
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:49,880
friends uh but as far as the music menow

1137
00:44:48,199 --> 00:44:52,399
dope was mind-blowing I I thought that

1138
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:54,559
was great listening to them open up the

1139
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:57,240
the day with really good music and they

1140
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:59,800
perform really well uh dude those guys

1141
00:44:57,239 --> 00:45:02,118
are crushing it yes absolutely but yeah

1142
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:03,599
seeing Grove bags here you know I like

1143
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:05,720
seeing Grove with their tur blocks I'm a

1144
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:07,480
huge tur block fan absolutely you know

1145
00:45:05,719 --> 00:45:10,000
we've got royal gold they're they're my

1146
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:12,000
like cup buddies I saw them at Emerald

1147
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,559
cup they were at reg we were with them

1148
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,679
at reg and the river love those guys

1149
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:19,400
cutting edges here we got skunk magazine

1150
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:21,719
Rare Breed so many good brands so many

1151
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:24,880
good people even got gr magazine laid

1152
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:28,199
down higher than hell in my crop tops

1153
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:30,559
right now the founder guy is a asleep in

1154
00:45:28,199 --> 00:45:32,399
there came down from Eugene so they're

1155
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:34,079
all over the place I did see someone

1156
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:37,358
someone that got too high that had to

1157
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:41,280
get uh taken away on a stretcher that

1158
00:45:37,358 --> 00:45:43,519
she was she was too lit dab face and I'm

1159
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:46,079
guessing it was dabs oh [ __ ] I'm

1160
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:48,599
guessing I'm find who produce that

1161
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:50,160
product and put it on blast right right

1162
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:51,119
or maybe not you know you just never

1163
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:52,358
know with some people they're

1164
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:54,240
lightweights and they just can't handle

1165
00:45:52,358 --> 00:45:55,440
it and they get excited to be here I

1166
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:57,078
remember the people that used to take

1167
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,960
Edibles and end up in the medical tent

1168
00:45:57,079 --> 00:46:00,680
back at Old High Times events you know

1169
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,519
all the time all the time well a lot of

1170
00:46:00,679 --> 00:46:03,960
people don't remember that it has a lot

1171
00:46:02,519 --> 00:46:06,079
to do like if it's just like with

1172
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:07,880
alcohol if you haven't eaten today and

1173
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,760
you're going to go get blasted out and

1174
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:11,680
you know smash your face with some dabs

1175
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:14,200
or some edibles you're going to get way

1176
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:15,679
higher than if you you know eight a full

1177
00:46:14,199 --> 00:46:16,879
stomach you know sometimes you want to

1178
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:18,598
do that but that's if you have a

1179
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,800
tolerance right like you have to be

1180
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:21,800
aware I think at the end of the day

1181
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:24,640
awareness is such a huge thing right

1182
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:25,960
aware of what the what cannabis or what

1183
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:27,279
different types of cannabis can do to

1184
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:29,318
you cuz it's so subjetive of the

1185
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,839
individual you can go smoke something

1186
00:46:29,318 --> 00:46:33,440
that's narcotic and you want to go to

1187
00:46:30,838 --> 00:46:34,880
sleep yes you know or sedative and then

1188
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,200
there's some other stimulating stuff

1189
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,440
that makes you want to run around and

1190
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:40,519
dance and go crazy right and so and

1191
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:42,760
there's there's between that Spectrum

1192
00:46:40,519 --> 00:46:44,759
there's so many things in the mix it's

1193
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:46,920
true I was doing judging for the flowers

1194
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:48,800
for this event for canif Fest and I've

1195
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:51,240
normally always been you know a judge

1196
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:53,880
for Emerald cup for about 10 years but

1197
00:46:51,239 --> 00:46:55,598
I've done can ofest uh like two or three

1198
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:58,000
years and have supported them when they

1199
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:01,760
did Green week and humble week since

1200
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:05,039
2014 but it's been really weird we had

1201
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:07,000
three categories we had couch lock I

1202
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:08,679
judged the extract so I was surprised oh

1203
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,960
okay so you saw that there was three

1204
00:47:08,679 --> 00:47:12,759
categories it was Party Time couch lock

1205
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:16,800
and what was the other one balance

1206
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:18,920
balanced right and so to be able to fit

1207
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:21,359
all of the things that we feel from

1208
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:23,838
inest ingesting or smoking or dabbing a

1209
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:25,759
product into those three categories was

1210
00:47:23,838 --> 00:47:28,599
a challenge we're like which one

1211
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:30,520
actually here I had a tough time with

1212
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:33,960
that a little bit but I put them in

1213
00:47:30,519 --> 00:47:36,880
order of 1 2 third fourth fifth 7 6th

1214
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:38,240
8th 9th 10th 1 through 10 I I went back

1215
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:41,838
and forth I'm one of those guys who

1216
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:43,558
wants to taste this versus this and let

1217
00:47:41,838 --> 00:47:45,358
that soak in and then wake up in the

1218
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:48,119
morning try one so I went I went through

1219
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:50,440
a real process judging those extracts

1220
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:52,240
I'm not usually a rosin judge they they'

1221
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:55,679
accidentally giving me a rosin kit but I

1222
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:57,439
enjoy rosin I smoke rosin right um well

1223
00:47:55,679 --> 00:47:58,919
it's such an important part of of what

1224
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,880
people are looking for in genetics right

1225
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:02,680
now they want to know what their wash is

1226
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,640
the percentage of the wash you know how

1227
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:07,318
much Tri Chrome is produced so really

1228
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:09,400
it's a huge I mean it's a huge thing but

1229
00:48:07,318 --> 00:48:11,599
yeah it's a concentrated expression of

1230
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:13,440
the plant too so yeah yes it is

1231
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:15,559
definitely crack weed I call it crack

1232
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,599
weed all the time we I love the TS

1233
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:18,040
though you get different turps like

1234
00:48:16,599 --> 00:48:19,720
Donnie Burger's a great example I talk

1235
00:48:18,039 --> 00:48:21,920
about my show but like Donnie Burger the

1236
00:48:19,719 --> 00:48:23,480
flower is all right it's okay but you

1237
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,358
you turn it into extract and it's like

1238
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:27,358
wow that's freaking amazing and I have

1239
00:48:25,358 --> 00:48:29,358
some really cool crosses that I'm

1240
00:48:27,358 --> 00:48:31,960
working on with House of cultivar and

1241
00:48:29,358 --> 00:48:34,358
the flower is okay but you extract it

1242
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:36,240
and you turn it into rosin it's like wao

1243
00:48:34,358 --> 00:48:38,799
where did that vanilla come from where

1244
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:40,598
did this expression come from it's so

1245
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,318
special and you don't necessarily get in

1246
00:48:40,599 --> 00:48:43,880
the flour until it's concentrated I love

1247
00:48:42,318 --> 00:48:44,920
that right well a lot of people don't

1248
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,680
know is we look through their

1249
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:49,159
percentages to create like these wash

1250
00:48:46,679 --> 00:48:51,838
numbers and a 12ft tall plant that

1251
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:54,480
extracts an ounce of wash is a different

1252
00:48:51,838 --> 00:48:57,199
percentile obviously than that same Cula

1253
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,960
bar at a 6ot plant so I feel like the

1254
00:48:57,199 --> 00:49:02,318
wash numbers and percentages are

1255
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:04,440
slightly hard to really Define because

1256
00:49:02,318 --> 00:49:06,960
of those points but a lot of cultivars

1257
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:09,039
may have more biowaste and more actual

1258
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,599
carbon material in them while we're

1259
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:12,519
looking at TR chromes now in a more

1260
00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:14,519
scientific way where this is just the

1261
00:49:12,519 --> 00:49:16,159
sugar on top and when we can take just

1262
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:18,519
the sugar then we're not having the

1263
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:20,440
experience of smoking the chlorophyll or

1264
00:49:18,519 --> 00:49:22,679
the the biomatter which I still enjoy

1265
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:25,358
I'm very much a flower girl an organic

1266
00:49:22,679 --> 00:49:27,440
you know doie for me will always do it

1267
00:49:25,358 --> 00:49:29,279
but these new infusions they take all of

1268
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,720
the taste of the carbon and everything

1269
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,319
out and you really just get that

1270
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:35,078
expression of the turpins you're right

1271
00:49:33,318 --> 00:49:36,759
yeah I mean there there's something so

1272
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:39,119
I'm a BHO fan as well there's a lot of

1273
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:41,040
people that hate on honestly because you

1274
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:43,358
lose water soluble tping so if we're

1275
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:45,639
talking about tpin and flavor B you get

1276
00:49:43,358 --> 00:49:48,000
some special stuff I don't hate on BHO

1277
00:49:45,639 --> 00:49:51,318
at all I'm I'm a rosin guy but I also

1278
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:54,280
like and can totally appreciate good B

1279
00:49:51,318 --> 00:49:57,039
right like it as it's Vaped properly so

1280
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:59,400
many people do not Vape their product

1281
00:49:57,039 --> 00:50:02,599
out and nobody wants you know BHO

1282
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:05,200
residue in the products no for sure but

1283
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:07,000
I feel like it has its own place and I

1284
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:09,159
feel like it's special and I feel like

1285
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,480
with water soluble turpins you do lose a

1286
00:50:09,159 --> 00:50:12,358
little bit something with specific

1287
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:15,679
cultivars especially that I feel like

1288
00:50:12,358 --> 00:50:17,880
perform better with BHO right um you

1289
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:19,519
know so and I love organic too but I'm

1290
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:21,640
not it doesn't always have to be or

1291
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:25,119
Sanic is fine with me well like you said

1292
00:50:21,639 --> 00:50:28,639
like BHO or carbon extract or keeping or

1293
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:28,640
all the different elements of extraction

1294
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:36,079
ofo you definitely are looking now at

1295
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:37,598
the Chrome form like what is the shape

1296
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:39,160
of the tri Chrome when it develops and

1297
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:41,200
at what stage you know because a lot of

1298
00:50:39,159 --> 00:50:43,960
them want to do the fresh frozen in a

1299
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:46,078
premature stage almost because it brings

1300
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:48,760
a very much lighter product out in the

1301
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:50,519
extract it does not every cultivar works

1302
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:53,440
or performs the same way when you do it

1303
00:50:50,519 --> 00:50:55,920
you know like Skittles early is great

1304
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:58,798
yeah Skittles mix amazing rosin right

1305
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,838
candy people love candy these days MH I

1306
00:50:58,798 --> 00:51:03,280
just you know it's like we bottlenecked

1307
00:51:00,838 --> 00:51:05,358
ourselves into this gelato and candy in

1308
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:08,119
the US which is going to go away it's

1309
00:51:05,358 --> 00:51:11,279
going to not no and phases and Trends

1310
00:51:08,119 --> 00:51:12,318
it'll be here for the long run but the

1311
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,720
thing is is we're going to have more

1312
00:51:12,318 --> 00:51:16,000
diverse stuff coming out there's people

1313
00:51:13,719 --> 00:51:17,558
that are striving to add diversity to it

1314
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,719
they may have to sneak it in by Crossing

1315
00:51:17,559 --> 00:51:21,599
it with gelato oh yeah right to get

1316
00:51:19,719 --> 00:51:23,000
people to like it but then who knows I

1317
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:25,119
mean Super Silver Haze is going to make

1318
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,318
a big comeback ah yes and that's got

1319
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:29,358
like that spicy back to it almost well

1320
00:51:27,318 --> 00:51:31,759
and I it maybe won't hit the big cities

1321
00:51:29,358 --> 00:51:34,598
as quickly but you look at hum humble

1322
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:36,559
Menino somoma Trinity you're getting a

1323
00:51:34,599 --> 00:51:38,519
lot of these equatorial expressions and

1324
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:41,040
some stuff that most people don't like

1325
00:51:38,519 --> 00:51:43,079
but it's up here and absolutely both of

1326
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:45,519
us working down in the Caribbean I mean

1327
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:47,200
both of us have worked down in the SVG I

1328
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:49,798
am presently working in the Virgin

1329
00:51:47,199 --> 00:51:51,519
Islands and in the BBI and these Island

1330
00:51:49,798 --> 00:51:54,199
cultivars you could take that same

1331
00:51:51,519 --> 00:51:56,079
genetic and grow it here and then grow

1332
00:51:54,199 --> 00:51:57,279
it at 4,000 ft and then grow it down the

1333
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:59,519
Caribbean

1334
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:01,880
everywhere totally different with the

1335
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:04,318
same cultivar and and that really has to

1336
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:06,200
do with your UV and your your atmosphere

1337
00:52:04,318 --> 00:52:08,519
and your elevation yeah and your

1338
00:52:06,199 --> 00:52:11,000
elevation pressures yeah and your

1339
00:52:08,519 --> 00:52:13,239
fertilization practices and all these

1340
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,838
types of aspects come into play with it

1341
00:52:13,239 --> 00:52:17,479
and so it's really interesting for me to

1342
00:52:14,838 --> 00:52:19,639
see like also defining through the pheno

1343
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:21,119
Hunts that we're doing and you know as

1344
00:52:19,639 --> 00:52:23,639
you develop genetics and different

1345
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:25,960
spaces of the world and adapt them to

1346
00:52:23,639 --> 00:52:28,000
that you know area specifically it takes

1347
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:30,519
a couple years is for a cultivar to

1348
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,798
truly adapt to the atmosphere to the

1349
00:52:30,519 --> 00:52:35,159
elevation pressure you know the vapor

1350
00:52:32,798 --> 00:52:36,400
pre pressure deficit that may be around

1351
00:52:35,159 --> 00:52:39,118
and all these elements that we were

1352
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:42,559
talking about I found that at 4,000 ft

1353
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:44,358
where um I have my farm the tribs have

1354
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:47,640
more of a potassium capture because at

1355
00:52:44,358 --> 00:52:50,279
4,000 ft those particular goo and hard

1356
00:52:47,639 --> 00:52:52,920
indicas they really want that cold snap

1357
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:56,880
they want to go down to the 50s and have

1358
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:58,920
still 85° Day times 75° times you know

1359
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:01,039
they want that chilling hours that are

1360
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:03,920
really vastly different well you know

1361
00:53:01,039 --> 00:53:05,920
down in the Caribbean it's still 85° at

1362
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,079
3:00 in the morning yeah OG Kush isn't

1363
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,079
going to perform well in the Caribbean

1364
00:53:07,079 --> 00:53:10,920
necessary by itself opportunity you can

1365
00:53:09,079 --> 00:53:13,359
hybridize it with stuff that does and

1366
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:15,000
find selections that will perform well

1367
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:17,159
with the hybridization process

1368
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,559
absolutely but by itself it's not meant

1369
00:53:17,159 --> 00:53:20,199
to be grown in the Caribbean just like

1370
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:24,119
that I we made a whole bunch of cross

1371
00:53:20,199 --> 00:53:25,439
Marlin and I uh for St Vincent we made

1372
00:53:24,119 --> 00:53:26,599
some special banana crosses that we're

1373
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,039
going to be going down there with

1374
00:53:26,599 --> 00:53:30,599
excellent to gift to the people it's

1375
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:33,759
going to be great we're excited about it

1376
00:53:30,599 --> 00:53:35,880
big UPS SVG he's com to help minister of

1377
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:38,200
Agriculture is about to get a nice gift

1378
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:40,160
oh excellent big up Caesar saoto we

1379
00:53:38,199 --> 00:53:41,399
absolutely adore him he's worked really

1380
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:43,519
well with the people and I think it's

1381
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:46,358
great to see how they've implemented

1382
00:53:43,519 --> 00:53:48,119
medicinal marijuana now we have sgv

1383
00:53:46,358 --> 00:53:49,400
can't we have summus we have so many

1384
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:51,119
different dispensaries that are starting

1385
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:52,798
to open and I really have it's super

1386
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:55,519
impressive and they care about the

1387
00:53:52,798 --> 00:53:57,358
people and we're not as thorn in their

1388
00:53:55,519 --> 00:53:59,639
side like we are in the United States

1389
00:53:57,358 --> 00:54:00,838
it's very accepted by the government

1390
00:53:59,639 --> 00:54:02,279
they want to help people they want to

1391
00:54:00,838 --> 00:54:04,159
heal people they want to understand how

1392
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:05,400
to make it better for people and you

1393
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:08,159
know they want a product that's going to

1394
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:10,240
make people healthy and not sick yes and

1395
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:11,679
that that I feel like that has a certain

1396
00:54:10,239 --> 00:54:13,479
amount of like the Catalyst of the Ros

1397
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:15,879
of fire culture they have a deep Rosa

1398
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:17,240
fire culture there that Still Remains

1399
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:19,039
very true to their roots and their

1400
00:54:17,239 --> 00:54:21,078
beliefs of you know protecting the

1401
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:23,119
Island the island is lost soul forer

1402
00:54:21,079 --> 00:54:25,960
it's the heart of a volcano and so when

1403
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:27,798
I you know in 2021 when I showed up

1404
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:30,039
exactly at that same time it was right

1405
00:54:27,798 --> 00:54:31,559
after the volcanic eruption and the

1406
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:33,480
amount of work that they've done to

1407
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:35,798
redevelop that country I felt even

1408
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:37,880
though it's a British territory they

1409
00:54:35,798 --> 00:54:40,119
really managed to pull out of that and

1410
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:42,680
even the tail end of this last hurricane

1411
00:54:40,119 --> 00:54:45,240
they got those roofs ripped off and you

1412
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:46,838
know Ralph oh yeah Bobby sent me big big

1413
00:54:45,239 --> 00:54:48,919
shout out to Bobby he sent me a lot of

1414
00:54:46,838 --> 00:54:51,119
videos Bob shck what's up Bobby what's

1415
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:53,000
up dude and Ross John you can't go wrong

1416
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:55,318
with Ross John oh [ __ ] yeah dude he's

1417
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,960
the man best best food on the island is

1418
00:54:55,318 --> 00:54:59,719
at Ross John's house oh so good uh the

1419
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:01,318
the shakes are amazing like dude like

1420
00:54:59,719 --> 00:55:03,118
literally some of the best fruit shakes

1421
00:55:01,318 --> 00:55:05,880
I've ever had in my entire life heck

1422
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:07,680
yeah there I love the the fact that we

1423
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:09,358
still can get roasted bananas on the

1424
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:11,199
side of the road you know true

1425
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:13,199
Grassroots culture still lives on these

1426
00:55:11,199 --> 00:55:15,879
islands and big up to all all the

1427
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:17,039
islands from Jamaica Trinidad Barbados

1428
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,519
keep fighting the good fight you're

1429
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:20,880
going to get medical marijuana and

1430
00:55:18,519 --> 00:55:23,639
Recreation going that's going it's going

1431
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:25,519
to like our ability to continue like

1432
00:55:23,639 --> 00:55:27,519
being symbiosis are bringing our

1433
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:30,400
cultures together and dropping all

1434
00:55:27,519 --> 00:55:31,798
racism all you know white black I don't

1435
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,280
care what color you are we're like here

1436
00:55:31,798 --> 00:55:34,519
to work together as a cannabis Community

1437
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:36,440
are you a good person or are you not a

1438
00:55:34,519 --> 00:55:38,440
good person that's it boils down it

1439
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:40,880
should boil down to that right it

1440
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:43,720
[ __ ] or is it not [ __ ] are you

1441
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:45,400
good or are you bad you know it's like

1442
00:55:43,719 --> 00:55:46,959
there's a lot of [ __ ] out there but

1443
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:48,200
there's also a lot of good people

1444
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:50,440
especially within this community there

1445
00:55:48,199 --> 00:55:51,919
are still a lot of good people it's true

1446
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:53,920
and I think that's it BRS out the good

1447
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:56,639

all right with it you know but the thing

1481
00:57:42,719 --> 00:57:46,598
is um it's a refreshing break for a

1482
00:57:44,519 --> 00:57:49,318
festival because normally when you go to

1483
00:57:46,599 --> 00:57:51,798
a festival is um uncomfortably hot yeah

1484
00:57:49,318 --> 00:57:53,558
so this is kind of like on the river you

1485
00:57:51,798 --> 00:57:55,318
reg that was great yeah some of the

1486
00:57:53,559 --> 00:57:57,720
Bands don't even get the good support

00:57:55,318 --> 00:57:59,519
that they need yeah yeah yeah but there

1488

1494
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,519
several times and that was in my opinion

1495
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:18,039
the best performance that he's ever done

1496
00:58:15,519 --> 00:58:22,199
that I've seen yeah man the thing is

1497

loving up the culture but they never

1580
01:01:27,519 --> 01:01:32,559
know that there was a time when you see

1581
01:01:30,519 --> 01:01:34,440
I used to roll on the street if you even

1582

1588
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:53,839
happen we seeds people were arrested for

1589
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:57,039
seeds for for a seed a tail that was

1590
01:01:53,838 --> 01:01:59,838
done and just the 2008 Farm Bill changed

1591
01:01:57,039 --> 01:02:01,400
all that record breaking moment

1592
01:01:59,838 --> 01:02:05,119
something that is extremely special the

1593
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:07,000
2018 farm bill to criminalize seeds and

1594

and Bounds in some ways we still have to

1598
01:02:14,679 --> 01:02:19,118
get more people out of prison yeah but

1599
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,480
that's what the thing is a lot of

1600
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:24,200
people they're they pet PE for not

1601
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:27,880
liking reg music yeah is the fact that

1602
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:32,318
we sing too much about weed but they

1603
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:36,480
don't realize that there was a time when

1604
01:02:32,318 --> 01:02:38,159
your whole livelihood yeah can be gone

1605
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:40,039
for for having weed in your position for

1606
01:02:38,159 --> 01:02:42,118
this plant so that's why we were singing

1607
01:02:40,039 --> 01:02:44,640
like hey it should be legal we should

1608
01:02:42,119 --> 01:02:48,960
it's a [ __ ] plant excuse my language

1609
01:02:44,639 --> 01:02:52,118
yeah why should lose all their Earthly

1610
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:53,920
belongings just because they have a a

1611
01:02:52,119 --> 01:02:56,920
couple grams of a plant in their

1612
01:02:53,920 --> 01:03:01,159
position yeah so that's what reg music

1613
01:02:56,920 --> 01:03:03,519
was all about was freeing the weed for

1614
01:03:01,159 --> 01:03:06,199
people to have it the rights to smoke it

1615
01:03:03,519 --> 01:03:08,278
without being punished and and get

1616
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:10,879
locked up for years that's what

1617
01:03:08,278 --> 01:03:12,960
Freedom's all about right you know from

1618
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:15,160
an American perspective it's about

1619
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:17,039
Freedom right the fre freedom to choose

1620
01:03:15,159 --> 01:03:19,239
to do what we want to do that doesn't

1621
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:22,278
hurt other people how can that be a bad

1622
01:03:19,239 --> 01:03:24,479
thing you know and then we were hip to

1623
01:03:22,278 --> 01:03:27,039
the medicinal purpose of it from way

1624
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:29,000
back too oh yeah Peter TSH was the

1625
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:33,480
greatest advocate for we for sure in the

1626
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:36,440
70s yeah in the in the the 70s the

1627
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:39,318
freaking um the dark era of the dark

1628
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:43,639
dark era yeah yeah yeah we we used we we

1629
01:03:39,318 --> 01:03:46,199
got we got the most chasti and punish

1630
01:03:43,639 --> 01:03:49,558
for weed the the the the government in

1631
01:03:46,199 --> 01:03:52,439
Jamaica back then gave the officers

1632
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:54,640
permission to do whatever they want if

1633
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:56,278
we have that in our position there was a

1634
01:03:54,639 --> 01:03:58,719
time like oh yes

1635
01:03:56,278 --> 01:04:01,798
yeah and the rebellious ones like Peter

1636
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:04,199
T yeah he got beaten next door to death

1637
01:04:01,798 --> 01:04:06,599
for having weed yeah in in his position

1638
01:04:04,199 --> 01:04:11,439
yeah they practice skull he was in the

1639
01:04:06,599 --> 01:04:14,720
hospital in a coma Peter 5446 the song

1640
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:16,240
Right totally that was his his number

1641
01:04:14,719 --> 01:04:19,679
that he got when they locked him up for

1642
01:04:16,239 --> 01:04:22,558
smoking weed so it's like our our

1643
01:04:19,679 --> 01:04:25,558
relationship with weed yeah is like it's

1644
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:27,680
very strong it's very a strong bond we

1645
01:04:25,559 --> 01:04:30,880
we we we smoke it we get the The Vibes

1646
01:04:27,679 --> 01:04:33,000
of it we know the purpose of it and ever

1647
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:35,000
since we've been advocating for the

1648
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:38,318
freedom of weed so the fact that it get

1649
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:41,239
to this point right now is special for

1650
01:04:38,318 --> 01:04:44,199
and a lot of us who advocate for it

1651
01:04:41,239 --> 01:04:46,879
never even live to see yeah that what

1652
01:04:44,199 --> 01:04:48,480
we're seeing now no it's sad sad some of

1653
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:50,318
these Giants dude like we talk about the

1654
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:53,278
Giants from Humble the Giants from

1655
01:04:50,318 --> 01:04:55,960
Jamaica people that really set they

1656
01:04:53,278 --> 01:04:58,838
fought for it they set the pace for what

1657
01:04:55,960 --> 01:05:00,079
is happening now oh so long ago and it's

1658
01:04:58,838 --> 01:05:02,358
just so special to be alive and

1659
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:04,200
experience all this you know and in our

1660
01:05:02,358 --> 01:05:06,798
own ways we're all stewards of the plant

1661
01:05:04,199 --> 01:05:10,038
right so like I do interviews and I do

1662
01:05:06,798 --> 01:05:12,400
my podcast yeah and I do uh my breeding

1663
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:14,400
book and I create genetics and you you

1664
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:16,160
sing about advocacy oh yes man you know

1665
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:17,880
we got all these musicians and we all

1666
01:05:16,159 --> 01:05:19,239
play this role in a much bigger thing

1667
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:21,798
and it's such a beautiful thing to be a

1668
01:05:19,239 --> 01:05:25,759
part of and and this is the the the

1669
01:05:21,798 --> 01:05:28,559
fruits of all that yeah I can walk into

1670
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:29,960
a a a a a festival and saw people have

1671
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:35,039
the freedom to

1672
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:37,838
smoke and sell and promote yeah weed

1673
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:39,240
without have to be looking around like

1674
01:05:37,838 --> 01:05:41,440
it's a plan and it makes the world a

1675
01:05:39,239 --> 01:05:42,919
better place right at the end of the day

1676
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:45,838
cannabis makes the world a better place

1677
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:49,278
of course and to deny people that is

1678
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:50,838
just silly for one thing but it's like

1679
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:52,199
we all have a role and our purpose we

1680
01:05:50,838 --> 01:05:53,960
were talking a little bit of that before

1681
01:05:52,199 --> 01:05:55,639
the interview about our purpose and you

1682
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:57,199
know I feel like I'm pretty blessed

1683
01:05:55,639 --> 01:05:59,920
blessed because I feel like I found my

1684
01:05:57,199 --> 01:06:01,798
purpose and as a steward of the plant as

1685
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:04,559
a you know a higher calling or whatever

1686
01:06:01,798 --> 01:06:06,400
you want to call it you know I feel like

1687
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:07,559
I'm blessed to know where I'm supposed

1688
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:09,639
to be in the world and doing what I'm

1689
01:06:07,559 --> 01:06:11,440
supposed to be I feel like most of my

1690
01:06:09,639 --> 01:06:14,078
friends that are reggae singers or

1691
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:15,720
musicians they know the same thing yes

1692
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:18,960
and and that's that's that's the beauty

1693
01:06:15,719 --> 01:06:22,000
about um the music and the people who

1694
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:23,880
embrace the culture and The Vibes yeah

1695
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,480
we're all on the same page you know

1696
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:28,680
people we're all about

1697
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:31,760
making the world a better place right

1698
01:06:28,679 --> 01:06:35,399
and like you know living in harmony with

1699
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:37,079
the Earth the plants and all the things

1700
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:39,358
yeah and the relationship between it all

1701
01:06:37,079 --> 01:06:41,760
cuz there's this symbiotic relationship

1702
01:06:39,358 --> 01:06:44,598
between the plant and everything around

1703
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:48,319
it yes bro and there is something

1704
01:06:44,599 --> 01:06:52,640
special about this plan yeah and we need

1705
01:06:48,318 --> 01:06:56,558
to know that not we need to know that we

1706
01:06:52,639 --> 01:06:59,759
know that now yeah because there isn't

1707
01:06:56,559 --> 01:07:03,240
one person in the world right now that

1708
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:05,119
don't know the medicinal purpose not

1709
01:07:03,239 --> 01:07:06,639
just for the high because that's all

1710
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:09,119
they they used to chastise us and

1711
01:07:06,639 --> 01:07:11,558
crucify us for is the high but look how

1712
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:14,278
much things there's so much more under

1713
01:07:11,559 --> 01:07:16,119
that there's so much one can one plant

1714
01:07:14,278 --> 01:07:17,679
can do so many different things we have

1715
01:07:16,119 --> 01:07:19,680
all these different medicines to cure

1716
01:07:17,679 --> 01:07:21,558
these things that Canabis can cure

1717
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:23,358
potentially right and maybe it's not

1718
01:07:21,559 --> 01:07:25,160
that way with every person every time

1719
01:07:23,358 --> 01:07:26,480
because the Cannabis is subjective to

1720
01:07:25,159 --> 01:07:28,078
the indiv ually have different body

1721
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:30,079
chemistries it depends on what you're

1722
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:31,798
going through and but if it can cure a

1723
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:33,599
child of epilepsy how can you say it's a

1724
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:36,838
bad thing exactly that's that's my big

1725
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:39,798
argument and then the fact that it was

1726
01:07:36,838 --> 01:07:42,558
being so criminalized just for the fact

1727
01:07:39,798 --> 01:07:45,719
that it make you high right that was

1728
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:49,000
just well beer makes you I know what the

1729
01:07:45,719 --> 01:07:50,480
problem is Right tobacco alcohol what

1730
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,920
they do is they tune you out they make

1731
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:54,278
you numb to the world you know there's a

1732
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:56,880
lot of drugs they make you numb to the

1733
01:07:54,278 --> 01:07:58,358
world what can Tunes you in right

1734
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:00,640
mushrooms they tune you in psyched dos

1735
01:07:58,358 --> 01:08:02,719
they tune you in and so people are

1736
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:05,078
scared of that right of people being

1737
01:08:02,719 --> 01:08:06,879
tuned in and so that's partially why

1738
01:08:05,079 --> 01:08:09,640
they're illegal right there there's so

1739
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:11,559
much more to that but as far as I like

1740
01:08:09,639 --> 01:08:13,960
being tuned in I would much rather be

1741
01:08:11,559 --> 01:08:16,319
tuned into the world around me and being

1742
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:18,480
you know very sensitive to everything

1743
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:20,359
than to be numb you know who wants to be

1744
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:22,639
numb and go through that you know and I

1745
01:08:20,359 --> 01:08:24,159
think struggle is important I feel like

1746
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:25,759
I've struggled through my life you've

1747
01:08:24,158 --> 01:08:27,358
probably had struggles through yours and

1748
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:29,119
struggle makes us better and stronger

1749
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:31,079
people right and it also makes us

1750
01:08:29,119 --> 01:08:33,079
realize when we're fortunate and we have

1751
01:08:31,079 --> 01:08:34,880
good fortune how important that is oh my

1752
01:08:33,079 --> 01:08:36,880
goodness yeah if you if you don't

1753
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:38,679
struggle then you don't appreciate when

1754
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:40,119
you when you when you have success

1755
01:08:38,679 --> 01:08:42,640
reggae music was built through struggle

1756
01:08:40,119 --> 01:08:44,318
in the 70s circling back to all that you

1757
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:46,400
know it's like that was built on

1758
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:47,798
struggle but um the the the reason for

1759
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:50,318
regga

1760
01:08:47,798 --> 01:08:55,560
was when you're poor you don't have a

1761
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:58,000
voice yeah so the system does not care

1762
01:08:55,560 --> 01:09:01,359
about the people who don't have a voice

1763
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:03,838
so in order for us to have a voice we

1764
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:06,159
have to sing because that's the only way

1765
01:09:03,838 --> 01:09:09,000
you can get the attention of both the

1766
01:09:06,158 --> 01:09:10,679
audience and the government because once

1767
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:13,479
you sing something that makes sense the

1768
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:16,158
people are going to Le on to it look

1769
01:09:13,479 --> 01:09:17,759
at government listen oh they got to

1770
01:09:16,158 --> 01:09:19,559
listen at a certain point they have to

1771
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:22,319
listen yeah because once the people is

1772
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:23,640
like yeah that song is telling the truth

1773
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:25,600
and then they start play it every day

1774
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:27,679
and everybody the mindset of the people

1775
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:29,920
start right like that there's a singer

1776
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:32,119

1777

a song right oh yeah I know Richie Spice

1778
01:09:32,119 --> 01:09:36,519
for sure the song called R red yeah yeah

1779
01:09:34,838 --> 01:09:39,318
that song was recorded like six years

1780
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:41,759
prior to it it becoming successful what

1781
01:09:39,319 --> 01:09:44,319
happened is the the the situation that

1782
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:46,359
he was singing about actually happened

1783
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:48,679
like a bunch of people just die in one

1784
01:09:46,359 --> 01:09:50,120
week over politics yeah and then a DJ

1785
01:09:48,679 --> 01:09:52,119
pick up the song and be like Earth run

1786
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:53,679
red and start playing and the whole

1787
01:09:52,119 --> 01:09:56,158
thing just blew up like Collective

1788
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:58,119
Consciousness everybody gets on that's

1789
01:09:56,158 --> 01:10:00,679
that's what reg music do we always try

1790
01:09:58,119 --> 01:10:03,119
to shine a light on what's Happening

1791
01:10:00,679 --> 01:10:05,319
yeah and then the song will make the

1792
01:10:03,119 --> 01:10:07,880
people like start look at it because

1793
01:10:05,319 --> 01:10:09,759
you'll be in in Oakland yeah you

1794
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:12,119
wouldn't know what happen here in hum

1795
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:13,920
right but if a song is sung about it and

1796
01:10:12,119 --> 01:10:15,920
then the song start playing everybody

1797
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:18,279
everybody's like oh [ __ ] actually is

1798
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:20,279

Jamaica is really like that and he's

1802
01:10:24,359 --> 01:10:30,519
like yeah bro you got to be careful you

1803
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:32,640
do it's not like all club sers and Beach

1804
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:34,080
rough part of it it's rough there is a

1805
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:37,760
rough side there's a rough side to all

1806
01:10:34,079 --> 01:10:40,800
of it so music is reg music to be to be

1807
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:44,119
exact yeah other music have their roots

1808
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:47,279
and their thing but reg for sure was

1809
01:10:44,119 --> 01:10:49,359
created on the fact that we want to make

1810
01:10:47,279 --> 01:10:53,158
the people know what's happening around

1811
01:10:49,359 --> 01:10:56,399
us yeah so every song has a meaning it

1812
01:10:53,158 --> 01:10:58,079
was built on a a a a reason why the song

1813
01:10:56,399 --> 01:11:00,839
was made there's greater meaning behind

1814
01:10:58,079 --> 01:11:02,640
all of it yeah there's no regular song

1815
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:05,159
If it's even about pointing a finger on

1816
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:08,039
Hunger pointing a finger and Injustice

1817
01:11:05,158 --> 01:11:10,119
but the song is always about something

1818
01:11:08,039 --> 01:11:12,279
it's it's just not there is purpose

1819
01:11:10,119 --> 01:11:14,719

01:15:05,319 --> 01:15:09,359
amazing musicians from the Atlanta area

1923
01:15:07,439 --> 01:15:11,399
and he's going to put on a hell of a

1924
01:15:09,359 --> 01:15:14,759
show it's going to be great I'm super

1925
01:15:11,399 --> 01:15:17,719
excited I hope they play some uh some

1926
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:19,480
contributions to the dead you know I

1927
01:15:17,719 --> 01:15:20,760
feel like I don't know what to expect

1928
01:15:19,479 --> 01:15:22,919
from that I I don't know either I have

1929
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:26,079
no idea but I would love to see

1930
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:28,199
some Grateful Dead Tunes being played in

1931
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:30,399
in oo's version because seeing him with

1932
01:15:28,198 --> 01:15:34,119
dead in company was always amazing I saw

1933
01:15:30,399 --> 01:15:35,719
him sing in San Francisco and he also

1934
01:15:34,119 --> 01:15:37,599
has a great voice and just a great

1935
01:15:35,719 --> 01:15:39,800
energy I love watching him perform too

1936
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:42,280
he's just so in tune with the music and

1937
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:44,279
I love that uh you know as dead in

1938
01:15:42,279 --> 01:15:47,279
company the last couple years have been

1939
01:15:44,279 --> 01:15:49,198
mindblowing uh really great and really

1940
01:15:47,279 --> 01:15:51,079
beautiful and being able to see him and

1941
01:15:49,198 --> 01:15:52,759
do his thing here is going to be really

1942
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:54,439
special tomorrow I'm really looking

1943
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:56,800
forward to it and I think the area is

1944
01:15:54,439 --> 01:15:58,279
really hyped for that sort of music and

1945
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:59,719
it's been a long time since we've had

1946
01:15:58,279 --> 01:16:01,399
this sort of event here on the water

1947
01:15:59,719 --> 01:16:03,480

1953
01:16:11,719 --> 01:16:16,158
people I love this type of thing and uh

1954
01:16:14,639 --> 01:16:18,159

today absolutely so you guys have some

2178
01:24:47,039 --> 01:24:53,039
special strains that you guys have

2179
01:24:49,238 --> 01:24:54,000
worked on and created over the years um

2180
01:24:53,039 --> 01:24:55,479
and let's talk about the world of

2181
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:59,560
genetics how do you feel about the

2182
01:24:55,479 --> 01:24:59,559
current trends in genetics available to

2183
01:25:00,679 --> 01:25:07,158
Consumers yeah um you

2184
01:25:04,479 --> 01:25:08,799
know I don't I don't consume a ton of

2185
01:25:07,158 --> 01:25:11,638
cannabis but the biggest complaint that

2186
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:13,560
I that I'm hearing from people is that

2187
01:25:11,639 --> 01:25:15,520
um all the strains are the same they all

2188
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:17,679
taste the same whether or not they're

2189
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:20,679
crossed to one another and still have

2190
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:21,960
the same flavor um I think it's think

2191
01:25:20,679 --> 01:25:23,480
it's starting to get a little bit old

2192
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:26,039
for them and so they're really always in

2193
01:25:23,479 --> 01:25:28,519
the hunt for these new Legacy genetics

2194
01:25:26,039 --> 01:25:30,479
and along with that maybe not with the

2195
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:32,920
the flavor of the taste they're looking

2196
01:25:30,479 --> 01:25:35,839
for a story to accompany the strains are

2197
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:37,679
about to put in their body yeah yeah

2198
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:40,400
know I agree totally I think it's uh

2199
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:42,520
there's a lot of the same and I think

2200
01:25:40,399 --> 01:25:45,079
it's really helping us you know our

2201
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:47,480
small craft Farmers shine is uh having

2202
01:25:45,079 --> 01:25:50,559
our own genetics and you know coming up

2203
01:25:47,479 --> 01:25:53,519
with new flavors um preferably you know

2204
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:56,400
like I like gas and now I'm coming out

2205
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:58,920
with you know gas it's like this uh OG

2206
01:25:56,399 --> 01:26:01,399
chem times Lance which is over there at

2207
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:04,158
the Redwood root booth and it's it's

2208
01:26:01,399 --> 01:26:06,158
super fire and it's really strong um and

2209
01:26:04,158 --> 01:26:08,519
then you know another thing with these

2210
01:26:06,158 --> 01:26:11,960
flavors is now we're starting to get to

2211
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:14,440
play with searching for rosin and so

2212
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:16,079
whole another whole other topic but well

2213
01:26:14,439 --> 01:26:18,000
you guys have amazing rosin that comes

2214
01:26:16,079 --> 01:26:20,840
off of both your flowers uh White Thorn

2215
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:22,679
Rose some of my favorite and you got the

2216
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:25,000
Lance and the Ridgeline runs that I feel

2217
01:26:22,679 --> 01:26:27,719
are both extremely special

2218
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:29,520
uh so now as far as are you guys

2219
01:26:27,719 --> 01:26:33,520
breeding for rosin

2220
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:36,080
currently I mean obviously yeah I'm you

2221
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:38,520
know somehow ended up breeding for rosin

2222
01:26:36,079 --> 01:26:41,198
and and finding that area of the

2223
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:43,679
Cannabis industry different something

2224
01:26:41,198 --> 01:26:46,000
new for me to be excited about always

2225
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:49,199
grew was a flower guy and always really

2226
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:51,800
bred for flower and lo and behold you

2227
01:26:49,198 --> 01:26:54,238
know with help from the hash Community

2228
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:56,279
really found out that maybe I should be

2229
01:26:54,238 --> 01:26:59,079
eing for hash because it's it's a better

2230
01:26:56,279 --> 01:27:02,238
hash um flower than it is a flower

2231
01:26:59,079 --> 01:27:05,719
flower so um started doing that and

2232
01:27:02,238 --> 01:27:09,359
exploring that and um finding some some

2233

2263
01:28:52,719 --> 01:28:57,719
people I've seen more amazing flow this

2264
01:28:55,238 --> 01:29:00,839
this weekend that I have all year uh

2265
01:28:57,719 --> 01:29:02,439
wild stuff man such diversity when you

2266
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:04,000
come up into humble as opposed to some

2267
01:29:02,439 --> 01:29:06,198
of the Cities I go to where it's like

2268
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:08,079
really focused on living CH a lot of

2269
01:29:06,198 --> 01:29:09,960
runs and like a lot of the stuff is just

2270
01:29:08,079 --> 01:29:11,960
spin-offs of that up here you get a

2271
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:13,840
little bit of everything you get some

2272
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:16,319
some wild stuff man I'm seeing some land

2273
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:17,840
race genetics I'm seeing some stuff

2274
01:29:16,319 --> 01:29:19,519
that's worked by different breeders

2275
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:21,279
that's definitely an expression that's

2276
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:23,040
their own and I love that yeah you can

2277
01:29:21,279 --> 01:29:24,800
tell there's definitely a difference in

2278
01:29:23,039 --> 01:29:27,118
NorCal home

2279
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:28,679
like this whole are is weed and even

2280
01:29:27,118 --> 01:29:30,759
even just down in Emerald I saw you down

2281
01:29:28,679 --> 01:29:35,199
in Emerald earlier in the month and it

2282
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:37,199
was uh completely different vibe event

2283
01:29:35,198 --> 01:29:38,759
everything man and I love that too right

2284
01:29:37,198 --> 01:29:40,638
but this is definitely different vibe up

2285
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:42,159
here the weed is has a different vibe up

2286
01:29:40,639 --> 01:29:44,199
here yeah yeah you can you can you can

2287
01:29:42,158 --> 01:29:46,279
feel the love in it out here man it's a

2288
01:29:44,198 --> 01:29:49,678
beautiful thing man I think this uh this

2289
01:29:46,279 --> 01:29:51,800
community and this culture is uh really

2290
01:29:49,679 --> 01:29:53,880
the backbone of cannabis in North

2291
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:55,560
America and a lot of parts around the

2292
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:57,159
world world you you tell people you're

2293
01:29:55,560 --> 01:30:00,639
from homeold it doesn't matter if you're

2294
01:29:57,158 --> 01:30:02,198
in Australia they know okay like you

2295
01:30:00,639 --> 01:30:03,880
guys know what you're talking about if

2296
01:30:02,198 --> 01:30:05,559
it's weed you guys get it yeah yeah yeah

2297
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:07,000
yeah it's a beautiful thing man so tell

2298
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:09,679
me about yourself what do you do how

2299
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:11,600
long you been doing it so man like I uh

2300
01:30:09,679 --> 01:30:14,399
I've been cultivating in the midwest

2301
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:17,520
since like the mid90s back in 1994 is

2302
01:30:14,399 --> 01:30:21,279
when I started cultivating and uh you

2303
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:24,000
know it's been a it's a Outlaw life for

2304
01:30:21,279 --> 01:30:26,158
a very long time yeah we you know it's

2305
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:28,399
unlike here where it was more celebrated

2306
01:30:26,158 --> 01:30:30,839
we were we really had to keep things

2307
01:30:28,399 --> 01:30:33,359
like Hush Hush we had to live this like

2308
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:36,760
crazy lifestyle to even to live the way

2309
01:30:33,359 --> 01:30:39,079
we wanted to you know so I've been um

2310
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:43,560
about 15 years ago I started my I did my

2311
01:30:39,079 --> 01:30:46,960
first breeding project and uh I uh was

2312
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:49,800
like okay this is this is I have I I

2313
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:51,439
really like unique things so I was like

2314
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:53,159
let me try to combine some things

2315
01:30:51,439 --> 01:30:56,759
together and see what I can really do

2316
01:30:53,158 --> 01:30:58,279
with it and then uh after that I

2317
01:30:56,760 --> 01:31:01,280
traveled across the United States

2318
01:30:58,279 --> 01:31:03,399
working in other legal systems and uh

2319
01:31:01,279 --> 01:31:05,399
Missouri finally went uh medical and

2320
01:31:03,399 --> 01:31:08,799
wreck and I came back home and I was

2321
01:31:05,399 --> 01:31:10,960
like now let's really focus in on making

2322
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:13,279
some special unique things that the

2323
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:15,760
market doesn't have you know what are

2324
01:31:13,279 --> 01:31:17,198
the genetics like out there you know we

2325
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:21,159
we have a lot of the genetics that

2326
01:31:17,198 --> 01:31:24,439
everybody's growing you know

2327
01:31:21,158 --> 01:31:26,759
but I'm old school still so I I love

2328
01:31:24,439 --> 01:31:29,399
these old flavors these old expressions

2329
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:32,159
and I like one of the goals I was having

2330
01:31:29,399 --> 01:31:34,519
in all my breeding projects is how can I

2331
01:31:32,158 --> 01:31:37,238
marry the old school with this new

2332
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:39,639
school structure and uh make it

2333
01:31:37,238 --> 01:31:42,198
prevalent now and uh that's what I've

2334
01:31:39,639 --> 01:31:43,840
really kind of been focusing on is uh

2335
01:31:42,198 --> 01:31:46,238
making some special unique things that

2336
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:47,719
not everybody else is making right you

2337
01:31:46,238 --> 01:31:50,839
know and it's uh so what are your

2338
01:31:47,719 --> 01:31:52,760
favorite kind of things to work with uh

2339
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:54,960
you know I just did uh one of my real

2340
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:58,199
like the last project I did did was uh I

2341
01:31:54,960 --> 01:32:00,760
used an NL Afghani that was like it it

2342
01:31:58,198 --> 01:32:03,158
was as close to the old school NL that I

2343
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:05,039
could really do and I uh I cross it in

2344
01:32:03,158 --> 01:32:07,439
with some of my flavors that I've made

2345
01:32:05,039 --> 01:32:10,079
and some other popular flavors around

2346
01:32:07,439 --> 01:32:12,638
and U I have a a liquid Sunshine's one

2347
01:32:10,079 --> 01:32:15,920
of them which I did with uh my mimosa

2350
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:24,360
the new school but like this peppery

like punch from that NL Afghani uh and

2352
01:32:24,359 --> 01:32:29,399

2442
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:56,158
beautiful thing to see sit down with

2444
01:35:56,158 --> 01:36:02,198
same drive for for this plant and it's

2445
01:35:59,719 --> 01:36:04,520
uh the amount of people that you can

2446
01:36:02,198 --> 01:36:06,519

2447
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:08,520
help support their families and all this

2448
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:10,679
stuff is a it's it's been a real it's

2449
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:13,119
been a real blessing it's great because

2450
01:36:10,679 --> 01:36:15,679
I feel like we we're making the world a

2451
01:36:13,118 --> 01:36:18,000
better place on so many levels and to be

2452
01:36:15,679 --> 01:36:20,359
part of a community that's doing that

2453
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:23,279
it's like this this greater Collective

2454
01:36:20,359 --> 01:36:25,079
Consciousness and we're ever evolving

2455
01:36:23,279 --> 01:36:26,800
and as as long as we're still aware that

2456
01:36:25,079 --> 01:36:28,600
that's the end goal is to make the world

2457
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:30,360
a better place you do a lot of good

2458
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:32,800
that's that's that's like one of my

2459
01:36:30,359 --> 01:36:34,839
slogans is Mo love you know it's like

2460
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:38,000
that's you you you know we we got to

2461
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:39,800
spread this love and it's uh it

2462
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:43,198
sometimes I think it gets lost in this

2463
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:45,760
legality system it does and like money

2464
01:36:43,198 --> 01:36:48,319
can get confused with passion and all

2465
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:50,119
these other things and passion needs to

2466
01:36:48,319 --> 01:36:51,639
be the passion and the passion for money

2467
01:36:50,118 --> 01:36:54,158
is definitely like if that's your

2468
01:36:51,639 --> 01:36:56,480
passion probably the cannabis IND is the

2469
01:36:54,158 --> 01:36:57,799
best place right yeah not right now you

2470
01:36:56,479 --> 01:36:59,479
know what I'm saying but I also believe

2471
01:36:57,800 --> 01:37:01,159
man if you do what you really love and

2472
01:36:59,479 --> 01:37:02,399
you put your heart and your soul into it

2473
01:37:01,158 --> 01:37:04,079
man everything is going to work itself

2474
01:37:02,399 --> 01:37:06,559
everything yeah everything comes through

2475
01:37:04,079 --> 01:37:08,519
it's like that's what it is dude like if

2476
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:09,800
you can really put everything into it

2477
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:11,760
and give it up for the plan I mean at

2478
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:15,039
the end of day we're just stewards for a

2479
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:16,520
greater plan a greater cause right and

2480
01:37:15,039 --> 01:37:17,399

2545
01:39:30,359 --> 01:39:33,279
concerned that I ended up with I would

2546
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:35,158
end up with all the mosquitoes in my

2547
01:39:33,279 --> 01:39:36,479
booth cuz we have I have a I have one of

2548
01:39:35,158 --> 01:39:38,519
those Vector fly lights I didn't plug it

2549
01:39:36,479 --> 01:39:39,879
in but I was thinking about doing that

2550
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:41,239
plugging it in seriously you should go

2551
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:43,319
on the other side and plug it in to

2552
01:39:41,238 --> 01:39:44,718
attract all of them away from us yes

2553
01:39:43,319 --> 01:39:47,158
exactly dude it's a nightmare I mean the

2554
01:39:44,719 --> 01:39:48,760
mosquitoes are the only problem out of

2555
01:39:47,158 --> 01:39:49,799
this whole place yesterday yesterday I'd

2556
01:39:48,760 --> 01:39:51,560
say it was worse cuz there was so much

2557
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:54,239
humidity around

2558
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:55,800
it all day we had yesterday all day

2559
01:39:54,238 --> 01:39:57,118
yesterday yeah but not today it seems

2560
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:59,400
like a a little bit better but I have

2561
01:39:57,118 --> 01:40:00,759
like 20 bites yeah some people too some

2562
01:39:59,399 --> 01:40:03,960
some people attract mosquitoes more than

2563
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:06,280
other people cuz a sticky trap jacket oh

2564
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:08,158
I should you knowell jacket where you

2565
01:40:06,279 --> 01:40:10,319
could have removable sleeves for the

2566
01:40:08,158 --> 01:40:12,158
sticky traps on your arms oh yeah that's

2567
01:40:10,319 --> 01:40:13,759
a good idea actually and put the lights

2568
01:40:12,158 --> 01:40:16,079
under the armpits maybe yeah you know

2569
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:17,599
what that's a good idea yeah if nothing

2570
01:40:16,079 --> 01:40:18,920
else you could have a cool novelty

2571
01:40:17,599 --> 01:40:21,800
jacket yeah I won't even need a booth I

2572
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:24,760
can just walk around on my my jacket get

2573
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:26,800

of the best weed in the world this

2592
01:40:58,079 --> 01:41:03,439
weekend especially for early finishers

2593
01:41:00,399 --> 01:41:04,960
so a lot of my focus has been on

2594
01:41:03,439 --> 01:41:06,719
breeding for effect over the last couple

2595
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:09,639
months but like really early finishers

2596
01:41:06,719 --> 01:41:11,118
is so important yeah and a place like

2597
01:41:09,639 --> 01:41:12,760
this we are in the beginning of

2598
01:41:11,118 --> 01:41:14,960
September and there's finished flower

01:41:12,760 --> 01:41:17,520
here dude I love that that's a good

2600
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:19,760
point too nor never in history did have

2601
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:22,480
I seen so much early finishers in one

2602
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:24,119
place dude it's like you finished flower

dude that's ready to go it's like wow

2604
01:41:24,118 --> 01:41:28,960

2605
01:41:26,399 --> 01:41:31,079
so true huh yeah I know it's uh yeah

2606
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:32,800
it's not just it's varieties but also

2607
01:41:31,079 --> 01:41:34,439
with the depth too and all that light

2608
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:35,639
assist for sure there's a ton of all

2609

2617
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:52,920
looking weed too I've seen some gnarly

2618
01:41:50,198 --> 01:41:54,399
landr stuff and some really cool stuff

2619

that's been breed locally where they're

2620
01:41:54,399 --> 01:41:58,118
breeding with like genetics that most

2621
01:41:55,960 --> 01:41:59,359
people wouldn't [ __ ] with even yeah and

2622
01:41:58,118 --> 01:42:01,319
you were telling me you had some like 10

2623
01:41:59,359 --> 01:42:03,118
pre-rolled already huh we do we have 10

2624
01:42:01,319 --> 01:42:05,880
big monster joints left I no I had like

2625
01:42:03,118 --> 01:42:07,559
20 this morning oh you did yeah 3.5 G

2628
01:42:10,439 --> 01:42:18,039
we've got some Skittles we've got some

2629
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:20,560
zetopia I rolled up some coffin candy

2630
01:42:18,039 --> 01:42:22,880
from shout out to planta that coffin

2631
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:25,199
candy and that rs1 I saved those jars

2632
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:26,880
for you're so epic dude oh man that

2633
01:42:25,198 --> 01:42:28,479
sounds great I got to try that for sure

2634
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:30,199
so much good stuff and Super Silver we

2635
01:42:28,479 --> 01:42:32,000
got the super silver smoking on a lot of

2636
01:42:30,198 --> 01:42:33,678
that super silver it's super delicious

2637
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:35,960
you know I had I had a super I had a

2638
01:42:33,679 --> 01:42:38,520
super silver that came to me um well

2639
01:42:35,960 --> 01:42:40,359
that's what we were calling it um but

2640
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:42,800
all I know is that this sucker would

2641
01:42:40,359 --> 01:42:43,960
finish hard at 7 weeks yeah that's not

2642
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:45,279
super silver yeah I know and it was

2643
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:46,880
weird that was I'm saying that was weird

2644
01:42:45,279 --> 01:42:49,639
cuz Super Silver Haze obviously is a

2645
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:51,400
haze it's a long strain so whatever we

2646
01:42:49,639 --> 01:42:53,279
had but it had like that the nose like

2647
01:42:51,399 --> 01:42:55,118
that and the look yeah most of them are

2648
01:42:53,279 --> 01:42:56,279
like a seven we or that's yeah it was a

2649
01:42:55,118 --> 01:42:58,158
weird it was a random thing that went

2650
01:42:56,279 --> 01:43:00,319
around for a little while um and so you

2651
01:42:58,158 --> 01:43:02,399
know we were doing tricks like um we

2652
01:43:00,319 --> 01:43:04,799
were trying to finish faster you know

2653
01:43:02,399 --> 01:43:06,879
try try to get the ROI going for sure

2654
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:08,400
and so we we uh tried out this technique

2655
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:10,359
where you shut the lights off for 36

2656
01:43:08,399 --> 01:43:12,638
hours you know that one to trigger it

2657
01:43:10,359 --> 01:43:14,598
into flower force it into flour I mean I

2658
01:43:12,639 --> 01:43:16,679
may do something similar yeah yeah okay

2659
01:43:14,599 --> 01:43:17,520
so you're already there yeah yeah yeah

2660
01:43:16,679 --> 01:43:18,719
yeah and then we were you know but then

2661
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:20,440
we have to nurse it back to health real

2662
01:43:18,719 --> 01:43:22,399
quick you know cuz it does shock it a

2663
01:43:20,439 --> 01:43:24,198
little bit well dude it's a great way to

2664
01:43:22,399 --> 01:43:25,638
D like be able to sex your plants faster

2665
01:43:24,198 --> 01:43:28,079
that's the best way you know it's like

2666
01:43:25,639 --> 01:43:30,760
giving them that that short Brooks thank

2667
01:43:28,079 --> 01:43:32,359
you for that tip many years ago but uh

2668
01:43:30,760 --> 01:43:33,800
yeah if you you flash them with the

2669
01:43:32,359 --> 01:43:36,359
darkness you leave them in the dark for

2670
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:37,800
a bit it definitely will make them

2671
01:43:36,359 --> 01:43:39,839
yellow out a little bit go into flower a

2672
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:42,560
little faster you'll be able to do CH

2673
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:45,079
expression whether it's male or female

2674
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:47,520
yep yeah exactly what's the best thing

2675
01:43:45,079 --> 01:43:50,639
you've seen this weekend genetics wise

2676
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:53,119
um you know actually some

2677
01:43:50,639 --> 01:43:54,960

forbidden and cherya and I go back 25

2720
01:46:25,880 --> 01:46:31,359

it's special I love seeing special stuff

2723
01:46:33,479 --> 01:46:36,959
that's a little bit different that's the

2724
01:46:35,198 --> 01:46:38,439
beauty of coming up to Humble too you

2725
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:40,319
see stuff that's different I'm from the

2726
01:46:38,439 --> 01:46:41,879
bay so we see a lot of the same stuff

2727
01:46:40,319 --> 01:46:43,439
coming up here you're getting all these

2728
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:45,679
different expressions and it's just such

2729
01:46:43,439 --> 01:46:47,719
an amazing thing when you got guys

2730
01:46:45,679 --> 01:46:50,199
sharing seeds and sharing genetics and

2731
01:46:47,719 --> 01:46:54,158
also looking for diversity yeah and

2732
01:46:50,198 --> 01:46:59,039
she's um way back in her history in um

2733
01:46:54,158 --> 01:47:01,598
2002 on Maui she left Maui in an hp13

2734
01:46:59,039 --> 01:47:03,599
Bud the seeds the continuity of her of

2735
01:47:01,599 --> 01:47:07,119
my notes that go back 25 years on the

2736
01:47:03,599 --> 01:47:10,000
cherya and the hp13 was an osaman

2737
01:47:07,118 --> 01:47:12,598
dominant variety and it was legendary

2738
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:15,238
and so it's um and the HP no matter what

2739
01:47:12,599 --> 01:47:17,199
you did with it you you throw it in a

2740
01:47:15,238 --> 01:47:19,559
horrible room you leave it in your car

2741
01:47:17,198 --> 01:47:21,319
in your backpack for 6 months you pull

2742
01:47:19,560 --> 01:47:23,080
that butt out and you know which one it

2743
01:47:21,319 --> 01:47:25,439
is

2744
01:47:23,079 --> 01:47:27,880
same way she's just herself she's here

2745
01:47:25,439 --> 01:47:29,399
to be here yeah for sure and I love

2746
01:47:27,880 --> 01:47:30,960
those Unique Express white Thorn Rose

2747
01:47:29,399 --> 01:47:32,679
was another one I got to experience last

2748
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:33,920
year that I thought was extremely

2749
01:47:32,679 --> 01:47:36,840
special for

2750
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:38,359
me and also breeding for effect you know

2751
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:40,360
I think there's a lot of guys up here

2752
01:47:38,359 --> 01:47:42,000
where most people are looking for

2753
01:47:40,359 --> 01:47:43,519
something that has bag appeal and that

2754
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:46,039
tastes good up here we're talking about

2755
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:48,280
effect a lot more yes well what always

2756
01:47:46,039 --> 01:47:50,760
informed our breeding decisions was how

2757
01:47:48,279 --> 01:47:52,960
it hit people in our community and how

2758
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:54,880
it grew in the field like how much

2759
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:56,920
processing it had to take and stuff like

2760
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:59,000
this so it was always effect based and

2761
01:47:56,920 --> 01:48:01,679
now in the legal Market we're moving

2762
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:04,399
towards a COA where some guys will only

2763
01:48:01,679 --> 01:48:06,880
test it for THC to see if it's a keeper

2764
01:48:04,399 --> 01:48:08,359
or not that's so silly right not you're

2765
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:10,079
not getting the whole picture at all in

2766
01:48:08,359 --> 01:48:11,479
fact you're getting a very little part

2767
01:48:10,079 --> 01:48:13,399
of the picture because there's so much

2768
01:48:11,479 --> 01:48:15,919
more than THC especially when we talk

2769
01:48:13,399 --> 01:48:17,439
about tpin right so throwing these

2770
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:19,000
turpine profiles and now we're getting

2771
01:48:17,439 --> 01:48:21,279
into flavorant that's a new thing

2772
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:23,198
abstract Tech wrote those white papers

2773
01:48:21,279 --> 01:48:25,639
last year I Incorporated my my breeding

2774
01:48:23,198 --> 01:48:27,399
book but I think moving the plant

2775
01:48:25,639 --> 01:48:29,359
forward you know they're doing a great

2776
01:48:27,399 --> 01:48:32,198
job of it and having these conversations

2777
01:48:29,359 --> 01:48:34,920
and really documenting facts as opposed

2778
01:48:32,198 --> 01:48:37,839
to just Theory I think it's great yeah I

2779
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:40,920
asked people in the last like year to

2780
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:43,159
describe cannabis diversity to me and

2781
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:46,319
how do you describe it and also describe

2782
01:48:43,158 --> 01:48:48,479
potency to me all the smokers wrote back

2783
01:48:46,319 --> 01:48:51,158
how it hits bro how long it lasts what

2784
01:48:48,479 --> 01:48:53,919
kind of high it is the lab guy says

2785
01:48:51,158 --> 01:48:56,079
potency is the sum of V can ammonoids

2786
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:57,800
tpin and other chemicals that's a

2787
01:48:56,079 --> 01:49:00,319
potency test

2788
01:48:57,800 --> 01:49:02,199
right yeah well and it's funny cuz like

2789
01:49:00,319 --> 01:49:03,759
pheno hunting if you just use the lab

2790
01:49:02,198 --> 01:49:06,678
you're never going to find the winners

2791
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:09,840
no exactly and from

2792
01:49:06,679 --> 01:49:11,319
a paper perspective or from a scientific

2793
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:13,560
approach a lot of guys think oh yeah

2794
01:49:11,319 --> 01:49:16,118
yeah we can look at this on paper or

2795
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:17,960
this this is and it's supporting data I

2796
01:49:16,118 --> 01:49:20,198
like right to but at the end of the day

2797
01:49:17,960 --> 01:49:22,800
it's your nose the nose nose yeah and

2798
01:49:20,198 --> 01:49:26,678
then the smoke like we um we tagged

2799
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:28,880
about 74 plants out of 480 or so in the

2800
01:49:26,679 --> 01:49:30,679
last feno hunt this summer tagged them

2801
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:32,400
in the field everybody was coming over

2802
01:49:30,679 --> 01:49:34,199
we'd put their name on them I told them

2803
01:49:32,399 --> 01:49:36,679
all we get you a bud with the seeds in

2804
01:49:34,198 --> 01:49:39,799
there you can run it yourself and but

2805
01:49:36,679 --> 01:49:41,960
then we um we saved all these root balls

2806
01:49:39,800 --> 01:49:44,119
but now it's on to the smoking phase and

2807
01:49:41,960 --> 01:49:45,880
we've already lopped 2third of them off

2808
01:49:44,118 --> 01:49:48,039
because they just didn't hold up to the

2809
01:49:45,880 --> 01:49:50,760
next test yeah what do you think about

2810
01:49:48,039 --> 01:49:52,198
root turps you ever smell your root um

2811
01:49:50,760 --> 01:49:54,199
I've smelled the roots and you know

2812
01:49:52,198 --> 01:49:56,919
what's in the forbidden fruit in that

2813
01:49:54,198 --> 01:50:00,039
line is the most odiferous to me at all

2814
01:49:56,920 --> 01:50:01,800
stages wow and um the root turps I I

2815
01:50:00,039 --> 01:50:03,920
haven't spent a lot of time but when I

2816
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:06,560
was in St Vincent I was interested we

2817
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:09,399
were up in the bush and GBA was our

2818
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:11,760
guide and his grandma had sent him with

2819
01:50:09,399 --> 01:50:13,799
instructions to get some roots for

2820
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:16,000
bronchitis and she made tea out of it

2821
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:17,320
for her bronchitis yeah I love St

2822
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:19,279
Vincent I spent a lot of time there

2823
01:50:17,319 --> 01:50:22,319
we're going back to St Vincent to gift

2824
01:50:19,279 --> 01:50:24,118
uh the minister of Agriculture Sabato

2825
01:50:22,319 --> 01:50:26,639
for still there yeah he's still there

2826
01:50:24,118 --> 01:50:27,960
and we're gifting him uh seeds that we

2827
01:50:26,639 --> 01:50:30,000
made for their country I did banana

2828
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:33,480
Skittles crosses that are heavy with

2829
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:35,760
banana punch banana uh OG to the

2830

Collins cough apples and

2832
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:41,560
bananas so many unique flavors that I

2833
01:50:40,039 --> 01:50:43,479
feel will be really good for the island

2834
01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:45,679
and it's it's our G I was with Marlon

2835
01:50:43,479 --> 01:50:47,279
Asher it's our way of giving back and

2836
01:50:45,679 --> 01:50:49,480
you know the people there they're

2837
01:50:47,279 --> 01:50:51,639
extremely poor there's a lot of poor

2838
01:50:49,479 --> 01:50:53,399
happy people and so if I can help

2839
01:50:51,639 --> 01:50:55,679
contribute to that in anyway to their

2840
01:50:53,399 --> 01:50:57,039
society doing better you know giving

2841
01:50:55,679 --> 01:50:59,279
something to the people that the people

2842
01:50:57,039 --> 01:51:00,279
can use to improve the quality of life I

2843
01:50:59,279 --> 01:51:03,158
mean there's a lot of people trying to

2844
01:51:00,279 --> 01:51:04,399
go in there and improve their quality of

2845
01:51:03,158 --> 01:51:06,078
life but they need to improve the

2846
01:51:04,399 --> 01:51:08,879
people's quality of life oh my gosh I'd

2847
01:51:06,078 --> 01:51:10,719
never seen uh such disparity and I lived

2848
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:13,239
on Maui a long time but I went to St

2849
01:51:10,719 --> 01:51:16,279
Vincent and one thing that stuck with me

2850
01:51:13,238 --> 01:51:17,678
is the happiness about what they have

2851
01:51:16,279 --> 01:51:19,158
yeah they weren't bitching about what

2852
01:51:17,679 --> 01:51:21,078
they didn't have they loved what they

2853
01:51:19,158 --> 01:51:23,279
had and were so appreciative and

2854
01:51:21,078 --> 01:51:26,078
everybody was asking for SE and I kept

2855
01:51:23,279 --> 01:51:27,719
saying save what you have because we're

2856
01:51:26,078 --> 01:51:30,639
still at a day and age right now where

2857
01:51:27,719 --> 01:51:32,800
it's like the question mark of what is

2858
01:51:30,639 --> 01:51:34,880
the value of these land races that have

2859
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:36,119
developed in a place like that and

2860
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:39,118
you've been there since I've been there

2861
01:51:36,118 --> 01:51:41,439
so how did the volcano impact genetics

2862
01:51:39,118 --> 01:51:43,118
because well directly on the island but

2863
01:51:41,439 --> 01:51:44,559
there's so many islands within St

2864
01:51:43,118 --> 01:51:47,880
Vincent and the Grenadines that have

2865
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:49,760
their own varieties that they've grown

2866
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:50,960
um but I I you know a lot of this stuff

2867
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:52,840
has been hybridized already in the

2868
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:54,760
island it's a small island pollen you

2869
01:51:52,840 --> 01:51:57,319
know I went there in 2018 to talk about

2870
01:51:54,760 --> 01:51:58,840
pollen mitigation right and so the

2871
01:51:57,319 --> 01:52:01,279
importance of pollen mitigation you know

2872
01:51:58,840 --> 01:52:03,039
not allowing R I believe in regular

2873
01:52:01,279 --> 01:52:04,479
Plants but I don't think that everybody

2874
01:52:03,039 --> 01:52:06,039
has the power where they're going to

2875
01:52:04,479 --> 01:52:08,039
want to just grow them out and there's

2876
01:52:06,039 --> 01:52:10,639
potential potential for contamination

2877
01:52:08,039 --> 01:52:12,880
well when I was there we U had a

2878
01:52:10,639 --> 01:52:15,480
function at the Cannabis Revival

2879
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:18,679
committee Spirit coddle and there was

2880
01:52:15,479 --> 01:52:20,919
like 50 local farmers a bunch of rostas

2881
01:52:18,679 --> 01:52:23,920
and a bunch of non rostas ganja farmers

2882
01:52:20,920 --> 01:52:27,239
and I posed the question cuz I was up

2883
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:30,399
there like who has selected and they all

2884
01:52:27,238 --> 01:52:32,279
were scratching their head and um and

2885
01:52:30,399 --> 01:52:34,158
what a father and son came up and

2886
01:52:32,279 --> 01:52:35,920
they're like yeah we think uncle's

2887
01:52:34,158 --> 01:52:37,839
selected well then I got brought up to

2888
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:40,639
the bush where we got off at the Rock

2889
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:42,719
Beach our gunman they stayed on the boat

2890
01:52:40,639 --> 01:52:45,159
they the other guys brought us up and we

2891
01:52:42,719 --> 01:52:48,599
hiked so far up and we saw two fully

2892
01:52:45,158 --> 01:52:50,638
native patches this is in May 6 to 8T

2893
01:52:48,599 --> 01:52:53,560
tall Haze looking things there was the

2894
01:52:50,639 --> 01:52:57,000
terpinolene and the non- tpin

2895
01:52:53,560 --> 01:53:00,079
and um then the third patch Patrick's um

2896
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:02,439
place he had the 6 in tall plants and

2897
01:53:00,078 --> 01:53:04,679
the foot tall plants and I said Pik he's

2898
01:53:02,439 --> 01:53:07,319
like hybrids I said Do you ever take

2899
01:53:04,679 --> 01:53:09,639
seeds off of that one for the next round

2900
01:53:07,319 --> 01:53:11,319
and he's like no and he he just like let

2901
01:53:09,639 --> 01:53:13,319
me show you what I do and he grabs seeds

2902
01:53:11,319 --> 01:53:14,960
seeds seeds and he there was no

2903
01:53:13,319 --> 01:53:16,559
selection thought and this is kind of

2904
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:18,960
like what a guy was telling me at

2905
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:20,719
Emerald cup is like the Afghans when

2906
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:22,239
they came when people brought the

2907
01:53:20,719 --> 01:53:25,480
Afghans here that was the first time

2908
01:53:22,238 --> 01:53:27,439
that they have been selected and like it

2909
01:53:25,479 --> 01:53:31,198
so like selection is such a key part of

2910
01:53:27,439 --> 01:53:34,078
the process for us but is it new to

2911
01:53:31,198 --> 01:53:35,759
them I you know I think it's new to a

2912
01:53:34,078 --> 01:53:37,599
lot of people in Emerging Markets where

2913
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:40,079
they don't have a lot of education on

2914
01:53:37,599 --> 01:53:41,400
the thing I mean St Vincent's had seeds

2915
01:53:40,078 --> 01:53:43,880
though and they've grown from seed for a

2916
01:53:41,399 --> 01:53:45,198
long time I mean Marlin's from Trinidad

2917
01:53:43,880 --> 01:53:48,679
and they used to get some of the best

2918
01:53:45,198 --> 01:53:50,479
flour from St Vincent yeah they had soil

2919
01:53:48,679 --> 01:53:52,719
I asked them do you just have male and

2920
01:53:50,479 --> 01:53:55,000
female they're like oh no plenty term

2921
01:53:52,719 --> 01:53:57,239
too the third gender we got plenty of

2922
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:59,639

2923
01:53:57,238 --> 01:54:01,919

kind of Dude to help make this uh event

2972
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:46,439
and other events here locally Thrive

2973
01:55:43,399 --> 01:55:49,118
moving forward so your sound system is

2974
01:55:46,439 --> 01:55:50,598
so clean I I mean I think sound systems

2975
01:55:49,118 --> 01:55:53,118
been getting better over the last 10 or

2976
01:55:50,599 --> 01:55:54,840
15 years but dude it sounds amazing

2977
01:55:53,118 --> 01:55:56,759
I don't know a lot of the technical

2978
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:59,840
aspects to it but I do know what I like

2979
01:55:56,760 --> 01:56:02,079
and it sounds crisp and clean out here

2980
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:04,639
there's also something about when you

2981
01:56:02,078 --> 01:56:06,679
hear music being projected over water

2982
01:56:04,639 --> 01:56:08,520
yeah there's just a deeper sound to it

2983
01:56:06,679 --> 01:56:10,078
or something all of it's extremely

2984
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:12,239
technical to make it sound good

2985
01:56:10,078 --> 01:56:13,880
especially at this level we we were both

2986
01:56:12,238 --> 01:56:15,238
at reggae and got to experience the

2987
01:56:13,880 --> 01:56:17,440
sound system there and that was

2988
01:56:15,238 --> 01:56:18,799
extremely special you know I'm blessed

2989
01:56:17,439 --> 01:56:21,158
to be able to experience all these

2990
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:23,279
things it's been great epic stuff for

2991
01:56:21,158 --> 01:56:27,078
sure yeah so what do you have in store

2992
01:56:23,279 --> 01:56:29,078
for next year well um this year coming

2993
01:56:27,078 --> 01:56:30,639
up we were looking to potentially uh do

2994
01:56:29,078 --> 01:56:34,639
a little collaboration I'll have to

2995
01:56:30,639 --> 01:56:36,920
leave some of the details uh un found

2996
01:56:34,639 --> 01:56:39,440
for now but we are but what we're doing

2997
01:56:36,920 --> 01:56:40,599
is a harvest competition this year

2998
01:56:39,439 --> 01:56:42,879
that'll be the next thing that we

2999
01:56:40,599 --> 01:56:44,679
produce for canif Fest we should talk

3000
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:47,118
about collaboration I would love to talk

3001
01:56:44,679 --> 01:56:49,480
about some collaboration cuz we do cubs

3002
01:56:47,118 --> 01:56:51,679
the James La genetics we we did we've

3003
01:56:49,479 --> 01:56:53,279
done some events with genetics and

3004
01:56:51,679 --> 01:56:55,520
sharing our genetics out and having

3005
01:56:53,279 --> 01:56:57,439
contests and yeah you never know what

3006
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:58,840
people can collaborate on so I'd love

3007
01:56:57,439 --> 01:57:01,638
that sounds like a good idea I've been

3008
01:56:58,840 --> 01:57:03,078
thinking about wanting to do one where

3009
01:57:01,639 --> 01:57:06,000
you get to pick an assortment of

3010
01:57:03,078 --> 01:57:08,519
somebody's genetic whole profile or

3011
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:10,960
their lineup and that's the competition

3012
01:57:08,520 --> 01:57:12,679
grow the best of the James loud genetics

3013
01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:14,560
I'm tell so we have genetics they in

3014
01:57:12,679 --> 01:57:16,679
tissue culture we can give everybody

3039
01:58:08,439 --> 01:58:12,158
been waiting for all year here at canif

3040
01:58:10,198 --> 01:58:14,559
Fest and for sure it's just kind of that

3041
01:58:12,158 --> 01:58:17,519
Vibe I saw many people

3042
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:19,599
yesterday bro I haven't seen you in 20

3043
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:21,679
years you know just people kind of

3044
01:58:19,599 --> 01:58:23,039
connecting well and REE was good for

3045
01:58:21,679 --> 01:58:25,440
that too but this is on a different

3046
01:58:23,039 --> 01:58:27,198
level cuz that's like the music and I

3047
01:58:25,439 --> 01:58:31,439
mean I I've been going to ree for a long

3048
01:58:27,198 --> 01:58:32,799
time over 20 years on and off and I love

3049
01:58:31,439 --> 01:58:34,078
regga in the river but it's just a

3050
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:35,800
different vibe than the Cannabis

3051
01:58:34,078 --> 01:58:37,439
Community CU this is straight cannabis

3052
01:58:35,800 --> 01:58:40,000
right everything's because of the plant

3053
01:58:37,439 --> 01:58:42,158
we are here in many ways as servants to

3054
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:44,880
the plant but we all have different

3055
01:58:42,158 --> 01:58:47,158
roles to play in this this greater thing

3056
01:58:44,880 --> 01:58:49,560
yeah we have over 250 different

3057
01:58:47,158 --> 01:58:52,238
organizations companies and Brands

3058
01:58:49,560 --> 01:58:54,239

3059
01:58:52,238 --> 01:58:56,158
this year and everybody is

3060
01:58:54,238 --> 01:58:58,559
representative of cannabis in some way

3061
01:58:56,158 --> 01:59:00,559
or another y you know there's a few

3062
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:02,520
artists and Artisans and whatnot that

3063
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:05,159
are here that are not like cannabis

3064
01:59:02,520 --> 01:59:07,840
specific yeah but they come from this

3065
01:59:05,158 --> 01:59:10,439
creative uh community of uh like-minded

3066
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:12,319

3067
01:59:10,439 --> 01:59:15,719

3157

gardeners who wanted to grow cannabis

3158
02:03:15,719 --> 02:03:20,319

3159
02:03:17,920 --> 02:03:22,319
professional cultivation for farming and

3160
02:03:20,319 --> 02:03:24,158

02:04:18,158 --> 02:04:24,118
like you know no uh just like how to

3188
02:04:20,960 --> 02:04:26,078
grow good weed really easily and and

3189
02:04:24,118 --> 02:04:29,158
then James is like a little bit more

3190
02:04:26,078 --> 02:04:30,679
Technical and and deep deeper stuff you

3191
02:04:29,158 --> 02:04:32,879
know we try to go deep but I feel like

3192
02:04:30,679 --> 02:04:34,599
my book has something for everybody so

3193
02:04:32,880 --> 02:04:36,118
you know I it's one of those things and

3194
02:04:34,599 --> 02:04:38,199
I think breeding is a natural

3195
02:04:36,118 --> 02:04:39,598
progression from learning how to grow so

3196
02:04:38,198 --> 02:04:42,638
if you guys don't know anything about

3197
02:04:39,599 --> 02:04:43,880
cannabis buy her book get into it and if

3198
02:04:42,639 --> 02:04:45,118
you want to learn something more and

3199
02:04:43,880 --> 02:04:47,159
you've already been growing I think

3200
02:04:45,118 --> 02:04:50,000
breeding is the great Next Step once you

3201
02:04:47,158 --> 02:04:51,960
can make the plant Express I agree yes

3202
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:54,078
so yeah I'd only been growing for 2

3203
02:04:51,960 --> 02:04:55,800
years like a year and a half when I bred

3204
02:04:54,078 --> 02:04:57,198
my first you know I wouldn't call it

3205
02:04:55,800 --> 02:05:00,719
breeding a strain but when I made my

3206
02:04:57,198 --> 02:05:04,000

with like cannabis history and a lot of

3223
02:05:42,399 --> 02:05:48,000
