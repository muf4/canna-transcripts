00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:09,599
Welcome to another exciting episode of

3
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:11,519
the James Loud podcast coming to you

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,160
straight from the heart of Catalonia,

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,480
beautiful Barcelona, a city that pulses

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,719
with vibrant energy and a zest for life

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,399
like nowhere else on earth. I'm thrilled

8
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,160
to be here in one of my favorite cities

9
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:24,640
where the culture is as rich as the

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,000
history is deep. Barcelona, a city

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,000
famous for its breathtaking

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
architecture. From the surreal creations

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,159
of Gaudi to the medieval charm of the

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,399
Gothic Quarter, is more than just a

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,000
feast for the eyes. It's a culinary

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,239
paradise where every meal is a

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,558
celebration, and the flavors are as bold

18
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,479
and dynamic as the city itself. From

19
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:44,718
mouthwatering tapas to fresh seafood

20
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,640
that dances on your pallet, Barcelona

21
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,960
offers a gastronomic adventure that's

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,640
second to none. And what better place to

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,399
host spannabis, one of the largest and

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,558
most celebrated cannabis gatherings in

25
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,160
Europe. This year marks a bittersweet

26
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:58,718
moment as we celebrate the final

27
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,558
Spanabis event in Barcelona. It's a

28
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,480
significant chapter in cannabis culture,

29
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:05,118
drawing enthusiasts and experts from

30
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,719
across the globe to share, learn, and

31
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:08,959
celebrate the art and science of

32
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:10,719
cannabis. While it's sad to bid farewell

33
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:12,798
to such an iconic event in this

34
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:15,438
incredible city, we're here to make this

35
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,759
last one the most memorable yet. Join us

36
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:19,919
as we explore the vibrant culture, dive

37
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,439
into the dectable food, and experience

38
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,680
the amazing cannabis scene that

39
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:26,079
Barcelona is renowned for. We'll live it

40
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,479
up one last time at Spanibus, soaking in

41
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:31,118
every moment of this unique gathering.

42
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,959
First up is the Barcelona Dabadoo, a

43
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:34,719
very special event which is a kickoff to

44
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:38,129
the week of Spanabis and also to

45
00:01:34,719 --> 00:02:17,579
celebrate Mila's 80th birthday.

47
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:27,238
How's it going everybody? I'm here

48
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,840
kicking off Spanabis 2025 at the

49
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:32,239
Greenhouse/Strain Hunters Club in

50
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,759
Barcelona with Arian Rosscam. How are

51
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,959
you doing today Arian? We're doing great

52
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:39,039
guys and James loud guys this weekend

53
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,719
spanabis at the greenhouse booth. So I

54
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:42,409
hope to see you all there and have a

55
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:56,889
great weekend in

56
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:56,889
[Music]

57
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:03,120
Barcelona. I'm here with Dr. Green from

58
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:08,158
Trinidad. He was in a strain hunters

59
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,840
documentary in 2011 or 12. 2011. So we

60
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:12,318
met at the High Times Cannabis Cup in

61
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,840
2012. And then we got Ashwin here. How

62
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:15,759
you doing today? I'm doing very well.

63
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,479
Thank you, James. No, so I know James

64
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:20,639
for many, many years now. I sold your

65
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:22,679
seats. Yeah. Seat center over the

66
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:24,639
counter. But most

67
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,879
remarkable, something I will never

68
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:29,679
forget is when

69
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:32,000
Sunset Sure first landed here in

70
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,480
Barcelona. Yeah. And there was one man

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,919
that took it to

72
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:37,919
Spanabis and people were lining up for

73
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:39,518
that. And that's how it got here. I

74
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,359
don't know. But yeah, I I had it in

75
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,759
Spanabis. You had your hands on it. We

76
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,319
did that. I know. We did 2013. And it

77
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:48,399
was just Yeah. game changer. I will

78
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:50,318
never forget. And that's because of the

79
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,120
flavor, the flavor profile, something

80
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:55,199
unique and it lingers in in in in my

81
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,280
memory. So, I feel like the flavors from

82
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,359
today that people know as gelatoes and

83
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,120
all these gelato derivatives all really

84
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,640
started with sunset sherbet. There was

85
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,239
cookies and they're all derivatives of

86
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:07,119
cookies too. But really that sunset

87
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:10,400
sherbet kind of set the trend on that

88
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,959
that candy dessert profile

89
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,000
and sure that sunset sherb had power

90
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:20,160
which I think is also important like

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,918
flavor effect something that like when

92
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,400
you smoke you know that you're smoking

93
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:26,560
nowadays everything is flavor. Yeah. And

94
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:28,159
you can empty bags after bags when

95
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,839
there's so much similarity between

96
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,759
everything. Right. And Sunset Sherbet

97
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:34,000
back then really stood out. Very

98
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,360
special. Yeah, Mario did a good job

99
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,519
growing that, man. Got to give it up to

100
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,680
to Mario for growing that. Sherbinsky,

101
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:41,680
big shout out. 100%. Shout out

102
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,280
Sherbinsky. Yeah, I mean, there was

103
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,879
people that started seed companies off

104
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:47,198
of the bag seeds that came out of the

105
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:50,159
sherbet packs. I know that people called

106
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,720
it even Spanibus sherbet. Like Phenofer

107
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,240
has a Spanibus Sherp in their Totally.

108
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,000
He crushed it. He crushed it with that.

109
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,759
Yeah, he did. Well, it's great seeing

110
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,639
you here. What are you expecting out of

111
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,879
Spanovis 2025? It's the last Spanabis we

112
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,439
understand in Barcelona, right? So, I'm

113
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:08,560
sad to be honest with you because as you

114
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:12,319
know, most of us are here the last

115
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,079
decade at least at least 10 years with

116
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,680
clubs that we're accustomed to. People

117
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,599
were accustomed to. We were both here

118
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,439
when they opened this club up. Yeah.

119
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:24,720
2014. 2014. Yeah. So, we have our places

120
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:26,399
already. and to to see the expo move and

121
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,680
go to somewhere else cuz a lot of people

122
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,959
are saying oh it's going to stay the

123
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,759
same people are going to come but that's

124
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:35,599
not true if you can't sell oh sorry if

125
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:37,360
you can't market your brand in spanabis

126
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,439
coming from America coming from the UK

127
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,479
and all that are you really going to

128
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:44,000
come to Barcelona in March just to hang

129
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:46,319
out with how many friends are actually

130
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,279
going to be here so it's sad it's sad

131
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:51,918
for me that things are changing and uh

132
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:54,879
hopefully you know we'll all find a new

133
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:56,159
location to that's similar enough to be

134
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,399
together. Maybe Mary Jane like the

135
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,240
Caribbean. Maybe the Caribbean, you

136
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,439
know, that's definitely Mary Jane, too.

137
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,038
But it's not just once a year. We need

138
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:04,399
to get together multiple times a year.

139
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:06,000
It can't just be once a year. You know

140
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:07,758
what I mean? So, like we need our

141
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,759
spannabis type event right around this

142
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,759
time of year. We need the Mary Jane type

143
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,439
event. We need the Caribbean events. We

144
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,720
need the California events where people

145
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,160
are coming to California to the events,

146
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,759
I think. And and you know, if the right

147
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,600
people are listening, I mean, you know,

148
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,000
every show has its audience, right? But

149
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:25,360
if this show eventually maybe does get

150
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,160
to the political aspect of Barcelona,

151
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:32,160
the mayor especially, I mean, look,

152
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:34,160
Spain has a ton of money as a country,

153
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,280
maybe from the old slave trade days, I

154
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:40,080
don't know. But it's still, why would

155
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:43,038
you as a country discourage tourism that

156
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:46,800
is not affecting anyone that is taking

157
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:48,639
away from illicit market opportunities?

158
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,400
And we know that when when cannabis is

159
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,000
sold on the street, the monies from

160
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,000
those illicit activities go to more

161
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,839
illicit activities, firearms and all

162
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,120
these other issues, right? So if you

163
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:00,719
have a a licensed operation that I mean,

164
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,120
you look around through the video here,

165
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,440
you see it's a social club. People come

166
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,598
here to consume cannabis peacefully,

167
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:09,839
right? And then leave peacefully. It's

168
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:12,800
one of the greatest things you could do.

169
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:14,719
If anyone hears this, the thousands of

170
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,800
people that come here every year for the

171
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,240
purpose of consuming in the clubs, it

172
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,439
should be something to be considered to

173
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,879
be kept. Definitely. I for me, it's hard

174
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:24,399
to argue that this planet doesn't make

175
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,319
the world a better place, right? So, at

176
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,478
the end of the day, I feel like the

177
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,120
people here are

178
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:32,478
bringing positivity into this world.

179
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,478
They're, you know, whether they're

180
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:36,159
consciously doing it or not, they're

181
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:37,918
making the world a better place. And I

182
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,280
think that's my big argument for all

183
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:42,799
these types of events. I think sharing

184
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:44,159
our stories and experiences, coming to

185
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,639
these events together, you know, we've

186
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,639
been doing this for a long time. Yeah.

187
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,478
Yeah. That's almost a little over 10

188
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,240
years now. Yeah. 13 years together,

189
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:54,399
right? And then besides what we've done

190
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,240
on our own, you know, like, you know,

191
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:58,239
and it's like without these events, we

192
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,759
would never have met. I have more good

193
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,519
friends out here than I do in my own

194
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,879
country, you know. So, it's it's

195
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:04,318
something that it's something that

196
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,759
should be encouraged, you know, the

197
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,319
social aspect of it, the coming

198
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:11,520
together. One small event sometimes

199
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,280
brings 20, 30 countries together, you

200
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,038
know. That's impressive. That's

201
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:16,719
impressive, you know. So, Spanabis

202
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:18,560
brings definitely a lot more, you know,

203
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,720
as a whole. So, and it brings money into

204
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,240
the economy in Barcelona. I think that

205
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,599
the people here, they're they're not out

206
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,038
to hurt people. They're not out to rip

207
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:26,959
people off. They're not out to do bad

208
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:29,120
things. For the most part, they're

209
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:30,399
really good good people. And the most

210
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,918
important thing for the government to

211
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:33,679
understand is that because you know I

212
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:36,000
come from a regulatory standpoint so I

213
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:38,000
like to put it in is that without the

214
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,839
clubs without the social club system

215
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
even if you put it intoarmacies you're

216
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,320
going to encourage and increase the

217
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,440
illicit market which will encourage more

218
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:50,080
problems in the end. So the best thing

219
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:54,200
to do is to license legitimate

220
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:56,240
legitimize and regulate more clubs

221
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,839
simply. I think that's the best thing

222
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,519
that they could do here in Spain

223
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,040
personally. I mean everywhere, France

224
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,278
also, you know, most of the European

225
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:04,639
countries. So, well, thank you so much

226
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:05,679
for your time. Thank you very much.

227
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:06,958
We'll do this again this week. Yeah.

228
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:09,419
Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. It's going to

229
00:09:06,958 --> 00:10:01,359
get busy. So,

230
00:09:09,419 --> 00:10:01,359
[Music]

231
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:12,959
[Music]

232
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:14,958
So, I'm here with Lance from Grove. How

233
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,319
are you doing today, Lance? I am doing

234
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,919
well, buddy. It's always good to see you

235
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,200
around the world as always. Absolutely.

236
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:21,120
It's always good to see you. We bump

237
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,800
into each other everywhere. We're going

238
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,959
to be bumping into each other more this

239
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:27,599
year at several events including

240
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:30,559
Germany. But we are here for the last

241
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,079
Spanabis today and it's the Puffpuff

242
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:35,119
Primortal, right? Is that is Yeah.

243
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:37,120
Puffpuff International Primordal. So

244
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,360
it's kind of the whole start of it. This

245
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,639
is the the birthing of the start of

246
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,240
Spannabis. As you know, we've been doing

247
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:44,159
this for years, man. Forever. Yeah. and

248
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,240
and it works up and it only gets better

249
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:48,078
day after day after day. So, we figured

250
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,759
we'd be a part of the Big Bang before

251
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:51,120
the official start tomorrow on Friday.

252
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:52,799
Really cool. And you guys have some

253
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,639
amazing food. There's a lot of amazing

254
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,919
guests at this event. You know, I'm

255
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:57,439
really looking forward to Spanabis this

256
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:58,958
year. It's, you know, they're saying

257
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,200
it's the last Spanabis. How do you feel

258
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:03,278
about that? Dude, this it's bittersweet

259
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,519
because this is my eighth year, I want

260
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:06,679
to say, sans co so doing it for a

261
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,519
decade.

262
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:10,958
Um, you know, Spannabis is a part of

263
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,720
Barcelona, like you and I both know,

264
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:15,039
like we come out being being California

265
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,278
kids, we're used to this weather, we're

266
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:19,599
used to this vibe, but to experience it

267
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:21,600
in the other side of the world is always

268
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,800
specialty. And so, the fact that they're

269
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,079
saying they're going to take it to Bil

270
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:25,519
Bao, which I get, they're finally,

271
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:27,278
they've been talking about destroying

272
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,720
the fairgrounds for years. Yeah. So,

273
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:29,838
they're taking it to Bil Bao, but it

274
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,600
doesn't have the same energy as

275
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,200
Barcelona. They don't have the clubs.

276
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,560
Maybe a couple clubs versus two or 30

277
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,000
hundred. Well, they're saying they're

278
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:37,759
taking it to Bilbao, but they've been

279
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,120
doing it in Bilva. They They did last

280
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:40,159
year. They did it in Bilbao. Well,

281
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,399
they've been doing Bilbao for a long

282
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,679
time, right? I think on and off. Yes. On

283
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,919
and off. And they did bring it back last

284
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:49,159
year cuz before they did Madrid and that

285
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:51,519
kind of Right. Yeah. And I mean, I have

286
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:53,278
bittersweet feelings. I mean, it's like

287
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,360
I've loved Spanabis. This is my single

288
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:56,639
favorite event to go to every year. I

289
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,079
have friends that I only see at

290
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,799
Spanabis, and I hope I'll see them at

291
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:03,439
Mary Jane as well. But it's like such an

292
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:05,199
amazing event, right? Like I mean one of

293
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,720
the best interviews I ever did was at

294
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,480
Barcelona.

295
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,720
You and I both, man. Yeah, we we had an

296
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,320
amazing amazing interview that no one

297
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,839
will ever get to hear. I know. They'll

298
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,040
get to see they could see it, but they

299
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,480
never hear it, right? They didn't record

300
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:18,639
the sound, but that's okay, you know. I

301
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,720
mean, exactly. We're still here. We're

302
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,839
still doing it. I love it. You know, I'm

303
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,200
excited for the next three days. It's

304
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,399
going to be a lot of fun. I'm too, man.

305
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,399
And talking to some friends that are

306
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,559
local coffee shop owners. Stefan from

307
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,559
Prettyme. Shout out Lorenzo from Turpps

308
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:31,599
Army. Screech from Dank of England.

309
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:33,518
They're all talking about getting

310
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,040
together as the coffee shops. Yeah. And

311
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,639
doing a weed week out here next year

312
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,159
regardless. They should. And I have a

313
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,600
feeling guys like you and I will still

314
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:41,278
roll up for that because to be able to

315
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,159
do all this and not have to go work a

316
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:45,519
fair for three. Sounds good. Yeah. It

317
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:47,278
sounds a little more intimate. It's like

318
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,440
when the big band goes and plays all the

319
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:50,799
small clubs. I love that. That's exactly

320
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,160
it. That's exactly I think it'll be

321
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:53,199
dope. Looking forward to it, man.

322
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:54,480
Looking forward to hanging with you this

323
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,639
week. Absolutely. Thank you very much

324
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,519
for the time. Yep. You got it.

325
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,440
I'm here with Sebastian from 420 Fast

326
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,078
Buds. So, how are how are you feeling

327
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,760
about this being the last Spanibus? It's

328
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:08,479
not the last Spanibus, just the last

329
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:10,319
Spanish in Barcelona. Maybe not. Who

330
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,839
knows? But last in Lfira for sure cuz

331
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,519
they're tearing it down, right? So,

332
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,760
exactly. They're tear tearing down the

333
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,000
whole fairgrounds, which is sad because

334
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:20,078
I feel like this pyramid maybe it's not

335
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,919
the most modern anymore and people need

336
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:24,000
something more modern, but it's iconic.

337
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:26,479
It has people with tattoos of the

338
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,559
pyramid on their backs. You know what I

339
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,200
mean? It's really it's it's amazing

340
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:32,879
event place. So, you know, as far as an

341
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,480
event center, some place where we've

342
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:36,958
been going for a long time to these

343
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,480
events. I I love the I love the venue,

344
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,759
right? And I every year I love the fact

345
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,600
that you can go to the same place and

346
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:43,439
find the same people, right? Greenhouse

347
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,959
is in the same place. Most of most

348
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,360
people are in the same place for a long

349
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,958
time. Always same. Always 196. You come

350
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,759
in first. It's first first move on the

351
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:53,039
left, you know. That's just Yeah. Um, so

352
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:54,399
let's put it this way. I don't want to

353
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:56,719
be one of those people who are like,

354
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,799
"Oh, the end of an era." It is the end

355
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,320
of an era. But is there something new

356
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:04,159
coming? Of course, there's something new

357
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,600
coming. Is Spanabis Bilbao, which is

358
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:07,120
going to be They've been doing it in Bil

359
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,800
Bao, though every year, too. But it's

360
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,480
17th, 18th, and 19th of April. So, we

361
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:14,639
have to check it out. And I need to

362
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,399
throw a 420 event the next day. So,

363
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,639
after everything is over, of course,

364
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,240
somebody needs to do it. And if not me,

365
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:25,600
who can do it? Absolutely.

366
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:28,000
But I go without any let's check it out,

367
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,040
right? Is it going to replace Banabis?

368
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,159
It can't. It can't replace here. It's 20

369
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:37,838
years of coming. It's a huge scene here.

370
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:39,278
It's a beautiful city. And I give VBA

371
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,720
the chance, but it won't have the

372
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:44,399
infrastructure to hold 50,000 people,

373
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,920
you know, like that, not to host them

374
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,879
and stuff like that. Well, Germany, what

375
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:48,479
they're going to they're expecting

376
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:49,838
100,000 people in Germany this year.

377
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,079
It's going to be crazy.

378
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:56,399
Let's see. Last year was cool as Yeah,

379
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:59,359
cool. But a nightmare. The organization

380
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:01,278
of the fair was a nightmare. There was

381
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,079
trash everywhere. Like nothing was

382
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:07,039
working. This year they organizing it

383
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:08,838
double the size. So I'm sure they're

384
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:12,559
prepared. Everybody learns from their

385
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:16,160
mistakes. And I am excited for this very

386
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:18,719
much. And I think that eventually Berlin

387
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:21,120
is going to take the place of Spanabis

388
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,440
in Europe and we will have events like

389
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,720
Spanabis Bilbao which will be amazing

390
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,720
but it won't be it won't be as impactful

391
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,320
as Spanabis Barcelona but it still will

392
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,519
have impact right there's still people

393
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,399
there's still people I know that go to

394
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,919
Bil Bao every year you know so yeah I

395
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,600
mean I'm really excited for the next

396
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:40,240
three days it's going to be really fun

397
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,839
it's going to be really busy but yeah I

398
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,440
I love this this is you know we're in

399
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,440
our element here. You know, this is this

400
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,639
is what we love. This is what we do. So,

401
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,600
I I come home at 1 2:00 in the morning

402
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:54,480
and I get up or I leave the house before

403
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:58,079
10. This is day after day after day

404
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:00,800
after day. Um, your body sometimes just

405
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:02,559
screams rest when you come home, but you

406
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:05,359
always want more. Or, can I maybe add

407
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:08,159
one more club, just one more dab? Can I

408
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,759
do this more? It It's We're, as you say,

409
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:11,278
we're just fully in our element. That's

410
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,199
what we live for. It's going to be wild.

411
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:14,000
It's going to be wild, man. Thank you so

412
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:15,599
much for your time. Thank you for

413
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,600
everything, man. Always. Always. Thank

414
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,440
you so much. And you know what I always

415
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,360
have to say at the end. No. Oh, yeah.

416
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,440
You have to remember that it's 4:20

417
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,919
somewhere. How's it going everybody? I'm

418
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,360
here with Dan Her. How you doing today,

419
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:29,039
brother? I'm doing very well, dude.

420
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,519
Thank you so much for uh giving me some

421
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:35,039
time, carrying the legacy on of the late

422
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:37,600
Jack that that's impacted so many of us

423
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:39,919
on so many levels, right? And it, you

424
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,560
know, it it's true. That's like every

425
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:45,120
every time I like we're here in Spain

426
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:47,758
and I see the things that he helped to

427
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,120
start and inspire here just as he did in

428
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:53,519
the US and so I get to feel his energy

429
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,440
everywhere I go. Yeah. I mean his legacy

430
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,839
lives on. His impact was so great it's

431
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,920
felt everywhere all the time. Yeah. I

432
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,600
you know the legacy by the way is not

433
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:04,078
me. The legacy is this. It's all it's

434
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,160
all of us. It's it's this you know I'm

435
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:09,119
Jack's son but this is the legacy.

436
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,640
Right. Right. Absolutely. you know, it's

437
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,159
so much greater. I mean, it's like the

438
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,160
Grateful Dead, how they've impacted our

439
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,959
whole industry. And Jack is is on that

440
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,839
same level. I feel I I I think from the

441
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,519
cannabis, you know, standpoint, I he's

442
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:25,359
one of the very few people I think that

443
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:27,599
has truly changed the world by, you

444
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,599
know, being as passionate and outspoken

445
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,519
and

446
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:35,038
unrelenting and and authentic and uh

447
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:37,038
unapologetic and unapologetic. Yeah.

448
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:38,079
Yeah. So, tell me about everything that

449
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:40,400
you're doing. And I heard you're doing

450
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:42,720
all kinds of wild stuff. Well, uh, we're

451
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,120
looking to bust into the European market

452
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,519
in multiple ways. Obviously, cannabis is

453
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:50,879
a is a tough, uh, you know, development

454
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:52,960
right now, but the the Jack brand is

455
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,960
more than just what people look at as

456
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,440
genetic, right? Um, you know, everything

457
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:02,079
from clothing to

458
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:05,200

466
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:25,759
And then uh we're also partnering here

467
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:28,079

468
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:30,558
And Gross Beer is doing a jack beer

469
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:32,159
which will be launching next month. So

470
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:34,399
you guys putting Jack Turpps in the beer

471

and Jack Turps in the wine? Yep. That's

472
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,960
amazing. And uh you know, we we wanted

473
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,960
to create something that was truly

474
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,038
sharable, like people would want to sit

475
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,759
down and and have the beer with their

476
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:49,359
food and sit down with uh a mate or a

477
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:50,960
date and uh and and truly enjoy a glass

478
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:52,319
of wine. So, if it's if it's not

479
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,079
something that you want to sit down and

480
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:55,839
share, Yeah. we weren't interested in

481
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:58,798
making a novelty product. We wanted to

482
00:18:55,839 --> 00:19:00,480
make something that that really um did

483
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:02,160
more than collect dust on a mantle

484
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,839
somewhere. Totally understandable.

485
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,160
Totally understand. I feel the same way.

486
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:08,639
I mean, I think that authenticity

487
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,160
resonates so heavily with within our

488
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,520
community especially. It's just so

489
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,840
important to have something that we all

490
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:15,279
enjoy that you can give to somebody and

491
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:17,359
they want to use. I mean, cannabis is

492
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:19,759
supposed to be used fresh, right? Hash

493
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:21,359
is hash you can smoke years later, is

494
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:22,798
still good. Flower on the other hand

495
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:25,119
does not smoke good years later

496
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:26,879
typically. Typically. Yeah. But there

497
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:29,439
are some good there's some people that

498
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,520
have figured out how to store it. Well,

499
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,160
yeah. I I mean I can preserve it for

500
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:35,759
months, not years, right? But that's

501
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,679
true. But who knows, you know? I think

502
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,599
that the depending on what you like. I

503
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,600
think the turppines change over time.

504
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:44,240
Frenchie canoli always talked about how

505
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:46,879
tarpines changed over time, you know,

506
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,359
within the hash. Uh, you know, so he was

507
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,120
a smart man. He was a smart man. another

508
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:53,759
guy that just really contributed heavily

509
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:56,719
to the community around the entire level

510
00:19:53,759 --> 00:20:01,119
of culture within cannabis like the hash

511
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:03,519
culture, the hash world benefited by his

512
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:04,879
absolute dedication to just his

513
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:06,160
devotion. Yeah. And same thing with

514
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,840
Jack. It's like these people are so

515
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,200
devotional. The these are the guys that

516
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:12,319
I look up to right every day. Yeah. You

517
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,400
too. I think you're doing some great

518
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:16,720
things. Yeah, thank you. I think being

519
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,038
the second generation and being the

520
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,720
legacy, I think you're doing a great job

521
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:22,160
and I feel like expanding into these

522
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,319
other markets where you can introduce

523
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,160
tarpen into alcoholic beverages is

524
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:27,599
amazing. I love it. You know, being a

525
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,240
chef and and having a background in

526
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:31,759
culinary arts, I have a lot of respect

527
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,400
for people that are trying to branch off

528
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:36,319
and to do things um that that aren't

529
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,559
being done, right? Anybody can copy

530
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:40,079
somebody else, but to pave the way and

531
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:41,519
try to go into other stuff, not knowing

532
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:43,038
if it's going to work, but having a gut

533
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:45,359
feeling, it's it's that devotional

534
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:48,158
quality, you know, that makes the world

535
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:50,240
great. I I I I agree. And, you know, I'm

536
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,520
I'm expecting push back. Yeah. You know,

537
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,319
you're going to get push back, but [ __ ]

538
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:56,240
them. But the the the reality is is um

539
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:57,678
if something's good, then it's good. If

540
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,038
you know, it's good food, it's good

541
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,038
food. If it's good wine, it's good wine.

542
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:04,798
If it's good beer, same, you know.

543
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:07,279
Absolutely. Um I I I I I don't uh

544
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:09,279
segment between alcohol and cannabis. I

545
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:11,918
mean, if you go to most any cannabis

546
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:13,359
event, there is alcohol and cannabis.

547
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,200
It's only it's only the government that

548
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:17,038
tries to keep everything separate. Yeah.

549
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,360
You know, but we we know what brings

550
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:23,679
people together. And this plant in this

551
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:27,519
community is is perfect for pairing a

552
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:30,000
wine with a hash or um you know, a dab

553
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:33,879
or a joint. and then being able to

554
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:37,359
experience uh a a plethora of

555
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,640
of you know taste. Well, the

556
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:40,158
experiences, right? At the end of the

557
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,679
day, these are experiences. And when you

558
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,280
can give somebody experience that they

559
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,120
wouldn't otherwise get from somewhere

560
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:47,599
else, you're on to something. That's how

561
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:48,639
I feel about it. So, I I I I'm I'm

562
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:51,199
hoping that we're going to be there for

563
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,440
the long run and and that uh people will

564
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,200
uh give it an opportunity because uh it

565
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,679
it is different when you get the notes

566
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,679
of cannabis in your wine. Uh, so it kind

567
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:03,038
of messes with you for a second. Sure.

568
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:05,440
But, uh, you you give it a chance, you

569
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:07,679
taste it, and you realize that I could

570
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,279
[ __ ] with this. Yeah, dude. I I think

571
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,440
it's amazing. So, Logan, I used to work

572
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:14,798
for Logan, right? I did I was a chef for

573
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,640
Logan. I did uh music festival. They had

574
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:18,558
a beer festival, music festival. They

575
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,280
combined it called the beer circus.

576
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:23,119
Anyway, Logan had a tarpine beer. Uh,

577
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:24,200
they were the first ones. I believe they

578
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:27,519
worked with

579
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,960
uh Absolute Extracts, not Absolute Tech,

580
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:30,960
but Absolute Extracts and and they

581
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,720
released it and they got, you know,

582
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,079
letters from the DEA, Cease and Desist,

583
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,240
and all this stuff, but it was amazing

584
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:38,639
stuff. Yeah. Well, we did a a beer

585
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,599
collaboration with Sweetwater Brewing in

586
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:44,960
2020. Oh, wow. They produced uh 10,000

587
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:48,079
cases of Jack uh Tarpine beer. They sold

588
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,079
it in about 30 days, right? And then

589
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:52,240
they were bought by a Canadian company.

590
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:55,918
and the Canadian company cut off all of

591
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:58,640
the cannabis branded uh or licensed uh

592
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,320
beers. Yeah. On the flip side, the beer

593
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,360
was delicious. I wish they would bring

594
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:06,000
it back. Um but uh you know, moving

595
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:08,558
forward, here we are in Barcelona. We're

596
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,119
working with a great brewery uh brewery

597
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:12,798
uh Gross Beer and uh I look forward to

598
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:14,319
coming back here next month and uh and

599
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:15,918
launching. You know what I'm really

600
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:18,558
looking forward to in the weed world is

601
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,840
people crossing Jack Carrera again.

602
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:22,158
Bringing back some of those old Jack

603
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:24,399
crosses, the Jack Flash, the Jack Frost.

604
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,480
You know, the the Jack hair is still out

605
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,640
there. There's there's versions of it

606
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,839
out there that are good, really good.

607
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,840
And but back in the '9s and early 2000s,

608
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:35,199
there was a lot of var variation with

609
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:36,639
Jack, right? There was so many people

610
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,558
breeding with it. You were getting all

611
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,200
kinds of cool stuff. And I would love if

612
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:43,918
the world came back with the Jack. Yeah.

613
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,120
Well, we do our own crosses. Uh but

614
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,640
we're really focusing on uh new

615
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:51,038
standalone uh genetics that are specific

616
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,440
to our brand. Yeah. And and we're really

617
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:56,240
hoping that uh expanding the oper the

618
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,558
the options for Jack pre-rolls infused

619
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,400
pre-rolls, the the multiple different uh

620
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:02,399
flavors and products that we have

621
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,159
through the the flower side of things,

622
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,080
right? That people will understand that

623
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,760
the the brand is more than just the

624
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:09,038
single genetic. Well, and it almost has

625
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:10,640
to be because the thing with Jack is

626
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:12,000
it's so dominant when you cross it to

627
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,159
other stuff. A lot of times you get

628
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,079
Jack. Yeah. Right. You know, everything

629
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,760
becomes Jack and Jason, right? You know,

630
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:19,678
it's like, oh yeah, that's Jackie.

631
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:21,519
That's, you know, and we want we want

632
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,200
people to enjoy Jack and some of the

633
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:25,759
crosses, but we also want people to just

634
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,600
enjoy cannabis and and something unique

635
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:28,640
and and hopefully they can find that

636
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,399
with some of the things that we're

637
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,919
developing with the brand. Yeah. Well,

638
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,519
if you guys are interested in fenos and

639
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,880
feno hunting, we're doing that all the

640

you at High Times Cannabis Cup 2012.

748
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,240
the very first American Cups. You were

749
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,759
in all those. They were good times. It

750
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,000
was a different time than what it is

751
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:36,319
right now. It was a lot more taboo back

752

then and a little bit more like, you

California 2015. [ __ ] loving it out

785

here, man. That vibe is great. So, is

786
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,038
this your first spanabis? This is my

787
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,000
very first Spanabis. Uh took me a long

788
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:46,000
time to get out here. We were supposed

789
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,319
to come out here in 2019. Then CO hit

790
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,440
and ruined the whole thing. So, put a

791
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:51,278
little damper, but I made sure to make

792
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,360
it out here. Thank god I did since the

793
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:55,679
last one in Barcelona. Yeah. Yeah. I

00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:57,199

00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,600
in a long time, right? This feels like

800
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,759
California 2015 to me. Uh, which is very

801
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:12,240
honestly, this feels like 2010. It's

802
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:14,240
always had that early high times vibe

803
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,839
where we had these cups and it was very

804
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,440
it's nostalgic for me because everyone

805
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:19,359
was so passionate about weed. They

806
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,278
weren't bitter about the industry yet.

807
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:23,359
They weren't jaded. Now these people

808
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:24,558
walking around here love weed. They love

809
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:26,879
everything about the plant. They get

810
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:28,798
excited about edibles still. They get

811
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,720
excited about, you know, brownies, the

812
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:32,240
hash. They love the hash. Not even good

813
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,000
hash. They just get excited about hash,

814
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,359
dude. Like it's just it's an incredible.

815
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,278
It's still about the love of the plant,

816
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:40,079
you know? It hasn't been ruined yet by

817
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:41,759
the by big business. corporations or or

818
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:43,359
just the evolution of where it's going

819
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:44,558
to go with the legalizing, you know.

820
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:46,000
Sure, sure, sure. The people that don't

821
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:47,678
make it, the big guys kind of start

822
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,519
taking over. The little guys fall to the

823
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:51,600
wayside. And uh yeah, but out here, the

824
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,798
vibes, the vibes big, it's strong. I

825
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:54,079
love it. I can't believe it took me this

826
00:32:52,798 --> 00:32:55,440
long to get here. I can't believe it

827
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:56,639
took you this long either. Glad you're

828
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,240
here, though, bro. Thanks, man.

829
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,720
Appreciate it. So, tell me about your

830
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,798
new venture. Okay, so I recently joined

831
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,000
uh a company called Pacific Room Fusion.

832
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:06,079
about eight months ago, they brought me

833
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,440
on as as a consultant to help them kind

834
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:09,918
of build out the user interface, their

835
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,200
new their new platform. And then uh both

836
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:12,880
of us kind of gained more and more

837
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,720
interest in the other the other person

838
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,559
or the other group. And long story

839
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,960
short, we're few weeks away from launch.

840
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:22,398
And it's essentially kind of a a B2B

841
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,480
weed maps or or a eBay for for cannabis

842
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:26,879
and hemp CBD. And it's worldwide, right?

843
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,960
So, North America, Western Europe,

844
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,919
Southeast Asia, South America, any hemp

845
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:35,278
producing country, uh businesses can get

846
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:37,200
online kind of post uh uh like a whole

847
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:38,798
like a eBay type listing for bulk

848
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,080
product. So whether that's seeds,

849
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:42,798
whether that's hemp, whether that's

850
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:44,079
biomass, isolate, flour, or whatever,

851
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:45,200
they can it's an international

852
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:46,480
marketplace for people to communicate

853
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,038
with each other. And then in regulated

854
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,880
areas, say like within the states,

855
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:52,640
regulated companies can meet each other

856
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,240
on there as well. Really cool. Yeah.

857
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,519
Nifty little idea. It's pretty novel,

858
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,640
dude. Thank you so much for your time,

859
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,319
dude. I look forward to having you on

860
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,919
the podcast again. Yeah, I would love

861
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:01,918
that, man. I appreciate it. Good to see

862
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:04,320
you, James.

863
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,640
I'm here with Dave C from the Adam Dunn

864
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:09,279
show. How are you doing? How's your

865
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:11,039
spanamus going? You're loving it? I'm

866
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,159
loving it. It's a great event. I'm a

867
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:16,239
little sad that it's the last one in

868
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:18,480
Barcelona. Uh we'll see how Bill Ba goes

869
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:21,118
next year. Yeah, it might not uh have

870
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,519
the infrastructure yet, but they have uh

871
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,720
a year to prepare for us. Absolutely.

872
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:26,719
We'll see how it goes. What are some of

873
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:28,799
the highlights of your trip? I love

874
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:31,918
catching up with old friends that don't

875
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:34,480
come over to the States for uh the US

876
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:37,440
Canada events. I was hoping there would

877
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:40,000
be more technology here, you know, for

878
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,960
to sort of uh focus on the European

879
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,280
market, but it this is a breederheavy

880
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,398
event. I mean, a real breeder heavy

881
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,079
event. I don't know about a seed

882
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:49,440
producer. Maybe there's there's a

883
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,359
handful of breeders and a lot of people

884
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,159
making seeds these days. There are

885
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:56,799
truckers out here. Yes, they are just

886
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:59,519
throwing anything forward. But uh there

887
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,960
are a lot of people selling genetics.

888
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:02,480
How about that? Yes, there's a [ __ ] ton

889
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,880
of seeds in the building. That is for

890
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,880
sure. Had a great time here. I'm looking

891
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,960
forward to next year. I'd like to see

892
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,400
more of Spain. I'd like to see more of

893

897
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:23,119
just offered Dave double the salary.

899

908
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:48,720
still remember scooping out uh several

909
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,880
hundred of rosin from your jar.

910
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:53,279
Absolutely. The emerald or wherever it

look around. It is a beautiful day to

smoke weed. It's a beautiful day to buy

00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:41,280
Meno. Dope. Could it get any louder in

928
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,880
here? How you guys doing today? Oh man,

929
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,200
we're doing so good right now. This is

930
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:48,400
epic to be out here. Yes. Super fun

931
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:50,078
time. We are stoned. Absolutely. This is

932
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:53,599
the place to do it. The smoke is in the

933
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:55,359
air. It's uh 6:00 on a Saturday night. I

934
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:57,359
I'm loving it. It's still packed. This

935
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:59,279
place is packed and doesn't seem rolled

936
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:00,960
up. Yeah, we got some CBDs rolled up in

937
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,160
the blunt because we've been smoking so

938
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,119
much good stuff while we've been out

939
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:07,118
here that we haven't smoked any CBDs

940
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:10,160
yet. This is the So, this is Flow

941
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:12,160
Gardens. Flow Garden won CBD at Spanabis

942
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:14,319
third place last night. Boom. Third

943
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:16,078
place. That's even more such a big treat

944
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:19,920
for us to be able to enjoy some of the

945
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:21,119
top contenders. Top tier CBD flour. Like

946
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,639
I wonder what the first place looked

947
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,559
like cuz I'm impressed on this one.

948
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:27,118
Yeah, me too. Maybe it's rigged though.

949
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:28,960
You never know. You never know. It's

950
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,800
always rigged. It's always rigged. So,

951
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,800
how's Spanabis treating you? You guys

952
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,400
first year out here? Yeah, this is our

953
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,680
first time out in Europe. First time at

954
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:40,800
Spanabis and it's been like amazing. So

955
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:43,039
ex just crazy all around from the the

956
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,280
views of everything, the food, the

957
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:47,920
people being out here at Spanabis to

958
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,760
enjoy it in Barcelona before it changes

959
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,358
makes it so special to us. You guys are

960
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,079
out here performing, too. You're a hash

961
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:55,759
calabash. We I missed you guys. Like we

962
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:57,119
left we must have left right before you

963
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,480
guys came up. Yeah, I saw a picture this

964
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:01,039
morning. I was like, you were there on

965
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,320
the couch where we were? What? I didn't

966
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:04,719
know you were there. No, that event was

967
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,320
great. It was a cool little event. Yeah.

968
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:08,559
So, being able to perform out here on

969
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,559
the main stage, totally unexpected. Uh,

970
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:12,400
snuck on there and got to do two songs,

971
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:14,639
which one of them was a dedication to

972
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,639
Frenchie Canoli. It's coming up on our

973
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:17,920
new album. It's called Ooh La. And it

974
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:19,679
was just so awesome to see the whole

975
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,760
crowd vibing with us. Like, perfect

976
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:24,319
timing. It's such a good crowd here. The

977
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,920
people are so passionate. Yeah. I mean,

978
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,519
not just the Spanish people, everyone

979
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,838
from all around the world. Everyone is

980
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:31,519
loving it. It's just good vibes, right?

981
00:39:29,838 --> 00:39:33,039
Pure vibes. Good vibes. Good weed. And

982
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:35,119
there's really good weed. So when I

983
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:37,119
first came to my first spanabis, the

984
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,960
weed sucked. There was like Don and

985
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,320
Aaron had good weed. There was a handful

986
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:44,480
of people with really good weed. How

987
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:46,800
long ago was that? 2012, 2013. Oh, wow.

988
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,719
Yeah. That was my first year. So I've

989
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,039
I've been to a lot of I love this event.

990
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:53,199
Major revolution. And the X track game

991
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:55,440
out here, dude. Like pretty ridiculous.

992
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:57,679
I bet the Skittles rising out here has

993
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,358
been next level, dude. Oh, really? Wild.

994
00:39:57,679 --> 00:40:01,039
Yeah. Yeah. So with the water and the

995
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:03,119
climate that different regions have in

996
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:05,279
the world is so cool to see strains that

997
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:07,680
we've kind of got to know especially in

998
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:10,000
Cali or even in our own county of

999
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:11,519
Menescino or you're the Bay Area grown

1000
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,199
and then to see some of this grown in

1001
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:14,880
Spain and see what turpps it kind of

1002
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:16,879
expressions brings out from this climate

1003
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,559
and this I think the water has a lot to

1004
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,000
do besides just climate these days. Oh

1005
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:21,759
yeah, the water that you're feeding it

1006
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,920
can change the flavor also and bring in

1007
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,520
the vibe from wherever your region is.

1008
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,920
Well, most of us have such chemically

1009
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:29,358
treated water in California. Very true.

1010
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,720
So places like this makes sense. It

1011
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:32,000
should be. And the hash makes sense

1012
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:34,239
because once you're using a lot more

1013
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,760
water and you're cleaning it. Yeah. It's

1014
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:38,159
very awesome. Very delicious. How is

1015
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,720
that? Delicious. That's like super bomb.

1016
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:42,639
It's so smooth, too. It's like just on

1017
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:45,358
the inhale, exhale. Nothing but just

1018
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:47,679
smoothness. I can feel it's like insta

1019
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:49,679
calming almost relaxing me already.

1020
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:52,559
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I love it. It's nice.

1021
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:54,078
19% CBD. It's got to have like 4%

1022
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:56,719
turpps. See, that stuff is wild. It's

1023
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:58,400
tasty. It's It looks nice. It smells

1024
00:40:56,719 --> 00:41:00,959
does not look like CBD. It looks like

1025
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,920
THC. For sure. Yeah. But you can smoke

1026
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,440
that whole thing down and you're just

1027
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,119
going to be relaxed. You'll feel the

1028
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:08,079
tobacco more than you'll feel the weed.

1029
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:10,000
Yep. For sure. Yummy. So, how's it been

1030
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,760
for you out here though? Cuz you've been

1031
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,039
rocking at this. I love this event. I

1032
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,400
love the people here. I love everything

1033
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:15,838
about it. Like, we got a lot of people

1034
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,280
that watch some podcasts from all over

1035
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:19,039
the world that have come up and wanted

1036
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,880
to take photos and want to hang out,

1037
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:23,039
smoke. I got a lot of gifts from people.

1038
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,440
It was really cool. So when I was

1039
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:28,800
younger by I won a cup in 2012 in

1040
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,318
Amsterdam and I saw people come up to S

1041
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,920
and gift them stuff. There was guys

1042
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:33,920
crying when they gave S stuff. Like

1043
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,760
literally crying when they were giving S

1044
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,680
stuff and I was like that's pretty cool,

1045
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,440
you know, and to just get a lot of, you

1046
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:41,679
know, getting positive feedback from

1047
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,039
fans. I just we have a lot of good

1048
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:44,879
people out there, you know, and I feel

1049
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:46,559
like my podcast isn't really just me.

1050
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,640
It's about the guest, right? That's what

1051
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:49,920
So it's just great acknowledgement when

1052
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:51,039
it's like they're telling me I'm doing

1053
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,720
something good, you know? For sure.

1054
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:54,960
Yeah, I could totally dig that. It's

1055
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:56,879
been so cool to be like this far from

1056
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,599
home, you know, for our first trip out

1057
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,599
to Europe, out to Spain, and like to see

1058
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:03,519
like how much love and from people from

1059
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,200
all over the place coming up to say

1060
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:07,119
what's up, and how long they've been

1061
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:08,480
following us for the past 10 years, and

1062
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:11,039
like you guys are crushing, dude. I

1063
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,719
mean, you guys,

1064
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:14,960
a long time. And it's so dope how so

1065
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:16,719
many people have been like real hardcore

1066
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,240
supporters of us from the beginning and

1067
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:20,000
still here with us. Well, and there's an

1068
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:21,439
evolution of what you guys did. you

1069
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,960
know, that's spread out al across the

1070
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,838
globe, you know, there's all kinds of

1071
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:27,920
stuff, dude. It's it's amazing when you

1072
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:29,838
throw a a pebble in a pond and create

1073
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,519
those waves, dude. And how they [ __ ]

1074
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:33,599
just take their own shape, right? I

1075
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:35,039
mean, in a sense, we're all an evolution

1076
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,800
from the Grateful Dead here, right? And

1077
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:38,239
then you guys evolve from the Grateful

1078
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,760
Dead to you guys into all these other

1079
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:42,239
little projects that people have done

1080
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,920
and bands. I mean, it's just it's a it's

1081
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:45,199
a vibe, right? It is. It's a total vibe

1082
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,639
and we love it. This is the cannabis

1083
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:48,719
culture. This what we represent and

1084
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:51,279
support. And uh [ __ ] James Loud, man.

1085
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:52,639
He's our homie right here. Real deal ser

1086
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,160
like real deal breeder, you know,

1087
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:56,000
passionate about this culture. Someone

1088
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:57,679
who really knows what's up and like this

1089
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,199
the kind of people that we need on the

1090
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:01,279
on the front line, you know, standing

1091
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:02,799
our ground with real Ganja soldiers out

1092
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,280
here and we're doing it together and

1093
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,960
we're about the community. Community

1094
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,400
about all about all of us. Yeah. We're

1095
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,240
all stronger together. Our roots

1096
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,400
combining. We're building an unbreakable

1097
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:13,919
foundation out here. Right. Well, and so

1098
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,599
many of us see ourselves as individuals,

1099
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,358
but I love looking at the community as

1100
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,800
one. Yeah. We're working it. You know,

1101
00:43:17,358 --> 00:43:20,400
we're trying to just master our craft.

1102
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,160
Go out there and spread this culture and

1103
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,680
just have fun with it, too. You know,

1104
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:25,358
the game is hard right now. There's a

1105
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:27,440
lot of people getting taken out of the

1106
00:43:25,358 --> 00:43:29,519
game and big corporations coming in, but

1107
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,358
with people like James Loud, people like

1108
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:33,280
us, and these other companies that are

1109
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:35,199
holding it down for real, like this

1110
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,480
culture will prevail. It will prevail.

1111
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:38,000
And it's through the collaboration

1112
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,639
model, right? Through the collaboration

1113
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,920
model, we can all work together. And

1114
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:43,679
it's a beautiful thing. Yeah, it is.

1115
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,358
It's a It's a worldwide collaboration

1116
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:47,279
now is what's really cool. Seeing this

1117
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:49,358
really opens my eyes to what's been

1118
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,599
happening and what we're seeing

1119
00:43:49,358 --> 00:43:53,759
happening in this moment, too. It's just

1120
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:55,920
like a lot of really cool worldwide

1121
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,800
possibilities for us to come together,

1122
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,880
not just as a community uh or a county

1123
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,400
or a state or a country, but a world

1124
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,838
now. It's crazy. We're taking it back

1125
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,200
over cuz we're still blown away that

1126
00:44:03,838 --> 00:44:07,358
they took it from us all these years

1127
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:09,118
ago. How did the world go hate the plant

1128
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:10,719
all at once? Such a money-driven

1129
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:12,400
scandal. And now we're turning the

1130
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:14,078
tables finally, right? And we're talking

1131
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,160
about a plant that for thousands and

1132
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:17,680
thousands of years we used it as

1133
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:20,078
medicine, right? And then all of a

1134
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:21,838
sudden it's gone, right? And then and

1135
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:23,599
then the people forget, right? They they

1136
00:44:21,838 --> 00:44:24,719
forget, right? It's easy to forget for

1137
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:26,318
people raised with it. So they're like,

1138
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:28,639
"Oh, it must be bad." We're told it's

1139
00:44:26,318 --> 00:44:30,559
bad, right? The stigma of it stays with

1140
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:32,559
people way longer than I somehow

1141
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:34,400
understand. Still there's that stigma,

1142
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:36,400
right? Still there slowly but surely

1143
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,639
because people our age, right? The next

1144
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,720
generation has changed. After our kids,

1145
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:42,480
it's over. Well, we got donors like us

1146
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:44,318
smoking hard and people seeing it and

1147
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,000
we're productive people. Exactly. You

1148
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:48,079
know, I mean, productive Americans.

1149
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,039
We're doing our job, you know. We smoke

1150
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:53,119
tough, but we get the job done for sure.

1151
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:54,400
That's right. Well, thank you guys so

1152
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,000
much for taking the time and I really,

1153
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,920
of course. Hey, thank you for having us.

1154
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,838
Shout out to James Loud. Shout out to

1155
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,680
everybody out there. Dope, dude. You

1156
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:03,199
guys killing it. Kaka. Much love,

1157
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:06,159
everybody.

1158
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:08,559
I'm at Spinabis 2025 with Eric from Flow

1159
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:11,199
Gardens. He just won third place last

1160
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:12,799
night for CBD. How are you doing, Eric?

1161
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:14,318
I'm doing good, James. Thanks for having

1162
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,920
me out, man. Absolutely, man.

1163
00:45:14,318 --> 00:45:17,559
Congratulations on the big win. I think

1164
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,440
it's a big deal. Going home with

1165
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:21,199
hardware, for those of you guys that

1166
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,559
don't know, it's a big deal. Spanabis is

1167
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:24,399
one of the biggest festivals in the

1168
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:26,559
world, and to go home with hardware your

1169
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:30,240
first time is a big deal. It is. It's

1170
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:31,599
actually a dream of mine. Uh fair dream

1171
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:33,439
of mine, and it's never happened. So,

1172
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:35,119
good job, dude. Like, thank you. Yeah. I

1173
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,400
mean, I won high time skin cups. I won

1174
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:38,960
other stuff and this is the last one.

1175
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,960
So, I won't be getting a Spanabis piece

1176
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,119
of hardware in my life from at least

1177
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,039
unless they have another life, right?

1178
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:47,039
Well, I entered your pl hoping that

1179
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:48,800
would win. Uh it didn't take the place,

1180
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:50,880
but that's okay. Yeah. I mean, that's

1181
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,720
indica is a tough category, right? Like

1182
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:55,200
there's a lot of good flour coming in

1183
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:56,959
for the for the entry, right? Yeah. So,

1184
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:59,960
yeah, THCA, you guys are crushing the

1185
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:02,800
THCA. Yeah. So, I was just smoking your

1186
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:04,800
flour with Meno dope, the applesauce,

1187
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,039
the high level C. That's That's high

1188
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,280
CBD. I was taking big hits out of a

1189
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:11,838
blunt. And the funny thing is I felt the

1190
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:14,000
tobacco more than I felt the weed in a

1191
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:15,279
good way. And like you can smoke a whole

1192
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,599
big freaking joint of it and you just

1193
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:20,119
feel amazing. Exactly. Yeah. But it

1194
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:23,119
satiates you in the same way that

1195
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:25,119
like Well, not in the same way a a

1196
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,559
non-alcoholic beer does, but like it

1197
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:27,838
satiates you in a way where if you like

1198
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:29,440
smoking, but you don't want the effect,

1199
00:46:27,838 --> 00:46:31,920
you don't want tight eyes, you don't

1200
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,679
want to be tired, uh it's a great

1201
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,200
alternative, right? Yeah. It gives you a

1202
00:46:33,679 --> 00:46:37,358
good head change and it lasts for like

1203
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:38,639
30 minutes, you know? Right. Well, thank

1204
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:41,039
you so much for taking the time. Of

1205
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:42,719
course. Thanks for having me, dude.

1206
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:45,440
How's it going everybody? Day three. I'm

1207
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:47,679
here with Kelly from Dragonfly Earth's

1208
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,280
Medicine. How are you doing today? I'm

1209
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:50,879
awesome. It's super nice to see you

1210
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,720
today, James. Absolutely. It's been a

1211
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,480
year since we saw each other. It has. We

1212
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:57,039
had a great debate last year. It was It

1213
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:59,838
was amazing. I love when people can talk

1214
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:02,079
about stuff openly and debate stuff and

1215
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:03,838
just, you know, and have a difference of

1216
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:06,960
opinion sometimes, but still be able to

1217
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:08,559
talk about it in a nice sensible way.

1218
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,159
Yeah. Yeah. Well, I feel like if it if

1219
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:11,920
there's respect for one another and

1220
00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:13,679
there's true respect for the plant, then

1221
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,599
it's really easy to find that common

1222
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:17,039
ground. I agree. And I think at the end

1223
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,480
of the day, we're all here because of a

1224
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:20,079
plant, right? Something that changes the

1225
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,760
world, something that makes the world a

1226
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:24,079
better place, something that makes us

1227
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,760
smile when we talk about it. Absolutely.

1228
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:27,920
And you really can feel that energy and

1229
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:30,079
vibration here. You know, the people

1230
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,920
that you meet from all over the world,

1231
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:34,079
multiple different languages, all

1232
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,920
different kinds of strains, and really

1233
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:37,599
the vibration is super high because

1234
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,079
cannabis just keeps us at that high

1235
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:42,160
vibration. Absolutely. So, what are some

1236
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:45,440
of the highlights of your trip so far?

1237
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:48,318
Oh. Oh gosh, I really We did a whole

1238
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:50,000
bunch of um club reviews this year and

1239
00:47:48,318 --> 00:47:51,358
that was really fun. At the beginning,

1240
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,119
we just thought, "Oh, we'll just sort of

1241
00:47:51,358 --> 00:47:54,400
mess around." and that it turns out that

1242
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:57,440
not a lot of people have done club

1243
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:59,358
reviews. So, I felt like so welcome and

1244
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:02,000
like family at every single club that we

1245
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:03,759
went into and to review them and really

1246
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,440
highlight them and put them out into the

1247
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,880
world. It felt really good. So, I'd say

1248
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,639
that was one of my highlights. That's

1249
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,920
awesome. Yeah. And it's such a I mean,

1250
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:11,440
they're saying it's the last year. I

1251
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,880
mean, that's kind of sad if it's going

1252
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,039
to be the last year, but everything

1253
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,800
evolves, right? So, it's never the end.

1254
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:18,239
Yeah. Yeah. And there's Berlin. There's

1255
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,079
other things. I love this city, though.

1256
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:21,759
This city is so special. This city is

1257
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:23,839
really special, especially to walk

1258
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:26,160
around in the night and I think a lot of

1259
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:28,239
our events are late night so there's

1260
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:30,159
that quiet time where nobody's out in

1261
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:33,759
the streets and you can really feel like

1262
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:35,598
the ancient city and I know I know that

1263
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:37,119
a lot of the other cannabis people are

1264
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:38,880
walking around because we see them late

1265
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:40,559
at night too and that's pretty magical

1266
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,318
here. Yeah, it really is. And there's so

1267
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:44,720
much energy and so much history here and

1268
00:48:42,318 --> 00:48:46,239
it's like from one place in one area to

1269
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:48,480
the next there's different energies. You

1270
00:48:46,239 --> 00:48:51,439
know, the Gothic corner has its own like

1271
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:53,519
strange energy like it can be kind of

1272
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,200
dark in certain places. Now, you look at

1273
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:57,440
some of the architecture and it's kind

1274
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:59,199
of dark some of it and and then, you

1275
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,119
know, you go into the Borne and it's I

1276
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:02,799
love I love Borne. It's like it's

1277
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:04,960
interesting. Yeah, the Borne district is

1278
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,400
one of my favorites as well. And then,

1279
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,480
you know, you add a little bit of micro

1280
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:11,358
doing or even some macro dosing to that

1281
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:13,199
and things are really interesting and it

1282
00:49:11,358 --> 00:49:14,799
comes alive in a whole different way.

1283
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:17,919
Yeah. Monzerat. If you guys haven't been

1284
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:20,318
to Monzerat, we have. It's so amazing. I

1285
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:22,240
love the energy there is so next level.

1286
00:49:20,318 --> 00:49:24,159
So next level. Yeah. I mean, there's

1287
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:25,759
like energy swirling out there, you

1288
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:27,199
know. And unless you see it, you would

1289
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:30,079
never understand what I'm talking about.

1290
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:32,719
Or maybe you would. You would. But uh

1291
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:36,079
Yeah. I love Monzerat. Yeah, I do too.

1292
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:38,639
and to really see that uh Madonna and

1293
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:40,800
then how it's recreated with, you know,

1294
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:42,879
the baby Jesus or whatever that vision

1295
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:46,240
is and the fact that it's in there. The

1296
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:48,000
mystery is really elusive and beautiful.

1297
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:50,399
Well, it's amazing that they hiked up

1298
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,880
into the mountains and carved this out

1299
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:55,039
of the the mountain side. Or did they?

1300
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:57,280
Or did they? Or did they? There's so

1301
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:59,679
many big questions here. You know, I'm

1302
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,480
really really more than anything I walk

1303
00:49:59,679 --> 00:50:03,838
around this city and I question our

1304
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:05,440
history and like, wait a minute, that

1305
00:50:03,838 --> 00:50:07,279
doesn't really make sense and maybe this

1306
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,960
doesn't make sense. But that's the

1307
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,960
mystery and the beauty of it all.

1308
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,720
Absolutely.

1309
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:14,480
Well, are you going to be in Germany?

1310
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:15,679
Going to be in Germany for sure. It's

1311
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,318
awesome. Yeah, we'll be there for

1312
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:19,838
probably ICBC as well as Mary Jane and

1313
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:21,920
maybe even having a little bit of a base

1314
00:50:19,838 --> 00:50:23,358
there for a while. Wow. Wow. Really

1315
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,880
cool. Yeah. Yeah. I'm really looking

1316
00:50:23,358 --> 00:50:26,639
forward. I've never been to Berlin. I

1317
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,400
missed last year, but I can't wait to go

1318
00:50:26,639 --> 00:50:29,679
this year. Yeah. So, we'll see you there

1319
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,880
for sure. Thank you so much for your

1320
00:50:29,679 --> 00:50:32,480
time. Thanks so much, James, for

1321
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,240
everything that you do. Thank you. Have

1322
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:36,159
a great day. Yeah. You're coming on the

1323
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:38,000
podcast in the near future. I'm coming,

1324
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:40,239
everybody. She's on the podcast in the

1325
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,318
near future. She said it here first. I'm

1326
00:50:40,239 --> 00:50:43,838
coming. Thanks, everybody. Thanks,

1327
00:50:42,318 --> 00:50:46,159
James.

1328
00:50:43,838 --> 00:50:48,558
I'm here with Aladdin Khalifa Genetics,

1329
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:50,318
Spanabis 2025.

1330
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:53,040
How you doing today? I'm very good,

1331
00:50:50,318 --> 00:50:54,639
James. Dude, how you doing? I'm doing

1332
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:56,079
fantastic. I'm I'm doing really good,

1333
00:50:54,639 --> 00:50:58,318
man. It's really great having you on the

1334
00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:00,400
show. We need to do another We need to

1335
00:50:58,318 --> 00:51:02,159
do a real podcast. I'd love to have you

1336
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:05,318
in California. Absolutely. It'd be an

1337
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:08,000
honor and a pleasure. So, you are the

1338
00:51:05,318 --> 00:51:09,920
exclusive so far, the exclusive guy with

1339
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,079
the books in Europe. If you need the

1340
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:14,079
breeding book, you're the guy to see.

1341
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:15,440
You get it on khalifetics.com.

1342
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:16,880
That's what I heard. Yeah. Apparently,

1343
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,318
we're the only ones in Europe. So,

1344
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:20,240
that's great. And you guys have been

1345
00:51:18,318 --> 00:51:21,838
selling through books, which is great.

1346
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:23,279
It's great for me. It's great for you.

1347
00:51:21,838 --> 00:51:25,279
It's great for the community. And the

1348
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,960
feedback on those books is great. Thank

1349
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:29,200
you. A lot of people that order from

1350
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,559
Germany mostly. Yeah. Some people from

1351
00:51:29,199 --> 00:51:33,118
France as well and Spain and the

1352
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:34,960
feedback is great. Great. Yeah. I mean,

1353
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:37,119
you contributed the book as well. A

1354
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:39,119
little bit. A little bit. It's all a

1355
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:40,640
little bit of everything together made

1356
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:41,920
the book what it is, right? Well, yeah.

1357
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:43,519
Without those components, the book

1358
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,519
wouldn't be what it was. Well, I was

1359
00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:47,599
very surprised by the quality of the

1360
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:50,159
info that's in it. you know, there's a

1361
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:52,800
lot of scientific terms and it goes

1362
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:54,078
really really in in depth into those

1363
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,640
things. You know, there's a lot of

1364
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:58,000
details and there's so many pictures and

1365
00:51:56,639 --> 00:52:00,879
like you said, there's so many people

1366
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,239
that contributed to it, too. Right.

1367
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,000
Yeah. And that's the beautiful thing

1368
00:52:02,239 --> 00:52:06,159
when we can collaborate on these levels.

1369
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,719
I mean, collaborating on genetics, we're

1370
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:10,399
doing some big collaborations coming up.

1371
00:52:08,719 --> 00:52:11,838
So, I'm looking forward to it. Yeah. And

1372
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,280
it's like I want to collaborate with

1373
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:14,960
everybody. I love being able to

1374
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,319
collaborate and work together with good

1375
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,760
people that are like-minded, sharing

1376
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:19,759
genetics, and we all have our own

1377
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:22,000
styles, right? That's the beauty of this

1378
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,520
whole thing is like I can use my style

1379
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,039
for genetics, you can use yours, and

1380
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:26,960
together we can collaborate and create a

1381
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:29,119
whole new thing. Well, yeah, cuz we all

1382
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:31,440
have different tastes and different ways

1383
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:33,519
of selecting of cultivating everything.

1384
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:35,200
So, totally different. But like once you

1385
00:52:33,519 --> 00:52:36,639
combine those two different things, you

1386
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:38,558
could get something very surprising,

1387
00:52:36,639 --> 00:52:40,318
right? Quality is so subjective. People

1388
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:41,839
think, oh no, quality is quality.

1389
00:52:40,318 --> 00:52:43,358
quality to you and quality to me.

1390
00:52:41,838 --> 00:52:45,279
Especially at that level, there's

1391
00:52:43,358 --> 00:52:46,639
there's like these nuances. Yeah. And

1392
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,079
that's what I love about it. Especially

1393
00:52:46,639 --> 00:52:50,078
some of these breeders. They Some guys

1394
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:52,318
are very outside the box. Some guys are

1395
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:54,800
very straightforward. They just do the

1396
00:52:52,318 --> 00:52:57,119
same thing over like everybody else. I I

1397
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:59,839
like the I like the innovative outside

1398
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:02,079
the box guys. Mhm. Well, like you said,

1399
00:52:59,838 --> 00:53:04,318
you know, like you said, it's like,

1400
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:06,079
well, it started, you know, with like

1401
00:53:04,318 --> 00:53:08,239
only THC and stuff like that and

1402
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:09,760
everybody was into THC. And now where

1403
00:53:08,239 --> 00:53:12,000
there there's a lot more people looking

1404
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:14,640
for different things, nuances of

1405
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,559
secondary canabonoids, rare turpps. So,

1406
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:18,239
now it's the market is evolving,

1407
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:20,079
maturing, and it's way better. So, I

1408
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:21,358
like it that way. Me, too. I can't wait

1409
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:22,800
to see where this goes in a couple

1410
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:25,199
years. How do you feel about it being

1411
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,318
the last Spanabis? This one? The last

1412
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:27,919
one? I didn't even know it was going to

1413
00:53:26,318 --> 00:53:29,400
be the last one till like what 2 weeks

1414
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,599
ago. Yeah. That's a little bit

1415
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:33,280
disappointing and I don't know the the

1416
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:34,480
reason why it's the last one. Honestly,

1417
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:36,079
they're tearing this whole building

1418
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,599
down. Yeah. But and so they're going to

1419
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:42,079
move it to they they say they're moving

1420
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:43,440
it to Bil Bao. Um but Bil Bao is not the

1421
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:44,640
same as Barcelona. It's different vibe

1422
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,318
and I think that's great. But I heard

1423
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:48,159
they're also going to be doing it on 420

1424
00:53:46,318 --> 00:53:49,519
weekend next year. Okay. So that's going

1425
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:51,440
to be really tough for me to go to

1426
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:53,759
unfortunately. Oh man. Yeah. And it's

1427
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:55,760
not as international as it is here. No.

1428
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,040
It's harder to fly there, right? So,

1429
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:59,599
yeah, everything is a little bit more

1430
00:53:57,039 --> 00:54:00,960
complicated. So, yeah, I'm I'm surprised

1431
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:03,200
that we're weren't able to find another

1432
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,559
venue here in Barcelona or in the area.

1433
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:07,118
This is my single favorite event of the

1434
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:08,400
year. Absolutely. I love Barcelona. Mary

1435
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:10,318
Jane, we're going this year. That'll be

1436
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:12,240
great, too. But yeah, and I watch your

1437
00:54:10,318 --> 00:54:15,039
podcast and you talk about Spanabis so

1438
00:54:12,239 --> 00:54:16,879
often on there. So, yeah. Well, I mean,

1439
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:18,318
I have so many good memories hanging out

1440
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,838
with people like yourself. It's like I

1441
00:54:18,318 --> 00:54:21,279
have so many friends and the only time I

1442
00:54:19,838 --> 00:54:23,920
see a lot of them is here. Yeah.

1443
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:25,119
Likewise, man. Yeah. very special. The

1444
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:27,200
weather is great. It's not that great

1445
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:28,800
over there. So, I don't know. So, what

1446
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:30,719
kind of new projects are you working on?

1447
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,559
So, we're working on a special project

1448
00:54:30,719 --> 00:54:35,118
with the Frosties Purple Freak, which is

1449
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:37,599
a mutant. Yeah. Which is also purple.

1450
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:40,400
Very tiry as well. Yeah. And you gifted

1451
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:42,720
us some seeds last year. And now we're

1452
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:45,440
trying to create an auto version of it

1453
00:54:42,719 --> 00:54:47,439
with one of your best autos. So, it's a

1454
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:49,119
very ambitious project. It's very, very

1455
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,358
hard. It takes a lot of plants, a lot

1456
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:53,920
of, you know, you need to hunt a lot in

1457
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:56,719
order to to recombine those highly

1458
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:58,318
recessive traits, but it's fascinating.

1459
00:54:56,719 --> 00:54:59,919
So whether it works, whether or not it

1460
00:54:58,318 --> 00:55:01,679
works, we'll see. But it's very

1461
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:03,200
interesting to be doing that. I believe

1462
00:55:01,679 --> 00:55:04,879
it'll work. It's just about how long it

1463
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:06,639
takes. I think it's a numbers game.

1464
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,400
Yeah, you're right. We'll see, man.

1465
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:10,400
Statistically, it's possible. We got

1466
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,720
Statistically, it's possible. It's just

1467
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:14,480
a matter of time. Yeah. Time and energy.

1468
00:55:12,719 --> 00:55:16,239
Time and energy. Yeah. Patience. But

1469
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:18,318
like when you're radar, you know that.

1470
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:20,719
Right. But yeah, it's the long game. Oh,

1471
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:22,318
yeah. If it we'd be growing flour if we

1472
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:24,078
didn't want to do seeds, for the short

1473
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:25,838
game, right? That's And I would like to

1474
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:27,760
ask you a couple questions. Sure. How

1475
00:55:25,838 --> 00:55:29,599
long have you been a breeder for before?

1476
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:31,680
Like you were a grower at first and I

1477
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:33,680
was a grower. I grew. Yeah. I started in

1478
00:55:31,679 --> 00:55:36,480
closets, right? Closet growing and then

1479
00:55:33,679 --> 00:55:37,838
breeding. Uh we started early 2000s

1480
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,199
playing around with it. I was a really

1481
00:55:37,838 --> 00:55:40,960
bad breeder in the beginning. I just,

1482
00:55:39,199 --> 00:55:44,318
you know, I was like, put some pawn on

1483
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:46,000
here. The the thing is is anybody could

1484
00:55:44,318 --> 00:55:47,838
make seeds in the whole world, right?

1485
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,280
Anybody who can get a male plant, take

1486
00:55:47,838 --> 00:55:51,039
that palm and put on a female plant can

1487
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,640
make seeds, right? The magic from

1488
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:54,400
breeding actually comes in the selection

1489
00:55:52,639 --> 00:55:55,920
process. You know, it's like you're

1490
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,119
talking about double recessive traits

1491
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,358
and stuff like that that you're working

1492
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:00,960
with. That's real breeding. I mean, it's

1493
00:55:59,358 --> 00:56:03,119
it's in the selection process finding

1494
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:05,519
those new phenos to actually breed with

1495
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:06,798
to to share with the world. Yeah. You

1496
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:08,000
make seeds, you want to call yourself a

1497
00:56:06,798 --> 00:56:09,358
breeder, I don't care. I don't really

1498
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,679
care what other people I look at myself

1499
00:56:09,358 --> 00:56:14,239
but like for myself breeding really was

1500
00:56:11,679 --> 00:56:16,879
like for the last 15 years we've been

1501
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:18,239
doing real work you know I mean I think

1502
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:19,599
for the last 15 years there's some guys

1503
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:21,679
that have been doing a lot longer you

1504
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:23,359
know but I think it's a passion-driven

1505
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:25,039
industry anybody that wants to breed can

1506
00:56:23,358 --> 00:56:26,558
breed you just have to understand that

1507
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:28,318
the selection process is the real

1508
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:29,839
breeding seed production is seed

1509
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:32,159
production yeah but I have a question

1510
00:56:29,838 --> 00:56:33,838
about that so do you think it can be a

1511
00:56:32,159 --> 00:56:35,679
breeder from the get or do you think it

1512
00:56:33,838 --> 00:56:37,838
has to be a pollen chuck at first and

1513
00:56:35,679 --> 00:56:40,078
then you start breeding after you get

1514
00:56:37,838 --> 00:56:41,679
get the hang of hunting and all that. I

1515
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:43,440
think it almost should always start as a

1516
00:56:41,679 --> 00:56:45,039
hobby. But I think you should learn how

1517
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:47,440
to grow really, really, really, really

1518
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:49,279
well so you can make the plant express

1519
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:51,200
cuz if you're not growing it well, it's

1520
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,480
hard to select your keepers. You know

1521
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:53,838
what I mean? Everything looks very

1522
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,760
similar, right? You're not getting the

1523
00:56:53,838 --> 00:56:57,199
expressions of the nose, you're not

1524
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:00,559
getting expressions of the structure

1525
00:56:57,199 --> 00:57:01,838
properly. U and so the better you grow,

1526
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:03,519
the better you can do selections, the

1527
00:57:01,838 --> 00:57:04,960
better breeder you become. Exactly.

1528
00:57:03,519 --> 00:57:07,358
Right. Yeah. You have to have that

1529
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,559
dialed in and then you can, you know,

1530
00:57:07,358 --> 00:57:10,239
take that to the next level, right?

1531
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:11,680
Don't just jump in the industry and I

1532
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:13,199
want to be a breeder. Like, yeah, you

1533
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:15,039
can want to be a breeder, but learn how

1534
00:57:13,199 --> 00:57:16,318
to set that foundation up for success.

1535
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:17,440
And read the book, right? And read the

1536
00:57:16,318 --> 00:57:18,960
book. Yeah, definitely. And read the

1537
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:21,039
book. Yeah, it's available online, too.

1538
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:22,240
So, but yeah, dude, thank you so much

1539
00:57:21,039 --> 00:57:23,759
for your support. Thanks, Billy, for

1540
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:25,199
your time as well. Absolutely. Thank

1541
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,119
you, man. I'm very glad to see you

1542
00:57:25,199 --> 00:57:29,919
again,

1543
00:57:26,119 --> 00:57:32,640
bro. Thank you, bro. Thank you. I'm here

1544
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:35,200
in Spamis with Dust. I know. from

1545
00:57:32,639 --> 00:57:37,440
greenhouse seeds strain hunters. You are

1546
00:57:35,199 --> 00:57:39,199
a strain hunter and you're I'm a

1547
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,798
wannabe, too. And you're a good friend.

1548
00:57:39,199 --> 00:57:42,879
Nah, you're and you're an amazing

1549
00:57:40,798 --> 00:57:45,199
person, dude. You're always happy. You

1550
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:47,599
have this contagious happiness vibe that

1551
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:50,239
just spreads throughout the industry. It

1552
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:51,920
touches everybody. I try to keep it

1553
00:57:50,239 --> 00:57:53,759
smiling, you know. Yeah. Yeah. Well,

1554
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:56,960
someone's got to be happy all the time.

1555
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:58,640
Not me, but man, it's it's contagious.

1556
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:01,280
You're a happy guy. Yeah. Yeah. I try to

1557
00:57:58,639 --> 00:58:03,679
be happy, dude. Don't be humble. So, so

1558
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:05,920
how's your spin of going? Great. Great.

1559
00:58:03,679 --> 00:58:07,838
It's uh Yeah, it's a lot of meetings,

1560
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:09,519
you know, a lot of people that you're

1561
00:58:07,838 --> 00:58:11,119
going to see probably for the last time

1562
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:12,639
cuz who knows what's going to be the

1563
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:15,960
future, you know. Yeah, that's when you

1564
00:58:12,639 --> 00:58:18,719
say it like that, it makes me sad. But I

1565
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:20,240
I there's some people from this industry

1566
00:58:18,719 --> 00:58:21,598
in Spain, you know, that would come

1567
00:58:20,239 --> 00:58:23,598
here. I don't know if they go to other

1568
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:25,920
places or so. Yeah. There's a lot of

1569
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:28,079
people I only see at Barnabas. Yeah. So,

1570
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:30,400
I'm appreciating every every minute, you

1571
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:32,318
know, I just say hello to everybody. A

1572
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,760
lot of people coming to say thank you

1573
00:58:32,318 --> 00:58:36,159
and stuff, you know. So, it's always

1574
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,920
amazing to meet all those people

1575
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:40,480
watching the videos. You never see them,

1576
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:41,920
you know. So, and you've been working in

1577
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:43,679
Thailand. You're doing all kinds of

1578
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:46,079
stuff out there. It looks pretty fun.

1579
00:58:43,679 --> 00:58:47,759

days a lot of plants fantastic so tell

1593
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:21,519
me about some famous amazing moments

1594
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:24,880
that you've had at Spenabus

1595
00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:26,960
uh Well, some of my best memories here

1596
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:29,440
go was before opening the club, you

1597
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:31,400
know. So maybe 2012, 2013, something

1598
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:33,920
like that was also the beginning of

1599
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:36,480
dabbing. So here you could really see

1600
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:38,318
the first really good BA shows, you

1601
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:41,119
know, like cuz in Spain it was not a big

1602
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:43,039
scene yet, extractor scene. Oh yeah. So

1603
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:45,119
people from America would bring great

1604
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:46,480
stuff, you know, and so it was the first

1605
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:48,160
times that you had those kind of

1606
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,358
turppins that get to your mouth cuz it

1607
00:59:48,159 --> 00:59:51,358
was a [ __ ] kick in the face, you

1608
00:59:49,358 --> 00:59:52,880
know. You guys was over turppins, right?

1609
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:54,880
that all with Franco. It's just the

1610
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:58,079
amount of of flavor, you know, that you

1611
00:59:54,880 --> 01:00:00,318
get from a BH dab at that moment in the

1612
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:02,400
history, you know, it's like, wo, what

1613
01:00:00,318 --> 01:00:04,480
is that, you know? Yeah. Mind-blowing.

1614
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:06,079
So, I I still remember those days, you

1615
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:08,480
know, and yeah, great times, you know,

1616
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:10,400
and hanging out with Don and Aaron. They

1617
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:12,000
always had really good extracts and

1618
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,760
stuff, you know, and and then the

1619
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,400
Spanish people here got really good at

1620
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:19,440
it. So, Oh, yeah. They really did. You

1621
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:21,760
know, it's funny the evolution from 15

1622
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:23,519
years ago in Spain to now with

1623
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:25,599
extraction, with flour, with everything

1624
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:26,880
else. Exponential exponential growth.

1625
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:28,240
And you know, people are they take it

1626
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,440
real seriously here too. The guys that

1627
01:00:28,239 --> 01:00:30,798
are really passionate about it take it

1628
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,480
serious. I would I would say that some

1629
01:00:30,798 --> 01:00:34,960
of the best hashmaker in the world are

1630
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:37,039
in Spain now. Most of them are Italian,

1631
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:38,639
including everybody. Yeah. They all

1632
01:00:37,039 --> 01:00:40,239
here, you know. Yeah, they're all here.

1633
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:42,159
And they all got inspired by this

1634
01:00:40,239 --> 01:00:44,479
culture, you know, by this energy that's

1635
01:00:42,159 --> 01:00:46,239
in Spain, right? in Barcelona in

1636
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:47,679
particular. You know, Barcelona is a

1637
01:00:46,239 --> 01:00:49,679
different vibes. Yeah, I've seen some

1638
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:50,960
amazing hash in the last couple days and

1639
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:53,199
all over the place. You know, a lot of

1640
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:55,039
stuff is amazing. Great hash, great

1641
01:00:53,199 --> 01:00:57,598
flowers. Yeah. In the States, we have

1642
01:00:55,039 --> 01:00:59,039
like the papayas and the GMOs and stuff.

1643
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:00,559
There's a lot of diversity out here and

1644
01:00:59,039 --> 01:01:01,838
diversity with types of hash. A lot of

1645
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:04,319
people still love bubble hash. It

1646
01:01:01,838 --> 01:01:06,000
doesn't have to be rosin. Yeah. I love

1647
01:01:04,318 --> 01:01:07,358
it.

1648
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,679
And we still have the love for the

1649
01:01:07,358 --> 01:01:11,759
Moroccan, too. Oh, yeah. The real the

1650
01:01:09,679 --> 01:01:13,519
real tradition. This is where Europe is

1651
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:15,440
really attractive, you know, right? You

1652
01:01:13,519 --> 01:01:17,039
also have like the roots. Yeah, for

1653
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:18,880
sure. You got the new school, the old

1654
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:21,759
school all together and everything in

1655
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:23,200
between. Yeah, that's all there. Nice.

1656
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:26,980

the first American seed company to

1724
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:30,079

others in front of us. you know, we

1726

could do it, right? Yeah, you could do

1734
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:49,200
it. Like you just put your foot on the
