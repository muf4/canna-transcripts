79
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:19,039
genetics not not a lot of them but a lot

80
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,560
of the good ones through our group of

81
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:23,878
friends came from Eugene you we got the

82
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,039
dog Bud from Eugene which was the it was

83
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:28,239
a chem a chem dog bag seed I think West

84
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:30,359
Coast dog the dog was my first

85
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,319
introduction to the chem family

86
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,319
oh yeah and I got it and I was like

87
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:36,079
smelled like chlorine and gas and it was

88
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:39,039
like

89
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,680

I had that actually that feno still

91
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,040
because that was I think it's still

92
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,599
around okay it's still around yeah and

93
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:47,479
that's like a yeah it's wild because it

94
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:49,000
grows very much like the sour and then

95
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:50,438
it finishes different like different

96
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,840
structure at the end without a doubt it

97
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:54,318
was it was so cool and yeah good times

98
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,319
yeah so you've been around a while yeah

99
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:58,199
a little bit you know yeah yeah yeah

100
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:02,518
especially from the areas that I know I

101
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:05,039
mean let me know what you think of that

102
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:08,158
nice and we had Dave from

103
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,359
budo with the old school sour this is so

104
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:11,840
I was kind of thinking my mind was

105
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,879
playing tricks on me uh because so many

106
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,079
people have they showing me sour over

107
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:18,478
the last two years especially and I've

108
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,120
been looking for the sour cut and then

109
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,839
this guy Dave comes up to me at re in

110
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,360
the river with buds in his hand he goes

111
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:26,319
tell me when you think of this you know

112
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,199
and you can be honest and so I'm like

113
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,839
Dave Dave from Eugene Dave no Dave from

114
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:34,520

117
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,000

118
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,879
that that yeah he's he's really great so

119
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,240
but but he had the real deal and and it

120
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:48,600
reminded me of the original sour that we

121
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,960
had when there was only one sour totally

122
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,240
yeah no that the one that was going I

123
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:53,918
mean at least from what I knew the the

124
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,639
sour around Eugene it wasn't even really

125
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:58,439
called East Coast Sour Diesel then it

126
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:00,600
was called sour you know exactly and it

127
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:02,000
was an amazing cut really I mean what's

128
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,039
sad is I let it go just because I was

129
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,839
over it you know I mean I didn't because

130
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:08,680
we had other things going and I just

131
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:10,758
didn't you know I was like ah whatever

132
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,400
you know I wish I wouldn't have but um I

133
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:14,160
was smart and gave it to a family member

134
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:15,758
and had gotten it back six times before

135
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,680
they ended up getting rid of it you know

136
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,720
so so I really had to go back up into

137
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,759
Washington to get it a bunch of times I

138
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,759
wish I would have did that with the

139
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:24,680
original um that big sir holy cut that

140
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:27,560
was going around Eugene the purple stem

141
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,959
you know it was one of my favorites and

142
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,120
you know some of those ones you just

143
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:33,159
don't do that with you know right over

144
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,280
the time you know I've lost so many good

145
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,880
things over the years I mean there was a

146
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:39,559
there was a we had a shaman that was

147
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,719
like a Romulan Shaman backcross that was

148
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,560
it should have been called the shaman

149
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,199
but it was called the

150
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,519
shaman and that was some amazing stuff

151
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,759
and I just I I can smell it to this day

152
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:52,959
like in the back of my nose the perfumey

153
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,720
incens of it and there's so many like

154
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:56,038
things like that that we had that you

155
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,479
know got lost along the Wayside we

156
00:05:56,038 --> 00:06:00,680
didn't have the preservation techniques

157
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:01,959
that we have today no no and we didn't

158
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,800
you know we weren't thinking like that

159
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:05,719
then I mean I was saving a lot of things

160
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,439
cuz if I liked it I felt like I had to

161
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,599
save it hold it give it to my friends or

162
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:11,560
at least the family that you want them

163
00:06:09,598 --> 00:06:13,759
to have that blessing you know and that

164
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,280
experience of what you're you know

165
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,080
because it's it's not to say it's rare

166
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:18,318
there's a lot of amazing keeper fenos

167
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:21,159
that are going around of all types of

168
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,598
cultivars but the ones that you're that

169
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,400
are drawing you from growth stage all

170
00:06:23,598 --> 00:06:27,918
the way to the right when you're

171
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:29,399
lighting the bong or whatever and it's

172
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:31,359
like right when it starts to go you know

173
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:33,719
like it's registering there it's a

174
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,000
keeper there you know you know like

175
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,080
those ones those are the ones that you

176
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
can have in your jar for 10 20 plus

177
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:44,240
years like and always have it you know

178
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,639
those are I really have um felt a you

179
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,120
know kind of a stewardship in my own

180
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:49,800
mind to hold some of those of what I've

181
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,560
what have crossed this boundary you know

182
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,439
because we all have our own bio assay

183
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,720
right so like for me I have what works

184
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:59,680
for me but it you know if it isn't

185
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,840
strong and powerful on a tarpine and a

186
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,400
you know cannaboid level it's probably

187
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:06,638
not making it through you know but when

188
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:08,120
they do and you notice all the elites

189
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,598
that people are holding on they are up

190
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,000
in that upper threshold most of them are

191
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:16,000
you know in between 20 and 30% most of

192
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,120
them are pretty high tur profile and

193
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,839
unique you know right so yeah I mean I

194
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,560
think I refocused and I talk about a lot

195
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:24,918
of my podcast but I really refocused

196
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,598
since 420 and this year on effect and

197
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:28,680
going back in that direction how does it

198
00:07:26,598 --> 00:07:31,598
make me feel and how does it make other

199
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,840
people feel totally we've Instagram has

200
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:35,680
taken us in this direction where it's

201
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:38,359
like how does it look guys you know bro

202
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,439
it's good it's so Frosty it's so and

203
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,240
it's like but that doesn't tell you how

204
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:44,000
it tastes and how it makes you feel and

205
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,280
I mean there's so many things out there

206
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,158
effect wise that I'm revisiting where

207
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:50,119
I'm like whoa you know that creeper weed

208
00:07:48,158 --> 00:07:51,598
that kicks in after 15 minutes it really

209
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,800
gets you right and you're all bugged out

210
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:56,079
a little bit you're like hm yeah where

211
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,720
you I took a full bong rip and I was

212
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:59,878
like I'm not even high so I took another

213
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,319
one and then like literally 5 minutes

214
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:04,039
later I'm like oh yeah this is that

215
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:07,120
creeper and uh it was some Mother's weed

216
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:09,360
from Johnny at Huckleberry Hill Farms

217
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,840
that stuff is pretty special um you know

218
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,598
he has the white Thorn Rose which is

219
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:14,519
very like I've heard of that one not

220
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:16,079
Indica not sativa where you know

221
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:18,158
everyone wants to classify these things

222
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:19,878
as indic ctiv but it's it's a hybrid in

223
00:08:18,158 --> 00:08:21,120
the middle and it it's Feelgood weed it

224
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:23,280
makes you just feel good you can smoke

225
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,598
it in the morning afternoon evening the

226
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,359
rosin's purple it's something special

227
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:29,719
and the effect of it is extremely

228
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,000
special and then he has a basically the

229
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:36,158
same progyny he has another plant and it

230
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,918
does a it has a very different effect it

231
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:40,080
does different things to your to your

232
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:41,478
mind and it creeps up on you and it it

233
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,719
makes you feel good but it really kind

234
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:45,879
of it's it's a more intense version of

235
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:47,160
that effect and I love that you know I

236
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:49,320
love strains like that like I have the

237
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:52,039
hazy Kush and I you know it was actually

238
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,800
my attempt to recreate the Big Sir holy

239
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:55,199
you know not different genetics but

240
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:57,399
looking for the similar effect and

241
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,480
similar style and morphology and things

242
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:02,240
like that but it's one of those strains

243
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,839
that like if you're on a good one yeah

244
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,399
it'll really put you on a good one

245
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,360
euphoric super stimulating super

246
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,159
energizing but if you're on a bad one

247
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:13,759
and in a kind of depressed state it'll

248
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:16,399
make you like on a dud you're like what

249
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:19,399
you know what I mean it's um you know

250
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,120
one time this uh you know this U artist

251
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:22,720
that we worked with gift a gab from

252
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,480
black alicious you know and he's passed

253
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,040
now rest so like uh we did a show with

254
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,680
him and my friend gave him a chunk of

255
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,360
hazy Kush right off the top of the jar

256
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:32,679
you know and he went out and smoked a

257
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,240
joint you know and my buddy's like hey

258
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:35,879
bro I go I busted in your jar and gave

259
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,000
him gave him a nug gave gab a nug I was

260
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:39,519
like hopefully it wasn't that one off

261
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
the top bro he's all like oh it was dude

262
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,039
I was like that was the hazy bro he's

263
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,278
all no you know because this dude my

264
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:46,519
friend couldn't even smoke this weed

265
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:49,078
because it like wow you know kind of put

266
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:51,278
him on one you know right sure enough 30

267
00:09:49,078 --> 00:09:53,359
minutes into gab's set he comes off

268
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:54,720
stage cuz he threw his back out you know

269
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,560
first thing they're coming backstage

270
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,759
down the hall and my buddy's like hey

271
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:00,719
man here's my do John you know just I'm

272
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:02,838
like hey what's up he oh dude my back

273
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,240
bro my back he's all how do I sound you

274
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,360
know I was like oh was like that you

275
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,919
know I was like oh he's sounding good

276
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,680
bro let's go like you know so we we we

277
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:10,879
worked it out did a meditation you know

278
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:12,239
did some breathing you know and then

279
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:13,439
they went it was a New Year's Eve shows

280
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,600
and then they went out and crushed it at

281
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,360
New Year's but like it was an hour of

282
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,278
like you know sometimes weed will put a

283
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,839
put a HTT on someone that's not a you

284
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:25,679
know all day user kind of guy 100% yeah

285
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,120
and it's so subjective to the individual

286
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:30,120
and you know we all are so different in

287
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,679
in what we like I mean there's stuff

288
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:35,120
that I think we can agree on across the

289
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:36,919
board at times but then we're also you

290
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,600
know as far as tolerances and other

291
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:42,000
things like that I mean some people love

292
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,519
the you know the uplifting and some

293
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,919
people love the narcotic totally and you

294
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,600
can go and the beauty of the plan is you

295
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:50,078
can go in any direction with it you know

296
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,399
there's so many different oh yeah salads

297
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:54,958
I love salads too flavor-wise right um

298
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:56,799
and you know I think that's coming as

299
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:58,359
far as rosin guys blending their rosin

300
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:59,599
flavors I mean it's it's a great they've

301
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,720
done it with wine and other things

302
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,879
forever for sure for sure yeah no that's

303
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,839
the thing is there's it's so there's so

304
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:08,519
many people and so many styles of

305
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:10,800
chemistry you know so like to be able to

306
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:12,278
offer that and people have to understand

307
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:14,439
their own chemistry and what works for

308
00:11:12,278 --> 00:11:16,000
them you know like for me I you know I

309
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,360
consistently smoke about three different

310
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,879
strains and even though I may have 30

311
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,039
jars I'm literally still picking from

312
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:24,958
three of those jars yeah and I put you

313
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:27,078
know a nug from each one of those jars

314
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,799
in my jar for the day and like that's

315
00:11:27,078 --> 00:11:30,319
kind of like how I roll you know and and

316
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:33,278
that'll change but there's some that

317
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:36,240
have lasted through time that are been

318
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:38,159
that way for 10 15 20 years now you know

319
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,600
and like and those ones you know like

320
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:41,919
and like like I was you know was telling

321
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,519
you at the show you know it's like I'm

322
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:45,319
definitely not I don't consider myself a

323
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,278
breeder in any way but I can select

324
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,519
decently you know and what I'm selecting

325
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:51,679
and how I'm selecting I'm I'm really

326
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,519
selecting for myself but because I know

327
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:57,039
I'm a pretty big critic and what I can

328
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:59,278
offer others through my own selection

329
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:01,000
you know cuz I am extreme critic I think

330
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:02,639
think they'll appreciate it at least you

331
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,639
know and like totally well I honestly

332
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,959
feel like that's more important than

333
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,200
being able to make seeds because as a

334
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:10,319
breeder the breeding part is doing this

335
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,639
selection right so at the end of the day

336
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,959
you know everybody's like Oh I'm a

337
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:15,198
breeder I'm a breeder well what kind of

338
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:16,559
selections are you making you know it's

339
00:12:15,198 --> 00:12:19,359
like yeah you made some seeds that's

340
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:21,119
cool but show me show me uh some years

341
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,240
of progress and where you went with it

342
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,399
and what you're doing and you know have

343
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,919
you improveed the the gene pool or you

344
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:28,720
just you know trying to make some money

345
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:30,198
and I think there's and there's nothing

346
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,839
wrong with either one but let's just be

347
00:12:30,198 --> 00:12:35,278
real about it like breeding you know in

348
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:36,560
in my book I kind of go into it as well

349
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:38,120
but the breeding is really through the

350
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:40,479
selection process and that's what makes

351
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,480
a good breeder is like okay well you can

352
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,519
take 50 seeds and you can pick the best

353
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,639
one or maybe the best three or whatever

354
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:49,198
it is you know and be able to have that

355
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:51,600
translated into something that's long

356
00:12:49,198 --> 00:12:53,159
lasting for sure I mean and that's why

357
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,240
I've done um doing a lot of work with

358
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:58,039
the 89 nl5 you know um SBD gave me these

359
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,120
seeds they come from Melvin eics work

360
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:02,639
that you know they did with uh the 89

361
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,159
nl5 from Neville you know and right well

362
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,079
I was kind of skeptical about it because

363
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:09,480
I had some stuff from Jim from himba and

364
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:11,559
you know before he passed and amazing

365
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,560
amazing nl5 but it was what I was

366
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:16,039
expecting right you know what I mean it

367
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:19,359
was what I was expecting it wasn't as

368
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:21,439
strong you know it wasn't current day

369
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,399
cannabis what I was expecting but it was

370
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,480
was what I was expecting on a you know

371
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:28,799
on that kind of set but then I had this

372
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:30,440
89 NL right by it and at first I was

373
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:32,039
like oh they weren't growing as fast so

374
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,959
I was kind of you know but then I

375
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:37,439
noticed some really interesting

376
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:39,399
traits and I'm not kidding over the next

377
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,040
three weeks the way they formed and I

378
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:44,198
mean one of them was straight Afghani

379
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:47,198
you know like

380
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:49,559
chocolate ACD look you know reminded me

381
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:50,799
of purple Bubba kind of you know right

382
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:53,078
and then the other one reminded me of a

383
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:55,240
chem sour you know so I was like oh this

384
00:13:53,078 --> 00:13:57,198
I'm like and what was crazy is I'm like

385
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:00,278
oh this must something must be not right

386
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:02,439
do you know what I mean and and then um

387
00:14:00,278 --> 00:14:04,480
but I was really impressed but I'm like

388
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:07,560
between these two plants I'm looking at

389
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,360
80% of cannabis right now between these

390
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:12,758
two you know what I mean and what that

391
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:15,519
can create there and luckily like um hor

392
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:16,879
santes came into town and um came over

393
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,679
and he stayed with me for like a week

394
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:21,439
you know and at at that time when I had

395
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:23,120
those pollinated MH on the deck you know

396
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,079
just two plants on my deck you know

397
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,959
actually just cuz I was just letting

398
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:27,919
them go longer I had to do stuff with

399
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:29,719
that room you know you get it totally

400
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:32,198
and I was like hey man can you verify

401
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:35,160
these cuz you're you were around you

402
00:14:32,198 --> 00:14:38,000
know you were like and he's like that's

403
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:39,958
dude what you know he was so shocked he

404
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,799
got Ron krift on the phone which was one

405
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:43,758
of Neville's main apprentices you know

406
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:45,399
wow how we are like FaceTiming and he

407
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:50,079
was there were just like I was just

408
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:53,120
tripping you know cu the level of

409
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:56,679
quality that then that made sense how

410
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,639
the lore made it that long so right um

411
00:14:56,679 --> 00:15:01,078
putting that into it you'll see some

412
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,159
stuff from over here and I've put that

413
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:05,439
by a lot of things and you know things

414
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:07,360
like the sour best [ __ ] ever which is

415
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,360
you know there's a lot of you know

416
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,360
misinformation about that strain in my

417
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,278
opinion it's one of the best OG Cuts you

418
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:18,000
know right um so like putting the 89 NL

419
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:19,720
to that making these super stinky chem

420
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,839
you know very interesting you know like

421
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:25,360
I it's kind of um to see and this and

422
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,240
you know Jimmy from original breeders

423
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,440
League he um did a huge you know he did

424
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,079
his huge thing you know [ __ ] very

425
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,639
beautiful impressive thing and but did

426
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:38,758
some um you know testing on the 89 NL

427
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:41,600
and that was extremely stable you know

428
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:45,159
and and I see the breeding tress through

429
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:48,480
all the breeding it creates such

430
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:50,639
beautiful potential but still holds true

431
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,319
a lot of its morphology a lot of its

432
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:56,120
Tendencies which in that case is good

433
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:58,519
you know and so I'm trying to basically

434
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,560
bring that into all the the current day

435
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:03,360
Elite

436
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:04,559
and kind of revigor revigor the you know

437
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,079
not saying I'm like oh I'm going to make

438
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:07,359
the Jean Pool better or nothing like

439
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:08,919
that but no no well you're not taken

440
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,800
away from it that's for sure but I feel

441
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:12,318
like uh you know I'm doing something

442
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:14,318
similar I'm taking old school cuts and

443
00:16:12,318 --> 00:16:18,120
mirring to New School Cuts Fort Collins

444
00:16:14,318 --> 00:16:20,639
cough old chems uh and I really like

445
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,078
that approach because I feel like we're

446
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,600
bottlenecking ourselves into these

447
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:26,679
gelato and runts and Skittles and these

448
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,240
things we we tend to do that just as as

449
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:31,078
it's human nature right

450
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,639
double down on it right yeah for sure

451
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:34,278
yeah it's I mean with medicine it's like

452
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,600
oh it works good so let's take twice as

453
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:38,318
much right I mean that that's just human

454
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,519
nature it's okay with mushrooms but most

455
00:16:38,318 --> 00:16:42,439
other things exactly with your mushrooms

456
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:44,560
yeah I mean you learn real quick you

457
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,279
know but medicinal mushrooms are like

458
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:48,119
you know like Lion's man stuff y from

459
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:49,720
when I heard Michael Symbio talking he's

460
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,198
like you should be eating so much of

461
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,040
those that you smell like mushrooms I

462
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:56,719
was like ah that sounds medicinal that

463
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:58,958
sounds extremely medicinal you're swea

464
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,800
and sweating Lion's man smell you know I

465
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:02,719
love being able to sneak old school

466
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:05,240
stuff into the new market where it's

467
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,519
like people like oh yeah I love that and

468
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,798
it's like I have a blue dream double

469
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:11,558
Lemon Cherry right that has a little bit

470
00:17:09,798 --> 00:17:13,639
of that blue what's special about blue

471
00:17:11,558 --> 00:17:16,558
dream and it has like it's unmistakable

472
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:18,520
blue dream with a with a structure of of

473
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:21,759
a gelato or these lemon cherries you

474
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:23,318
know and so I love being able to kind of

475
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:24,838
sneak that in under the rug where people

476
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:26,720
are like whoa that's freaking amazing

477
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:29,079
and they're haters of Blue Dream you

478
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,600
know and I I love Blue Dream for its own

479
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:31,960
in its own right Blue Dream is one of

480
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:33,639
the best plants out there as far as

481
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,519
struct structure it's the apical of

482
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:38,600
structure it yields well it's you know

581
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:00,599

was like it was junk man it was like

586
00:21:06,038 --> 00:21:09,720

you know but uh and with good genetics

600
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:41,200
and I went out and dug my soil out from

601
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:43,038
King of state's uh apple orchard just

602

and perlite and you know oyster shell

604
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,079
whatever green sand didn't realize at

605
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,880
that time green sand takes so long to

606
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:52,038
break down you don't even like it's like

607
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,080
but like there's some green sand in

608
00:21:52,038 --> 00:21:57,278
there some guos and just water and was

609
00:21:55,079 --> 00:22:00,599
[ __ ] sick you know like it was like

610

612
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,440
know because if because really you know

613
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:10,038
with good genetics if you don't

614
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,519
overwater underwater overfeed or you

615
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:12,879
know you can underfeed good genetics

616
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:14,400
you'll still be Dang if you're good soil

617
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,159
and good genetics you're you're halfway

618
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,519
there you know like and then there's the

619
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,760
drawing and that's a whole another

620
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:22,000
conversation but yeah I mean genetics

621
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:26,359

622
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,798
product totally I mean it's so you know

623
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:30,798

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,038
grow in Trinity Big Sir you know like

644
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:13,918
two bedrooms full no filter just using

645
00:23:12,038 --> 00:23:15,400
the box fan with the like attic fan on

646
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,240
it you know making a box with the attic

647
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,320
fan and the V you know the ducting out

648
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:23,440
of it like that was your setup you know

649
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:25,439
to plug that into a carbon filter I mean

650
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,038
I remember one time I pulled I I pulled

651
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,080
up to my house you know getting ready to

652
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:32,278
turn in I can smell the trend you know

653
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:33,599
just like on the road oh yeah this had

654
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:36,038
multiple times and right when I was

655
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:38,079
about to turn in four

656
00:23:36,038 --> 00:23:41,480
sheriffs just right in front of my house

657
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:43,599
I'm like oh my God and then they went

658
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,360
two blocks two houses down they just

659
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:46,678
stopped and then they drove two houses

660
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:49,079
down I pulled in and they were like

661
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:52,679
getting the guy I was just like oh my

662
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:54,119
god oh man bugging bro you know yeah

663
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:55,880
they were such a game changer CU I mean

664
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:58,719
I remember growing some Kem back in the

665
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:00,840
day and and it just the whole whole

666
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,360
house smelled but even the neighbors

667
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:03,959
down the street were like there's a

668
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:05,240
skunk there's have you guys seen the

669
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,400
skunk and I thought they were [ __ ]

670
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,679
with me but they really thought it was a

671
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,960
skunk like literally thought it was a

672
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:12,000
skunk because it was so strong for sure

673
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,720
well it smells so much like a live skunk

674
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,319
uhuh yeah especially a lot of stuff we

675
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,120
had back in the day compared especially

676
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:19,038
Trinity even you know I mean to be

677
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:21,519
honest I haven't smelled anything more

678
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:23,519
skunky than that than the original Royal

679
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:25,720
Tren yeah I have a trinity cut now it's

680
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:28,119
the future Trend cuz you know we had the

681
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:30,038
Trinity and then this other Trinity came

682
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:32,079
like after and we called it the future

683
00:24:30,038 --> 00:24:33,599
Trend a little more dense a little more

684
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:37,119
that's the one going around right now

685
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:38,558
it's not the old school one there's a

686
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:40,079
lot of things that are like that where

687
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:41,759
they're like durban's another one like

688
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:44,480
it's a different Durban than I remember

689
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:47,038
the Durban wasn't a terpinolene dominant

690
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,960
you know Aroma on it it was like it was

691
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:52,359
cherries and it was funky and you know

692
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,840
anise ah so it was like licorice

693
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:56,439
cherries and strong and pungent and then

694
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:58,558
the stuff now that I see is Durban and

695
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,960
super hazy ah yeah you know and it's

696
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:01,398
very very Haz likee and that wasn't the

697
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,840
Durban that I remember the Durban we had

698
00:25:01,398 --> 00:25:05,239
was like orange like orange yarn hair

699
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:06,918
growing over that would cover like it

700
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,159
didn't look like it had tricomes on it

701
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:10,919
you P pulled the hairs back a little

702
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:12,600
interesting but yeah so many things were

703
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:15,880
like that but yeah that Trinity

704
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:17,678
extremely extremely special for sure U

705
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,559
yeah and it's like finding it yeah

706
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,600
that's pretty amazing well yeah one

707
00:25:19,558 --> 00:25:23,440
person I know has it but you know

708
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:25,398
obviously getting old school genetics

709
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,080
from Old School TP types of people it's

710
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:28,719
a it's a process in itself you know what

711
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:31,119
I mean for sure well there's a reason

712
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,079
they're not out there probably a good

713
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:34,839
reason a lot of stuff you know you know

714
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:37,079
I have things that I won't let go you

715
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:38,720
know like um Graham you know he gave me

716
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:40,480
the phk and I did some breeding with it

717
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,798
but I won't let that cut go right it

718
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,759
won't um same with Brandon he gave me

719
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:46,278
the Afghani bull rider same thing I'm

720
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:48,079
you know it's well I think we're

721
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:51,079
stewards of these plants it's our job to

722
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:52,439
protect them not just to keep them alive

723
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:53,599
and share them with everybody which a

724
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,240
lot of people think oh yeah you should

725
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:57,079
share them with everybody no I mean as a

726
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:59,359
steward you should be responsible with

727
00:25:57,079 --> 00:26:00,439
them for sure just like I mean just like

728
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:01,678
everything you know we see what's

729
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,720
happening in the industry and the

730
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,278
stewardship that is happening and that

731
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,640
isn't that could be you know there's a

732
00:26:06,278 --> 00:26:10,079
there's a big thing that's happening um

733
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,679
but there's more that could happen

734
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:14,278
especially with notoriety and um

735
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:16,240
publicity a lot of people are getting if

736
00:26:14,278 --> 00:26:18,679
they were to utilize that and really

737
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,720
turn it instead of for financial gain

738
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:22,679
and still keep the financial gain part

739
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,880
but really do it for philanthropic

740
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:26,320
reasons for the right reason stewarding

741
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,760
I agree you know whatever their even

742
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:29,398
their perspective of relationship is

743
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:31,038
with the plan but if they stewarded that

744
00:26:29,398 --> 00:26:33,239
for others you know instead of it being

745
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:35,879
more superficial and right you know well

746
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:37,440
once it's authentic it's just and the

747
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,360
thing is all these things they come

748
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,080
across as either authentic or not we you

749
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:42,519
can see right through all the [ __ ] a

750
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:43,678
lot of times you know well I think the

751
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:46,079
plan helps with that too you know it

752
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,600
sure does um shed the veil and cut the

753
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:50,558
veil and you know really um in our own

754
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:52,359
self and our own behavior and mental

755
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:54,879
dispositions and in the outside world

756
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:57,639
too well you know I was so excited at TP

757
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,000
Nami this last weekend because of the

758
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,520
quality level level of breeders that

759
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,880
were there all in one place a lot of

760
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:07,918
emerald cut people right uh but

761
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:10,000
more sativa leaning hybrids or sativas

762
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:12,640
that I'd ever seen in one place at one

763
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,398
time that outnumbered the gelato and

764
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,120
outnumbered the cookie crosses and the

765
00:27:15,398 --> 00:27:19,678
stuff that we've really seen to as

766
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:20,719
modern cannabis the you know the PE

767
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,840
there was a lot of people from the hills

768
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,200
coming down which I love it and we were

769
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:27,678
seeing these long flowering varieties in

770
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:31,558
in abundance in from all over Jesse from

771
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:33,240
B Vex we had mark from Gray shock uh we

772
00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:36,720
had you know Jackson was there mean

773
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:39,200
jeene and rebel grown and and a bunch of

774
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,159
people coming together with all these

775
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,679
old school genetics and all old school

776
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:44,559
Expressions stuff that you know maybe

777
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:46,640
it's a new cross but a lot of stuff I've

778
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:50,038
seen before you know 15 years ago 20

779
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,519
years ago that gets me excited and it

780
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:52,960
gives me hope for the future to be

781
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:54,120
honest I feel like that kind of stuff

782
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,000
when there's all these great people we

783
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:58,158
got a group photo of everybody sh was

784
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,398
there uh you know and then we had Arian

785
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,519
from Greenhouse coming out and he was

786
00:27:59,398 --> 00:28:02,038
like shaking his head like what are

787
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:04,759
these Americans doing I've never seen

788
00:28:02,038 --> 00:28:07,319
this happen before and uh you know so

789
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:08,720
that gives me hope that we can get

790
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:10,278
ourselves out of this bottleneck where

791
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,558
it's all gelato and I feel like there's

792
00:28:10,278 --> 00:28:13,398
nothing wrong with gelados there's

793
00:28:11,558 --> 00:28:15,278
nothing wrong with these purple candy

794
00:28:13,398 --> 00:28:18,319
gas varieties but there's more to

795
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:20,038
cannabis than just those things for sure

796
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:21,319
there's more than Instagram you know

797
00:28:20,038 --> 00:28:23,440
there's nothing wrong with Instagram and

798
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:25,359
it can be used as a positive tool I

799
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,240
think it has its benefits it has

800
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:28,839
benefits for both of us you know I think

801
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,880
it helps us promote our Brands but at

802
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:32,480
the same time you don't get to smell it

803
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,440
you don't get to taste it and you don't

804
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,240
get to feel the effect exactly and I

805
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,880
mean I think that's what's um really

806
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,720
it's education and I think that's what a

807
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:42,120
lot of us that have been around a while

808
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:44,399
should be doing just my personal opinion

809
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:47,518
is informing everyone you know because

810
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:49,759
if if I have you know a few different

811
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:52,200
cookie crosses a few different gelato

812
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:55,558
things and then a you know others say

813
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:58,840
OG's or hazes or chams and I'm

814
00:28:55,558 --> 00:29:01,759
continually going over of these hazes

815
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:03,278
and chems and ogs you know people should

816
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:04,919
take note of that why because we have

817
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:06,759
the we can you know we have the best of

818
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:07,840
both yeah and when you have the best of

819
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:10,398
both you're going to choose what

820
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:11,879
registers in your own chemistry well and

821
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:13,239
I think once people understand that they

822
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,880
should

823
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:18,880
actually maybe not seek out what's hype

824
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:21,760
and hyping but seek out what's you know

825
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:26,640
the who's growing it how it's grown

826
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:28,398
methodology and how old the genetic line

827
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,720
is maybe and try to discover something

828
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:32,359
new because you might realize that hey

829
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,880
this older stuff really Vibes with me

830
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:37,398
more actually because the hives maybe

831
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:40,278
more stimulating more invigorating more

832
00:29:37,398 --> 00:29:42,239
you know like cerebral and you know more

833
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:44,599
rushy and you know these kind of

834
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,278
feelings are like kind of what the you

835
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:48,639
know the old schoolers are are liking

836
00:29:46,278 --> 00:29:51,200
and have been liking for years hence why

837
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,679
you know at tpami you see this you know

838
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,278
everyone's like check it out what we've

839
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:55,679
been doing you know like yeah no same

840
00:29:54,278 --> 00:29:58,839
thing we've all been doing for a long

841
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:02,399
time but it's not but hpe bottleneck

842
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:04,359
it's creativity and effect expressed you

843
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:06,319
know well the modern world has changed

844
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:08,798
things so much you know it's like back

845
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:10,519
in the day you used to know where your

846
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:13,158
vegetables were coming from you you used

847
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:15,120
to know who was raising your cattle and

848
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:16,519
same thing with breeding your flowers or

849
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:18,879
growing your cannabis it's like there's

850
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:20,640
a big disconnect you know I'm I have

851
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,320
some of my Snoop dogs selling some of my

852
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,120
genetics I just saw jars with the loud

853
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:25,519
loops on there but there's this big

854
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:27,558
disconnect and I think they're not

855
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:28,960
giving necessarily the Breeders credit

856
00:30:27,558 --> 00:30:31,759
or the cator credit they're just

857
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:34,000
marketing flower and there it is what it

858
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:35,960
is but I feel like there's there's a

859
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,599
there's a better story and a deeper

860
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,720
Story and there's deeper understanding

861
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:41,959
to be had about all this stuff

862
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,440
especially like Farmers up in Humble

863
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:45,159
right like I use them as the example but

864
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,840
it's really Farmers everywhere being

865
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:48,240
able to tell their Story Farm to Table

866
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:50,398
where you can go to the farm you can see

867
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,038
them produce it there you can talk to

868
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:54,518
the grower you can talk to the breeder

869
00:30:52,038 --> 00:30:56,200
the extract artist whoever that is where

870
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,519
where there's like more of a story and

871
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,519
then you have a deeper connection to

872
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,599
that flower

873
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:03,519
and I mean Canabis is about Community

874
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:05,079
anyway and I feel like that's part that

875
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:07,278
we've kind of gone away from that we

876
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:08,720
really need to go back to yeah and I

877
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:10,240
think that's what I think that's what's

878
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,038
coming back around I think that's why

879
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,599
obviously these podcasts are so popular

880
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:16,319
for people and because you have you know

881
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:18,158
a lot of really cool people and

882
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:20,480
expressions of Humanity on these

883
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:22,399
different podcasts that are you know

884
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,679
being able to connect with a different

885
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:27,518
um set of you know viewers and a whole

886
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,200
different sphere and to be able to you

887
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,278
know just it's

888
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,639
really you know enlightening for

889
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:36,839
everyone and really endearing for all of

890
00:31:34,638 --> 00:31:38,519
us to be you know be able to share what

891
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:40,959
we've experienced the fight the

892
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:43,240
struggles that we've you know because as

893
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,240
you you know it's been a smaller time

894
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,960
that it's been legal of us doing this

895
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:49,200
than it's been illegal of us doing this

896
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,759
you know and and a lot of us you know we

897
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,319
did a lot of work for the states and

898
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:53,558
different things you know um you know I

899
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:55,240
did a lot of work with Oregon and their

900
00:31:53,558 --> 00:31:57,200
legalization push and multiple rules

901
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:59,079
advisory committees head grower advisor

902
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,399
got things like unlimited PL count

903
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:02,918
written into law you know when it was

904
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:06,000
like 100 plant you know Federal right

905
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:08,278
like 99 and under no no call to the FED

906
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,480
100 and over they could call the FED 101

907
00:32:08,278 --> 00:32:12,079
you know you're like you're like buming

908
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,360
you know so like to be able to get

909
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:15,638
things like unlimited plant count

910
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:17,879
written in and you know like really

911
00:32:15,638 --> 00:32:20,240
holding that seat for the people yeah

912
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:22,440
really is a p a people's voice you know

913
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,440
because even at the end right at the

914
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,880
very end when that got signed into law

915
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:28,960
that got switched up a little bit so you

916
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:30,880
know there's even in when it's even it

917
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,558
lobbying makes a difference yeah and we

918
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,000
have short memories so I feel like

919
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:35,879
people have short memories there's new

920
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,319
people coming online all the time that

921
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,000
they weren't there to experience it so

922
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:40,519
it's great to be able to remind people

923
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,880
or the younger Generations that are

924
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:44,359
coming online to be able to watch this

925
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,240
now or watch this podcast that we're

926
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:48,479
having five years from now 50 years from

927
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,278
now 100 years from now right and you

928
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,440
know understand what was going on in

929
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:56,159
2024 it's going to be a different thing

930
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,798
in 2030 even and you know this next 5

931
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,159
years next 10 years is going to be crazy

932
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:02,720
for cannabis you know who knows what's

933
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:04,480
going to happen but it's not going to be

934
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,480
less right you know what I mean it's not

935
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,000
going to be less and it's going

936
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,399
direction for sure everyone's already

937
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,319
you know you remember how it was when it

938
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:15,839
was you know what Colorado you know

939
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:18,720
Washington Oregon or Oregon Washington I

940
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:21,678
can't remember you it's like and then it

941
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:24,519
Cali then it just like it was like I

942
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:26,679
mean now look at it it's International

943
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:28,558
scale we got Germany which is a very big

944
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:30,120
country I mean it's a very big deal and

945
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:32,158
I think a lot of people are like oh it's

946
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:33,759
just another country no it's a big big

947
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,200
big country that's going online with

948
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:40,240
recreational con to all the EU yeah and

949
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:42,080
they have the highest the German EU GMP

950
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,519
is is the highest of its standards as

951
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:46,319
far as like German GMP standards are

952
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:49,120
higher than anywhere else in the world

953
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:51,398
wow and so I think it's great I you know

954
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:52,879
we had Arn talking about it about how

955
00:33:51,398 --> 00:33:53,798
you know the stacks of paperwork to get

956
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,799
the

957
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:59,918
cgmp uh done is like you know four feet

958
00:33:56,798 --> 00:34:01,158
tall wow so but yeah real pro pro stuff

959
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:03,360
you know real Pro stuff hard to

960
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:05,559
bootstrap hard to yeah very hard to

961
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:08,598
bootstrap very hard for to go from the

962
00:34:05,558 --> 00:34:11,480
ground up you know but I mean I think

963
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:13,480
that stuff is great I think I'm big on

964
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,159
testing oversight I think that we need

965
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:17,240
more of that in the United States for

966
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:19,720
sure I'm not super big on government

967
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:22,118
oversight and more government but I am

968
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:24,199
in favor of universal testing that

969
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:26,440
that's uh puts us in line with other

970
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:28,559
countries uh you know I feel like our

971
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:30,358
there's so much motivation to have

972
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:34,519
higher testing results for the for the

973
00:34:30,358 --> 00:34:36,559
farmer for the breeder for the lab and

974
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:37,719
then the person who suffers is the end

975
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:39,279
user because they're not getting true

976
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:41,118
results well and that's the thing is

977
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,159
it's like you know when we are getting

978
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,599
true results it's harder to sell you

979
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:48,280
know like even you know like our good

980
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,519
buddies SC Labs you know and um Al like

981
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,800
they I've been KNN him for a long time

982
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:53,039
and he's been helping me through that

983
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,960
whole process with Oregon and to see how

984
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:57,400
you know what we're getting testing wise

985
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,159
with him consistently for I use SC as

986
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:01,039
well so I I feel like they're Straight

987
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:04,679
Shooters yeah they're real you know but

988
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:08,199
then when you're getting a 22 or a 19 or

989
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:09,879
23 you know 23 maybe is more marketable

990
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:13,358
but when you're get in the 19 to 21

991
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:16,400
range it's so much harder to Market that

992
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:18,480
flower in the wreck reality because

993
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,960
people think that it's more it's

994
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,440
supposed to be around 30 and that's not

995
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,358
that's actually not true you know it's

996
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,720
when you know what I talk to them even

997
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:27,920
Addison you know like um when I you know

998
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:29,559
at Steep Hill back in the day when first

999
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,320
brought him the golden at that time you

1000
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:33,838
know he tested it at 24.7 I think and

1001
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,720
the highest that he had tested at that

1002
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:37,559
point was 194 or something like that so

1003
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:40,239
it was a huge deal to jump that much you

1004
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:41,440
know um but even then he was talking

1005
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:42,759
about it when they started doing these

1006
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,119
hash testing and different things and

1007
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:47,119
flower testing you can't have it that

1008
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,400
high it's not like actually physically

1009
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:52,039
possible you know so you know to have

1010
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:54,358
these like 40% it's like H it's pretty

1011
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:56,279
sus you know it's it is you know I have

1012
00:35:54,358 --> 00:35:59,199
some testing results that are like 40%

1013
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:00,800
total canab 40 40 1% total canabo and

1014
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:03,639
it's like it's pretty wild if you think

1015
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:07,079
of that amount if we look at a bud like

1016
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:09,920
40% of that is canabo that's it's wild

1017
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:11,560
right and you're like huh um I want to

1018
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,880
believe it you know I have a lot of

1019
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:15,679
really good tests and a lot of good coas

1020
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:18,400
that are really you know you can show

1021
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:19,719
them off but it kind I don't have

1022
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,318
anything from Steve Hill that tests in

1023
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:24,598
the 40s

1024
00:36:21,318 --> 00:36:25,920
nothing I um you know like in Oregon

1025
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:28,200
there's some Labs that get some high

1026
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,599
testing and you know SC labs always been

1027
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:32,439
you know like true yeah and most cuz

1028
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:35,880
most of the gear that I'm selecting

1029
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:38,679
naturally tests between 22 and 26% just

1030
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:41,680
what my kind of you know bio ACI what

1031
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:43,559
what that's kind of you know Desiring is

1032
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:46,159
that range just naturally I think the

1033
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:48,279
best flavors come in that low 20s you

1034
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:50,000
know and there's some stuff that there's

1035
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,240
anomalies that you know that I think are

1036
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,239
in the 30s that do have amazing flavor

1037
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:56,838
and their high tpin but it's very rare

1038
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:58,679
because canabo compete with tpin so

1039
00:36:56,838 --> 00:37:01,000
typically the high the cannaboids the

1040
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:04,239
lower the Tarpin and vice versa but and

1041
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,920
then it's not all about just tpin uh now

1042
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:09,559
the word flavorant has come to mind uh

1043
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:11,318
recently abstracts Tech did some white

1044
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:13,199
they wrote some white papers on

1045
00:37:11,318 --> 00:37:16,039
flavoring you know sulfur based

1046
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:17,239
compounds and THS basically you know

1047
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:18,800
we've been talking about THS for a long

1048
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:20,399
time and now they're categorizing THS

1049
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,280
and showing how they contribute to the

1050
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,680
flavor and Aroma which I think is great

1051
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,800
well those are all kind of the more like

1052
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:28,199
I mean is it like a microle or thle is

1053
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:30,839
that a it's a it's a you know basically

1054
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:33,318
uh it's a style of tpine still right

1055
00:37:30,838 --> 00:37:35,000
it's a smaller flavor molecule okay yeah

1056
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:36,599
it's a lot harder to test for well

1057
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,400
that's why I think that like you know me

1058
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:39,760
personally like I like fresh herb you

1059
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,680
know after it's been dried for about

1060
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,480
seven days from that point to about a

1061
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:45,519
month is my favorite Sweet Spot

1062
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,800
personally yeah um and I'm assuming it's

1063
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:49,759
because all the you know tpin and the

1064
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:52,560
micro thyes and the THS are all in a

1065
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:56,839
combination there and you know the more

1066
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:58,119
um you know ones that degenerate you

1067
00:37:56,838 --> 00:38:00,159
know quicker they're not going to be

1068
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:02,079
around in a in a in a month you know or

1069
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:03,719
you know people like oh curing it Slow

1070
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:06,119
and Low this that and the other that's

1071
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:08,439
great I I get it but for me personally I

1072
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:11,119
just I just like the range of what

1073
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:13,800
happens from when it's fres dry I Like

1074
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:15,920
it Loud right yeah you know to to to to

1075
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:18,440
you know and it's like even my buddy

1076
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,760
Steve you know like um from Green life

1077
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:22,760
he he's like man like what's a deal you

1078
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,760
know like I want my jar to [ __ ] smack

1079
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,440
you know I want it to you know and I'm

1080
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,800
like man he's like when I open your jar

1081
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:30,159
just hits you know and I'm like man

1082
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:32,318
because I love fresh weed yeah you know

1083
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:35,118
well and I think it's it's also

1084
00:38:32,318 --> 00:38:36,318
subjective to the cultivar and there's

1085
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:38,400
there's factors that play but like

1086
00:38:36,318 --> 00:38:40,960
Skittles for example it is the best when

1087
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,000
it's fresh right when it's done drying

1088
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,679
and it's like maybe cured for a couple

1089
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,920
days you don't need to burp it anymore

1090
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:48,639
whatever you do that's when it is the

1091
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,559
very best and it doesn't get better on

1092
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:52,159
the nose it still smokes good for a lot

1093
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:54,358
longer but that first like week and a

1094
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:56,879
half it's just loud it just hits you in

1095
00:38:54,358 --> 00:38:58,679
the face and there's Sour's kind of like

1096
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,480
that too sour the sour will smoke good

1097
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:02,399
for a long time but like the real the

1098
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,039
loudness of the sour when you open it

1099
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,400
the fresher the better well it's like

1100
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:07,358
even with like ogs you know it's like

1101
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,400
after a week is when they really start

1102
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:10,598
to punch harder you know like exact you

1103
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,160
know you're like fresh you want to smoke

1104
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:15,359
it right like REM me because it has its

1105
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:17,199
thing but after a week it's like that

1106
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:18,880
anes and the whole like thing starts to

1107
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:21,399
come out more it's like more piny and

1108
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,240
earthy and yeah for sure and then

1109
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,480
there's like Jack Jacks have their own

1110
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:27,759
thing right Jacks I I feel like the

1111
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:29,760
lyine stuff that's really high in Li

1112
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,560
lanine actually deteriorates pretty fast

1113
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,119
so they don't last even in like the TPL

1114
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:37,279
blcks we do a bunch of trials with stuff

1115
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:41,160
and some of that line line r seem to age

1116
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:42,280
faster and I'm not sure exactly why but

1117
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:43,838
it's definitely one of those things like

1118
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:46,119
six months later they're they're Never

1119
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:47,799
As Good well maybe because that tpine

1120
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:50,760
you know what I mean it's like I it's a

1121
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:52,720
solvent in a lot of you know industry so

1122
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,800
sure maybe that's kind of degradating

1123
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:56,239
the other tpin the use of that solvent

1124
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,560
and yeah it works really good on those

1125
00:39:56,239 --> 00:40:00,159
varieties you know for sure so yeah so

1126
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:03,679
what's your favorite thing to smoke I've

1127
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:05,480
been liking this uhsse by 89 NL um and

1128
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:08,440

1129
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:12,480

1132
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:18,838
you know earthy thing going on it's good

1133
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:20,318
for sure you know it kind of reminds me

1134
00:40:18,838 --> 00:40:22,920
like of a dog walker smell almost a

1135
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:25,759
little bit you know yeah yeah so those

1136
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:28,240
are you know I like that one a lot um

1137
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:32,119
the lemon punch by 89 I've been liking a

1138
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:34,719
lot phk Afghani yeah you know kind of

1139
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:36,519
just um you know like I said I have a

1140
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:38,559
you know pretty good selection of things

1141
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:41,000
to choose from but I keep going to these

1142
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:43,119
specific ones and you know some of them

1143
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,239
are new but like the hazy Kush it's a

1144
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:48,240
terpinolene aamine humulene kind of

1145
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:50,279
strain right but it'll always have a

1146
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:52,479
place for me you know people like oh I'm

1147
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,880
not really into the terpinolene at all I

1148
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,719
was like well had the right combination

1149
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,838
[ __ ] smells like candy and it's like

1150
00:40:55,719 --> 00:41:00,838
really good you know and if it's done

1151
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:03,519
right it's epic and the high that's you

1152
00:41:00,838 --> 00:41:05,838
know comb when those tpin are combined

1153
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:07,960
with high THC it's something special

1154
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:09,480
happens you know and the same with all

1155
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:11,199
of it you know the reason people

1156
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:13,199
understand the reason a lot of they like

1157
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:15,799
something it's not the cannaboids it's

1158
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:17,960
[ __ ] tpin you know and and and that

1159
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,800
combination you know when you have all

1160
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:21,838
these cannaboids that we do understand

1161
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:23,640
and ones we don't you combine that with

1162
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:26,639
Tarpin we do understand and ones we

1163
00:41:23,639 --> 00:41:28,838
don't you know there's just a range and

1164
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:30,799
and then when you start talking of like

1165
00:41:28,838 --> 00:41:33,119
Organics versus conventionals and all

1166
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:35,560
the you know enzymatic stuff and you

1167
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:37,358
know when you really there's a there's a

1168
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:39,480
micron nuances that we just don't

1169
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:41,598
understand yet that you know that for

1170
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:43,519
some reason it's a calling us but we

1171
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:44,800
just don't know why scientifically yet

1172
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:48,800
yeah we're just scratching the surface

1173
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:52,519
of it for sure so yeah I I I would 100%

1174
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:54,720
agree and I I love soil and I use coco

1175
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:56,079
but I also love smoking soil you know we

1176
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:58,519
have a closed loop facility so I'm not

1177
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:01,519
trying to bring bugs in right that's the

1178
00:41:58,519 --> 00:42:04,480
disant whole giant biome right exactly

1179
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:06,920
like I mean in in a perfect world yeah

1180
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:09,719
we could do that but but here we're

1181
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:12,519
confined to the constraints totally of

1182
00:42:09,719 --> 00:42:16,439
of cleanliness especially and and trying

1183
00:42:12,519 --> 00:42:17,759
to be um yeah as sterile as possible you

1184
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:20,599
know one of the cleaner spots I've been

1185
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:22,920
to period like really and the protocols

1186
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:25,838
perfect yeah our Sops are pretty dialed

1187
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:27,800
and we're just constantly trying to

1188
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:30,078
prevent pests you know cu can come in

1189
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,400
from the outside they can come shirt we

1190
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:32,559
don't allow people typically in our

1191
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:35,720
Nursery

1192
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:38,440
ever you know we have a pretty dense

1193
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:38,439
plant c in

1194
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:44,358
there oh this stuff got me it smells

1195
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:46,359
amazing though right from the from the

1196
00:42:44,358 --> 00:42:47,358
from the non-smoked TP you're like

1197
00:42:46,358 --> 00:42:49,318
you're like because remember you were

1198
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:51,318
saying the cams like get

1199
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:55,039
you you're like what this is I'm

1200
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:57,279
allergic to this one for sure so I got a

1201
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:59,358
question for you organ let's talk about

1202
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,720
a genetic that everyone hates talking

1203
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:04,639
about in Oregon is Jagger what's your

1204
00:43:01,719 --> 00:43:06,000
opinion on jger um I mean it's a feno

1205
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:08,118
like the Hindu is from what I've

1206
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,639
understood even like you know um you

1207
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:11,720
look at Graham's purple Hindu Kush you

1208
00:43:09,639 --> 00:43:14,279
know it's like smells like tangerine and

1209
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:16,919
citrus yeah purple cracked out looks

1210
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:18,559
like cookies kind of like um and you

1211
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:21,000
know he told me he's like dude I I

1212
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:23,280
sourced this out of Hindu cush seeds you

1213
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,960
know just so I'm assuming the Jagger's

1214
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,720
same deal it's a purple Hindu Kush

1215
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,639
meaning a Hindu Kush that was purple

1216
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:30,118
yeah and it made it through you know

1217
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:32,558
people love it and it's you know

1218
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:34,599
resistant and I think it's like run its

1219
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:35,920
course through the outdoor Community

1220
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:37,559
yeah it was like blue dream in the

1221
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,079
beginning everyone loved it like

1222
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:40,720
literally it's another blue dream where

1223
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:42,480
it was like in the beginning it was like

1224
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:44,799
whoa what is this everybody had to have

1225
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,318
it the cuts got out everywhere and

1226
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,920
that's part of like the stewardship of

1227
00:43:46,318 --> 00:43:50,440
stuff you know but uh you know we keep

1228
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:53,358
going back to the stewardship but that's

1229
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:55,760
another one it's like it became popular

1230
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:57,519
and then people started hating on it

1231
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,400
yeah I mean I it's it's a unique

1232
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:02,039
smelling plant and the highest you know

1233
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,838
is what it is but I think there's just a

1234
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:07,199
lot better and you know anything um that

1235
00:44:04,838 --> 00:44:09,078
people blast out that hard is going to

1236
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:10,960
have some Kickback just sure normal

1237
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:12,920
eventually I mean people hate on cookies

1238
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,760
now too and cookies in the back in the

1239
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:16,880
day the real original cookies was

1240
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:18,920
special ex I still have that cut I got

1241
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,559
it from Alec actually from SC labs in

1242
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:23,440
200 I think 11 or something did youever

1243
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:25,839
when it was just cookies right only

1244
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:28,559
cookies it was small producer like I had

1245
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:31,838
so the original was more like burnt

1246
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:33,599
rubber Funk like extremely strong lior

1247
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:35,199
yeah exactly it was that cut that's the

1248
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:37,760
one I'm Still rocking you know well and

1249
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:39,519
I believe that some people some people

1250
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,359
question the fact that there's Durban in

1251
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:43,480
there and I totally firmly believe that

1252
00:44:41,358 --> 00:44:46,039
that anise that licorice comes from

1253
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:47,800
Durban okay unmistakably because the

1254
00:44:46,039 --> 00:44:50,558
Durban we had had that same licorice in

1255
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:53,400
it right Bay my friend Josh Freeman he's

1256
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:55,599
the one who brought down seeds of Durban

1257
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,680
from Canada that he'd gotten up there uh

1258
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:59,960
with my other friend Joe

1259
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:01,480
and that was the anise and I feel like

1260
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:03,880
first time I smelled cookies I was like

1261
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,880
whoa that reminds me of the Durban and

1262
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,680
next thing you know they're saying oh

1263
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,000
it's Durban in there I'm like 100% I

1264
00:45:06,679 --> 00:45:10,598
agree that it's probably Durban in there

1265
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,280
that gives it that anise oh cool uh but

1266
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:14,318
we got the original cookies we got

1267
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:15,880
wasn't the Forum cut it wasn't the thin

1268
00:45:14,318 --> 00:45:19,239
minute it was just the

1269
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:22,280
cookies uh my buddy Paulie had gotten it

1270
00:45:19,239 --> 00:45:24,199
from think $5,000 for the cut he' gotten

1271
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:26,079
it from the hydro shop that was in

1272
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:29,000
Berkeley I believe on Fourth Street

1273
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:30,800
right by the think there's a a pet shop

1274
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,159
that sold lizards and stuff like that

1275
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,880
right there but anyway there was a guy

1276
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:37,199
that sold it to him and then he got it

1277
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:39,440
for our group and we shared it but uh it

1278
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:41,719
was this crazy cookies that was really

1279
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,358
small producing but it reminded me of OG

1280
00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:45,519
in the sense that the node spacing was

1281
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:48,239
terrible and if you didn't support it up

1282
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:50,440
it would just spaghetti over so but yeah

1283
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:51,838
and it was so strong you know and it

1284
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:54,079
half a pound of light was what we were

1285
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:55,480
getting yield wise right I still grew it

1286
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:56,720
for half a pound of light when we were

1287
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:59,480
all you know we had other stuff at the

1288
00:45:56,719 --> 00:46:01,679
time that would yield a lot more right

1289
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:03,480
yeah know I I like that I made some made

1290
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:05,078
some things out of it it's U it was you

1291
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:07,280
know I still have that cut that's the

1292
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:08,720
cut that I'm still holding and right a

1293
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,000
special one obviously made it this far

1294
00:46:08,719 --> 00:46:11,480
it's not just the branding that made it

1295
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,159
this far you know well it made it into

1296
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:15,119
everything all the new [ __ ] has cookies

1297
00:46:13,159 --> 00:46:16,639
in it like literally all the stuff that

1298
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:18,559
we're smoking now that has purple

1299
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:20,078
there's cookies in it right for sure so

1300
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:21,280
as much as people want to hate on stuff

1301
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:23,000
it's like they hate on stuff for the

1302
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:25,240
wrong reason the other thing that gets

1303
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,280
me right now is purple weed is so

1304
00:46:25,239 --> 00:46:29,598
popular when I feel like when I'm phenoh

1305
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:31,319
hunting the Expressions that are louder

1306
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:33,559
in the same progyny we'll have green and

1307
00:46:31,318 --> 00:46:35,838
purple in different Hues but the more

1308
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:37,599
green it is the usually louder they are

1309
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:39,639
for sure so people want what they can't

1310
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:41,359
have they always want the anomalies and

1311
00:46:39,639 --> 00:46:43,000
I think we value stuff that's not

1312
00:46:41,358 --> 00:46:45,400
necessarily important and part of that

1313
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,880
social media but totally do you find

1314
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:49,200
that the um you know green versus purple

1315
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,240
and the hashing and everything that

1316
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:52,960
you're like you know more they be more

1317
00:46:51,239 --> 00:46:54,879
hash Potentials in purples or more hash

1318
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,318
Potentials in Greens you know cuz I've

1319
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,640
I've been seeing a lot of the at least a

1320
00:46:56,318 --> 00:46:59,639
lot of The Greener stuff that I work

1321
00:46:57,639 --> 00:47:01,358
with it's pretty greasy yeah and you

1322
00:46:59,639 --> 00:47:03,039
know you know like the ogs and stuff

1323
00:47:01,358 --> 00:47:06,078
like that some of them sour and ogs are

1324
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:09,239
super greasy with hash you know rosin

1325
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:11,640
yeah so the you know the spsc 89 um my

1326
00:47:09,239 --> 00:47:14,000
buddy Buck he uh he made some amazing

1327
00:47:11,639 --> 00:47:16,199
rosin out of it amazing hash full melts

1328
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,800
and everything but the yields weren't

1329
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:21,039
like as you know as much but right

1330
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:23,839
versus like say if you're doing some you

1331
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:25,679
know more animal mints or something like

1332
00:47:23,838 --> 00:47:28,358
that that's just like f an all tricomes

1333
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:30,598
and a little more totally you know waxy

1334
00:47:28,358 --> 00:47:33,078
but well then there's the GMOs they just

1335
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:34,920
dump and dump and dump you know and

1336
00:47:33,079 --> 00:47:36,640
that's a turp that I can get sick of

1337
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:39,358
that I really like but I can get sick of

1338
00:47:36,639 --> 00:47:42,199
it pretty because it's just so it's so

1339
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:43,799
strong and it's good but like it's they

1340
00:47:42,199 --> 00:47:46,039
put it in everything and then I like the

1341
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,960
original GMOs I mean I like chmd to be

1342
00:47:46,039 --> 00:47:50,159
honest I really like the it's like I

1343
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:52,440
feel like it's not as loud as GMO but

1344
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:54,239
it's very nostalgic for me I get that

1345
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,358
smell and it reminds me of the 90s oh

1346
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:57,118
yeah that's why I got something in there

1347
00:47:55,358 --> 00:47:58,679
I you know really the AJ sour diesel

1348
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:00,720
reminds me of GMO a little bit mixed

1349
00:47:58,679 --> 00:48:03,558
with OG it has that kind of little more

1350
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:05,399
rank smell you know that's the sour

1351
00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:07,519
decut that's going around now more than

1352
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,960
anything the the sour d that's more

1353
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:12,800
citrusy that's bright that's really loud

1354
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:14,880
in the bag with its complexity is the

1355
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:17,400
one that I grew up with yeah same yeah

1356
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:19,960
when I when I got this AJ um sour d from

1357
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:23,000
crazy composer Dave you know like I uh

1358
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:25,440
Ian I was like bro is I was like is this

1359
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,960
normally like GMO smelling like OG GMO

1360
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,079
smelling he's all oh yeah that's this

1361
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,280
one I was like well that's not the one

1362
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:34,039
that was going out here forever right

1363
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:36,359
he's all no it's not no I believe that

1364
00:48:34,039 --> 00:48:38,440
sour is a bag seed from Chev 91 there's

1365
00:48:36,358 --> 00:48:40,558
lots of different theories on it you

1366
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:42,240
know there's different stories about who

1367
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:45,040
read it and you know they're in my book

1368
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:46,519
if people want to read it but uh just

1369
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:48,719
from what I've seen with the dog butt

1370
00:48:46,519 --> 00:48:51,679
that we had with the sours that I've

1371
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:54,798
grown and similarly uh the lab results

1372
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:56,358
that I've seen in fingerprinting and you

1373
00:48:54,798 --> 00:48:58,480
know we were talking about homozygosity

1374
00:48:56,358 --> 00:49:01,318
earlier right and you know you look at

1375
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:04,240
the s1's uh as being typically more

1376
00:49:01,318 --> 00:49:05,679
homozygous and you can look at chem dog

1377
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:08,159
and then you can look at these other and

1378
00:49:05,679 --> 00:49:10,798
and how it pans out on paper it's really

1379
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:13,000
interesting but uh you know and there a

1380
00:49:10,798 --> 00:49:14,759
lot of these are very similar and hity

1381
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:18,000
and so well there's a good chance in my

1382
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:19,720
opinion that it's just an S1 yeah and uh

1383
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,039
a really special S1 and there's nothing

1384
00:49:19,719 --> 00:49:23,239
wrong I mean some of the best things are

1385
00:49:21,039 --> 00:49:24,838
bag seeds that we I mean and single bag

1386
00:49:23,239 --> 00:49:26,318
seeds not like you accidentally

1387
00:49:24,838 --> 00:49:27,838
pollinated something but when you just

1388
00:49:26,318 --> 00:49:30,358
find a couple

1389
00:49:27,838 --> 00:49:31,798
seeds those are the best those those are

1390
00:49:30,358 --> 00:49:34,078
my favorite too and I still have

1391
00:49:31,798 --> 00:49:35,880
collections I you know I think the real

1392
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:37,280
smokers the ones that find the real back

1393
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:40,079
seeds and that's where the real magic is

1394
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:41,400
at totally and then you know I mean I'm

1395
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,798
I'm kind of esoteric with this whole

1396
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:44,838
thing so maybe that's just the plan

1397
00:49:42,798 --> 00:49:46,440
offering certain people the the jewel

1398
00:49:44,838 --> 00:49:48,119
you know offering them something that

1399
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:50,519
they're going to Steward properly that

1400
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:53,079
Pearl you know getting it like here's

1401
00:49:50,519 --> 00:49:55,639
your offering for being such a devoted

1402
00:49:53,079 --> 00:49:57,680
uh you know yeah and you know talking

1403
00:49:55,639 --> 00:49:59,598
about devotion I think that's really the

1404
00:49:57,679 --> 00:50:02,118
direction this industry is the people

1405
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:03,599
that are thriving you know the old

1406
00:50:02,119 --> 00:50:05,200
school people especially because they're

1407
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,760
devotional right they're devoted to this

1408
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:09,279
plan stewards we could talk about

1409
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:10,720
stewards but as far as a devotion like

1410
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,440
whether you're a musician you're devoted

1411
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:14,798
to music or whether you're devoted to

1412
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:16,280
this plant when it becomes devotional

1413
00:50:14,798 --> 00:50:19,159
where you wouldn't do this no matter

1414
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:20,720
what happens whether it's illegal legal

1415
00:50:19,159 --> 00:50:22,798
where there's money or no money that's

1416
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:24,358
when the special stuff happens for sure

1417
00:50:22,798 --> 00:50:25,798
and I mean I'm sure we've all

1418
00:50:24,358 --> 00:50:27,759
experienced it over the last little bit

1419
00:50:25,798 --> 00:50:29,318
of years you know like you know

1420
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,520
different kind of things going which way

1421
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:33,679
or the other or whatever it's like you

1422
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:36,159
know kind of kind of some fears or

1423
00:50:33,679 --> 00:50:38,159
whatever kind of coming to play and you

1424
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:40,318
know really it's like [ __ ] man there

1425
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:42,039
ain't nothing else to do you know except

1426
00:50:40,318 --> 00:50:44,719
work with this plan you know I'm like

1427
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:46,599
I'm I'm in there for for the rest I'm in

1428
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:49,679
there for the rest well and it's funny

1429
00:50:46,599 --> 00:50:51,119
because once mushrooms got pop more

1430
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:53,199
popular a couple they kind of went

1431
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:54,200
mainstream about five years ago people

1432
00:50:53,199 --> 00:50:57,118
like dude you should start breeding

1433
00:50:54,199 --> 00:50:58,118
mushrooms you know this is 2018 right

1434
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:59,519
and people were like dude you should

1435
00:50:58,119 --> 00:51:00,760
start breeding mushrooms too you know

1436
00:50:59,519 --> 00:51:02,039

1445
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:19,240
things I have in my life that I feel

00:51:17,358 --> 00:51:21,039
like I'm good at something that I've

1447

devoted my whole life to and then taking

1448
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:25,119
on mushrooms I enjoy mushrooms as a

1449
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,199
spectator you know from the outside I

1450

love mushrooms and I I love medicine and

1451
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:31,519

1452
00:51:29,679 --> 00:51:33,719
like what I'm going to devote my time to

1453
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:36,280
and my energy cannabis is where it's at

1454
00:51:33,719 --> 00:51:38,279
cannabis is where it's going to end up

1455
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:40,400
and uh yeah I love it I love being part

1456
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:42,359

1458
00:51:42,358 --> 00:51:46,440

1460
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:50,599
so you know for myself I kind of uh feel

1461
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:52,440
the same way and like as you do with the

1462
00:51:50,599 --> 00:51:53,760
cooking and the the herb you know it's

1463
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:55,760
like these are really tangible things

1464
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,920
that we can entangle our intentions into

1465
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:00,040
like actually and it's right you know

1466
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:02,318
just look at you know our grandmothers

1467
00:52:00,039 --> 00:52:04,199
or mothers or fathers or you know even

1468
00:52:02,318 --> 00:52:05,798
with M Roto with the you know hidden

1469
00:52:04,199 --> 00:52:07,519
messages of water and all these kind of

1470
00:52:05,798 --> 00:52:09,559
or you know that old book secret life of

1471
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:11,798
plants you know this is like this is

1472
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:13,119
some esoteric information that we all

1473
00:52:11,798 --> 00:52:15,358
understand meaning like when our when

1474
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:17,318
someone really loves us and we consume

1475
00:52:15,358 --> 00:52:19,639
something from that person shit's

1476
00:52:17,318 --> 00:52:23,000
noticeable right you know and we feel it

1477
00:52:19,639 --> 00:52:24,400
and you know if you don't then you know

1478
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,719
you you know should be more aware

1479
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,639
because it's like really obvious in a

1480
00:52:25,719 --> 00:52:30,480
lot of ways you know and I think this

1481
00:52:27,639 --> 00:52:32,679
plant um and cooking is something that

1482
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:34,880
really is we can you know and acts as a

1483
00:52:32,679 --> 00:52:36,519
server of that intention and love and

1484
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,119
compassion that we can that we're

1485
00:52:36,519 --> 00:52:40,079
sharing ourself you know and our

1486
00:52:38,119 --> 00:52:41,760
entanglement of something with a very

1487
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:44,400
special thing whether it be food or the

1488
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:46,079
sacred wisdom plant you know it's you

1489
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:48,599
know we're very lucky to be able to even

1490
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:50,640
be conversing about this really you know

1491
00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:52,400
totally yeah it's it's a beautiful thing

1492
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:55,118
and then when you're able to share that

1493
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:57,119
energy with somebody else and they get

1494
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:58,480
it it's just so much better to and like

1495
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:00,920
and there's a whole community of people

1496
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,798
that get it which is great for sure so a

1497
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:04,440
lot of them in Oregon you I'm originally

1503
00:53:11,679 --> 00:53:14,318

like it has one of the best climates in

1505
00:53:14,318 --> 00:53:18,358
the world but uh it's also the mindset

1506
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,838
of the people that live in Oregon

1507
00:53:18,358 --> 00:53:21,400

1554
00:54:53,079 --> 00:54:57,920

the Grateful Dead influence I mean on

1621
00:57:13,079 --> 00:57:18,359
our whole Community is so profound and

1622
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:20,119
so big and it's it's a it's a positive

1623
00:57:18,358 --> 00:57:21,480
impact you know I mean some things in

1624
00:57:20,119 --> 00:57:23,599
the industry there's negative impact

1625
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:26,280
from Big Business and stuff like that

1626
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:28,838
and there's some positive but mostly bad

1627
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:30,720
Grateful Dead it was only positive you

1628
00:57:28,838 --> 00:57:32,279
know on the community and within the

1629
00:57:30,719 --> 00:57:34,279
community and the Grateful Dead

1630
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:36,280
Community which they're slightly

1631
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:37,960
different but they're also completely

1632
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:40,280
tied in with each other for sure you

1633

00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:47,559
have their own niches and their own

1637
00:57:45,559 --> 00:57:49,680
clicks but everybody's kind of tied in

1638
00:57:47,559 --> 00:57:52,798
together because of cannabis totally and

1639

1696
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:49,760
yeah and to be the you know Sasha is

1697
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:52,199
quite the legend because it wasn't like

1698
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:54,440
he like people he tested it all on

1699
00:59:52,199 --> 00:59:56,399
himself you know like if he got high

1700
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:57,720
before he got sick that was good in that

1701
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:02,798
good direction to go and that's some

1702
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:05,038
like OG [ __ ] bro yeah serous ball for

1703
01:00:02,798 --> 01:00:07,880
one thing but also he believed in it

1704
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:09,240
that much right and so a devotional in

1705
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:12,440
the same way word devotional for

1706
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:15,558
cannabis totally his impact I mean

1707
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:17,798
profound I mean imagine the amount of um

1708
01:00:15,559 --> 01:00:20,280
good feelings that he's brought to

1709
01:00:17,798 --> 01:00:22,798
fruition in the world and the Continuum

1710
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:25,319
of you know just those couple things and

1711
01:00:22,798 --> 01:00:26,920
the derivatives of those things even and

1712
01:00:25,318 --> 01:00:29,079
well yeah and it's like I feel like

1713
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:31,079
we're an evolution of the Grateful Dead

1714
01:00:29,079 --> 01:00:33,640
right to a degree and he is that there's

1715
01:00:31,079 --> 01:00:35,359
an evolution of him that's that's

1716
01:00:33,639 --> 01:00:37,358
prevalent around the world you know

1717
01:00:35,358 --> 01:00:40,038
that's for sure that he had impact on

1718
01:00:37,358 --> 01:00:42,679
and still has impact on and you know

1719
01:00:40,039 --> 01:00:45,319
it's amazing when we can pass on that

1720
01:00:42,679 --> 01:00:47,879
energy whether it's via cannabis or

1721
01:00:45,318 --> 01:00:49,159
cannabis seeds or genetics or whatever

1722
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:52,440
it is that you or even molecular

1723
01:00:49,159 --> 01:00:54,118
structures you structures music whatever

1724
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:55,599
it is that you do that you love where

1725
01:00:54,119 --> 01:00:57,119
you can contribute that part I mean

1726
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:58,798
that's what life is all about I think at

1727
01:00:57,119 --> 01:01:00,400
end of the day it's like finding out

1728
01:00:58,798 --> 01:01:01,798
what you're good at doing that to the

1729
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,480
best of your ability so that you're

1730
01:01:01,798 --> 01:01:05,920
passing on something in the form of an

1731
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:08,039
energy totally to to everybody else yeah

1732
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:10,280
like a wisdom energy based in altruism

1733
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:12,599
you know and really to be able to share

1734
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:14,839
that is I mean you know as you just said

1735
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:17,280
it's like our a lot of us is life goal

1736
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:19,960
here and once you can actually come to

1737
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:21,640
fruition with that the happiness that um

1738
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:23,358
is experienced is something quite

1739
01:01:21,639 --> 01:01:25,358
special and unique you know yeah it's

1740
01:01:23,358 --> 01:01:28,480
something you can't buy the beauty of it

1741
01:01:25,358 --> 01:01:29,838
is you you can't buy it no way not even

1742
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:32,039
it's not in the same realm it's just

1743
01:01:29,838 --> 01:01:33,558
like you know even with marketing and

1744
01:01:32,039 --> 01:01:35,640
advertising some of this stuff you know

1745
01:01:33,559 --> 01:01:37,839
you can buy advertising but some of the

1746
01:01:35,639 --> 01:01:39,558
stuff you can't you know and the history

1747
01:01:37,838 --> 01:01:41,358
and the time and the people's commitment

1748
01:01:39,559 --> 01:01:42,720
and devotion like you say it's like

1749
01:01:41,358 --> 01:01:44,279
that's an unbought thing and that's

1750
01:01:42,719 --> 01:01:46,358
something that happens spontaneously

1751
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:48,680
organically and naturally in the human

1752
01:01:46,358 --> 01:01:50,440
mind that's like that's one of our

1753
01:01:48,679 --> 01:01:51,919
special traits here you know yeah and

1754
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:53,519
happiness is such an interesting thing

1755
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:55,119
because I think happiness comes from

1756
01:01:53,519 --> 01:01:56,920
devotion a lot of times and I think

1757
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:58,240
happiness a lot of people are like well

1758
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:59,599
I don't want to work I'd be happy if I

1759
01:01:58,239 --> 01:02:01,919
didn't work and I feel like I'm the

1760
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:03,880
opposite I think that work is what makes

1761
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:05,720
me happy being able to do what I do

1762
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:07,920
every day that makes me happy I'm super

1763
01:02:05,719 --> 01:02:10,358
happy that I'm able to do that stuff and

1764
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:12,639
hard work keeps us out of trouble hard

1765
01:02:10,358 --> 01:02:15,119
work hard work is so you know I think

1766
01:02:12,639 --> 01:02:17,960
hard work is great and you know I think

1767
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:19,880
when we're committed to one thing and

1768
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:22,079
devotional we can you know almost with

1769
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:24,000
blinders on that's when you can find

1770
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:26,480
real happiness on a different level and

1771
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,440
then work doesn't seem so tough it's

1772
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:30,599
still work and you know we're getting

1773
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:33,119
older so like our bodies get more beat

1774
01:02:30,599 --> 01:02:35,278
up every year a little bit but uh you

1775
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:37,798
know as far as like happiness is very

1776
01:02:35,278 --> 01:02:41,199
subjective totally I

1777
01:02:37,798 --> 01:02:43,000
mean you know like really if if that was

1778
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:46,439
most of our focuses and what we were

1779
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:49,278
doing was based in that kind of momentum

1780
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:51,278
of you know happiness altruism

1781
01:02:49,278 --> 01:02:53,960
compassion love these kind of things

1782
01:02:51,278 --> 01:02:56,480
that would really like as a society as a

1783
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:58,920
community as a peoples if we focus on

1784
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:01,880
that generate more of that and just do

1785
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:03,880
what we love really I think the you know

1786
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:05,559
the Ripple effects of that it's like

1787
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:07,559
it's world changing you know and and I

1788
01:03:05,559 --> 01:03:10,119
and I think that we're actually seeing

1789
01:03:07,559 --> 01:03:12,519
that in real time because all of us and

1790
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:15,318
even the generations before us because

1791
01:03:12,519 --> 01:03:17,079
we're kind of in that weird interm um

1792
01:03:15,318 --> 01:03:19,558
generation of cannabis it seems like

1793
01:03:17,079 --> 01:03:24,559
because there's the ones in their you

1794
01:03:19,559 --> 01:03:26,960
know 60s 7s 80s past and then us in our

1795
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:30,720
40s or whatever and then you know the

1796
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:33,519
sets below us but you know we really

1797
01:03:30,719 --> 01:03:35,639
um it's really something's quite special

1798
01:03:33,519 --> 01:03:37,798
that we got to take this torch on you

1799
01:03:35,639 --> 01:03:39,798
know and we really um I remember like

1800
01:03:37,798 --> 01:03:42,960
when Michael bacas Morpheus you know

1801
01:03:39,798 --> 01:03:44,480

1802
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:47,000

01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:15,119

1818
01:04:13,079 --> 01:04:17,079
funny we got the orgon country fair that

1819

the day and oh yeah now it's like what

1822
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:24,278
it is you know a little more corporate

1823
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:26,519
obviously but like yeah you know the

1824
01:04:24,278 --> 01:04:28,679

1827
01:04:30,838 --> 01:04:33,440
contact with the government system cuz

1828
01:04:32,199 --> 01:04:35,480
he's a senator and he is basically the

1829
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:37,440
one of the main champions of he you know

1830

and contacted him and got in contact

1834
01:04:44,639 --> 01:04:49,838
with him and he kind of put me under his

1835
01:04:47,358 --> 01:04:51,078
wing and had me help him how I can Al

1836
01:04:49,838 --> 01:04:53,318
from SC Labs getting me all the

1837
01:04:51,079 --> 01:04:55,278

1838
01:04:53,318 --> 01:04:57,558
things on thew the rule list you know

1839
01:04:55,278 --> 01:04:59,920
like yeah yeah like you know so a lot of

1840
01:04:57,559 --> 01:05:02,160
people don't understand you know we

1841
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:04,200
might be like a brand or you know us

1842
01:05:02,159 --> 01:05:06,480
sitting here they recogniz this maybe

1843
01:05:04,199 --> 01:05:09,239
for seeds or genetics or highend organic

1844
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:10,358
flour or whatever but the reality is is

1845
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:13,879
we're doing a lot of work behind the

1846
01:05:10,358 --> 01:05:15,679
scenes a lot of the times to really help

1847
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:17,880
this momentum happen and continue to

1848
01:05:15,679 --> 01:05:19,960
happen by getting proper laws put in

1849
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:22,880
place getting proper stewardship in the

1850
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:25,199
ways that at least the government can

1851
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:27,119
understand that you know someone that

1852
01:05:25,199 --> 01:05:29,519
smokes all day every day can be

1853
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:32,240
accountable can be you know eloquent can

1854
01:05:29,519 --> 01:05:34,440
be aware intelligent high IQ these

1855
01:05:32,239 --> 01:05:37,118
things happen without any hindrance from

1856
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:39,039
this plant and actually and more ex

1857
01:05:37,119 --> 01:05:41,079
expression of awareness through the

1858
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:43,039
plant and they can you know and that's

1859
01:05:41,079 --> 01:05:45,760
really helped I think because I saw we

1860
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:47,920
we consulted we went and consulted us uh

1861
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:50,799
finance committee US Congress n DC you

1862
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:52,720
know with it's like multiple politicians

1863
01:05:50,798 --> 01:05:54,719
there and everything it's like they

1864
01:05:52,719 --> 01:05:57,199
wanted to hear from us because we can

1865
01:05:54,719 --> 01:06:00,358
speak awar we can do these kind of

1866
01:05:57,199 --> 01:06:01,759
things with the the plant in a way that

1867
01:06:00,358 --> 01:06:05,278
was out of their understanding at the

1868
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:07,400
time you know in the you know 2012 13 14

1869
01:06:05,278 --> 01:06:08,440
15 16 now now it's like oh yeah they're

1870
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:11,000
like oh yeah all these smart people

1871
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:12,559
smoke weed no big deal you know totally

1872
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,039
well yeah I mean you know people are

1873
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:15,559
kind of slow to get it but this plant

1874
01:06:14,039 --> 01:06:18,160
makes the world a better place you know

1875
01:06:15,559 --> 01:06:20,359
at the end of the day you know and it's

1876
01:06:18,159 --> 01:06:23,358
funny because I think even my parents

1877
01:06:20,358 --> 01:06:24,920
generation they had a hard time with me

1878
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:26,199
wanting to be involved with cannabis

1879
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:27,720
growing and everything thing you know I

1880
01:06:26,199 --> 01:06:29,078
was pretty honest with my parents

1881
01:06:27,719 --> 01:06:31,639
especially they come and visit us and

1882
01:06:29,079 --> 01:06:33,000
stay at our house and I'd be like we got

1883
01:06:31,639 --> 01:06:34,400
plants in the garage and my dad's like

1884
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,559
oh yeah you got plant I'm like I got

1885
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:38,680
plants in the garage I just want to let

1886
01:06:35,559 --> 01:06:42,000
you know I got plants he's like you have

1887
01:06:38,679 --> 01:06:43,440
plants oh oh and you know it's like but

1888
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,880
it was kind of a shock and then he was

1889
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:48,599
kind of disappointed he was pretty

1890
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:51,039
impressed with the you know our basic

1891
01:06:48,599 --> 01:06:52,400
our carpentry skills and everything else

1892
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:53,880
but he was a little bit worried about

1893
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:56,200
the legality of it and me getting in

1894
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:58,640
trouble and then sanj gupa you know

1895
01:06:56,199 --> 01:07:00,558
comes on 60 Minutes and and he changed

1896
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:02,519
the world in a whole different

1897
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:04,160
perspective showing kids that benefited

1898
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:06,838
from cannabis for sure you know and from

1899
01:07:04,159 --> 01:07:09,358
cannaboids and I think for sure it's

1900
01:07:06,838 --> 01:07:10,920
hard to argue that this plant doesn't

1901
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:12,440
make a the world a better place you know

1902
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:14,480
I'm working in St Vincent in the

1903
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:17,240
Grenadines out in in I work with the

1904
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:18,960
government down there I donated 30,000

1905
01:07:17,239 --> 01:07:22,078
seeds and I created

1906
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:23,880
a strategy that should help Infuse a lot

1907
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:25,318
of money in the community if they do

1908
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:28,400
their own breeding on the island and

1909
01:07:25,318 --> 01:07:30,278
they have an identity uh for export and

1910
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:32,318
I think the potential for that is huge

1911
01:07:30,278 --> 01:07:34,920
but the government down there is very in

1912
01:07:32,318 --> 01:07:36,558
support of using the plant to make the

1913
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:38,079
world a better place and their Community

1914
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:41,480
a better place and I love that amazing

1915
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:43,920
yeah that's the I mean that's really the

1916
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:45,559
in my opinion the plants intention you

1917
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:49,119
know I know it's just a plant whatever

1918
01:07:45,559 --> 01:07:52,798
but you know for us to have such a

1919
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:54,760
high receptor base for the cannaboid

1920
01:07:52,798 --> 01:07:56,519
molecules and even like a lot of our

1921
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:58,960
favorite animal like the dog has one of

1922
01:07:56,519 --> 01:08:00,920
the largest cannaboid receptor systems

1923
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:03,079
in of all animals you know for it to be

1924
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:05,159
our you know co-pilot in a lot of this

1925
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:06,519
for a lot it's like you know there's

1926
01:08:05,159 --> 01:08:09,318
something special about this plant

1927
01:08:06,519 --> 01:08:11,679
that's on a deep level right you know

1928
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:15,358
and that we're all seeing it and sharing

1929
01:08:11,679 --> 01:08:18,000
it and being a part of it I mean I don't

1930
01:08:15,358 --> 01:08:19,559
hear anyone being like Oh no man like

1931
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,000
you know unless you know you people like

1932
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:22,880
to drink a lot of booze seem like they

1933
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,880
have a kind of issue with weed you know

1934
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:27,319
if they you know alcoholics or whatever

1935
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:29,400
they don't like to smoke weed because

1936
01:08:27,319 --> 01:08:31,199
maybe it makes them drink less it makes

1937
01:08:29,399 --> 01:08:32,639
you drink less they're like no that's a

1938
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:33,879
it's like what I always think with like

1939
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:36,000
alcohol you know it's like kind of like

1940
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:38,199
Corps in a in an ant's brain you know

1941
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,600
it's like the alcoholism is going to

1942
01:08:38,198 --> 01:08:42,599
basically manipulate you and coarse you

1943
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:44,120
to doing its task you know what I mean

1944
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:45,920
and and weed comes in the thing that's

1945
01:08:44,119 --> 01:08:47,920
going to make you drink less and so

1946
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:49,679
that's a that's a problem the weed is

1947
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:51,000
you know because the alcohol wants to be

1948
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:53,838
part of it more you know so it's like

1949
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:55,520
NOP less alcohol no weed then you know

1950
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:57,119
it's like um I've noticed that kind kind

1951
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:58,799
of correlation people that drink too

1952
01:08:57,119 --> 01:09:01,759
much they don't they don't like to get

1953
01:08:58,798 --> 01:09:03,960
high you know because yeah oh I have my

1954
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:05,600
I get a weird trip you know weird head

1955
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:07,880
trip you know I'll get anxious or it's

1956
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:10,838
like yeah man you for sure

1957
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:12,400
will yeah I mean I think for sure if you

1958
01:09:10,838 --> 01:09:14,399
smoke first and then drink you're going

1959
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:15,759
to drink way less totally and uh you

1960
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:17,238
might get sick if you're a drinker and

1961
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:18,759
then you're just an occasional smoker

1962
01:09:17,238 --> 01:09:20,519
you might get sick if you smoke too like

1963
01:09:18,759 --> 01:09:23,560
at the end you might get yeah you might

1964
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:25,400
get the spins or whatever totally but uh

1965
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:26,920
you know it's like but I think you

1966
01:09:25,399 --> 01:09:28,798
definitely drink less when you're

1967
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:30,798
smoking like that's just across the

1968
01:09:28,798 --> 01:09:32,600
board for sure you know and I do have

1969
01:09:30,798 --> 01:09:34,960
friends that Crossfade a little too much

1970
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:38,159

1971
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:39,560
the you know it's you know like I it's

1972
01:09:38,158 --> 01:09:41,039
really like moderation is key with

1973
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:42,759
everything even with cannabis you know

1974
01:09:41,039 --> 01:09:45,039
and um because you know once our

1975
01:09:42,759 --> 01:09:46,439
receptors are full they're full and you

1976
01:09:45,039 --> 01:09:48,158
know how much more you need early

1977
01:09:46,439 --> 01:09:50,158
actually you don't need to waste it you

1978
01:09:48,158 --> 01:09:51,559
know you can for sure you know there's

1979
01:09:50,158 --> 01:09:52,920
there's a you know it's like you know

1980
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:54,719
you get it when you're just smoking hash

1981
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:56,199
hash after hash and rosing and hash and

1982
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:58,198
hash at a certain point is just like

1983
01:09:56,198 --> 01:09:59,279
it's all flavor you know cuz it's ain't

1984
01:09:58,198 --> 01:10:00,839
nothing much more happen you're not

1985
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:02,840
going up any higher you know there are

1986
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:04,719
certain things uh Durban Poison being

1987
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:06,239
one of them and allow it that don't have

1988
01:10:04,719 --> 01:10:07,880
ceilings where you can just keep smoking

1989
01:10:06,238 --> 01:10:09,279
you can go you can go places you never

1990
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:11,880
thought you could go you're like this

1991
01:10:09,279 --> 01:10:13,559
feels like LSD yeah exact I've been

1992
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:15,239
there before or edibles you know from

1993
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:17,640
some of the African genetics it's like

1994
01:10:15,238 --> 01:10:18,759
wow you you just you do get a

1995
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:20,199
psychedelic experience and there's

1996
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:22,199
people that'll argue it but I've been

1997
01:10:20,198 --> 01:10:24,238
there so I know firsthand and I've done

1998
01:10:22,198 --> 01:10:25,960
plenty of psychedelics so I know in

1999
01:10:24,238 --> 01:10:27,359
comparison like I've had more of a

2000
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:29,439
psychedelic experience with some of

2001
01:10:27,359 --> 01:10:31,880
these varieties with Edibles drinking

2002
01:10:29,439 --> 01:10:33,039
bang where they mix it with hot milk for

2003
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:34,880
sure well that was what they you know a

2004
01:10:33,039 --> 01:10:36,800
lot of the Buddhist practitioners way

2005
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:38,960
back there's you know certain practices

2006
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:40,600
where that that's in combination with

2007
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:43,480
the practice you know yeah little bit of

2008
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:45,880
bong you know whole bottle go into their

2009
01:10:43,479 --> 01:10:48,519
Retreat cave and you know do their

2010
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:51,400
meditation I mean you're like whoa you

2011
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:53,280
know it's a you know I used to make this

2012
01:10:51,399 --> 01:10:55,559
uh back in the day you know we put just

2013
01:10:53,279 --> 01:10:57,079
pack a crock poot with Sugar Leaf oh

2014
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:58,560
yeah and then just put olive oil in

2015
01:10:57,079 --> 01:11:00,760
there and do like a slow cook on it

2016
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:02,440
through the day and then just you know

2017
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:04,119
stract that basically just pour that off

2018
01:11:02,439 --> 01:11:06,319
in filter and just take spoonfuls you

2019
01:11:04,119 --> 01:11:08,920
know and like you know one teaspoon

2020
01:11:06,319 --> 01:11:10,479
you're like you know one tablespoon you

2021
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:12,079
know like my buddy one time my buddy's

2022
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:13,639
like took like three tablespoon he calls

2023
01:11:12,079 --> 01:11:15,840
me the next day he's all bro I swear my

2024
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:18,520
heart stopped and it was beating like

2025
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:20,199
one time every couple minutes you know

2026
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:22,520
oh I've been there yeah we back in the

2027
01:11:20,198 --> 01:11:24,519
90s there wasn't a ton of literature

2028
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:26,640
there was like one book on the chemistry

2029
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:27,679
of it but we really liked exploring and

2030
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:29,880
trying different stuff and we had all

2031
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:32,440
this trim always right so we would make

2032
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:34,840
tinctures and we would do bicardi 151

2033
01:11:32,439 --> 01:11:36,639
and put it on the you know double burner

2034
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:38,239
and uh cook it in there and we had

2035
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,920
different ways of making butter and

2036
01:11:38,238 --> 01:11:41,959
everything else but we had so much extra

2037
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:43,679
trim that it was always like what can we

2038
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:45,000
do with it now and this was you know

2039
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:46,399
then we started making bubble hat and

2040
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:49,279
that all changed so it's like oh now we

2041
01:11:46,399 --> 01:11:50,799
got extract all the time well it's even

2042
01:11:49,279 --> 01:11:53,079
making like the making the tinctures out

2043
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:55,880
of bubble hash or like you know the the

2044
01:11:53,079 --> 01:11:57,439
220 or the whatever the 160

2045
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:58,800
love you'd like take all that and dry it

2046
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:01,479
and make the tincture out of that and

2047
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:03,000
like sure that's like you know what I

2048
01:12:01,479 --> 01:12:05,079
like to do is I like to heat the

2049
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:07,000
material just a little bit before cuz

2050
01:12:05,079 --> 01:12:08,279
like when I make the tincture when I

2051
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,000
don't heat it you know it kind of does

2052
01:12:08,279 --> 01:12:12,039
the fermentation thing and starts to

2053
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:14,319
like expand [ __ ] right and then you

2054
01:12:12,039 --> 01:12:15,960
decarb it right from the beginning you

2055
01:12:14,319 --> 01:12:17,519
decarb it when it's in flower form or in

2056
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:19,520
hash form and then put that to the

2057
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:22,480
extract and it's like just little easier

2058
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:23,639
to work with you know I found for sure

2059
01:12:22,479 --> 01:12:25,319
yeah I mean we always used to make

2060
01:12:23,639 --> 01:12:26,600
different stuff and different drinks and

2061
01:12:25,319 --> 01:12:28,198
Cocktails and we never knew the

2062
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:29,679
milligrams back in the day you just you

2063
01:12:28,198 --> 01:12:31,599
know you would be rushing you knew off

2064
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:33,600
the first shot you know like somebody

2065
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:35,520
knew off the first yeah like sometimes

2066
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:36,719
even the first 15 minutes you know some

2067
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:38,040
of this stuff when your face starts

2068
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:38,920
getting crunchy and hot or something

2069

2070
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:42,279
stronger start getting purple the only

2071
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:45,039
time that happens is when I eat peppers

2072
01:12:42,279 --> 01:12:48,158

2074
01:12:48,158 --> 01:12:51,319

tinure because like you know three four

2076

saying that you know because they well

2079
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:01,800
they do say that like cannaboids through

2080
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:04,320
the body through the stomach through the

2081
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:06,199
you know that kind of whole system is

2082
01:13:04,319 --> 01:13:08,079
going to create more of a psychedelic

2083
01:13:06,198 --> 01:13:10,279
experience you at a certain range you

2084
01:13:08,079 --> 01:13:13,679
know and you if you've eaten enough if

2085
01:13:10,279 --> 01:13:16,000
youve you know 200 whatever milligrams

2086
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:18,239
thousand 500 whatever yeah yeah like

2087
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:20,238
it's like it starts to happen yeah you

2088
01:13:18,238 --> 01:13:21,959
know and I've told I work with a lot of

2089
01:13:20,238 --> 01:13:24,238
people with cancer and everything and

2090
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:25,679
you know obviously with tinctures and

2091
01:13:24,238 --> 01:13:27,559
stuff like that and you know I've talked

2092
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:28,960
to this one woman she had um I forgot

2093
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:30,760

01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:43,319
disease because it's so bad you know and

2108
01:14:01,039 --> 01:14:06,359

2109
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:08,440

2110
01:14:06,359 --> 01:14:11,079
and five weeks she called me frantic you

2111
01:14:08,439 --> 01:14:14,599

2113

2116
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:25,198

2117
01:14:22,359 --> 01:14:26,960
oh man and gone you know and I and you

2118
01:14:25,198 --> 01:14:29,039
know like and she told me she's like the

2119
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:31,158
beginning was really hard cuz the amount

2120
01:14:29,039 --> 01:14:33,158
and when you're having a terminal

2121
01:14:31,158 --> 01:14:35,479
illness there's a lot of other things

2122
01:14:33,158 --> 01:14:38,039
psychologically going on right when

2123
01:14:35,479 --> 01:14:39,799
you're that level of being high and your

2124
01:14:38,039 --> 01:14:42,359
fear of deaths and these things you know

2125
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:44,239
like the very mortal things happen and

2126
01:14:42,359 --> 01:14:46,039
you know and she told me and but then it

2127
01:14:44,238 --> 01:14:47,519
kind of eased off and had this

2128
01:14:46,039 --> 01:14:50,679
experience and you know it's sick that

2129
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:52,480
was H I don't know maybe seven eight

2130
01:14:50,679 --> 01:14:54,760
years ago and still watch her on

2131
01:14:52,479 --> 01:14:57,119
Facebook with her husband they did you

2132
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:59,159
know coffee shop watched her daughter

2133
01:14:57,119 --> 01:15:01,519
graduate college you know and like to be

2134
01:14:59,158 --> 01:15:03,879
able to you know we have lots of and I'm

2135
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:06,040
sure you do too lots of you know stories

2136
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:07,760
like that and it's no [ __ ] better

2137
01:15:06,039 --> 01:15:10,719
blessing than that you know to be able

2138
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:13,320
to to see that and to share that and to

2139
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:15,119
you know share our experience of

2140
01:15:13,319 --> 01:15:17,759
creating this medicine in a you know

2141
01:15:15,119 --> 01:15:19,439
holistic way to where you know where it

2142
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:22,199
does make the world a better place and I

2143
01:15:19,439 --> 01:15:24,319
think a lot of us even an extra day one

2144
01:15:22,198 --> 01:15:27,198
one extra day longer it's all worth it

2145
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:29,039
right and if can give you that extra day

2146
01:15:27,198 --> 01:15:32,198
I've had friends that have used cannabis

2147
01:15:29,039 --> 01:15:34,238
and and lost their battles you knowt and

2148
01:15:32,198 --> 01:15:36,799
I've had friends that have beat cancer

2149
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:38,319
with cannabis and so and maybe it's not

2150
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:40,119
right for every type of cancer but it's

2151
01:15:38,319 --> 01:15:41,559
worth exploring and I think the other

2152
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:43,559
thing is it is scary if you're not a

2153
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:45,480
cannabis user going into trying cannabis

2154
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:48,039
you have cancer that's scary enough and

2155
01:15:45,479 --> 01:15:49,759
now you got to take this drug that a lot

2156
01:15:48,039 --> 01:15:50,800
of times seems scary on the outside and

2157
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:53,000
a lot of times you have to build your

2158
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:54,760
tolerance up to it a grma day is a lot

2159
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,840
wow you know it's it's a wow you know

2160
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:58,800
but and my friend month to build up you

2161
01:15:56,840 --> 01:16:01,199
know yeah my friend Dave mesford he he

2162
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:05,400
lost the battle you he he fought for I

2163
01:16:01,198 --> 01:16:07,158
think three years four years uh and he

2164
01:16:05,399 --> 01:16:09,599
was taking a gram a day and he built up

2165
01:16:07,158 --> 01:16:11,000
to that tolerance but like that's a lot

2166
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:13,239
you know I think he was at two grams a

2167
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:15,800
day at one point wow and that's that's a

2168
01:16:13,238 --> 01:16:18,319
a lot and you know but but if you can

2169
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:21,039
get an extra day or extra month or an

2170
01:16:18,319 --> 01:16:24,039
extra year of life I think that's you

2171
01:16:21,039 --> 01:16:25,719
know that's that's amazing for sure it's

2172
01:16:24,039 --> 01:16:27,439
worth every

2173
01:16:25,719 --> 01:16:29,800
aspect of it you know because we we

2174
01:16:27,439 --> 01:16:31,359
don't understand that like you know

2175
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:33,920
that's what people you know there's a

2176
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:36,359
lot of this Chase but really in those

2177
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:39,239
last phases it's going to be family what

2178
01:16:36,359 --> 01:16:41,399
how you treated people you know like how

2179
01:16:39,238 --> 01:16:43,158
you were loved how you love and those

2180
01:16:41,399 --> 01:16:45,198
are going to be the important things and

2181
01:16:43,158 --> 01:16:47,079
one thing about this plant it shows you

2182
01:16:45,198 --> 01:16:49,719
that too right it can show you that

2183
01:16:47,079 --> 01:16:52,238
before those you know in more terminal

2184
01:16:49,719 --> 01:16:55,679
phases even you know and if we utilize

2185
01:16:52,238 --> 01:16:57,479
it as a holistic medicine it can be as a

2186
01:16:55,679 --> 01:17:01,158
preventative in some ways just in our

2187
01:16:57,479 --> 01:17:03,519
own psyche you know feeling more love

2188
01:17:01,158 --> 01:17:05,519
acceptance these kind of things you yeah

2189
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:07,080
it's a great way to deal with trauma you

2190
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:09,199
know and some PE you know people use

2191
01:17:07,079 --> 01:17:11,559
alcohol to escape and to tune out

2192
01:17:09,198 --> 01:17:13,879
whereas I feel like plant medicine

2193
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:15,920
psychedelics cannabis especially Tunes

2194
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:17,880
Us in right it Tunes you into music it

2195
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:20,199
Tunes you into reality it Tunes you back

2196
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:21,719
into what's important and that's you

2197
01:17:20,198 --> 01:17:23,759
know that's why we're here today for

2198
01:17:21,719 --> 01:17:26,198
sure that's uh I think that is one of

2199
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:29,079
the big beauties of the planet is the

2200
01:17:26,198 --> 01:17:31,279
you know just like it does in our body

2201
01:17:29,079 --> 01:17:34,760
yeah the connectivity it does in

2202
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:37,238
community you know and the the reach and

2203
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:39,039
what it's I mean look at it's what's

2204
01:17:37,238 --> 01:17:40,479
happened to the world right now with

2205
01:17:39,039 --> 01:17:43,198
cannabis

2206
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:46,559
it's at one point it was a huge facet in

2207
01:17:43,198 --> 01:17:48,519
our industrial um formulation and

2208
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:50,800
agricultural formulation with Humanity

2209
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:52,840
right and kind of then got pushed under

2210
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:55,840
the rug you know intentionally

2211
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:58,800
unintentionally um but it couldn't be

2212
01:17:55,840 --> 01:18:01,279
held back right and now it's it's over

2213
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:03,840
you know the whole globe is infatuated

2214
01:18:01,279 --> 01:18:07,238
with it in a way that it's like maybe

2215
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:10,400
this is one of our last um last Great

2216
01:18:07,238 --> 01:18:14,000
Hopes you know yeah to evolve Humanity

2217
01:18:10,399 --> 01:18:17,319
as a race to give us fuel food and you

2218
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:19,319
know structural building tools to

2219
01:18:17,319 --> 01:18:21,479
actually change this kind of Continuum

2220
01:18:19,319 --> 01:18:22,719
of what we've created it's has

2221
01:18:21,479 --> 01:18:24,279
everything well it's such a complete

2222
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:26,198
part of our existence you know and it

2223
01:18:24,279 --> 01:18:28,279
can be used for so many different things

2224
01:18:26,198 --> 01:18:30,198
besides healing and all the other things

2225
01:18:28,279 --> 01:18:31,399
that are you know obvious to us I guess

2226
01:18:30,198 --> 01:18:34,238
maybe not to other people but very

2227
01:18:31,399 --> 01:18:36,158
obvious to us as far as building yeah we

2228
01:18:34,238 --> 01:18:39,158
can build with it we can build houses

2229
01:18:36,158 --> 01:18:42,359
with it we can build concrete flame

2230
01:18:39,158 --> 01:18:43,759
[ __ ] yeah there's just and there's

2231
01:18:42,359 --> 01:18:46,479
so many things you know they've been

2232
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:48,719
using it for for rope for the longest

2233
01:18:46,479 --> 01:18:50,759
time and textiles and well even I heard

2234
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:52,439
the first Ford like Model A all the

2235
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:54,800
fabrics and the Plastics were made of

2236
01:18:52,439 --> 01:18:56,919
hemp yeah well hemp is so much it lasts

2237
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:59,320
so much longer than cotton nobody in the

2238
01:18:56,920 --> 01:19:01,600
cotton industry wants to hear it but you

2239
01:18:59,319 --> 01:19:04,079
know that's you know it's a superior

2240
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:05,760
product on so many levels for sure you

2241
01:19:04,079 --> 01:19:07,559
know and it's a perfect protein you know

2242
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:10,000
if we look at the protein and the fats

2243
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:12,719
the quality of nutrition that it can

2244
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:14,600
give us and give to places that you know

2245
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:16,880
are malnourished I mean I think there's

2246
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:18,320
just so much potential for it yeah I

2247
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:19,800
think the potential is really Limitless

2248
01:19:18,319 --> 01:19:21,479
you know we haven't even we barely

2249
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:23,119
cracked the surface on it in my opinion

2250
01:19:21,479 --> 01:19:25,279
and what we're going to do and what

2251
01:19:23,119 --> 01:19:27,039
you're seeing you know because like I

2252
01:19:25,279 --> 01:19:29,198
mean every a lot of people are on you

2253
01:19:27,039 --> 01:19:30,880
know Instagram but you go to LinkedIn

2254
01:19:29,198 --> 01:19:32,839
and you know you're like holy [ __ ]

2255
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:35,000
there's like professionals doing like

2256
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:37,079
real professional [ __ ] on here you know

2257
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:40,198
I mean like at huge levels you know it's

2258
01:19:37,079 --> 01:19:41,800
uh some the scientists just I mean even

2259
01:19:40,198 --> 01:19:43,879
in breeding you know you hear stuff on

2260
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:45,320
my show we talk a little bit about data

2261
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:48,039
driven breeding but the potential for

2262
01:19:45,319 --> 01:19:49,920
breeding and and marker driven breeding

2263
01:19:48,039 --> 01:19:52,319
you know it's like uh for for traits and

2264
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:53,880
for drug Discovery I mean totally that

2265
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:56,519
gets me excited I mean I think plant

2266
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:59,800
medicine full spectrum plant medicine as

2267
01:19:56,520 --> 01:20:01,159
a whole it's like we were on this this

2268
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:02,679
trajectory that was completely the

2269
01:20:01,158 --> 01:20:04,319
opposite of that where they're like oh

2270
01:20:02,679 --> 01:20:05,840
you just take this one molecule and

2271
01:20:04,319 --> 01:20:07,519
it'll hopefully kill you for this but

2272
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:09,000
look at all the side effects right and

2273
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:10,960
now we're like oh well we have this full

2274
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:13,560
spectrum thing that has no side effects

2275
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:16,000
or very minimal side effects that does

2276
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:17,560
all these different things and we can

2277
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,479
use that and go in all these different

2278
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:21,880
directions once we start understanding

2279
01:20:19,479 --> 01:20:23,599
it better totally and I I think that's

2280
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:25,400
the beauty of right now what's happening

2281
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:27,280
that I mean even

2282
01:20:25,399 --> 01:20:29,399
um you know at the conference I was

2283
01:20:27,279 --> 01:20:31,238
talking to guy Martin and he was telling

2284
01:20:29,399 --> 01:20:33,319
me all these different things of you

2285
01:20:31,238 --> 01:20:34,359
know basically the science of seeing all

2286
01:20:33,319 --> 01:20:36,719
these different markers that are

2287
01:20:34,359 --> 01:20:39,479
released from different sugars light you

2288
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:42,119
know whatever and you can manipulate the

2289
01:20:39,479 --> 01:20:43,519
genetic cycle the plants growth all this

2290
01:20:42,119 --> 01:20:46,198
stuff just through these you know

2291
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:48,400
different markers it's like ah and

2292
01:20:46,198 --> 01:20:49,719
imagine the range of those because I was

2293
01:20:48,399 --> 01:20:51,799
telling it's like okay if this is just

2294
01:20:49,719 --> 01:20:54,158
structural and say conventional farming

2295
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:55,679
what about say like non-conventional

2296
01:20:54,158 --> 01:20:57,039
farming where you do have living soil

2297
01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:59,359
biome and all these kind of things the

2298
01:20:57,039 --> 01:21:02,319
enzymatic response and all that and

2299
01:20:59,359 --> 01:21:04,639
that's creating more of these factors

2300
01:21:02,319 --> 01:21:06,920
right and there's more you know just the

2301
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:08,679
net of factors and the range of

2302
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:10,719
possibilities just he's it just keeps

2303
01:21:08,679 --> 01:21:12,760
growing you know you're just like wow

2304
01:21:10,719 --> 01:21:14,800
chemotyping can totally change you know

2305
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:17,119
it's like and that's what people don't

2306
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:18,760
it's like we've we've got our our

2307
01:21:17,119 --> 01:21:19,960
phenotypes that everybody understands

2308
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:22,000
we've got the genotypes that are hidden

2309
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:23,719
inside and then we've got the chemotype

2310
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,600
Expressions that that we're looking for

2311
01:21:23,719 --> 01:21:27,319
these chemical Expressions they get

2312
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:28,639
changed you know they could be changed

2313
01:21:27,319 --> 01:21:30,519
by the environment they can get changed

2314
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:32,520
by the nutrition just like the phenotype

2315
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:34,360
can well you know that's what like um we

2316
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:35,560
know when philos come online and uh you

2317
01:21:34,359 --> 01:21:37,079
know the beginning and everything we

2318
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:38,880
started working with them and gave them

2319
01:21:37,079 --> 01:21:42,719
all the ogs that we had you know it be

2320
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:46,560
koser Kush uh you know ghost OG Fire OG

2321
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:48,319
sour best [ __ ] ever Skywalker OG and you

2322
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:50,360
know that that headband that was the OG

2323
01:21:48,319 --> 01:21:53,238
one you know right and they're like this

2324
01:21:50,359 --> 01:21:54,759
is all the same cut yeah all the same

2325
01:21:53,238 --> 01:21:56,599
I'm like I'm like oh I don't know man

2326
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:58,600
the highs are different you know and

2327
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:59,760
I've kept I kept them really healthy and

2328
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:02,239
so where they weren't having like

2329
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:04,000
morphology issues of through degradation

2330
01:22:02,238 --> 01:22:05,319
and stuff and they're you know I'm like

2331
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,600
still to this day I'm like I don't know

2332
01:22:05,319 --> 01:22:08,880
if they're the same cut or if they're

2333
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:12,440
s1's but they're really close well I'll

2334
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:13,960
tell you that Josh D and the ghost they

2335
01:22:12,439 --> 01:22:16,638
they had the same cut they went through

2336
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:17,880
different paths right and then I got

2337
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:20,000
them back and grew them side by side and

2338
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:22,760
they grew very differently uh but they

2339
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:25,198
were definitely related like they seem

2340
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:27,000
L's headband [ __ ] cuts the same you know

2341
01:22:25,198 --> 01:22:28,799
it's all the same you know and yeah so

2342
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,719
we had the headband cut that our friend

2343
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:32,880
NL had brought so he's the one that

2344
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:35,079
brought it to NorCal as headband he had

2345
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:37,600
got it from Josh and Josh was like you

2346
01:22:35,079 --> 01:22:39,559
can't call it OG and so he called it

2347
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:41,639
headband and he told he lied to us for

2348
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:43,920
years and we all we all called it

2349
01:22:41,639 --> 01:22:46,000
headband but it was just the Josh dog

2350
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:47,560
and it it yielded really well and the

2351
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:50,479
ghost that I had didn't yield nearly as

2352
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:52,400
well but uh yeah like the Skywalker OG I

2353
01:22:50,479 --> 01:22:55,198
have yields amazing you know it's like

2354
01:22:52,399 --> 01:22:59,479
you know that g-cut one whatever crowned

2355
01:22:55,198 --> 01:23:01,599
out you know Stacks really well the SPs

2356
01:22:59,479 --> 01:23:04,919
kind of looks similar but doesn't stack

2357
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:06,960
as well um but but I you know for me

2358
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:08,560
there is high differences and you know

2359
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:09,880
so I'm like okay well and epigenetic

2360
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:11,760
changes that probably happen along the

2361
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:14,119
way because people have put their energy

2362
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:15,880
into it right and then we've along with

2363
01:23:14,119 --> 01:23:17,719
you know bacteria there's like systemic

2364
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:19,960
bacteria that that's in the plant

2365
01:23:17,719 --> 01:23:22,480
there's all these things that happen to

2366
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:25,039
the life techniques of Horticultural you

2367
01:23:22,479 --> 01:23:26,599
know expression

2368
01:23:25,039 --> 01:23:29,719
right so we have stress whether it's

2369
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:32,199
pest or whether it's pathogen or you

2370
01:23:29,719 --> 01:23:34,079
know or environmental we have these

2371
01:23:32,198 --> 01:23:36,439
stressers that are going to manipulate

2372
01:23:34,079 --> 01:23:37,880
the plant and you know to say it's the

2373
01:23:36,439 --> 01:23:39,599
same plant after it goes through these

2374
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:42,000
paths in different directions it's it's

2375
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:43,280
not the same plant so tissue culture

2376
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,000
whether it can take it back you know

2377
01:23:43,279 --> 01:23:46,800
that's there's the argument of okay well

2378
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:49,319
we can take off these epigenetic changes

2379
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:50,880
I don't believe that fully U you know

2380
01:23:49,319 --> 01:23:51,960
and they're studying methylation now and

2381
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:55,279
some different

2382
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:56,520
things uh but you know it's all exciting

2383
01:23:55,279 --> 01:23:59,960
and I think we're just scratching the

2384
01:23:56,520 --> 01:24:01,920
surface of it um and in 10 years we're

2385
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:03,560
going to know a lot more about the plant

2386
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:05,440
we're going to know a lot more about

2387
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:07,039
ourselves uh you know and we're in this

2388
01:24:05,439 --> 01:24:09,158
beautiful place dud like I feel like

2389
01:24:07,039 --> 01:24:10,760
we're in the infancy of something that's

2390
01:24:09,158 --> 01:24:13,759
going to be longstanding that's going to

2391
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:16,560
have great impact over the next 100 200

2392
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:18,199
300 years if we're alive as as you know

2393
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:20,520
as mankind as long as we're alive we're

2394
01:24:18,198 --> 01:24:22,879
going to have impact on the future

2395
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:25,159
totally I mean even look at like um you

2396
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:27,880
know that uh the Chinese pharmacopia

2397
01:24:25,158 --> 01:24:30,079
from you know pre 2000 or pre you know

2398
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:31,400
over 2,000 years ago right yeah you know

2399
01:24:30,079 --> 01:24:32,920
where they you know the plant was they

2400
01:24:31,399 --> 01:24:34,279
called it what the plant of a 100 cures

2401
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:36,239
or something you know had more medicinal

2402
01:24:34,279 --> 01:24:39,319
uses than any other plant in the book

2403
01:24:36,238 --> 01:24:41,718
right back then to where where now 2,000

2404
01:24:39,319 --> 01:24:44,359
plus years later still talking about

2405
01:24:41,719 --> 01:24:46,600
that book then and it being

2406
01:24:44,359 --> 01:24:51,399
representative of what this plant can

2407
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:53,239
offer in you know preindustrial times MH

2408
01:24:51,399 --> 01:24:54,960
it's huge you know and you know we're

2409
01:24:53,238 --> 01:24:56,559
discovering that okay first agricultural

2410
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:58,359
set of cannabis was in Tibet you know

2411
01:24:56,560 --> 01:25:00,239
they're finding now you know when they

2412
01:24:58,359 --> 01:25:02,920
just discovered they're like well this

2413
01:25:00,238 --> 01:25:05,039
predates what we knew before so they

2414
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:09,679
were obviously growing this for some

2415
01:25:05,039 --> 01:25:12,198
reasons back then already you know and

2416
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:14,199
you know I think that just like with the

2417
01:25:12,198 --> 01:25:18,118
dog and these things you know certain

2418
01:25:14,198 --> 01:25:20,960
plants uh helped our

2419
01:25:18,118 --> 01:25:23,279
agricultural um kind of evolution in

2420
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:25,319
ways that other plants didn't you know

2421
01:25:23,279 --> 01:25:27,639
and if these medicinal plants like even

2422
01:25:25,319 --> 01:25:29,679
you look at iasa you know how who who

2423
01:25:27,639 --> 01:25:31,359
who knew to combine manister opsis copy

2424
01:25:29,679 --> 01:25:33,679
and chuno these two plants together to

2425
01:25:31,359 --> 01:25:35,679
make this potion right who who told them

2426
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:37,760
that how did that bit discover you know

2427
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:39,600
you know so like even like when you know

2428
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:41,600
I was like six years old I'm in Nebraska

2429
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:43,880
right in Lincoln these plants were in

2430
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:45,719
this dude's backyard you know you know

2431
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:47,600
me and my friend we you my neighbor

2432
01:25:45,719 --> 01:25:50,118
friend we just see him you know and I

2433
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:52,119
was like they were [ __ ] calling me

2434
01:25:50,118 --> 01:25:53,839
you know I'm like what I jumped the

2435
01:25:52,118 --> 01:25:55,639
fence ripped them all out the ground

2436
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:58,199
took them back to my house had one of

2437
01:25:55,639 --> 01:25:59,880
those blue little plastic swimming pools

2438
01:25:58,198 --> 01:26:01,960
fil put them in there filled it with

2439
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:04,319
water and me and my friend were just

2440
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:06,158
like with our feet Barefoot tromping on

2441
01:26:04,319 --> 01:26:08,000
it you know my dad comes out it's like

2442
01:26:06,158 --> 01:26:11,158
what the [ __ ] you know like military guy

2443
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:13,639
you know like you know

2444
01:26:11,158 --> 01:26:15,079
so and he you know he didn't smoke weed

2445
01:26:13,639 --> 01:26:16,600
he didn't you know he smoked cigarettes

2446
01:26:15,079 --> 01:26:18,399
but didn't like you know there was no

2447
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:20,159
reference of drug culture nature

2448
01:26:18,399 --> 01:26:22,118
anything like that but there's this

2449
01:26:20,158 --> 01:26:25,039
thing that's saying like you're

2450
01:26:22,118 --> 01:26:28,238
attracted to me mhm you know and so

2451
01:26:25,039 --> 01:26:29,960
you know as societies and tribes and

2452
01:26:28,238 --> 01:26:33,238
cultures over

2453
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:35,118
Millennia how much of how much has that

2454
01:26:33,238 --> 01:26:37,000
plant guided our Evolution you know and

2455
01:26:35,118 --> 01:26:39,639
here we are into this phase of the most

2456
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:43,600
technical time of humanity I mean in

2457
01:26:39,639 --> 01:26:45,520
current you know day um and here's this

2458
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:47,039
plant fully embedded and entangled all

2459
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:49,080
of it you know it's so strange that the

2460
01:26:47,039 --> 01:26:50,840
prohibition happened when it happened

2461
01:26:49,079 --> 01:26:52,479
right and like right when technolog is

2462
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:53,920
kicking off there's this cannabis

2463
01:26:52,479 --> 01:26:55,158
prohibition you know it's like and it's

2464
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:58,158
right around around the same time the

2465
01:26:55,158 --> 01:27:00,279
technology kind of boomed right so but

2466
01:26:58,158 --> 01:27:02,559
and then now you know 50 years later

2467
01:27:00,279 --> 01:27:04,000
we're or 40 years later we're coming

2468
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:05,280
back to it and understanding that hey

2469
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,039
it's not such a bad thing it actually

2470
01:27:05,279 --> 01:27:08,800
makes the world a better place it's

2471
01:27:07,039 --> 01:27:11,039
something that needs to be studied for

2472
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:12,800
sure I mean even like you know you can

2473
01:27:11,039 --> 01:27:14,920
see what it does even myself you know I

2474
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:18,679
was super aggressive when I was younger

2475
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:20,639
and yeah you know and it just made it

2476
01:27:18,679 --> 01:27:23,760
rounded the edges you know and it really

2477
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:25,440
um helped me see myself in a way that I

2478
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:28,520
didn't need to be aggressive I didn't

2479
01:27:25,439 --> 01:27:32,238
need to be that guy I can be softer more

2480
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:35,280
patient you know more understanding I

2481
01:27:32,238 --> 01:27:37,839
can be less arrogant and you know less

2482
01:27:35,279 --> 01:27:40,118
of an egomaniac and I can see those

2483
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:43,960
things and the plant really shows you

2484
01:27:40,118 --> 01:27:46,000
that you know really you know like it's

2485
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:48,439
like if you say something that was maybe

2486
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:51,198
self-centered or rude or something you

2487
01:27:48,439 --> 01:27:52,799
smoke some weed and everyone's gone

2488
01:27:51,198 --> 01:27:55,118
you'll be thinking about that thing

2489
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:57,760
right you know and thinking that that

2490
01:27:55,118 --> 01:28:01,279
wasn't the right thing to do and say why

2491
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:02,639
cuz this plant you know it's trying it's

2492
01:28:01,279 --> 01:28:04,639
doing its best to make it better you

2493
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:06,760
know for sure well and on a deeper level

2494
01:28:04,639 --> 01:28:08,159
I think that we are who we are because

2495
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:10,719
of the experiences we've had and the

2496
01:28:08,158 --> 01:28:12,359
trauma that we've had and so we all have

2497
01:28:10,719 --> 01:28:13,960
this unique lens that we see the world

2498
01:28:12,359 --> 01:28:17,198
through and then when you're able to

2499
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:19,079
smoke cannabis some of those traumas can

2500
01:28:17,198 --> 01:28:20,799
kind of get moved over here and then we

2501
01:28:19,079 --> 01:28:22,679
can see the world how it really is I

2502
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:24,119
mean I think psychedelics will even do

2503
01:28:22,679 --> 01:28:26,079
that further they'll take more of those

2504
01:28:24,118 --> 01:28:30,399
filters off and then you're like whoa

2505
01:28:26,079 --> 01:28:32,118
cuz ego really makes us not not necessar

2506
01:28:30,399 --> 01:28:34,079
who we are but ego can totally screw us

2507
01:28:32,118 --> 01:28:36,238
up you know and make us see the world

2508
01:28:34,079 --> 01:28:38,600
from a completely different perspective

2509
01:28:36,238 --> 01:28:41,238
have negative impact and the more we can

2510
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:43,079
kind of strip away that ego the more we

2511
01:28:41,238 --> 01:28:45,158
can become good people and make the

2512
01:28:43,079 --> 01:28:47,399
world a better place so for sure I mean

2513
01:28:45,158 --> 01:28:49,519
it it lies to us consistently you know

2514
01:28:47,399 --> 01:28:51,359
to get what it needs which it wants to

2515
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:55,080
be permanent it wants to be stagnant it

2516
01:28:51,359 --> 01:28:57,238
wants to be there yeah and you know

2517
01:28:55,079 --> 01:28:59,719
Freedom doesn't happen there you know

2518
01:28:57,238 --> 01:29:01,799
and so like if we can you know utilize

2519
01:28:59,719 --> 01:29:03,679
this plant step back see the ego see its

2520
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:06,679
entanglement of aversion of attachment

2521
01:29:03,679 --> 01:29:08,840
and what it's kind of doing to our to

2522
01:29:06,679 --> 01:29:11,560
our brain yeah you know and through a

2523
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:14,000
fear response or basically or a you know

2524
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:17,119
desire response or something so if we

2525
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:20,118
can see that by just you know stepping

2526
01:29:17,118 --> 01:29:22,118
aside well ego so desperately wants you

2527
01:29:20,118 --> 01:29:23,799
to feel special you know you want to

2528
01:29:22,118 --> 01:29:25,960
feel special ego tells you that you need

2529
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:27,840
to special that you need to be different

2530
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:29,439
you deserve it that you deserve to be

2531
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:30,920
special or that you deserve to be

2532
01:29:29,439 --> 01:29:34,000
different than everybody else and and

2533
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:36,600
really I think our job is to just come

2534
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:38,800
come here do what we're best at to the

2535
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:40,719
best of our ability and try to leave

2536
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:43,039
something good for everybody else by

2537
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:44,520
totally I mean I think um you know we

2538
01:29:43,039 --> 01:29:46,238
have this term called bodhichitta you

2539
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:47,639
know which is the altruistic mind that

2540
01:29:46,238 --> 01:29:49,839
wishes to achieve enlightenment for the

2541
01:29:47,639 --> 01:29:51,600
sake of all other beings you know and

2542
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:54,440
you know there's a being called abhava

2543
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:57,880
which has taken that mind as its Core

2544
01:29:54,439 --> 01:29:59,960
Essence of you know experience here and

2545
01:29:57,880 --> 01:30:03,880
really altruistically tries to help

2546
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:05,719
others in a way that's ultimate you know

2547
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:09,480
and I think this plant

2548
01:30:05,719 --> 01:30:11,198
really you know can help that and that

2549
01:30:09,479 --> 01:30:13,279
is where the true happiness will come

2550
01:30:11,198 --> 01:30:17,039
from yeah you know when we're when we're

2551
01:30:13,279 --> 01:30:19,399
not based in our arrogant egoic

2552
01:30:17,039 --> 01:30:21,639
entanglement and we can step back and

2553
01:30:19,399 --> 01:30:23,759
see things altruistically and really

2554
01:30:21,639 --> 01:30:25,480
help others you know there's this uh you

2555
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:27,039
know saying you know for as long as

2556
01:30:25,479 --> 01:30:29,158
space remains for as long as sentient

2557
01:30:27,039 --> 01:30:30,560
beings remain until then may I too

2558
01:30:29,158 --> 01:30:32,238
remain to dispel the miseries of the

2559
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:34,960
world and you know and that's kind of

2560
01:30:32,238 --> 01:30:38,559
the essence of the bodh of mind which

2561
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:41,399
really this plant in my you know eyes

2562
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:43,239
fully entangles that Essence and

2563
01:30:41,399 --> 01:30:46,279
everyone that it doesn't matter what you

2564
01:30:43,238 --> 01:30:49,118
believe what you think what you you know

2565
01:30:46,279 --> 01:30:51,158
eat what you drink usually people that

2566
01:30:49,118 --> 01:30:54,319
consume cannabis when they do it they

2567
01:30:51,158 --> 01:30:56,559
feel better right they feel happier well

2568
01:30:54,319 --> 01:30:57,759
they they whether they know it or not

2569
01:30:56,560 --> 01:31:00,800
they're on the path to spiritual

2570
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:03,000
enlightenment you know I love that right

2571
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:04,600
in the whole buddh is the principles

2572
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,238
behind it I think it's amazing because

2573
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:08,159
spiritual enlightenment is something

2574
01:31:06,238 --> 01:31:09,959
that whether you know you're on that

2575
01:31:08,158 --> 01:31:12,118
path or or not if you're smoking

2576
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:14,198
cannabis or you take plant medicine

2577
01:31:12,118 --> 01:31:16,118
you're on that path for sure because you

2578
01:31:14,198 --> 01:31:19,319
know that Evolution process is something

2579
01:31:16,118 --> 01:31:22,079
that you know most of us are not going

2580
01:31:19,319 --> 01:31:25,079
to escape in our lifetimes you know it's

2581
01:31:22,079 --> 01:31:26,760
it's really I think uh the human nature

2582
01:31:25,079 --> 01:31:28,559
and I think it's all beings nature

2583
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:30,880
actually and because you can set see

2584
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:32,440
that even if you put a flame towards a

2585
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:34,520
bug it's going to go away from the flame

2586
01:31:32,439 --> 01:31:37,319
not into the flame right so even on a

2587
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:38,760
ant level it doesn't want to suffer

2588
01:31:37,319 --> 01:31:40,880
right and you can see that most the

2589
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:42,159
reason most people are doing the things

2590
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:43,560
they're doing is because they don't want

2591
01:31:42,158 --> 01:31:45,638
to suffer and they think that they're

2592
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:47,400
going to do the things that are going to

2593
01:31:45,639 --> 01:31:49,279
eliminate that suffering or they're not

2594
01:31:47,399 --> 01:31:50,879
going to suffer you know but most of us

2595
01:31:49,279 --> 01:31:53,679
are doing the things that make us suffer

2596
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:55,639
because we are not informed you know um

2597
01:31:53,679 --> 01:31:59,158
but but I think if people really focus

2598
01:31:55,639 --> 01:32:02,719
on love you know compassion and really

2599
01:31:59,158 --> 01:32:04,439
um you know selflessness you know which

2600
01:32:02,719 --> 01:32:06,079
happens from mindfulness you know you

2601
01:32:04,439 --> 01:32:07,960
don't have to be in your thought pattern

2602
01:32:06,079 --> 01:32:09,920
of your ego of what you're trying to

2603
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:12,520
convince your brain to believe through

2604
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:14,800
being special or you know if you can

2605
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:17,040
just be in a breath and be

2606
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:18,639
aware moment and shut that off a lot of

2607
01:32:17,039 --> 01:32:20,238
times most people don't even know how to

2608
01:32:18,639 --> 01:32:22,560
do that I think and it took me a long

2609
01:32:20,238 --> 01:32:24,399
time of even trying to do that before I

2610
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:26,039
learned how to shut it off you know like

2611
01:32:24,399 --> 01:32:28,879
to where I'm living in the moment I'm

2612
01:32:26,039 --> 01:32:31,920
living in that breath totally that that

2613
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:33,359
flow State mind really like you know if

2614
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:34,840
you're an athlete or high level athlete

2615
01:32:33,359 --> 01:32:36,799
or musician you can really relate with

2616
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:38,360
it well you know but you know it's kind

2617
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:40,639
of it's similar you know Jiu-Jitsu

2618
01:32:38,359 --> 01:32:42,198
changed my mind changed my it changed my

2619
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:43,639
life for that especially that flow State

2620
01:32:42,198 --> 01:32:45,158
and combining it with cannabis is

2621
01:32:43,639 --> 01:32:48,079
another one where all the jits studes

2622
01:32:45,158 --> 01:32:50,079
love cannabis yeah and the reason all

2623
01:32:48,079 --> 01:32:52,679
everybody that does jiujitsu or martial

2624
01:32:50,079 --> 01:32:54,439
arts I mean I think a lot of guys

2625
01:32:52,679 --> 01:32:56,840
because you can get in that state where

2626
01:32:54,439 --> 01:32:59,719
you're not thinking you're just uh

2627
01:32:56,840 --> 01:33:01,400
reacting and you're moving and flowing

2628
01:32:59,719 --> 01:33:02,719
without having to think about what am I

2629
01:33:01,399 --> 01:33:04,198
doing next because the second you start

2630
01:33:02,719 --> 01:33:06,079
thinking about what you're doing next

2631
01:33:04,198 --> 01:33:08,960
you're going a lot slower than you would

2632
01:33:06,079 --> 01:33:10,800
if you're just reacting and flowing

2633
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:12,198
totally without a doubt you know it's

2634
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:13,960
like and I'm not even that good at

2635
01:33:12,198 --> 01:33:15,678
Jiu-Jitsu I'm not good at all at

2636
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:17,399
Jiu-Jitsu but I love Jiu-Jitsu and I

2637
01:33:15,679 --> 01:33:18,960
love what it does for my body and for my

2638
01:33:17,399 --> 01:33:21,118
mind and it's something that I need to

2639
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:22,880
do a lot more of so yeah no it's a

2640
01:33:21,118 --> 01:33:24,920
really um amazing thing I wrestled you

2641
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:27,400
know all through school and and did some

2642
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:30,199
jits and my K did some jits and uh you

2643
01:33:27,399 --> 01:33:32,238
know like it's that anything that you're

2644
01:33:30,198 --> 01:33:34,359
going to be doing an intense active

2645
01:33:32,238 --> 01:33:37,799
sport yeah that you have to like you

2646
01:33:34,359 --> 01:33:40,839
said you have to be mindful and you know

2647
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:42,159
um present and not be thinking or you're

2648
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:44,679
not going to perform well whether it be

2649
01:33:42,158 --> 01:33:47,439
surfing snowboarding you know like deep

2650
01:33:44,679 --> 01:33:50,719
powdering trees and or climbing you know

2651
01:33:47,439 --> 01:33:52,439
it's all these things take a focus that

2652
01:33:50,719 --> 01:33:55,480
if you're thinking I mean don't get me

2653
01:33:52,439 --> 01:33:57,079
wrong cling analytical but like it's

2654
01:33:55,479 --> 01:33:59,638
less Flow State but I've seen my friend

2655
01:33:57,079 --> 01:34:02,079
that climbs you know free solo like you

2656
01:33:59,639 --> 01:34:03,319
know 500,000 foot stuff free solo that

2657
01:34:02,079 --> 01:34:04,600
dude's in the Flow State he ain't

2658
01:34:03,319 --> 01:34:05,759
thinking you know he's like well it's

2659
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:07,199
the same thing cooking on the line when

2660
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:08,760
you're working in a kitchen or when

2661
01:34:07,198 --> 01:34:10,439
you're cooking or whether you're doing

2662
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:11,719
Jiu-Jitsu it's all about preparation

2663
01:34:10,439 --> 01:34:14,439
right so if you're

2664
01:34:11,719 --> 01:34:16,118
prepared even growing to a degree like

2665
01:34:14,439 --> 01:34:18,279
if you're prepared ahead of time you're

2666
01:34:16,118 --> 01:34:20,118
going to have a lot better results you

2667
01:34:18,279 --> 01:34:21,639
know you might get lucky you might get

2668
01:34:20,118 --> 01:34:23,960
lucky in Jiu-Jitsu you might get lucky

2669
01:34:21,639 --> 01:34:26,000
in the kitchen but uh if you're not

2670
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:27,639
prepared you're not going to have as

2671
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,639
good results and the thing is is like

2672
01:34:27,639 --> 01:34:29,960
because you don't have to really think

2673
01:34:28,639 --> 01:34:31,679
about what you're doing you can flow

2674
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:33,039
even in the kitchen you have all your

2675
01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:34,039
ingredients laid out in front of you

2676
01:34:33,039 --> 01:34:35,800
you're going to have a lot better

2677
01:34:34,039 --> 01:34:37,118
results than if you're scrambling around

2678
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:39,760
the kitchen finding stuff you know at

2679
01:34:37,118 --> 01:34:41,639
the last doubt so and it translates to

2680
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:43,280
so many things like at the you know

2681
01:34:41,639 --> 01:34:44,279
buying stuff you you go to the grow shop

2682
01:34:43,279 --> 01:34:46,359
and they're out of the thing that you

2683
01:34:44,279 --> 01:34:48,519
needed that day you know and that

2684
01:34:46,359 --> 01:34:50,198
happens all the time I mean a lot of

2685
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:52,040
people and it's like if you're prepared

2686
01:34:50,198 --> 01:34:54,519
in advance you're going to have a lot

2687
01:34:52,039 --> 01:34:56,279
more success holy creating that

2688
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:58,760
foundation in anything that you're going

2689
01:34:56,279 --> 01:35:02,118
to basically have success in is clutch

2690
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:03,360
you know and really really um you know

2691
01:35:02,118 --> 01:35:04,799
understanding the causal nature of

2692
01:35:03,359 --> 01:35:07,079
things and then breaking down that

2693
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:09,279
formula and you know and getting

2694
01:35:07,079 --> 01:35:11,960
prepared it's it's a huge part of

2695
01:35:09,279 --> 01:35:15,639
anything especially spiritual practice

2696
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:17,439
cultivation music martial arts any high

2697
01:35:15,639 --> 01:35:19,359
level sport yeah you know it's like even

2698
01:35:17,439 --> 01:35:21,519
with surfing if you can surf and you can

2699
01:35:19,359 --> 01:35:23,960
be good but if you're not in shape yeah

2700
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:26,119
you can [ __ ] drown you know like with

2701
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:27,600
a quick you know like it's like you

2702
01:35:26,118 --> 01:35:29,279
think you you know well last time I

2703
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:30,840
surfed I could surf this this size you

2704
01:35:29,279 --> 01:35:33,118
know you get out there and C paddle and

2705
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:37,119
you be like in the Impact Zone just like

2706
01:35:33,118 --> 01:35:39,519
you know yeah rethinking life oh yeah

2707
01:35:37,118 --> 01:35:40,759
you know like yeah or you get caught in

2708
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:42,760
the wrong side of a set and you have

2709
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:45,440
another wave crashing on you and uh yeah

2710
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:48,440
it's all bad yeah no it's you really get

2711
01:35:45,439 --> 01:35:50,359
um nothing's you know I've you know I've

2712
01:35:48,439 --> 01:35:54,238
climbed a lot of stuff in Yus and stuff

2713
01:35:50,359 --> 01:35:55,839
and um but nothing's um put a uh reality

2714
01:35:54,238 --> 01:35:57,959
check on me more than almost drowning

2715
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:59,520
and big set or you know because it's

2716
01:35:57,960 --> 01:36:01,239
like you get to a point where you can't

2717
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:03,840
even breathe even though you're above

2718
01:36:01,238 --> 01:36:05,559
surface you know you're so exhausted and

2719
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:06,960
winded from holding your breath and like

2720
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:09,679
taking beatings that you come up and

2721
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:11,079
you're like like hyperventilated almost

2722
01:36:09,679 --> 01:36:13,239
that you can't even breathe even though

2723
01:36:11,079 --> 01:36:14,479
you're above the surface it's like

2724
01:36:13,238 --> 01:36:16,479
experience yeah I've got a lot of water

2725
01:36:14,479 --> 01:36:18,678
in my lungs before and it's not fun you

2726
01:36:16,479 --> 01:36:20,039
know and thought I was going to die and

2727
01:36:18,679 --> 01:36:22,199
I experienced that at a very young age

2728
01:36:20,039 --> 01:36:24,000
so kind of it's It's funny those things

2729
01:36:22,198 --> 01:36:25,399
that you experience at a young age can

2730
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:27,920
be really beneficial especially

2731
01:36:25,399 --> 01:36:30,399
near-death experiences you learn how

2732
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:31,800
fragile life is to a deg it took me a

2733
01:36:30,399 --> 01:36:33,599
long time you know I was in my 30s

2734
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:35,480
before I really understood but I

2735
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:38,800
understood life a lot more from almost

2736
01:36:35,479 --> 01:36:41,638
dying as a kid um you know I I almost

2737
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:44,719
ODed as a kid as well and so I think

2738
01:36:41,639 --> 01:36:46,039
those kind of things put the you know

2739
01:36:44,719 --> 01:36:47,679
the the experience of life and the

2740
01:36:46,039 --> 01:36:49,439
fragility of life into perspective a

2741
01:36:47,679 --> 01:36:50,880
little bit more without a doubt you know

2742
01:36:49,439 --> 01:36:54,118
I think a lot of us we just we were

2743
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:56,239
Invincible in our 20s you know it was it

2744
01:36:54,118 --> 01:36:57,559
wasn't until 30s yeah it's like you

2745
01:36:56,238 --> 01:37:00,599
start and I think you start losing

2746
01:36:57,560 --> 01:37:02,280
friends you know from from everything

2747
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:03,560
and as you get into your 40s now I'm

2748
01:37:02,279 --> 01:37:04,880
getting in my 40s and I was talking to

2749
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:06,920
some my friends in their 50s and they're

2750
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:08,319
like yeah just wait 50s is where you

2751
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:10,600
really start losing your friends your

2752
01:37:08,319 --> 01:37:12,359
health starts to go you know your 40s

2753
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:14,119
you might lose your vision a little bit

2754
01:37:12,359 --> 01:37:16,880
you know you might lose your hairline

2755
01:37:14,118 --> 01:37:18,279
you know but but yeah it's interesting

2756
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:19,840
aging is really interesting and it's

2757
01:37:18,279 --> 01:37:21,880
funny the knowledge that you get over

2758
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:23,679
time it's it's like the years move

2759
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:25,400
faster every year seems a little bit bit

2760
01:37:23,679 --> 01:37:28,000
faster than the year before and one of

2761
01:37:25,399 --> 01:37:29,638
my uncles put it into perspective that

2762
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:33,118
uh you know when you're 5 years old a

2763
01:37:29,639 --> 01:37:37,118
year is 20% of your life but when you're

2764
01:37:33,118 --> 01:37:40,238
50 you know it's it's a 125th of your

2765
01:37:37,118 --> 01:37:42,920
life or a 100 it's it's a 1% of your

2766
01:37:40,238 --> 01:37:44,479
life you know so really put I mean

2767
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:48,199
that's a really bad analogy right there

2768
01:37:44,479 --> 01:37:50,039
but like as far as like every year it

2769
01:37:48,198 --> 01:37:51,839
it's basically that one year is shorter

2770
01:37:50,039 --> 01:37:53,920
and so it seems like they just go from

2771
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:55,440
one season to the next a lot faster

2772
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:57,199
without a doubt even if you're good at

2773
01:37:55,439 --> 01:37:59,799
mindfulness practice and breath Focus

2774
01:37:57,198 --> 01:38:01,439
you know cuz I've you know I I try to

2775
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:02,880
stay pretty present and try not to think

2776
01:38:01,439 --> 01:38:04,439
about even you know my first teacher

2777
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:06,279
told me he like bro your brain's already

2778
01:38:04,439 --> 01:38:07,519
like clogged up with memories and stuff

2779
01:38:06,279 --> 01:38:08,880
he's like you got to eliminate a lot of

2780
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:11,360
that stuff so you can memorize things

2781
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:13,800
and get makes the space you know yeah um

2782
01:38:11,359 --> 01:38:15,559
but what I realized over the time is if

2783
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:18,159
I'm not looking back on the past and

2784
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:20,719
being present and aware and what's

2785
01:38:18,158 --> 01:38:23,000
happening time's non-existent it's like

2786
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:25,520
when I look back at the things and the

2787
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:27,599
moments and you know and the the the

2788
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:30,199
range and how you know it seems really

2789
01:38:27,599 --> 01:38:33,960
quick but if I start to go from this

2790
01:38:30,198 --> 01:38:36,598
moment back throughout this day than

2791
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:38,960
yesterday you know like it's quite long

2792
01:38:36,599 --> 01:38:40,560
and all the experiences are quite Rich

2793
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:43,118
you know right but if I'm looking from

2794
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:44,440
here to there wow man that sucks you

2795
01:38:43,118 --> 01:38:46,880
know I don't like to do that so much

2796
01:38:44,439 --> 01:38:48,799
Thanksgiving to Christmas it's just wow

2797
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:51,719
yeah like even watching my son grow up

2798
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:53,520
and everything and yeah become you know

2799
01:38:51,719 --> 01:38:55,639
start to become a young man and like

2800
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:57,760
like [ __ ] man it was like he was so

2801
01:38:55,639 --> 01:38:59,000
sweet dude like now it's like you're

2802
01:38:57,760 --> 01:39:02,079
like bro you're like you don't even want

2803
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:04,719
me to hug you in public barely bro like

2804
01:39:02,079 --> 01:39:06,519
totally you know yeah it's amazing how

2805
01:39:04,719 --> 01:39:08,118
fast time passes in some ways and how

2806
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:10,280
slow it is in others and it's all just

2807
01:39:08,118 --> 01:39:11,439
perception and perspective you know well

2808
01:39:10,279 --> 01:39:12,960
that's the thing is it's you know they

2809
01:39:11,439 --> 01:39:14,198
say in a from a Buddhist perspective

2810
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:16,960
they don't you know they believe time's

2811
01:39:14,198 --> 01:39:18,839
an illusion right and really because it

2812
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:20,359
impermanence is a truth so there's a

2813
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:22,159
continual flux in all things

2814
01:39:20,359 --> 01:39:25,079
everything's impermanent that's a truth

2815
01:39:22,158 --> 01:39:26,638
so um you know the all these planetary

2816
01:39:25,079 --> 01:39:28,279
structures and their movement and

2817
01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:30,118
everything they're always in flow and

2818
01:39:28,279 --> 01:39:31,599
always in a continual flux so there is

2819
01:39:30,118 --> 01:39:33,880
no fixed moment actually you know it's

2820
01:39:31,599 --> 01:39:35,560
like what's happened what's happening

2821
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:37,440
and what's yet to happen you know is how

2822
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:39,360
it would be broke down but time you know

2823
01:39:37,439 --> 01:39:42,000
that's the stagnation that we're trying

2824
01:39:39,359 --> 01:39:44,000
to fixate our you know our ego wants to

2825
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:46,800
make it real you know make it stable and

2826
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:48,319
make it make it solid and still you know

2827
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:49,639
we want it to last forever and even our

2828
01:39:48,319 --> 01:39:51,479
point of view you know that's the ego

2829
01:39:49,639 --> 01:39:53,760
wants it to be solid and you know this

2830
01:39:51,479 --> 01:39:56,158
is real this with truth you know the

2831
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:58,400
reality is it's not like you think with

2832
01:39:56,158 --> 01:39:59,759
most things you know even if we're

2833
01:39:58,399 --> 01:40:01,359
accurate you know even like with

2834
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:03,400
impermanence you know it's a permanent

2835
01:40:01,359 --> 01:40:05,439
thing you know there's like whatever 16

2836
01:40:03,399 --> 01:40:07,879
some types of permanences but like

2837
01:40:05,439 --> 01:40:09,799
impermanence being one of them but even

2838
01:40:07,880 --> 01:40:12,359
all the conceptual aspects of it and

2839
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:13,960
everything they're still representations

2840
01:40:12,359 --> 01:40:16,719
of our awareness and how we're

2841
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:20,920
perceiving things but in its true

2842
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:23,520
Essence all those fade away right yeah

2843
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:25,000
and it is how it is and what what's

2844
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:27,760
happening is what's happening but once

2845
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:29,439
we start to make it relative to our

2846
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:31,960
experience and whatever we're we're

2847
01:40:29,439 --> 01:40:34,799
still taking away of the depth and the

2848
01:40:31,960 --> 01:40:36,279
subtleties of it actually on a true

2849
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:38,840
level at least you know in my opinion

2850
01:40:36,279 --> 01:40:41,039
you know it's it's like really uh what's

2851
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:42,800
crazy is it's so subtle so vast so

2852
01:40:41,039 --> 01:40:44,960
simple and so deep you know all in the

2853
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:47,960
same aspects and you know time's a good

2854
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:49,800
one to kind of get lost in or you know

2855
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:53,000
the fact that it doesn't exist actually

2856
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:54,679
but the fourth dimension yeah totally

2857
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:57,399
yeah it's wild

2858
01:40:54,679 --> 01:40:59,480
uh you know so I had a psychedelic

2859
01:40:57,399 --> 01:41:01,479
experience from nitrous oxide when I was

2860
01:40:59,479 --> 01:41:02,959
a kid and that was it's funny because

2861
01:41:01,479 --> 01:41:04,919
like we talk about nitrous and people

2862
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:06,760
think of it hippie crack or whatever you

2863
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:08,359
know it's a strong one it's a strong it

2864
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:11,000
can be a strong one you know and I had a

2865
01:41:08,359 --> 01:41:12,839
full melt the First full melt DMT trip I

2866
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:15,639
ever had was on nitrous oxide oh yeah

2867
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:17,639
did they do the combo no no no no no I

2868
01:41:15,639 --> 01:41:19,880
got the experience from the nitrous

2869
01:41:17,639 --> 01:41:21,599
oxide and I was at a rave wow and I was

2870
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:22,760
in the VIP area and there was a bean bag

2871
01:41:21,599 --> 01:41:23,760
and someone just handed me a big

2872
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:26,960
punching ball

2873
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:29,360
balloon and I had hit this I'm like oh

2874
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:32,000
there's a there's a bean bag right there

2875
01:41:29,359 --> 01:41:35,079
yeah I was like perfect uh I had a full

2876
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:37,399
melt experience and I basically went to

2877
01:41:35,079 --> 01:41:39,559
this place and I understood everything

2878
01:41:37,399 --> 01:41:41,158
right stuff that you can't understand I

2879
01:41:39,560 --> 01:41:43,880
couldn't put it into words coming back

2880
01:41:41,158 --> 01:41:45,279
here but I really I I woke up and I

2881
01:41:43,880 --> 01:41:46,960
don't know how long I was out for but it

2882
01:41:45,279 --> 01:41:48,279
felt like a very long time and my

2883
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:49,679
friends like well where were you and I

2884
01:41:48,279 --> 01:41:51,439
was like dude you guys got I Tred to get

2885
01:41:49,679 --> 01:41:54,118
all my friends together yeah there was

2886
01:41:51,439 --> 01:41:55,799
no balloon when I woke up right

2887
01:41:54,118 --> 01:41:57,679
and literally I had to get all my

2888
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:59,279
friends to tell them everything that I

2889
01:41:57,679 --> 01:42:00,639
understood because I understood

2890
01:41:59,279 --> 01:42:03,118
everything I understood existence I

2891
01:42:00,639 --> 01:42:05,440
understood everything and got my friends

2892
01:42:03,118 --> 01:42:06,880
together and I couldn't put it into

2893
01:42:05,439 --> 01:42:08,118
words and it was the most frustrating

2894
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:11,159
thing ever because I had totally

2895
01:42:08,118 --> 01:42:14,039
understood it but in this dimension in

2896
01:42:11,158 --> 01:42:15,479
this plane I could not put it into words

2897
01:42:14,039 --> 01:42:17,760
because it's more than we can comprehend

2898
01:42:15,479 --> 01:42:19,598
in this existence but the one thing I

2899
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:21,440
took away from this whole experience and

2900
01:42:19,599 --> 01:42:23,840
this was I was 17 years old is that

2901
01:42:21,439 --> 01:42:26,519
we're all going to be okay and so that

2902
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:28,480
stuck with me I'm 47 now so that's like

2903
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:30,840
literally 30 years ago I had that we're

2904
01:42:28,479 --> 01:42:33,959
all going to be okay no matter what in

2905
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:35,560
the end we're all okay totally so yeah

2906
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:37,920
yeah I me I I remember one time smoking

2907
01:42:35,560 --> 01:42:39,400
a grandma DMT one night and you know got

2908
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:40,800
pretty high obviously with that hitting

2909
01:42:39,399 --> 01:42:42,319
it out the bong you know back when we

2910
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:45,119
didn't really know how to smoke it as

2911
01:42:42,319 --> 01:42:46,799
well you know like 20 some years ago and

2912
01:42:45,118 --> 01:42:50,000
I remember seeing the plant on the table

2913
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:51,679
you know and the soil and the container

2914
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:54,800
and myself and I remember seeing the

2915
01:42:51,679 --> 01:42:56,000
plant and me exact same energy yeah you

2916
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:58,920
know but the

2917
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:00,439
table was different the soil was a

2918
01:42:58,920 --> 01:43:02,399
little different and the pot was

2919
01:43:00,439 --> 01:43:04,759
different but me and the plant were the

2920
01:43:02,399 --> 01:43:07,479
same and I was like ah you know really

2921
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:11,000
having that realization that all living

2922
01:43:07,479 --> 01:43:13,238
things are sharing you know the similar

2923
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:14,840
type of energy right you know and and

2924
01:43:13,238 --> 01:43:16,598
then they even proved with DMT that they

2925
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:18,960
say that all you know carbon based life

2926
01:43:16,599 --> 01:43:21,880
has DMT in it you know and it's like

2927
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:23,118
you're like wow you know big lessons

2928
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:24,599
come from these psychedelic EXP

2929
01:43:23,118 --> 01:43:27,238
experiences a lot of times and we can't

2930
01:43:24,599 --> 01:43:30,319
really explain the depth of them a lot

2931
01:43:27,238 --> 01:43:33,118
of ways but one thing that this common

2932
01:43:30,319 --> 01:43:35,198
um you know thing is that everything's

2933
01:43:33,118 --> 01:43:37,719
interconnected MH they're all of the

2934
01:43:35,198 --> 01:43:39,839
same Source you know energy source light

2935
01:43:37,719 --> 01:43:42,198
whatever you know yeah and and there's a

2936
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:44,440
similarity that's much larger than a

2937
01:43:42,198 --> 01:43:46,198
difference for sure you know and that's

2938
01:43:44,439 --> 01:43:48,479
like you know it can come in all kinds

2939
01:43:46,198 --> 01:43:52,158
of different ways and the perspectives

2940
01:43:48,479 --> 01:43:53,439
and you know perceptions but well DMT is

2941
01:43:52,158 --> 01:43:54,920
so wild because you can have so many

2942
01:43:53,439 --> 01:43:56,839
different types of trips it's not just

2943
01:43:54,920 --> 01:44:00,279
the same experience every

2944
01:43:56,840 --> 01:44:02,039
time no it's not thank God thank God

2945
01:44:00,279 --> 01:44:03,559
yeah Salvia is a wicked one man that's

2946
01:44:02,039 --> 01:44:05,439
that's like when it comes to plant

2947
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:07,080
medicine Salvia is basically not a good

2948
01:44:05,439 --> 01:44:08,519
starting point for most people that's

2949
01:44:07,079 --> 01:44:11,039
like the end point and maybe you only do

2950
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:12,280
it a couple times or once you yeah you

2951
01:44:11,039 --> 01:44:13,960
shouldn't start there because you may

2952
01:44:12,279 --> 01:44:15,198
never want to do anything else ever if

2953
01:44:13,960 --> 01:44:17,880
you think that's what psychedelics are

2954
01:44:15,198 --> 01:44:21,118
about then you're probably yeah yeah for

2955
01:44:17,880 --> 01:44:23,159
sure wild yeah no that's the I have the

2956
01:44:21,118 --> 01:44:24,960
most respect for salvie actually you you

2957
01:44:23,158 --> 01:44:26,519
have to yeah if you don't you're going

2958
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:29,359
to be in big trouble it's like one of

2959
01:44:26,520 --> 01:44:30,159
those things it's like uh you know it's

2960
01:44:29,359 --> 01:44:32,439
it's

2961
01:44:30,158 --> 01:44:34,439
wild it's definitely wild you know I was

2962
01:44:32,439 --> 01:44:37,118
like well you know that's like the

2963
01:44:34,439 --> 01:44:40,118
opposite of DMT experience you know but

2964
01:44:37,118 --> 01:44:41,960
like similar message you know like I

2965
01:44:40,118 --> 01:44:45,158
mean similar message different yeah

2966
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:47,719
different path way different approach

2967
01:44:45,158 --> 01:44:49,920
like well yeah man yeah I mean

2968
01:44:47,719 --> 01:44:51,480
psychedelics are pretty wild U and then

2969
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:53,520
you know mushrooms it's funny now

2970
01:44:51,479 --> 01:44:55,118
mushrooms

2971
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:57,159
people take micro does now and I

2972
01:44:55,118 --> 01:44:58,920
appreciate micro does I I like micro

2973
01:44:57,158 --> 01:45:01,920
does for public speaking and stuff like

2974
01:44:58,920 --> 01:45:03,560
that but yeah me too as far as we never

2975
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:06,000
did micro does back in the day it was

2976
01:45:03,560 --> 01:45:07,480
like a half an eighth if you only could

2977
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:09,880
eat a gram you were like disappointed

2978
01:45:07,479 --> 01:45:12,118
you half an e is the the starting point

2979
01:45:09,880 --> 01:45:13,760
for for the real ones you know yeah and

2980
01:45:12,118 --> 01:45:15,598
and maybe we had more mild mushrooms I

2981
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:17,159
don't care but we always had trips so we

2982
01:45:15,599 --> 01:45:19,000
weren't we weren't taking mushrooms just

2983
01:45:17,158 --> 01:45:21,079
to feel okay we were taking mushrooms to

2984
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:23,560
experience something that lasted a while

2985
01:45:21,079 --> 01:45:25,198
and you know it changed our

2986
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:26,239
state of mind it wasn't just like oh

2987
01:45:25,198 --> 01:45:27,559
we're not going to drink tonight we're

2988
01:45:26,238 --> 01:45:29,158
going to eat a littleit you want the

2989
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:30,480
whole Forest to breathe you know right

2990
01:45:29,158 --> 01:45:32,279
exactly the the ground should be

2991
01:45:30,479 --> 01:45:35,759
breathing you know everything should be

2992
01:45:32,279 --> 01:45:37,479
coming alive for sure so yeah but it's

2993
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:39,119
interesting they're micro doing LSD

2994
01:45:37,479 --> 01:45:40,759
they're micro doing mushrooms they're

2995
01:45:39,118 --> 01:45:42,639

2996
01:45:40,760 --> 01:45:44,239
cannabis cannabis is like heavily micro

2997
01:45:42,639 --> 01:45:45,920
doed now compared to what we were doing

2998
01:45:44,238 --> 01:45:47,959
when we were younger well yeah even the

2999
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:50,639
LSD thing you know like I've been micro

3000

you're at a show or something you know

3004
01:45:56,319 --> 01:45:59,118

01:46:16,319 --> 01:46:19,880
anything you just you know seeing all

3018
01:46:17,880 --> 01:46:22,960
the sound come out in light and can't

3019
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:25,239
even talk or think anymore it's like oh

3020
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:27,039
you know so you know even back then I

3021
01:46:25,238 --> 01:46:31,238
started micro doing you know meaning

3022
01:46:27,039 --> 01:46:32,599
deluding yeah so it's more safe you know

3023
01:46:31,238 --> 01:46:34,519
you don't have to like you know you know

3024
01:46:32,599 --> 01:46:36,440
it's like oh you have to take 10 drops

3025
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:37,960
actually to get one drop you know one

3026
01:46:36,439 --> 01:46:39,919
hit so that's like safe you know it's

3027
01:46:37,960 --> 01:46:41,359
way safer actually that's that's a great

3028
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:42,560
yeah the 10 10 to one is a great

3029
01:46:41,359 --> 01:46:43,960
approach for sure you know you got to

3030
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:45,280
get yourself in trouble on purpose with

3031
01:46:43,960 --> 01:46:48,560
that one you know it's not like you're

3032
01:46:45,279 --> 01:46:51,000
like even you know doing events or doing

3033
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:52,280
talks or podcasts it's like you know

3034
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,639
know it's like are you going to really

3035
01:46:52,279 --> 01:46:55,399
you don't need that many you just take

3036
01:46:53,639 --> 01:46:56,960
one and then you know you have energy

3037
01:46:55,399 --> 01:46:58,279
two whatever but you know you're not

3038
01:46:56,960 --> 01:47:00,719
going on stage you know you don't want

3039
01:46:58,279 --> 01:47:03,039
to be like you know so it's different

3040
01:47:00,719 --> 01:47:04,800
you know um like with the cactus for me

3041
01:47:03,039 --> 01:47:07,519
I you know I took Cactus every day for

3042
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:10,079
like three years and yeah um you know

3043
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:12,520
and that was kind you micro do it too or

3044
01:47:10,079 --> 01:47:15,079
I guess you could say that but you know

3045
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:17,119
I would take a you know I mean I would

3046
01:47:15,079 --> 01:47:18,519
take the same amount now that I'd take

3047
01:47:17,118 --> 01:47:19,719
if I me me and the lady are going out

3048

on psychedelics just in one form or

3070
01:48:05,039 --> 01:48:08,920
another for sure you know and so well

3071
01:48:07,479 --> 01:48:10,598
now there's so many options too it's not

3072
01:48:08,920 --> 01:48:12,279
like back in the day there was like one

3073
01:48:10,599 --> 01:48:15,039
or two now it's like there's a wide

3074
01:48:12,279 --> 01:48:17,158
spectrum of you know for sure I mean I I

3075
01:48:15,039 --> 01:48:19,319
hear even there's MDMA pens you know I

3076
01:48:17,158 --> 01:48:20,759
know there's DMT pens mushroom pens you

3077
01:48:19,319 --> 01:48:22,279
know like all these things you're like

3078
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:24,360
really and I'll just keep it simple like

3079
01:48:22,279 --> 01:48:26,039
how it's always I like old school myself

3080
01:48:24,359 --> 01:48:28,198
but yeah it's wild everything want you

3081
01:48:26,039 --> 01:48:29,679
know it's funny cuz we've we've started

3082
01:48:28,198 --> 01:48:32,519
to go in this direction of convenience

3083
01:48:29,679 --> 01:48:34,158
and I do love the pre-roll hand roll

3084
01:48:32,520 --> 01:48:35,719
model for cannabis I'm not a huge hash

3085
01:48:34,158 --> 01:48:38,439
hole guy we may do a hash hole in

3086
01:48:35,719 --> 01:48:40,118
metrics one of these days but as far as

3087
01:48:38,439 --> 01:48:41,759
I do like the convenience for the hand

3088
01:48:40,118 --> 01:48:44,079
roll but everything's gone into pen so

3089
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:45,239
like Rosen carts I think it's cool I

3090
01:48:44,079 --> 01:48:46,880
think Rosen carts are good but you got

3091
01:48:45,238 --> 01:48:48,519
to use them right away they don't taste

3092
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:50,880
for me like Rosen cards aren't good

3093
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:53,159
after well even a couple weeks yeah even

3094
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:54,880
if you know the first 10 hits Roz and

3095
01:48:53,158 --> 01:48:57,079
Carter all right but yeah then they go

3096
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:59,920
it goes downhill really fast and so you

3097
01:48:57,079 --> 01:49:01,519
see these two G carts now I'm like why

3098
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:03,520
would you have a two gr cart like I

3099
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:06,040
would prefer a half gram cart especially

3100
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:07,800
a Rosen cart a half gram rosin cart over

3101
01:49:06,039 --> 01:49:09,439
two grams of anything because after the

3102
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:11,760
first gram it's all garbage like I don't

3103
01:49:09,439 --> 01:49:14,118
I don't want it I would much color

3104
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:15,440
change oh yeah you go from this nice

3105
01:49:14,118 --> 01:49:16,799
light color to this dark color

3106
01:49:15,439 --> 01:49:19,238
something's going

3107
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:20,760
on so yeah but we do live in this world

3108
01:49:19,238 --> 01:49:22,319
of convenience so with everything people

3109
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:23,760
are like oh how can I how can I get it

3110
01:49:22,319 --> 01:49:25,118
easily and how how is it easily

3111
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:26,280
accessible and I understand that the

3112
01:49:25,118 --> 01:49:27,639
pre-roll because I want people to

3113
01:49:26,279 --> 01:49:29,639
experience the same kind of joint I get

3114
01:49:27,639 --> 01:49:31,400
to smoke and I I take the time and

3115
01:49:29,639 --> 01:49:33,000
effort to roll these perfect joints

3116
01:49:31,399 --> 01:49:34,920
totally and I would love to share that

3117
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:37,079
with the whole world you know I'm like

3118
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:38,399
that excites me totally but uh it gets

3119
01:49:37,079 --> 01:49:40,399
to a level where they want overc

3120
01:49:38,399 --> 01:49:43,000
convenience for sure next thing it's

3121
01:49:40,399 --> 01:49:45,118
just a patch you know it's like yeah

3122
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:47,198
it's like I just want the Cannabis

3123
01:49:45,118 --> 01:49:48,598
patch and you know maybe that's for you

3124
01:49:47,198 --> 01:49:50,198
that's fine but that's not yeah some

3125
01:49:48,599 --> 01:49:51,719
people they they'll get that and they'll

3126
01:49:50,198 --> 01:49:53,439
enjoy it but for me it's like there's

3127
01:49:51,719 --> 01:49:55,118
got to be the I like this smoking side

3128
01:49:53,439 --> 01:49:57,079
of it I like that whole experience the

3129
01:49:55,118 --> 01:49:58,839
ritual aspect of it absolutely you know

3130
01:49:57,079 --> 01:50:00,439
I like roll you know how it is it's like

3131
01:49:58,840 --> 01:50:01,800
I mean that's kind of how even I started

3132
01:50:00,439 --> 01:50:04,559

just kind of builds you know and so like

3143
01:50:20,599 --> 01:50:23,719
that aspect is just something that's

3144
01:50:22,319 --> 01:50:26,679
really

3145
01:50:23,719 --> 01:50:28,198

3150
01:50:35,719 --> 01:50:40,118
ritual aspect in that now I mean now I

3151
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:41,880
like to basically roll a joint I like to

3152

the rosin or the hash that keeps them U

3174
01:51:21,719 --> 01:51:25,880
or even like the old School hash that

3175
01:51:23,279 --> 01:51:29,000
like you know what I'd like to do is um

3176
01:51:25,880 --> 01:51:31,279
do like 70 to you know 120 or 70 to 160

3177
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:33,078
and just granulate it and air dry and

3178
01:51:31,279 --> 01:51:35,078
then you just put that you know grind

3179
01:51:33,078 --> 01:51:36,840
that in with that's the best I love I

3180
01:51:35,078 --> 01:51:38,319
love good bubble hash I mean I was

3181
01:51:36,840 --> 01:51:41,078
raised on good bubble hash from the

3182
01:51:38,319 --> 01:51:42,479
early 90s before we had Bubble Bags my

3183
01:51:41,078 --> 01:51:44,559
my buddy Micah showed me how to make

3184
01:51:42,479 --> 01:51:46,879
them on silk screens and we had like

3185
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:49,280
this ritual a five gallon bucket you had

3186
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:50,560
to S It One Direction had to STW it in

3187
01:51:49,279 --> 01:51:52,840
the other direction you had to let it

3188
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:55,119
settle and then with a solo cup you were

3189
01:51:52,840 --> 01:51:56,279
scooping it over you know you were

3190
01:51:55,118 --> 01:51:57,880
literally scooping it over the silk

3191
01:51:56,279 --> 01:51:59,399
screen and we let it dry on the silk

3192
01:51:57,880 --> 01:52:01,560
screen we didn't know any better know

3193
01:51:59,399 --> 01:52:03,920
any different and but the hash was

3194
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:05,560
amazing and so it was like we discovered

3195
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:06,719
gold you know at that point I mean back

3196
01:52:05,560 --> 01:52:09,800
then it was gold because I remember

3197
01:52:06,719 --> 01:52:12,679
doing the like you know whatever early

3198
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:15,920
2000 like you know with the bags yeah

3199
01:52:12,679 --> 01:52:17,920
and but then the like the 20 25 28 and

3200
01:52:15,920 --> 01:52:20,078
40 were like the cream because like

3201
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:21,480
we're doing dry trim catching like you

3202
01:52:20,078 --> 01:52:24,679
know these hay strains or golden

3203
01:52:21,479 --> 01:52:26,000
pineapple whatever and that those bars

3204
01:52:24,679 --> 01:52:29,399
were each one of those you know I'd make

3205
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:31,679
a you know 28 25 bar I'd make a 40 bar

3206
01:52:29,399 --> 01:52:33,719
make a 70 bar and really you know

3207
01:52:31,679 --> 01:52:35,880
putting it in the three hole three hole

3208
01:52:33,719 --> 01:52:38,560
Bowls the elf back then you know and

3209
01:52:35,880 --> 01:52:41,400
like so the 20 the 20-some and the

3210
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:42,679
40-some were the best of that CU you

3211
01:52:41,399 --> 01:52:44,359
know I think it's catching the smallest

3212
01:52:42,679 --> 01:52:46,719
tricomes but after they've shriveled up

3213
01:52:44,359 --> 01:52:48,399
so it's actually like probably a 70 it's

3214
01:52:46,719 --> 01:52:50,239
catching you know and totally and so

3215
01:52:48,399 --> 01:52:52,598
like but it's just different I remember

3216
01:52:50,238 --> 01:52:54,198
making these bricks and like pressing

3217
01:52:52,599 --> 01:52:55,480
like you know like silk screen on silk

3218
01:52:54,198 --> 01:52:57,279
screen paper towel underneath and just

3219
01:52:55,479 --> 01:52:59,319
pressing all the water Wild colors out

3220
01:52:57,279 --> 01:53:00,719
of them to you know when you break them

3221
01:52:59,319 --> 01:53:02,158
like after they you know some of them

3222
01:53:00,719 --> 01:53:03,760
would look like [ __ ] on the outside but

3223
01:53:02,158 --> 01:53:05,598
you break it it'd be so gold like a

3224
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:08,400
little gold bar and you're like

3225
01:53:05,599 --> 01:53:11,319
oh oh yeah yeah that 45 we get some

3226
01:53:08,399 --> 01:53:14,359
amazing tones like different Hues of of

3227
01:53:11,319 --> 01:53:16,639
red sometimes or orange some really cool

3228
01:53:14,359 --> 01:53:18,118
stuff yeah I mean those were amazing

3229
01:53:16,639 --> 01:53:19,599
days dude when I remember I remember

3230
01:53:18,118 --> 01:53:21,799
making some out in like you know I was

3231
01:53:19,599 --> 01:53:23,719
out in crestwell out in my you know I

3232
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:26,599
remember snow and I was doing this

3233
01:53:23,719 --> 01:53:28,520
golden pineapple you know wash and I

3234
01:53:26,599 --> 01:53:30,880
don't know what happened I know I wasn't

3235
01:53:28,520 --> 01:53:32,760
micro doing but like when the tricomb

3236
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:36,199
started to release heavy it looked like

3237
01:53:32,760 --> 01:53:38,360
almost like an iridescence in the foam

3238
01:53:36,198 --> 01:53:40,719
you know I was like [ __ ] something's

3239
01:53:38,359 --> 01:53:44,158
happening you know cuz it was so cold it

3240
01:53:40,719 --> 01:53:45,719
was so snowy and it was just like

3241
01:53:44,158 --> 01:53:47,399
everything was perfect you know and it

3242
01:53:45,719 --> 01:53:49,639
was just releasing and the mountain it

3243
01:53:47,399 --> 01:53:51,118
was dumping you're just like [ __ ] you

3244
01:53:49,639 --> 01:53:52,960
know this is Si you got a big old

3245
01:53:51,118 --> 01:53:54,519
Spoonful at the bottom those were the

3246
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:55,760
best you know oh my goodness there was

3247
01:53:54,520 --> 01:53:57,320
sometimes we'd wash stuff and we didn't

3248
01:53:55,760 --> 01:53:58,599
know the genetics or something we' wash

3249
01:53:57,319 --> 01:54:00,198
it and there'd be nothing and then other

3250
01:53:58,599 --> 01:54:01,840
times you'd be like well we got cuz we

3251
01:54:00,198 --> 01:54:03,519
did a lot of Frozen too so we would have

3252
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:04,920
Frozen sugar trim once we figured that

3253
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:06,199
out it was a game changer but not

3254
01:54:04,920 --> 01:54:08,399
everything watchs the same it still

3255
01:54:06,198 --> 01:54:10,078
doesn't totally right so you'd be trying

3256
01:54:08,399 --> 01:54:11,439
something for the first time excited and

3257
01:54:10,078 --> 01:54:12,719
you'd be like oh there's not even a

3258
01:54:11,439 --> 01:54:14,719
spoonful in there or it'd be kind of

3259
01:54:12,719 --> 01:54:16,158
junky you know you're like oh this isn't

3260
01:54:14,719 --> 01:54:18,279
you know and that's what I noticed like

3261
01:54:16,158 --> 01:54:20,319
some of the ones that like with the dry

3262
01:54:18,279 --> 01:54:21,840
trim method with the big tricomb you're

3263
01:54:20,319 --> 01:54:24,319
like the mount you're catching in the

3264
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:27,000
like you know in the 120 the 160 you're

3265
01:54:24,319 --> 01:54:28,719
like what dude that's look crazy lookt

3266
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:30,158
you know and then or versus you know

3267
01:54:28,719 --> 01:54:32,158
some of the stuff that say will give you

3268
01:54:30,158 --> 01:54:34,359
that'll ghost you on a a fresh frozen

3269
01:54:32,158 --> 01:54:36,118
wash you know like golden or Trinity

3270
01:54:34,359 --> 01:54:37,880
they'll straight ghost you you know but

3271
01:54:36,118 --> 01:54:40,118
then you dry it and it's like what this

3272
01:54:37,880 --> 01:54:42,440
is this is like full m you know like

3273
01:54:40,118 --> 01:54:44,238
it's like crazy some of the strains that

3274
01:54:42,439 --> 01:54:45,719
on a fresh frozen will give you a ghost

3275
01:54:44,238 --> 01:54:47,319
but then on a dry trim will give you

3276
01:54:45,719 --> 01:54:50,319
some I mean the shit'll look like fresh

3277
01:54:47,319 --> 01:54:53,118
frow it'll you know crazy you know it's

3278
01:54:50,319 --> 01:54:55,118
like yeah it's so amazing and hash is so

3279
01:54:53,118 --> 01:54:57,039
wild and and you know they're just

3280
01:54:55,118 --> 01:54:58,479
really dialing in the genetics now too

3281
01:54:57,039 --> 01:55:00,880
so it's really amazing the directions

3282
01:54:58,479 --> 01:55:03,399
they're going I love rosin but I still

3283
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:06,118
just love good bubble hash you know for

3284
01:55:03,399 --> 01:55:07,799
for me U you know dabbable bubble hash

3285
01:55:06,118 --> 01:55:09,960
is pretty great too well that's why I

3286
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:12,360
mean this 90u full melt and stuff it's

3287
01:55:09,960 --> 01:55:13,840
you know melt it's like better than

3288
01:55:12,359 --> 01:55:16,359
rosin and anything and you know like not

3289
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:18,360
to try to be a I'm not trying to say

3290
01:55:16,359 --> 01:55:21,078
this or be a hater to rosin or anything

3291
01:55:18,359 --> 01:55:23,319
but I don't know you know like pressure

3292
01:55:21,078 --> 01:55:26,319
Heat

3293
01:55:23,319 --> 01:55:28,559
parchment you know that combo with all

3294
01:55:26,319 --> 01:55:30,519
this microplastic and stuff you know

3295
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:32,000
like I I can't really um you know I

3296
01:55:30,520 --> 01:55:34,480
don't know if there's something in there

3297
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:35,960
so I do know for sure in like some 90u

3298
01:55:34,479 --> 01:55:38,759
full melt that's just caught with the

3299
01:55:35,960 --> 01:55:40,520
bag there's less chances of micr plastic

3300
01:55:38,760 --> 01:55:42,760
and stuff in there then there is some

3301
01:55:40,520 --> 01:55:44,239
pressurized squashed plastic thing you

3302
01:55:42,760 --> 01:55:45,800
know so well I'm excited about all these

3303
01:55:44,238 --> 01:55:47,439
static machines coming out now too I

3304
01:55:45,800 --> 01:55:48,599
think straight great Statics awesome

3305
01:55:47,439 --> 01:55:50,118
because we talk about you know

3306
01:55:48,599 --> 01:55:52,360
solventless and they say bubble hash

3307
01:55:50,118 --> 01:55:54,799
solvent water in my chemistry book in

3308
01:55:52,359 --> 01:55:57,000
High School it says water is the master

3309
01:55:54,800 --> 01:55:58,800
Sol it right like you know it'll go

3310
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:00,840
through granite it'll do yeah totally

3311
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:02,679
like literally in big bold letters going

3312
01:56:00,840 --> 01:56:04,719
back I was like whoa and then

3313
01:56:02,679 --> 01:56:06,760
solventless comes out I love niik and I

3314
01:56:04,719 --> 01:56:08,760
think it's great he coined a term it's

3315
01:56:06,760 --> 01:56:10,520
very unique and still accepted today and

3316
01:56:08,760 --> 01:56:12,440
that's how we change language and stuff

3317
01:56:10,520 --> 01:56:15,719
but uh true

3318
01:56:12,439 --> 01:56:16,960
solventless is static bubble hat you I

3319
01:56:15,719 --> 01:56:18,760
mean not bubble has but the second we

3320
01:56:16,960 --> 01:56:20,319
put it through water any sort of sift

3321
01:56:18,760 --> 01:56:21,679
and I loved sift back in the day I loved

3322
01:56:20,319 --> 01:56:23,319
Keef well remember when Cuban grower

3323
01:56:21,679 --> 01:56:25,078
came on dude

3324
01:56:23,319 --> 01:56:27,920
he was like with a microscope pulling

3325
01:56:25,078 --> 01:56:30,279
particles out you know like yeah you

3326
01:56:27,920 --> 01:56:31,520
know and it's funny cuz like the cameras

3327
01:56:30,279 --> 01:56:33,519
that we had back then weren't like the

3328
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:35,480
cameras we have now and it's like there

3329
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:37,520
was still incredible photos on Instagram

3330

scientific level that even you know only

3343
01:57:03,599 --> 01:57:07,159
people that are really doing that level

guys are just so skilled uh the quality

3350
01:57:19,599 --> 01:57:23,440
of photos they're photography they're

3351
01:57:21,599 --> 01:57:24,520
artists artists because there's and

3352
01:57:23,439 --> 01:57:25,759
there's so much to it a lot of people

3353
01:57:24,520 --> 01:57:26,960
just see the picture and they get

3354
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:28,560
excited about this picture they don't

3355
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:29,639
know what it's just like with genetics

3356
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:30,920
and other things they don't know really

3357
01:57:29,639 --> 01:57:32,039
what went into it they see the end

3358
01:57:30,920 --> 01:57:33,440
result and they're like oh that's

3359
01:57:32,039 --> 01:57:35,479
amazing but they don't understand look

3360
01:57:33,439 --> 01:57:37,799
how much Clarity there is on that flower

3361
01:57:35,479 --> 01:57:39,799
harvesting that plant and preparing that

3362
01:57:37,800 --> 01:57:42,679
plant and getting it at the right moment

3363
01:57:39,800 --> 01:57:44,279
and then stacking those photos properly

3364
01:57:42,679 --> 01:57:46,480
and having the light perfect and all

3365
01:57:44,279 --> 01:57:48,000
these things that have to happen for you

3366
01:57:46,479 --> 01:57:49,919
to get that photo you know it's it's

3367
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:51,279
pretty exciting and I get excited

3368
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:53,440
because I mean I've seen the process and

3369
01:57:51,279 --> 01:57:54,880
I understand it a little bit more and

3370
01:57:53,439 --> 01:57:56,559
once you start understanding it's like

3371
01:57:54,880 --> 01:57:58,078
wow it's really especially if you have a

3372
01:57:56,560 --> 01:57:59,480
photographer that's like trying to learn

3373
01:57:58,078 --> 01:58:01,479
how to do it and you're like well it

3374
01:57:59,479 --> 01:58:03,638
doesn't look like that and it's because

3375
01:58:01,479 --> 01:58:05,158
of this this this and this totally and

3376
01:58:03,639 --> 01:58:06,880
even the cultivation like if you use

3377
01:58:05,158 --> 01:58:09,638
stuff where you have burnt tips on your

3378
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:11,639
leaves if you're using stuff salts that

3379
01:58:09,639 --> 01:58:13,400
burn burn your tips your leaves a little

3380
01:58:11,639 --> 01:58:14,440
bit it's not going to look as good you

3381
01:58:13,399 --> 01:58:16,158
know the photo is not going to look

3382
01:58:14,439 --> 01:58:18,359
nearly as good well even if the flowers

3383
01:58:16,158 --> 01:58:20,359
pushed hard it's you can tell you know

3384
01:58:18,359 --> 01:58:22,319
especially people that can tell when you

3385
01:58:20,359 --> 01:58:25,519
can tell you can tell yeah swollen where

3386
01:58:22,319 --> 01:58:27,479
they're like over swollen you know it's

3387
01:58:25,520 --> 01:58:29,719
like you know it's like someone doing

3388
01:58:27,479 --> 01:58:32,359
steroids or someone like being like you

3389
01:58:29,719 --> 01:58:34,560
know hey organic you know fed Grass

3390
01:58:32,359 --> 01:58:36,279
Grass you know Fred beef dude and it has

3391
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:37,800
a glow to it right like they both have a

3392
01:58:36,279 --> 01:58:39,599
glow to it in different ways you yeah

3393
01:58:37,800 --> 01:58:41,400
for sure without a doubt that you know

3394
01:58:39,599 --> 01:58:43,560
and that's I think that's the cool thing

3395
01:58:41,399 --> 01:58:46,638
is you know whatever floats your boat

3396
01:58:43,560 --> 01:58:48,520
with this one and and this plant has

3397
01:58:46,639 --> 01:58:50,400
countless expressions and and there's

3398
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:52,520
something for everybody and humans have

3399
01:58:50,399 --> 01:58:56,198
countless expressions and so like I

3400
01:58:52,520 --> 01:58:57,480
think that combination is is is a is a

3401
01:58:56,198 --> 01:58:59,158
beautiful thing you know whatever you

3402
01:58:57,479 --> 01:59:01,158
want to do just grow more weed and you

3403
01:58:59,158 --> 01:59:02,839
know plant more seeds and like do more

3404
01:59:01,158 --> 01:59:04,638
you know that's if you love it double

3405
01:59:02,840 --> 01:59:06,679
down on it it's one of those things and

3406
01:59:04,639 --> 01:59:08,000
you know I think not doing it for money

3407
01:59:06,679 --> 01:59:09,599
doing it because you love it and you're

3408
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:12,599
devoted to it and it's one of those

3409
01:59:09,599 --> 01:59:14,039
things that you feel aligned with well

3410
01:59:12,599 --> 01:59:15,679
that was back in the day I would never

3411
01:59:14,039 --> 01:59:17,679
consult anyone or give them information

3412
01:59:15,679 --> 01:59:19,239
if they're doing it for money yeah they

3413
01:59:17,679 --> 01:59:22,599
had to love the plant they had to love

3414
01:59:19,238 --> 01:59:24,559
the you know because you know the money

3415
01:59:22,599 --> 01:59:26,599
can be a side product yeah you know if

3416
01:59:24,560 --> 01:59:28,880
you're devoted and you're giving it your

3417
01:59:26,599 --> 01:59:30,719
all for sure what whatever field you're

3418
01:59:28,880 --> 01:59:34,199
in doesn't have to be weed but money is

3419
01:59:30,719 --> 01:59:36,760
g to come yeah but that that devotion

3420
01:59:34,198 --> 01:59:37,960
and that heart and that care that's rare

3421
01:59:36,760 --> 01:59:39,800
totally and that's what I love about

3422
01:59:37,960 --> 01:59:41,880
capulator the Mac 1 say what you want

3423
01:59:39,800 --> 01:59:43,840
about Mac one as a genetic or you like

3424
01:59:41,880 --> 01:59:46,199
the smoke don't like the smoke but the

3425
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:49,639
way he gave out the cuts that that's

3426
01:59:46,198 --> 01:59:51,439
pretty special and you know it it's not

3427
01:59:49,639 --> 01:59:52,920
seen across the board typically these

3428
01:59:51,439 --> 01:59:54,559
days where or or if it is people don't

3429
01:59:52,920 --> 01:59:55,840
talk about it Mac one was something that

3430
01:59:54,560 --> 01:59:57,320
was never supposed to be sold it was

3431
01:59:55,840 --> 02:00:00,199
supposed to be given and shared with

3432
01:59:57,319 --> 02:00:01,679
good people and you know I I love that

3433
02:00:00,198 --> 02:00:03,078
about the plant and I feel like that's

3434
02:00:01,679 --> 02:00:04,880
just one of those good examples that we

3435
02:00:03,078 --> 02:00:07,719
can all learn from for sure I mean that

3436
02:00:04,880 --> 02:00:10,960
kind of intention and that kind of like

3437
02:00:07,719 --> 02:00:12,279
um you know stewardship right really

3438
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:14,760
that means something you know and that's

3439
02:00:12,279 --> 02:00:16,800
something special and those kind of um

3440
02:00:14,760 --> 02:00:20,159
Vibes should be you know something that

3441
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:22,320
we're like you know seeing and emulating

3442
02:00:20,158 --> 02:00:24,559
in whatever way we can you know we had a

3443
02:00:22,319 --> 02:00:27,000
we got to give our heart um however

3444
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:28,800
we're doing it and you know that's a

3445
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:30,840
good that's a good that's a good example

3446
02:00:28,800 --> 02:00:33,520
of that for sure y that was a special

3447
02:00:30,840 --> 02:00:36,599
plan at that time and what it was you

3448
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:38,079
know the look The turp the structure

3449
02:00:36,599 --> 02:00:40,119
what it was doing and what it did for

3450
02:00:38,078 --> 02:00:42,000
it's an anomaly too within that cross

3451
02:00:40,118 --> 02:00:43,399
like for for you to get those TPS and

3452
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,800
then some of the other crosses that I've

3453
02:00:43,399 --> 02:00:45,519
seen within the progyny some of the

3454
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:49,199
other

3455
02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:52,800
plants uh yeah we had a the max 69 which

3456
02:00:49,198 --> 02:00:54,479
was very hazy very Colombian

3457
02:00:52,800 --> 02:00:58,400
uh and then you got this Mac one that's

3458
02:00:54,479 --> 02:01:00,359
very soft and it looks amazing too like

3459
02:00:58,399 --> 02:01:02,399
I've seen it in some amazing grows

3460
02:01:00,359 --> 02:01:04,238
outdoors in Greenhouse where it's like

3461
02:01:02,399 --> 02:01:06,359
you look across from 50 feet away and

3462
02:01:04,238 --> 02:01:08,439
you're like what is that it has that one

3463
02:01:06,359 --> 02:01:10,158
glowing over there that pink glow it

3464
02:01:08,439 --> 02:01:12,279
like has this pink glow and it's super

3465
02:01:10,158 --> 02:01:13,719
Frosty and it's like they're not tall

3466
02:01:12,279 --> 02:01:16,399
plants they're like these amazing

3467
02:01:13,719 --> 02:01:17,639
delicate you know extremely special yeah

3468
02:01:16,399 --> 02:01:20,118
it reminds me of a plant that was going

3469
02:01:17,639 --> 02:01:21,319
around Eugene we called it the dawn um

3470
02:01:20,118 --> 02:01:23,598
it was or you know they called it the

3471
02:01:21,319 --> 02:01:25,599
Kid Next Door or neighbor kid whatever

3472
02:01:23,599 --> 02:01:28,279
but it was uh you know train wreck by

3473
02:01:25,599 --> 02:01:30,760
purple afy and it was similar you know

3474
02:01:28,279 --> 02:01:33,039
like see it across the room pink blah

3475
02:01:30,760 --> 02:01:35,039
you know like whatever and it's like you

3476
02:01:33,039 --> 02:01:37,399
know those ones are cool really would

3477
02:01:35,039 --> 02:01:39,399
that kind of give that glow no matter

3478
02:01:37,399 --> 02:01:42,519
how big the field is or how big the room

3479
02:01:39,399 --> 02:01:45,679

going to pop them right I want to see I

3488
02:02:00,238 --> 02:02:03,039
don't care about this aftermarket thing

3489
02:02:01,639 --> 02:02:05,960
I want to see how good these seeds are

3490
02:02:03,039 --> 02:02:08,639
because I didn't really know Leo as a

3491
02:02:05,960 --> 02:02:10,960
friend at the time we're friends now and

3492
02:02:08,639 --> 02:02:13,000
and maybe it was earlier than that but

3493
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:14,520
when I popped them we had popped 800

3494
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:16,840
seeds or something like that and we were

3495
02:02:14,520 --> 02:02:18,159
popping them my buddy's backyard and

3496
02:02:16,840 --> 02:02:20,000
there was this little patch that you

3497
02:02:18,158 --> 02:02:22,279
could see from 30 feet away and

3498
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:23,760
everybody would be like what are those

3499
02:02:22,279 --> 02:02:25,039
and it it wasn't just the way they

3500
02:02:23,760 --> 02:02:27,000
looked because you know there's a lot of

3501
02:02:25,039 --> 02:02:28,359
stuff Oreos and some of the stuff that

3502
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:30,158
looks really good it has a really

3503
02:02:28,359 --> 02:02:32,279
amazing look that would attract you to

3504
02:02:30,158 --> 02:02:35,039
it this stuff it was like the look the

3505
02:02:32,279 --> 02:02:37,078
smell the structure everything about

3506
02:02:35,039 --> 02:02:38,960
every one of the plants was amazing like

3507
02:02:37,078 --> 02:02:39,920
you could see it and all these different

3508
02:02:38,960 --> 02:02:41,000
Expressions because there's so many

3509
02:02:39,920 --> 02:02:43,199
different seeds out there but it was

3510
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:46,198
like this little patch and that's a

3511
02:02:43,198 --> 02:02:48,118
super special one Leo's got some uh some

3512
02:02:46,198 --> 02:02:50,279
of those still around he's supposed to

3513
02:02:48,118 --> 02:02:51,639
drop some off I'm waiting for the sick

3514
02:02:50,279 --> 02:02:53,319
but yeah good and that changed my mind

3515
02:02:51,639 --> 02:02:54,960
about about like the value of seeds and

3516
02:02:53,319 --> 02:02:57,479
I know he was selling his 200 bucks a

3517
02:02:54,960 --> 02:02:59,679
pack even back then and the value of

3518
02:02:57,479 --> 02:03:01,638
seeds and and it's all subjective to the

3519
02:02:59,679 --> 02:03:03,760
individual you know he sold them for 200

3520
02:03:01,639 --> 02:03:05,760
but it's like these SB Dunks that go for

3521
02:03:03,760 --> 02:03:07,079
$5,000 these pairs of Nikes you know

3522
02:03:05,760 --> 02:03:09,400
it's like Nike doesn't sell for that

3523
02:03:07,078 --> 02:03:11,479
much but the secondary Market it is what

3524
02:03:09,399 --> 02:03:13,479
it is and the sell value of a seed is so

3525
02:03:11,479 --> 02:03:14,759
subjective to the individual totally

3526
02:03:13,479 --> 02:03:17,638
what they can do with it I mean I've

3527
02:03:14,760 --> 02:03:20,039
always have like high respect for ficado

3528
02:03:17,639 --> 02:03:22,239
and Leo and like packaging what he did

3529
02:03:20,039 --> 02:03:24,920
branding Wise It's like it's beautiful

3530
02:03:22,238 --> 02:03:27,158
you know you can't if you if you argue

3531
02:03:24,920 --> 02:03:29,399
with it you're just a hater you know

3532
02:03:27,158 --> 02:03:31,279
shit's pimp you know yeah and he's given

3533
02:03:29,399 --> 02:03:32,799
me his drops over the last couple years

3534
02:03:31,279 --> 02:03:35,158
when he has new drops he's given me

3535
02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:36,880
packs and like I think his Z had the

3536
02:03:35,158 --> 02:03:38,679
actual gold plant tags in him and I'm

3537
02:03:36,880 --> 02:03:40,239
like dude that is just he's always an

3538
02:03:38,679 --> 02:03:43,559
outside the box thinker he wants it to

3539
02:03:40,238 --> 02:03:45,638
be elegant and I I love the the wax

3540
02:03:43,559 --> 02:03:47,199
stamps on the stuff and just the way he

3541
02:03:45,639 --> 02:03:49,920
takes it to a different level and makes

3542
02:03:47,198 --> 02:03:51,479
it his own for sure it's I mean it's

3543
02:03:49,920 --> 02:03:52,960
it's beautiful and he was the first like

3544
02:03:51,479 --> 02:03:55,519
that period And there's been a lot of

3545
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:57,800
knockoffs since then but like you know

3546
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:59,440
like even I waxed my you know quirks for

3547
02:03:57,800 --> 02:04:00,679
a while because you know I was like oh

3548
02:03:59,439 --> 02:04:02,638
that's sick what he's doing I don't know

3549
02:04:00,679 --> 02:04:04,880
wax the [ __ ] cork you know C and it

3550
02:04:02,639 --> 02:04:06,599
has this craft feel to it I love that

3551
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:08,520
it's really I mean it's Louis Vuitton

3552
02:04:06,599 --> 02:04:10,279
and craft combo kind of it's like really

3553
02:04:08,520 --> 02:04:14,040
what it reminds me of is that like

3554
02:04:10,279 --> 02:04:15,679
crossover of yeah you know fine fine and

3555
02:04:14,039 --> 02:04:17,519
you know it's like it's like when you

3556
02:04:15,679 --> 02:04:19,359
take the finest foods and you you know

3557
02:04:17,520 --> 02:04:20,960
have a dinner in Humble or something for

3558
02:04:19,359 --> 02:04:22,719
sure it' be one thing if his genetics

3559
02:04:20,960 --> 02:04:25,039
didn't back it but his genetics are good

3560
02:04:22,719 --> 02:04:26,599
like he is a great breeder he's a great

3561
02:04:25,039 --> 02:04:28,840
person first of all but he's a great

3562
02:04:26,599 --> 02:04:30,880
breeder and his seeds that he put in

3563
02:04:28,840 --> 02:04:32,360
those expensive packages where he did

3564
02:04:30,880 --> 02:04:33,480
spend some money and there was a lot of

3565
02:04:32,359 --> 02:04:35,359
thought that went into it but they're

3566
02:04:33,479 --> 02:04:36,558
all good genetics i' I've always been

3567
02:04:35,359 --> 02:04:38,558
super happy with everything that I

3568
02:04:36,559 --> 02:04:40,320
popped of his well I mean that 78 ay is

3569
02:04:38,559 --> 02:04:42,760
in a lot of the work you know I put the

3570
02:04:40,319 --> 02:04:45,840
78 ay to the saour OG made the tens in

3571
02:04:42,760 --> 02:04:48,119
and like you know I mean I I've done a

3572
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:49,760
lot of work with that and it I'm not

3573
02:04:48,118 --> 02:04:52,039
kidding like every single feno that

3574
02:04:49,760 --> 02:04:53,960
popped out of that 78 ay by the sour OG

3575
02:04:52,039 --> 02:04:55,800
was epic you know and I I kept the the

3576
02:04:53,960 --> 02:04:58,118
two and the four the T cush two and four

3577
02:04:55,800 --> 02:05:00,119
but it's only because there just wasn't

3578
02:04:58,118 --> 02:05:01,639
that many of them and that's what was

3579
02:05:00,118 --> 02:05:03,078
left and they were winners you know the

3580
02:05:01,639 --> 02:05:05,159
three was a winner too but these two

3581
02:05:03,078 --> 02:05:07,238
were better so I was just like ah you

3582
02:05:05,158 --> 02:05:08,839
know just and like ended up doing quite

3583
02:05:07,238 --> 02:05:11,118
a bit of work with it just because for

3584
02:05:08,840 --> 02:05:14,199
that fact it was it was good you know

3585
02:05:11,118 --> 02:05:16,198
nice yeah so if you had one piece of

3586
02:05:14,198 --> 02:05:18,598
advice for your younger

3587
02:05:16,198 --> 02:05:22,198
self what would that one piece ofice be

3588
02:05:18,599 --> 02:05:23,719
go bigger no go bigger go harder yeah

3589
02:05:22,198 --> 02:05:26,879
I'm just kidding I think sometimes going

3590
02:05:23,719 --> 02:05:30,279
bigger um you know not going big keeps

3591
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:33,679
you out of trouble yeah um to really

3592
02:05:30,279 --> 02:05:37,118
just focus more on helping instead of

3593
02:05:33,679 --> 02:05:39,158
focusing on myself yeah and really you

3594
02:05:37,118 --> 02:05:40,839
know I I went with that pretty hard but

3595
02:05:39,158 --> 02:05:42,000
if I would have did it more more

3596
02:05:40,840 --> 02:05:46,360
pure-minded

3597
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:49,279
more um wholesomely you know I did it

3598
02:05:46,359 --> 02:05:51,238
the best I could but I could have did it

3599
02:05:49,279 --> 02:05:53,439
better you know would have would have

3600
02:05:51,238 --> 02:05:55,479
created more more happiness I think even

3601
02:05:53,439 --> 02:05:57,799
I'm quite a happy guy now but you know I

3602
02:05:55,479 --> 02:05:59,359
go through my phases but I think if I

3603
02:05:57,800 --> 02:06:01,760
did things more with an altruistic

3604
02:05:59,359 --> 02:06:03,399
intention from the beginning yeah it

3605
02:06:01,760 --> 02:06:05,639
would have just created better results

3606
02:06:03,399 --> 02:06:07,359
in the end you know and and the results

3607
02:06:05,639 --> 02:06:09,039
are good but you know you know how we

3608
02:06:07,359 --> 02:06:11,479
are when our when we're in our early 20s

3609
02:06:09,039 --> 02:06:14,920
you know and late teens early 20s we do

3610
02:06:11,479 --> 02:06:16,238
a lot of arrogant stupid [ __ ] you know

3611
02:06:14,920 --> 02:06:18,039
yeah we think the world's a lot

3612
02:06:16,238 --> 02:06:20,598
different than it really is totally and

3613
02:06:18,039 --> 02:06:23,078
I think we gain experience and knowledge

3614
02:06:20,599 --> 02:06:25,719
over time and you know it's

3615
02:06:23,078 --> 02:06:27,960
like for me the beauty of this podcast I

3616
02:06:25,719 --> 02:06:29,480
saw Joe Rogan doing his podcast and I

3617
02:06:27,960 --> 02:06:31,520
felt like watching him over the years he

3618
02:06:29,479 --> 02:06:33,399
got smarter right and I'm like dude this

3619
02:06:31,520 --> 02:06:35,280
guy's he's more int he talks more

3620
02:06:33,399 --> 02:06:36,519
intelligently for one thing but he gets

3621
02:06:35,279 --> 02:06:37,519
all these perspectives from all these

3622
02:06:36,520 --> 02:06:40,239
different

3623
02:06:37,520 --> 02:06:42,840
people high level people and I feel like

3624
02:06:40,238 --> 02:06:45,638
I get high level cannabis people and

3625
02:06:42,840 --> 02:06:47,078
people that have experience in I get a

3626
02:06:45,639 --> 02:06:49,159
piece of each one of those people when I

3627
02:06:47,078 --> 02:06:51,759

3662
02:08:02,840 --> 02:08:05,800
more people growing weed in their closet

3663
02:08:04,118 --> 02:08:07,598

in their living room you know whatever

3666
02:08:09,078 --> 02:08:12,759
it takes like the old days you know

3667
02:08:10,599 --> 02:08:13,880
that's sleeping next to their plants you

3668
02:08:12,760 --> 02:08:16,239
know I used to do that now I have

3669
02:08:13,880 --> 02:08:18,159
allergies I don't know you know dude I

3670
02:08:16,238 --> 02:08:20,439
used to cure and I remember you know

3671
02:08:18,158 --> 02:08:23,279
like i' I'd cure and dry everything in

3672
02:08:20,439 --> 02:08:25,359
my bedroom yep and just you know that

3673
02:08:23,279 --> 02:08:27,238
and as as you know in those first few

3674
02:08:25,359 --> 02:08:28,799
days the man the turps are powerful you

3675
02:08:27,238 --> 02:08:31,198
know oh yeah you're just like whoa am I

3676
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:33,239
not even sleep yeah my my buddy Joe I'm

3677
02:08:31,198 --> 02:08:35,719
sure if I went to his house during

3678
02:08:33,238 --> 02:08:37,519
trimming he still has black uh clone

3679
02:08:35,719 --> 02:08:39,279
trays where he trims in and he falls

3680
02:08:37,520 --> 02:08:40,880
asleep next to him even still I mean I

3681
02:08:39,279 --> 02:08:43,719
we used to do that all the time but he's

3682
02:08:40,880 --> 02:08:46,000
still living and he's up in Oregon yeah

3683
02:08:43,719 --> 02:08:48,359
sick it's popular up there for sure it's

3684
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:51,078
like we're we're committed committed to

3685
02:08:48,359 --> 02:08:53,359
this PL and yeah I mean the prices these

3686
02:08:51,078 --> 02:08:55,319
days you have have to be I mean you know

3687
02:08:53,359 --> 02:08:57,839
so it's it's not all about money anymore

3688
02:08:55,319 --> 02:08:59,759
and I think we're becoming Farmers now

3689
02:08:57,840 --> 02:09:01,199
and I think that Rockstar lifestyle I

3690
02:08:59,760 --> 02:09:03,039
mean there's still some people whatever

3691
02:09:01,198 --> 02:09:04,719
but like it's not about that Rockstar

3692
02:09:03,039 --> 02:09:07,000
life you know it's it's it's about

3693
02:09:04,719 --> 02:09:09,359
something more for sure I mean we live

3694
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:10,800
that one too but uh yeah now it's a lot

3695
02:09:09,359 --> 02:09:12,639
different and you know if you're still

3696
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:14,559
getting good good money for your herb

3697
02:09:12,639 --> 02:09:16,480
that's good you know and um you deserve

3698
02:09:14,559 --> 02:09:18,880
it if you are because it's not an easy

3699
02:09:16,479 --> 02:09:20,359
feat these days but uh you know really

3700
02:09:18,880 --> 02:09:22,719
it's for the heart of it I think these

3701
02:09:20,359 --> 02:09:24,279
days and Shar the information and really

3702
02:09:22,719 --> 02:09:26,480
actually the stewardship of being able

3703
02:09:24,279 --> 02:09:28,319
to teach people how to do it their own

3704
02:09:26,479 --> 02:09:29,759
you know people give them the genetics

3705
02:09:28,319 --> 02:09:31,880
and the tools to be able to do it good

3706
02:09:29,760 --> 02:09:34,360
on their own and and the variety and the

3707
02:09:31,880 --> 02:09:36,639
potentials to be able for them to have a

3708
02:09:34,359 --> 02:09:38,198
multitude of different aspects yeah of

3709
02:09:36,639 --> 02:09:42,078
this plant you know once people

3710
02:09:38,198 --> 02:09:44,638
understand you know how many you know

3711
02:09:42,078 --> 02:09:46,719
different ranges there is it's it's it's

3712
02:09:44,639 --> 02:09:48,880
Limitless so don't get stuck in one

3713
02:09:46,719 --> 02:09:50,599
little lane you know really like get

3714
02:09:48,880 --> 02:09:52,159
