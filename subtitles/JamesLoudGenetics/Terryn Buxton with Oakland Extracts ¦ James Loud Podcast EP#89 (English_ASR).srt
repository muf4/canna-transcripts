00:00:56,679 --> 00:01:00,399
weeks ago like it's it seems like a few

16
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:03,599
weeks but it was a little over a month

17
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:06,560
ago over at The Harborside reunion party

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,799
great event uh you know a lot of great

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,359
people coming together for a great cause

20
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,360
and uh yeah it's like a high school

21
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:13,959
reunion it was great yeah it's wild you

22
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:16,239
know and seeing some people that I had

23
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:17,959
no idea that were even going to be there

24
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:20,199
um you know because I'm as an outsider I

25
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:22,519
was a vendor you know knowing Steve and

26
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,680
Andrew pretty well uh doing some filming

27
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:25,879
with them especially over the last

28
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,159
couple years they're great guys and then

29
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:29,399
everybody that works at Harbor Side it

30
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:30,960
was like very family oriented company

31
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,840
yeah it was a beautiful space to be in

32
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:35,639
um I was lucky to be there uh early when

33
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,640
they opened I worked there from 09 to

34
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,759
2012 and so I got to know a lot of the

35
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,920
original staff that first open the store

36
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,599
and just when the staff was a little bit

37
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,759
smaller as it was starting to grow those

38
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:46,239
were the best years too in my opinion

39
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,280
those were the best years of Harbor Side

40
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,158
going there as a consumer going there as

41
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,040
a vendor someone who went there to buy

42
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,320
clones they had the best clones like

43
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,280
literally they set the standard for

44
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:59,000
clones the same standard that we have

45
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,159
today was set at Harbor Side back then

46
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,640
and the world had never seen anything

47
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:04,240
quite like it yes there was you know

48
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,478
there was clone vending going on before

49
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,758
Harbor Side there's clone vending going

50
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:11,159
on now but right you know when they when

51
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:13,399
they brought out we had Dan Grace who

52
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:15,878
really rocked him out uh from darkheart

53
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,480
Nursery man just really killing it on a

54
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:19,719
whole another level and you know scaling

55
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,159
and as they

56
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:24,400
scaled uh they maintained quality and

57
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:27,039
very even clones you know I haven't seen

58
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,280
very many companies that have competed

59
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:31,000
with those kind of clones even today

60
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,439
yeah I don't I mean I'm not in as in

61
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,280
touch with the Clone Market as I used to

62
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:36,598
be but I had never seen a clone company

63
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,318
grow to that scale that size that well

64
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:40,199
branded and still people come came back

65
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:41,639
loving the cuts even years into them

66
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:43,199
being popular a lot of Brands will kind

67
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:44,839
of get big and the quality kind of

68
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,199
starts to waiver as they scale up and

69
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,680
they always maintain that quality so

70
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:49,039
that was awesome I feel like at the end

71
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,040
they had problems they had hop plate and

72
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,919
verid was a big problem and so that

73
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:55,679
really I think affected them more than

74
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:57,399
anybody that I've ever seen uh but yeah

75
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,360
and as you scale it gets difficult and

76
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,239
the scale that they went to was pretty

77
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,040
phenomenal

78
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:06,158
and Po and then just gr and then

79
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:07,919
providing good genetics and I feel like

80
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:09,798
they were very they had good Integrity

81
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:11,399
with the the genetics the names of the

82
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:13,080
genetics everything was tested they they

83
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,680
weren't just throwing stuff out there no

84
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,159
we really liked working with them when I

85
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,560
was there there's a lot of the there's a

86
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:19,318
lot of small clone companies are kind of

87
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,719
popping up out of nowhere and then you

88
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:22,039
really couldn't trust where the genetics

89
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:23,799
were they say it was one thing but it

90
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:25,120
was often something else and dark heart

91
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:26,560
you really felt like yeah you could you

92
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,200
could really trust what they were doing

93
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,878
and just that era I mean I remember

94
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:31,438
before there really was a clone

95
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:33,359
department at Harborside and then once

96
00:03:31,438 --> 00:03:35,318
there was and once it got rocking I mean

97
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,840
there'd be a line when it was the season

98
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:38,280
the line there's a line outside the door

99
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,039
two hours before we opened that was down

100
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,438
the block and that line existed until we

101
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:42,959
were closed and there's still a line out

102
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:44,158
the door well after we were closed

103
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,479
people coming and getting those clones

104
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:48,199
and they were selling them by the truck

105
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:50,560
full yeah just you know it was funny

106
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:52,919
because you would go uh it you would go

107
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,719
online and I believe it was Twitter back

108
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:57,119
in the day um you know when Twitter

109
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:58,959
first became a thing you would go and

110
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,719
get the menu and hopefully you could get

111
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,199
what you wanted to get there it was like

112
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,479
published the day you know the day of or

113
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:06,560
the day before and you go there and get

114
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,318
in line and hopefully it was there maybe

115
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,840
it was maybe it wasn't but there was

116
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:13,318
always a diverse menu too of all kinds

117
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:16,160
of good stuff you know and it really

118
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:18,238
impressive you know looking back uh

119
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,759
looking in hindsight you know the stuff

120
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,000
that these dispensaries went to to get

121
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,800
to the points the places they're at now

122
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
yeah well it was beautiful working there

123
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,400
because before there most of the

124
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,160
dispensaries they're a lot smaller a lot

125
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:31,079
darker um security was kind of big

126
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,479
scalling guys up front and just the

127
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:34,038
entire experience it kind of felt like

128
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:35,478
going to a used record store if you

129
00:04:34,038 --> 00:04:36,959
didn't really know the cool thing you

130
00:04:35,478 --> 00:04:38,879
kind of got a certain kind of vibe from

131
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:40,239
people where was Harborside all the

132
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,399
security they refer the security as

133
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,038
safety it was wide open it was beautiful

134
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:45,359
it was well lit and it was very

135
00:04:44,038 --> 00:04:46,680
welcoming and inviting for people who

136
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,199
weren't necessarily from the Cannabis

137
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,000
community and they really made a point

138
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:52,120
as someone who worked there that you had

139
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,399
to be smiling all day if one if one of

140
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,759
the managers walked through and then saw

141
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:55,439
you not smiling they jumped on you

142
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:56,960
because they didn't want you just

143
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:58,639
sitting there looking stoned they wanted

144
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,079
you to look aware and engag so when

145
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,519
someone came up to you talking about

146
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:02,918
cancer or talking about some kind of

147
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:04,599
issue they had you weren't just some

148
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:06,079
Stone kid in the back they really wanted

149
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,240
to make it clear that this was about

150
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:08,959
medical and about servicing the

151
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,840
community yeah it was cool and they they

152
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:13,519
had a lot of money to yeah harbor side

153
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:15,439
was very successful so they had massages

154
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:17,159
and they had programs and they had you

155
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:18,719
know classes and all kinds of stuff they

156
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,919
spent a lot of money on that even when

157
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,360
they weren't making money that was

158
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:22,719
always a priority of them to make sure

159
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,439
that there's free health services

160
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,919
available to the community and that was

161
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:27,038
something that no matter what what was

162
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:28,038
going on with them financially they

163
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:29,959
always maintained through all the

164
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:31,800
lawsuits with the feds through the tax

165
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:33,318
bills that came in they always made sure

166
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,478
and all those people were paid by harbor

167
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:36,280
side these people weren't just giving it

168
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:37,839
away for free so it was really beautiful

169
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:39,239
thing that they committed to yeah they

170
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:41,799
had a big Target on their backs being

171
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,840
the biggest and being the first to do

172
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,000
what they did and then to scale people

173
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:47,719
wanted to make an example of them it

174
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,199
they were always in court it was always

175
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,639
someone trying to come after them it was

176
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,600
it was wild yeah our monthly staff

177
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,240
meetings were just Court updates usually

178
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,160
what's going on with this case this feds

179
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,079
might come in different trainings for

180
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,400
the cops coming in the feds coming in

181
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,240
how that might look different and it was

182
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:05,478
it was a lot yeah so how did you get

183
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,400
your start in cannabis um as a consumer

184
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:08,918
you know love the plant grew up loving

185
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:10,799
the plant uh all through high school and

186
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:12,478
in college I was always a big big fan of

187
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,918
the plant it was a big part of my life

188
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:17,038
and um I kind of inadvertently started

189
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:18,318
growing a friend of mine was started had

190
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:19,439
had a little grow at his house and I

191
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,360
would just kind of help him out he had

192
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:22,959
helped me out on a project previously so

193
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,160
I kind of owed him a little bit of Labor

194
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:25,918
and then so I started help helped him

195
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,319
build out his grow helped take care of

196
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:28,839
his plants and didn't realize I had a

197
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:30,639
green thumb before them and like really

198
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:32,038
got into taking care of the plants and

199
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,598
all this time I was working in different

200
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:35,560
nonprofit organizations so I had a kind

201
00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:37,159
of a square day job and then doing this

202
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,199
in the evening I really really got into

203
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,039
it and I got so into it I wind up having

204
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,919
my own grow at my house and then I

205
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:44,759
stopped working in nonprofits and I was

206
00:06:42,918 --> 00:06:47,159
just growing and I I lived right near

207
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:48,960
Harborside nice and I would um I would

208
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,400
go by there like every other day right

209
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:51,799
before closing just to kind of come in

210
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:52,719
get a gr but really just to hang out and

211
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,919
shoot the [ __ ] because when you're

212
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,800
growing it's a very insell activity like

213
00:06:54,918 --> 00:06:58,038
I'm by myself in a basement all hours of

214
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,720
the night and so it was just kind of

215
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:00,839
nice to go there to hang out and they

216
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,639
just started joking like you come here

217
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:05,638
so often you should just work here and

218
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,240
um and I honestly I got more good advice

219
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:08,639
about growing from the people that work

220
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,360
there than even the original people that

221
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,000
kind of put me on to growing and so it

222
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,319
just a great knowledge resource and I

223
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,759
had the time and so I just started

224
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:16,639
working there kind of for fun when so

225
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:19,080
many good Growers going in there it was

226
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,319
and and vendors too like the quality of

227
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:23,878
the flower there was really amazing

228
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:25,240
flower uh diverse you know there was

229
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:27,319
something for everybody too it wasn't

230
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,800
like there was only top shelf there was

231
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:30,160
top shelf and there was the bottom and

232
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,079
there was stuff that was was affordable

233
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,919
that was good um you know and good

234
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:36,560
healthy clean medicine I think that was

235
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:38,120
always the agenda was to have good

236
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,160
healthy clean medicine yeah that was the

237
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,720
focus Rick the original buyer there was

238
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,400
like really really strong on that before

239
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,639
we had any kind of um lab testing they

240
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:47,000
were very clear about what kind of

241
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:49,038
growing practices they wanted to see The

242
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,038
Growers have and as a vendor before I

243
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:52,158
started working there people would be in

244
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:53,800
that vending room they were getting

245
00:07:52,158 --> 00:07:55,199
their hearts broken because everyone

246
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,319
thinks they just have the most beautiful

247
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,680
plants and they go back there oh and

248
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:00,280
they would get uh they would get long

249
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,079
explanations of what can do better next

250
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:04,119
time and you see people coming out just

251
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:05,519
Crest falling but it just increased the

252
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,000
amount of effort and energy put in

253
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:09,079
towards their plants and making it

254
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,120
better it just improved the quality for

255
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:14,279
everybody so what was your favorite

256
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,560
flour from back in the day I know mine I

257
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:18,719
mean there's so many we we had a cut of

258
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,918
super silver haze that Steve insisted

259
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,240
was not super silver haze because it

260
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:22,598
smelled nothing like Haze he was like

261
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,478
stop calling it super silver haze he got

262
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:26,199
really mad he came in one day he smelled

263
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:27,719
it and he's he went off and he's like

264
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:30,120
just call it super silver it's too

265
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,240
cheesy and we're like the We're Young we

266
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,158
don't know what you're talking about

267
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,158
this is just the best sativa ever so I

268
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:37,240
used to love that we had it was that 97

269
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:40,038
cut I believe it was that 97 cut that

270
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:42,479
was extra funky it wasn't as terpinolene

271
00:08:40,038 --> 00:08:44,000
dominant or terpinolene dominant yeah I

272
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,440
used to love that one I love the old

273
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,639
school ciny star yeah C it was so good

274
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,320
back and I miss real indas that tasted

275
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,360
amazing I don't care what they tested at

276
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:56,440
but like like Romulan yeah Romulan

277
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:59,079
Romulan Romulan um and pure Afghani umgh

278
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,440
everything before the pers took over

279
00:08:59,078 --> 00:09:02,399
there was it felt like there's a lot of

280
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,440
more variety with around the indas and

281
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,839
it was really interesting you could

282
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,320
really feel them then when purple

283
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:08,040
started to dominate that everyone kind

284
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,720
of went that direction Purple Kush that

285
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:11,199
was out for a while I like the old one

286
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,480
when it was ugly little nugs that were

287
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,000
just dense and they actually did

288
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,159
something to you as opposed to whatever

289
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,480
came out later that I think was just

290
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:18,078
another version of Grape Ape they just

291
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,600
look good but didn't really do much I

292
00:09:18,078 --> 00:09:21,278
like purples used to actually have an

293
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,560
impact and then they started TR of focus

294
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:24,799
on were some strong ones for sure but

295
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:26,439
then then there was like the Blackberry

296
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:27,958
Kush right and that was like the weakest

297
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,040
of the week it was like CBD we didn't

298
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:31,559
even test it back in the day but I'm

299
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:34,399
pretty sure it would be super high in

300
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:36,359
CBD and super low in THC yeah yeah but I

301
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,600
missed a variety I I missed that variety

302
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,919
oh yeah and all the different long

303
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,720
flowering varieties uh you know it's

304
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:43,240
like there was some really special stuff

305
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,639
power plant I didn't like back in the

306
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:48,320
day but I like now I was always a big

307
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:50,360
fan of red Congo still am but I I like

308
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,079
red Congo more than than I do now and

309
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,079
then I like red Congo more than the

310
00:09:52,078 --> 00:09:56,399
Durban and more than the Mala although I

311
00:09:54,078 --> 00:09:58,719
like all three of those a lot the red

312
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,639
Congo makes me like laugh and smile and

313
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,600
the Durban just takes me out same thing

314
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:04,480
with the Malo is one of those ones in

315
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,120
small doses it's great but like you can

316
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,240
overdo it with that one for sure you

317
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,320
really got be climbing the walls oh yeah

318
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,639
yeah good stuff yeah my favorite my

319
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,240
favorite thing at Harbor Side back in

320
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:16,039
the day was the sage and sour I believe

321
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,440
it was from Santa Cruz yeah yeah that

322
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:18,639
was special I had my friends were

323
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,880
growing that for a long time so I got

324
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:20,838
really close with that plant that was

325
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:22,278
one of the original plants that we

326
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:24,760
started extracting when we started oen

327
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:26,240
extracts um that that was phenomenal the

328
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:29,519
San hard this that whole crew they're

329
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,200
all indoor organic soil soil grown was

330
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,600
that was that in my opinion that was the

331
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,600
best thing that came out of Harbor Side

332
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,720
the chem 91 was really good too the you

333
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:40,000
there was a bunch of amazing amazing

334
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,519
things that came out of that uh era but

335
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,639
that sage and sour was something special

336
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,278
because it was like if you like sour it

337
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:46,519
was great if you likeed Haze it was

338
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:49,078
great it would it would just check so

339
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:50,919
many boxes it was gassy it was it was

340
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:52,399
really nose burning pungent and the

341
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:54,759
structure was amazing it had a lot of

342
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,480
structure to it I miss the same crew

343
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:57,759
that that worked with the sage they

344
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,600
didn't create the sage but they had the

345
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:01,838
sage for a long time at Harborside they

346
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,879
did a Kyle kushman strawberry cough and

347
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,600
there was a couple runs of that that was

348
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:06,919
the best smoke I've ever had in my life

349
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,879
where it was like a psychedelic

350
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:10,599
experience it was so amazing but what's

351
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:13,278
interesting about growing is like they

352
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:15,440
had the cut the cut didn't change but it

353
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:16,799
was really just they it was great for

354
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,120
like a year and a half and then it kind

355
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:19,559
of whatever happened it kind of

356
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,679
deteriorated or their ability to get the

357
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:23,679
most out of it changed and it just was

358
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:25,599
just never the same yeah I like

359
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:28,039
strawberry cuff I feel like blue dream

360
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,759
is great it's like you know like blue

361
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:31,759
dream is very functional but Strawberry

362
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:33,879
Cough is a stronger Blue Dream It's like

363
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:36,360
it turn it's like blue dream turned up

364
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:38,360
yeah I was a big fan a big fan yeah yeah

365
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,720
good stuff I mean yeah I love talking

366
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,399
about genetics from the back you and

367
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,680
there's stuff that I haven't heard of in

368
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:44,480
a long time and somebody brings it up

369
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:46,359
and I'm like wow I remember that that

370
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,200
was amazing I just miss basic stuff like

371
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,360
UK cheese yeah like I don't understand

372
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,519
why that's still not around that was

373
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,320
loud you cross it into to know the right

374
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,959
people Nick has some okay so nickes got

375
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,399
some but uh it's not common to see

376
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:00,919
cheese right like cheese or even like

377
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:03,039
strong cheese derivatives I you know

378
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:05,199
there are some of these chemi things

379
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:06,078
they're like so I smell in extracts too

380
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,278
like when you're smelling raos and

381
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:08,439
you're like that smells cheesy and

382
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:10,399
people like I don't know that smells

383
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,360
like the cheese The Strain you know I

384
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,480
mean real UK or Exodus cheese that's

385
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,120
phenomenal yeah I just missed the

386
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,159
variety like I it like I I I mean gelato

387
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,679
is cool yeah you know all that all

388
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:22,799
what's happening now is cool but I just

389
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:24,479
miss a variety that we used to have and

390
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:26,120
there was just so many different and

391
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,240
there so many different types of St

392
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,639
strains coming from so many different

393
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,120
mom and pop grows yeah and the the best

394
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:32,879
I've ever smoked in my life were coming

395
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,360
from people that had like two four six

396
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:37,240
eight lights I mean literally all the

397
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,039
craft all the craft grown stuff that it

398
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,399
would come out different every time or

399
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:43,039
somebody had mastered its variety right

400
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:45,440
they had taken one cultivar and that's

401
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:47,000
all they grew for years and they' really

402
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,079
dialed it in I know some old hippies

403
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,240
that still do that you know it's like

404
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:52,679
that that's in my opinion is the best

405
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,399
like where you've mastered that because

406
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:57,679
the thing is is like everything requires

407
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:59,559
uh different inputs to a degree or or

408
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:01,000
different variables you know whether

409
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:02,518
it's harvesting on a certain date and

410
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,958
playing around with that or whether you

411
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:06,320
need to push it harder in the beginning

412
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:08,278
or at the end you know I think there's

413
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,199
there's so much to cultivation and

414
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:12,639
learning the cultivar yeah U and then

415
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:14,159
there's something special Bubba Kush was

416
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,639
good back in the day yeah Bubba was

417
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:19,759
amazing the Master Kush the Bubba Kush

418
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,560
the Hindu Kush yeah I I was not a fan of

419
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:23,278
that cuz my friends grew way too much of

420
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:24,879
it but like when I first got my hands on

421
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:26,240
it it was amazing and and like they

422
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:28,198
crossed it into so many different things

423
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,240
that really really really great great

424
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:32,559
plant I really um like I said I miss the

425
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,799
variety that we used to have um I like

426
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:36,799
the access that people have now I like I

427
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:38,078
like going I do demos at stores seeing

428
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:39,679
all these people coming just buying

429
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:41,599
gummies who like five years ago wouldn't

430
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:44,078
have even gone near a cannabis shop so I

431
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,920
love like how open it is but I do I do

432
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:48,078
miss the old the old guard I do miss the

433
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:49,479
old Farmers I do miss the old quality

434
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:51,919
and then I miss people just appreciating

435
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,759
flour like extracts are cool I I like it

436
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:55,838
dab but I'd rather have a joint any day

437
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:58,519
of the week I love flower I miss an

438
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,680
appreciation of sungrown it's like it's

439
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:01,399
like people so much so much

440
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,120
mass-produced like stuff they don't

441
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:04,839
understand that the best stuff on Earth

442
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,240
comes off of some Mountain somewhere

443
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:07,519
that someone picked you know and they've

444
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,959
probably never experienced it that's the

445
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,399
thing is like there's so much people

446
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,879
think oh well I know weed I smoke weed

447
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,639
all the time I go to the dispensary I go

448
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:15,159
to this guy and he's you know I go to my

449
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:16,919
plug and he's got the weed like I've

450
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:19,838
tried they think they've tried a lot of

451
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:21,759
it but they don't think sunr is great or

452
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,600
better or Superior and it's a different

453
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:25,680
product right like especially the effect

454
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,240
like we've gone away from talking about

455
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:29,359
effect which I feel like we need to go

456
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,039
back in that direction to like okay so

457
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,759
how does it make you feel yeah exactly

458
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:34,078
yeah and there's a handful of us that

459
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:35,600
are really kind of trying to push that

460
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:38,278
agenda and I think it's it's going to

461
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,079
catch on because at the end of the day

462
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:41,958
that's why we're all attracted to this

463
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:43,359
plan it's not because the way it looks

464
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:45,119
the way it tastes is may be cool but

465
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,320
it's really the effect it's the feeling

466
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,879
like I I miss being able to smoke

467
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,720
something and go to sleep like I miss

468
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:51,039
when indas actually put you to sleep cuz

469
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,560
that's really how I got GDP that gives

470
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:53,799
you the munchies yeah I mean that's how

471
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,078
I really got into can because I had

472
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:56,399
trouble sleeping when I was a kid like

473
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:58,359
all throughout my childhood I couldn't

474
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,440
sleep at all and the first time I not

475
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,278
the first time but but when I really

476
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,480
started being able to get regular sleep

477
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:04,120
was when in high school I discovered

478
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,879
cannabis and so over the first few years

479
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,000
I had cannabis a lot of times I wouldn't

480
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:08,399
smoke throughout the day but I always

481
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,480
made sure I had a bedtime Bowl because I

482
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,440
knew I would actually be able to go to

483
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,000
sleep that night and then actually work

484
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,360
in medical cannabis and realize there's

485
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,039
all these different types of cannabis

486
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,039
for all these different things and you

487
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:19,480
experiment with all that and you kind of

488
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:21,159
kind of fall in love with that and then

489
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,959
you see now wreck has taken over and

490
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:24,399
we've walked away from it being

491
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,919
experiential base we're being about

492
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,839
health and medicine and things like that

493
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:30,479
now it's just like pretty colors high

494
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,759
THC scores we really lost a lot I mean

495
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,759
Instagram weed will only get you so far

496
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:37,879
yeah you know but I think Instagram and

497
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,480
social media has they've changed the way

498
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:42,919
we look at at cannabis in general you

499
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,959
know but I think there's no no time like

500
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:46,919
the present to change you know I think

501
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:48,479
like podcasts you have your own podcast

502
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:50,559
too yes sir absolutely you know I think

503
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,480
podcasts are a great way to influence

504
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:55,198
people to change telling your story

505
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,759
telling the the world about the effects

506
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:59,359
of cannabis and how you know it's not

507
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:01,000
just about getting high um and I think

508
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,560
people can relate to that too cuz you

509
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,318
know it's like people have taken that

510
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:06,638
edible dose that's like 500 milligrams

511
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:07,958
and it's like some people never want to

512
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,318
take Edibles again because they've taken

513
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,559
too big of a dose yeah we used to scare

514
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:12,519
a lot of people off now that's actually

515
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:14,159
the one Improvement about what's going

516
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:15,519
on in the market is back in the day so

517
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:17,120
many of the Edibles were really really

518
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,560
strong that when someone came in we

519
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,198
would just absent mindly give them 100

520
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:21,479
milligram cookie not realizing that 5

521
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:23,359
milligrams would have been perfect for

522
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,759
them and now it's the opposite like it's

523
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,278
hard to find something that has a lot of

524
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:28,079
milligrams in it and that's safer for so

525
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:29,399
many people and so many more people do

526
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:31,120
have like a gentle experience with

527
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:33,559
Edibles which is really nice to see I

528
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,078
think it's good I think cuz that's a

529
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,359
great way to turn someone off from the

530
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:37,479
very beginning from their first

531
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,440
experience they're like oh I'm going to

532
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:41,120
go get 100 milligram edible and then

533
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,240
it's like okay well I never want to do

534
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,839
that again because I don't want to feel

535
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,240
like that but the thing is is like if

536
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,000
You' eaten 5 milligrams or 10 milligrams

537
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,480
or maybe even 20 you would have had a

538
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,799
much different experience yeah it's

539
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,240
interesting because it's it's it's so

540
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:54,120
important that people have a great

541
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,360
proper introduction to cannabis because

542
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,560
again having um having edible that's too

543
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,519
strong is going to really turn you off

544
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,359
and kind of turn you away from

545
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,879
everything

546
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,440
in the same way a really good topical

547
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:04,640
can be great to get people involved in

548
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,959
it I love giving topicals to older folks

549
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,520
realizing that they can deal with pain

550
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:09,880
relief without going to the medicine

551
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:12,038
cabinet having something safer more more

552
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,720
holistic and that opens them cannabis in

553
00:17:12,038 --> 00:17:15,640
general you can start with the topical

554
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,640
move over to a small gumy and kind of

555
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,319
just get them deeply they got bath bombs

556
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,679
they they got all kinds of stuff it's so

557
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:22,918
wild and we live in this world of

558
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:24,480
convenience it's like uh before we had

559
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:26,120
to really worked to do it you know like

560
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,079
roll a joint now there's pre-rolls or

561
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:30,359
hand rolls you know before dabbing it

562
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:32,199
was like there there was a lot of

563
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:35,399
different ways we smoked like Adam

564
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,960
Smashers smoking on coal and you know so

565
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,600
hot knives I still miss the hot knife

566
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,919
the hot knife was great there was like

567
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:42,678
these weird little eras where like I

568
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:43,919
remember hot knives in high school I

569
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:45,120
went to high school in the 90s so I

570
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,280
remember had a friend that lived in

571
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:48,558
Spain and so he would he would go out he

572
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:49,798
visit his dad every year and they would

573
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:51,200
come back with hash and they would put a

574
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:53,160
little bit of hash in the hot knife and

575
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,558
it completely blew my mind oh yeah and

576
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,519
then seeing them they started making

577
00:17:55,558 --> 00:17:59,879
like glass hot knives like like little

578
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:01,519
glass like spoons they had like a little

579
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,200
divot in it with the knob on the other

580
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:04,798
end so you could really get it in there

581
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,640
and I remember a friend of mine he had a

582
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:09,000
um like a glass little thing that you

583
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,400
inhale through that had a a big hole in

584
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,400
the middle that you could put ice in it

585
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,200
and you put a cork in it so it cooled

586
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,120
the middle of this this little Flume

587
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,519
that you kind of hit this like the [ __ ]

588
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:20,359
and that's all G so creative yeah and I

589
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:22,240
think you can attribute some of that to

590
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:23,798
the plant right like the the creative

591
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,640
side of it you're like okay well how can

592
00:18:23,798 --> 00:18:28,359
I make this experience better you know

593
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,120
so I got some guys that are for my

594
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:32,639
friends Asher introduced me to catch a

595
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:34,479
fire and those guys are from New Zealand

596
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,400
and in New Zealand they have their own

597
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,240
version of hot knives it's a torch that

598
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,120
has the knives on the end of it it heats

599
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,319
the knife up and you push the button you

600
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,959
you put the butt in there and you

601
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:44,319
squeeze it and you hit it out of a tube

602
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,000
oh that's awesome I got to try that oh

603
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:47,759
yeah it's it's wild and like I would

604
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,400
never have normally done it but I was

605
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:51,599
backstage uh at a show and Marlin's like

606
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,000
oh yeah we got to smoke with these guys

607
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:54,480
and they were like dude you have to hit

608
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,880
this and I normally would have been like

609
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,120
I don't know but I was like okay I'll do

610
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,720
it yeah it got totally ripped yeah you

611
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:01,199
got to try it where however people

612
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,919
present it where they're from like this

613
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,279
is what we do at home you you want to

614
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:05,520
try that you want to get a taste of it

615
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:06,720
yeah it's a different experience you

616
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,519
know there's so many different ways you

617
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,319
can smoke I mean you got your puff Co I

618
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:13,879
got my focus V yeah uh ways of

619
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:15,558
convenience and it's just so easy right

620
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,360
so and then we have all these flavors

621
00:19:15,558 --> 00:19:20,119
too I mean I got a variety of stuff I

622
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:21,240
got some uh long flowering varieties I

623
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:24,279
got some really short flowering

624
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:26,279
varieties I got the Skittles candy candy

625
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:28,000
it's really got candy yeah you know more

626
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:31,279
than anything especially with extracts

627
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,599
is candy candy candy flour too M but uh

628
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:34,639
you know and then but we're missing out

629
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:36,918
on some of these amazing long flowering

630
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,520
varieties when it comes to flour I

631
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:41,240
prefer a sativa I prefer things that

632
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:43,679
they grow like that but when it does

633
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,558
come and and in in flour I'm not a big

634
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,600
candy fan but when it comes to dabbing I

635
00:19:45,558 --> 00:19:49,240
like the candy stuff all day and I don't

636
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:50,678
like it when they press anything else is

637
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,720
really interesting I mean I'll sit there

638
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:54,120
watching TV and I'll just smell too I

639

652
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,280
impression that sativas don't press very

653
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:26,918
well and that's why we don't see a lot

654
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:28,759
of sativa in the Rosen Market but to

655
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:30,440
know that Sil super silver does like

656
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:32,079
could just have that as my sativ and

657
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,360
just be happy right there it'll do it

658
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:34,558
for you and the thing is is it's one of

659
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:36,519
those ones where you don't need a big

660
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:40,000
dab of it right like it's super strong I

661
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:42,119
feel like uh palpitations yeah whatever

662
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,798
like if you do too much like for me I I

663
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:46,359
enjoy it it's a good daytime thing it's

664
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:48,519
like uh or or morning I go to the gym

665
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:49,959
you know and it's like now rosin carts

666
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:52,759
it's like these are great for rosin

667
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,400
carts and I get in trouble I I work out

668
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:56,599
a lot and I definitely smoke before I go

669
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,080
in the gym but I I can't use the cart

670
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:59,879
cuz I'll like keep hitting it the whole

671
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:01,240
time I'm like in the car or at least if

672
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,159
it's a joint it's a beginning middle and

673
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:05,519
end so I don't over consume because if I

674
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:08,400
hit a cart for 45 minutes then go in the

675
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:10,158
cardio is not so good yeah for sure so I

676
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,559
just do the two hits right like I'll do

677
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,159
one or two hits the two hits is the most

678
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:15,720
in moderation it helps me focus it helps

679
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,799
me get through cardio if I have to go do

680
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:20,519
cardio if it's a cardio day I I do enjoy

681
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:22,359
smoking a pen and it's like depending on

682
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:24,240
the day and the mood some things I don't

683
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:26,278
I cannot smoke and go to the gym and

684
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,759
I'll be like no I got to get out of here

685
00:21:26,278 --> 00:21:29,440
but other things it's like Skittles too

686
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:32,200
Skittles is one of those ones that the

687
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,440
the extract of Skittles is super mild

688
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,558
compared to other ones but it leaves

689
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,558
that taste in your mouth too so when

690
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:37,240
you're working out you're like yeah I've

691
00:21:35,558 --> 00:21:38,480
smoking Skittles yeah I've really uh

692
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,480
this year I've been stuck on the white

693
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,278
Thorn Rose yeah yeah over we talk about

694
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,400
it on almost every episode of the

695
00:21:43,278 --> 00:21:47,000
podcast I'm disgusted with myself how

696
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,159
much I like it and because I'll still

697
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,359
like I go out I buy a lot I buy from a

698
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:52,039
lot of different brands just kind of see

699
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:53,558
what's current see what people are doing

700
00:21:52,038 --> 00:21:55,200
and the amount of times I'm just go back

701
00:21:53,558 --> 00:21:56,599
to the white Thorn this is my favorite

702
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,798
thing of all these things that I bought

703
00:21:56,599 --> 00:22:01,319
I'm almost embarrassed well you

704
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:03,720
shouldn't be because I'm that same way

705
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:05,319
and I feel like it's good old Feelgood

706
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,038
weed and we need to get back to more of

707
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:09,038
that stuff that the effect is so

708
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:10,558
important like with white Thorn Rose it

709
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:12,319
just makes you feel good like you smoke

710
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:15,119
it you can do anything you conquer the

711
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:18,399
world uh blue dream does that to a

712
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:20,798
degree but it's different yeah uh and my

713
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,080
buddy Dave mesford passed away on 420

714
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:24,798
his Blue 13 has the exact same effect as

715
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:26,558
white Thorn Weare okay you can smoke in

716
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:28,240
the morning you feel great you smoke in

717
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:29,798
the afternoon you feel great you smoke

718
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,400
it in in the evening you feel great

719
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:33,038
doesn't matter when you smoke it what

720
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,320
you're doing you just feel really good

721
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:37,038
and I feel like those people that

722
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:38,319
haven't experienced that with cannabis

723
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:39,480
that are like I don't know I don't think

724
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:41,639
cannabis is for me they should probably

725
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,360
try way throwing row yeah and it's just

726
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:46,200
it's it's one of those profound effects

727
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:48,319
where it's like it just makes you feel

728
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,880
whole or complete you know like that's

729
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:51,639
that's what I love about it I love

730
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,200
giving people their first dab or even

731
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,640
their second dab because I do a dab bar

732
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,840
as like cuz I'd rather do a dab bar than

733
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,120
a demo I don't want just sit in the

734
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:58,240
corner of a club I'd rather go to

735
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:59,719
there's a lounge where people can try

736
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,679
things that can sample things that's

737
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,519
where we met was your dab exactly and

738
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,400
just being able to offer something that

739
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:07,519
tastes delicious and then also I'm very

740
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,759
keen on low temp small dabs in the

741
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:10,639
beginning so you can kind of just get

742
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:12,079
the flavor of it and not overwhelm them

743
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,759
and so many people their first dab was

744
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:16,558
red hot and just burning screaming kind

745
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:17,759
of experience that I like 900 de yeah

746
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:19,399
give them something gentle something

747
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:20,798
that tastes amazing and just kind of

748
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,278
seeing their eyes light up and like I

749
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:23,599
had no idea it could be this good I had

750
00:23:22,278 --> 00:23:25,440
no idea this experience could be like

751
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:28,759
that what's the perfect temp for you for

752
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,798
low temp o um it's going to depend on

753
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:33,879
the consistency of the concentrate 100%

754
00:23:31,798 --> 00:23:35,319
um I always go for it as low as possible

755
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,480
but certain things like I mean I don't

756
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:37,879
like to dab diamonds but if you're

757
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:42,599
dabbing diamonds they want more heat

758
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:45,039
than like a nice rosin yeah um usually I

759
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:47,079
mean I guess I could open up the app on

760
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:49,798
my puff Co I can tell you exactly I

761
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:52,278
think for um my normal puff Co my my low

762
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:55,278
temp on the puff Co is around 450

763
00:23:52,278 --> 00:23:57,599
sometimes 475 um Roger from puffco he

764
00:23:55,278 --> 00:24:00,440
says he does 530 so I started doing and

765
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:02,158
he has access to everything so I started

766
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,320
so I started cranking mine up just to

767
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,640
like well I guess it's okay and it's

768
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:07,599
just a little hotter than I like but

769
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,520
definitely you feel it so much more when

770
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:12,079
it is a little bit hotter but I like the

771
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:13,319
high fours low fives yeah this because I

772
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:14,439
want to taste it CU my thing is like I'm

773
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:15,918
going to keep hitting it like I don't

774
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,679
need to just get wasted I don't need to

775
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,320
get loaded immediately i' rather just

776
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,000
dab I'm I mean I'm going to dab for a

777
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:22,319
long period of time anyway so I'd rather

778
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,400
just kind of savor the flavor of it

779
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:26,000
mine's a 420 I like that four that load

780
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,038
it's easy to remember too it's like okay

781
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,679
what's your temp it's 420 so and low low

782
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:32,278
temp I think so some people go even

783
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:35,440
lower than that but I feel like that 420

784
00:24:32,278 --> 00:24:36,960
is about where you get a lot of flavor

785
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,320
it also depends on the device too cuz

786
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,759
each one calls a little bit differently

787
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:44,558
definitely on my on my focus V I have it

788
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:46,278
dialed lower because it's hotter for

789
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:48,798
real for I don't know which one's more

790
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:50,558
accurate than the other but I know on my

791
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:51,879
um on my focus I should have brought it

792
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:54,440
because I have it on the counter sitting

793
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:56,919
right next to my puffco it'sif it might

794
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:59,798
be 375 or like low fours you got to try

795
00:24:56,919 --> 00:25:01,320
this this is the this is the Rover you

796
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:03,278
can you can change the temp of that as

797
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:04,639
well excellent excellent and uh yeah and

798
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:06,240
it's convenient you can watch the smoke

799
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,720
I I love the convenience of it and I

800
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,720
love the price point they're $80 oh it's

801
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,480
perfect you know and I'm not getting

802
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,960
paid to advertise this at all I love

803
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:16,079
these guys uh yeah they they do a great

804
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,960

stuff and trying out new stuff and they

809
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:27,278

seeing all the merch you have when I

843
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,319

844
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:28,759
much of an exciting space that we're in

845
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:31,678
right now yeah we're we're about launch

846
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:33,278
loud times it's our brand uh our our

847
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,038
clothing Lifestyle brand that we're

848
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:36,798
about to do and you know it's Oakland

849
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:38,960
rooted in Oakland just like everything

850
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:40,440
else we're doing I feel like yeah this

851
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,960
this community is great you know and

852
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,880
it's like uh very supportive of other

853
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,079
small

854
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,360
businesses uh that are still around

855
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:49,480
because it's tough these days you know

856
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:50,519
it's very tough very tough so yeah and

857
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,880
then the Lifestyle brand it's like

858
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:53,679
cookies does really well with theirs

859
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,720
backpack boys is doing well with theirs

860
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,080
you know we're we're a little bit

861
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,240
different than those guys we have our

862
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:59,079
own style and well makes sense you just

863
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,000
I mean I think the key with

864
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:03,199
merchandising is like you speak to your

865
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,038
community yeah I mean cookies is cookies

866
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,360
I mean that's that's that's who burner

867
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:08,119
is there's four-year-olds wearing

868
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:09,798
cookies t-shirts and then with with bre

869
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:11,599
backpack boys like if you know them like

870
00:27:09,798 --> 00:27:13,398
they are very much in tune with their

871
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:14,918
community and is in tune with them and

872
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:16,879
it's very organic and all that and I

873
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:17,919
feel like your brand has that can do

874
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,200
that as well because you're you're

875
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,759
speaking to a certain group of folks

876
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,960
that are out there that like want cool

877
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:24,720
stuff so yeah and everybody wants cool

878
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,519
stuff to a degree you just have to find

879
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,798
you you got to get in where you fit in

880
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:30,558
you know at the end of the day and it's

881
00:27:27,798 --> 00:27:32,798
like and authenticity just goes so far

882
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:34,759
with this industry you know it's like

883
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:37,679
you can spot it a mile away there's a

884
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:39,440
lot of there's a lot of uh people that

885
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,679
have come in from other Industries and

886
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,038
they weren't cannabis guys but they're

887
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:44,278
like I'm going to make money in cannabis

888
00:27:42,038 --> 00:27:45,440
and and you might be successful but most

889
00:27:44,278 --> 00:27:46,640
of the time you're not no they're never

890
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,159
they never really are now I mean they

891
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,278
think they're going to be and it's funny

892
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:53,600
because I've been in legal cannabis

893
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:54,960
since 06 yeah I think and then I was on

894
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:56,158
the oak Canabis Regulatory Commission

895
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,720
for a while like I was doing like a lot

896
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,519
of stuff and then I wound up I guess

897
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,240
Consulting with various people that were

898
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:03,798
coming into this coming into Oakland

899
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,440
trying to start businesses right and it

900
00:28:03,798 --> 00:28:07,158
was always these investment bankers and

901
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,360
they were just like yeah we're gonna

902
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:11,000
have a brownie and I'm like no you're

903
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:12,639
not like you're not they they think they

904
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
can come in and revent the wheel like

905
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,240
you guys just didn't know how to do it

906
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,440
right and it's like no you don't you

907
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,720
don't want to learn the lessons of all

908
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,440
these businesses that have tried and

909
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,159
failed around us from people who've

910
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,519
actually been here in this community not

911
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:24,559
like Oakland but in the Cannabis

912
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:25,960
community and understand like what's

913
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:27,200
going on with these products and they're

914
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,840
just like no we know better and we're

915
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,600
going to come in with our money

916
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:31,839
spreads and we're going to show you we

917
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:34,199
got someone from Nestle and they know

918
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:37,240
how to make the amount of times we have

919
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:39,919
this choler from so and so and I'm like

920
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:41,079
bro Christy at ke is going to kill you

921
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,840
like you're not going to survive like

922
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:44,720
you can have all these people you want

923
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:46,240
but we have products that already exist

924
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,600
that have been doing really well for a

925
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,558
good reason and you're not just going to

926
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:51,839
come and replicate that or do yeah

927
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:53,798
improve on that it's like yeah it's in

928
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:56,759
that that that space is so different

929
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:58,119
than cultivation in in the regard that

930
00:28:56,759 --> 00:28:59,839
the companies that are doing really well

931
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:01,119
well it's not easy to just go in and

932
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:02,678
like I got a good product and it's going

933
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:05,239
to sell it's like there's so much more

934
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:06,720
to it and just cuz you think you have a

935
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,319
good product doesn't mean that it's

936
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,839
necessarily going to fit into what the

937
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:11,879
world wants yeah I love just seeing the

938

00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:12,000
we're going to do some edibles and then

972
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:13,480
he learned how to make some hash with

973
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,159
some of our friends and next thing you

974
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,399
know we have a hash company instead and

975
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:18,399
every time we have a meeting it's like

976
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:19,879
when are we doing Edibles like we we

977
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:21,398
love edibles and there's just a lot of

978
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,640
other corners of the industry that are a

979
00:30:21,398 --> 00:30:23,839
lot of fun but everything is so

980
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,519
treacherous now it's like you got to

981
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:27,199
have a firm footing in what you do

982
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:28,759
before you start expanding too fast

983
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,120
especially in edible but you know Ros

984
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:31,679
and gummies are a great way to go

985
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:33,079
especially with the extract company I

986
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,640
feel like that's the most authentic way

987
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:37,398
to do it is extract it yourself put some

988
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,440
white Thorn Rose in a gummy those are

989
00:30:37,398 --> 00:30:41,359
those are my favorite that I've had so

990
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,679
far in my whole life the white Thorn

991
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:44,119
Rose gummy yeah I don't know who did it

992
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:46,640
but I've had a couple this year and they

993
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:49,719
were amazing they were beautiful yeah I

994
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,799
believe uh rosin did some and but

995
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,480
there's a couple other companies that

996
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:55,599
have done them as well I've have always

997
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,038
had trouble with sugar-based Edibles

998
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:59,038
yeah I mean I come from cannabis's

999
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:00,519
medicine mhm it's like I'm not going to

1000
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:01,960
give someone who has cancer and tell

1001
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:04,558
them eat sugar every day to fight your

1002
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:06,319
cancer kind of thing it's like even if

1003
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:08,000
like when when I was at Harbor when

1004
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:09,319
there wasn't proliferation of gummies

1005
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,638
there were just a lot of cookies a lot

1006
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:12,319
of brownies and just everything in the

1007
00:31:10,638 --> 00:31:14,359
sweet category and there were a few

1008
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:16,558
savories back then and I really feel

1009
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:18,719
like creating Edibles that are actually

1010
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:20,000
healthy are are a good wave and there's

1011
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,120
enough candy out there there's enough

1012
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,558
cookies out there I guess know

1013
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:24,000
everyone's gone except for Peete but I

1014
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:25,678
mean there's enough of the sweet things

1015
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,359
that are out there on the market that is

1016
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,480
time to kind of like diversify that up

1017
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:29,439
so I'd like to do something kind of

1018
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,599
other than the gummy something that

1019
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,278
isn't sugar based the ures were good but

1020
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:36,719
it's not edible right but but tinctures

1021
00:31:34,278 --> 00:31:39,599
were good Amber Alchemy she's uh we had

1022
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:42,079
her on the show uh Rachel yeah she's

1023
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:43,319
amazing and I love for for medicine I

1024
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:45,398
think tinctures are probably the best

1025
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:47,398
but there are food options that you can

1026
00:31:45,398 --> 00:31:50,079
do yeah absolutely I I'm a big fan of

1027
00:31:47,398 --> 00:31:52,119
Jade nectar yeah they really strong um

1028
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:54,000
sativa tinctures that are just just

1029
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:56,079
amazing it's eye opening I consume a lot

1030
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,960
of Uncle Ares I'd probably consume more

1031
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:59,480
Uncle Ares than my own product I just

1032
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,759
love beverages I love the beverage space

1033
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,759
that's another space I kind of wanted to

1034
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:05,440
get into but I see how difficult that is

1035
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:06,960
and I'm staying far away so much it's

1036
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,240
just a lot of money to get involved in

1037
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,960
Bev but it's like I feel like for sure

1038
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,599
like that is the space to be in in the

1039
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:15,399
future in cannabis I think like when you

1040
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:17,519
go into a 7-Eleven when you go into a

1041
00:32:15,398 --> 00:32:19,319
grocery store we devote so much more

1042
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,399
space to beverage than any other type of

1043
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:22,678
snack food out there that clearly

1044
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:23,839
Americans know how to drink their

1045
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:25,399
calories they like drinking their

1046
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:27,079
calories and so I think the beverage

1047
00:32:25,398 --> 00:32:29,158
space is just going to keep expanding

1048
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:30,759
for sure and then got Coca-Cola and big

1049
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:32,080
companies eyeing it too they're like

1050
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:34,038
okay well there's money there how are we

1051
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:35,439
going to approach this yeah yeah I mean

1052
00:32:34,038 --> 00:32:38,119
we already have the alcohol people we

1053
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,840
got Lonas paps say eyes I'm which I'm

1054
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:41,359
not a big fan of I'm I'm okay with

1055
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:42,839
lagunas because it's like that small

1056
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:44,439
time that like there's our local Stoners

1057
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:46,439
kind of they are a big company now but

1058
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:48,639
they weren't they're on by hinek now but

1059
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:50,120
they were Tony McGee J I used to work

1060
00:32:48,638 --> 00:32:51,959
with Okay so they're real people right

1061
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:54,839
whereas when I see like paps are really

1062
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:57,038
Sane eyeses I'm like you contributed to

1063
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:59,720
so much negativity in our culture with

1064
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:00,720
Malt Liquor not paps more St eyeses that

1065

now that you're going to come you're

1066
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,079

1071
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,000
message to we have our own story to tell

1072
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:14,398
and you had your time you told a story

1073
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,638
and you had an impact on the community

1074
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:17,079
and now it's over there and now this is

1075
00:33:15,638 --> 00:33:18,319
something else that we're doing but this

1076
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:19,918
America everyone's free to do what they

1077
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:21,240
want but I'm never that excited to see

1078
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,440
them in our space yeah good luck you

1079
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,599

1080
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,000

organically cuz he wanted to be in

1086
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,200

yeah yeah TOA colola I don't know if you

1088
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,840
remember the toaa back in so I think

1089
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:44,199
before 2005 TOA colola was a big thing

1090
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:46,199
okay uh there was a couple beverages

1091
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:48,639
they the beverages the companies all got

1092
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:52,159
taken down by the feds guys did years in

1093
00:33:48,638 --> 00:33:55,199
prison damn uh yeah Beyond bomb best

1094
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:57,159
edible company to exist ever one of my

1095
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,440
good friends he did five years for

1096
00:33:57,159 --> 00:34:02,399
edibles doing it legally in California

1097
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:04,519
but we had a beverage at Harbor Side I

1098
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:06,479
forgot I don't know I think it was THC

1099
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:08,039
designs was the name of the guys company

1100
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,800
he had these little cheesecakes where

1101
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:11,039
they medicated the graham cracker crust

1102
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,359
in the bottom that were strong and

1103
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:15,878
delicious and then he had a mango lossi

1104
00:34:13,358 --> 00:34:17,559
a chai and iced coffee and then I think

1105
00:34:15,878 --> 00:34:19,199
one other bever eggnog around the

1106
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:20,878
holidays and each of those little those

1107
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,439
little like little milk carton bottles I

1108
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:24,559
think they're about about 80 milligrams

1109
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:26,320
a piece and then at work we just take

1110
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:28,320
pour two or three of them in the blender

1111
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,359
with one of the brownies and just

1112
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,800
sounds amazing oh good times good times

1113
00:34:30,358 --> 00:34:34,918
I bet I bet yeah and I love edibles I

1114
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,560
and I I love edibles in that sense I

1115
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:40,078
don't eat Edibles as much especially you

1116
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:42,239
so Edibles affect me so they're so

1117
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,960
strong for me I smoke I can smoke joints

1118
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:45,199
I can smoke big three gram joints and

1119
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:47,320
sit there for an hour and puff on a

1120
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:49,759
joint no problem but then I go for like

1121
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:51,200
a 20 Mill 20 milligrams two gummies you

1122
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,800
know because California is 10 milligrams

1123
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:55,480
per gummy is the maximum dose although

1124
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,839
they are selling 100 milligram packages

1125
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:59,199
it's supposed to be 10 doses but yeah 20

1126
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:01,559
milligrams will get me now but back in

1127
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:03,039
the day we never measured anything so we

1128
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:04,880
would eat cookies and brownies and it

1129
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:06,960
was like okay how strong can we make it

1130
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,358
yeah I remember I used to make cupcakes

1131
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,480
that's how a lot of people like back in

1132
00:35:08,358 --> 00:35:11,759
the day no man used to make these

1133
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,599
cupcakes I use because I I was working

1134
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,280
with the people that are growing

1135
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:15,359
strawberry cough and this was they were

1136
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,920
just throwing away their trim so they

1137
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:19,000
would just give me bucket loads of fresh

1138
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,519
indoor trim and I'd make this butter and

1139
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,960
make these Strawberry Cough cupcakes and

1140
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:23,800
they were like electric there were just

1141
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,240
a psychedelic experience eating those so

1142
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,760
we were mega dosing and then when I

1143
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:28,919
worked at Harborside we had crov we had

1144
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:30,800
the th000 migr black bars and then like

1145
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,480
it was there was like hazing when I was

1146
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,280
a bud tender about like how many Edibles

1147
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,679
that you could eat on shift and like can

1148
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:37,160
hold your [ __ ] together cuz you still if

1149
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:38,559
you look too inated you're going to get

1150
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:41,000
in trouble so you can't like sit there

1151
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:42,799
looking wasted although sometimes we did

1152
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,320
and so there was a race to get to how

1153
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,680
many people could eat 100 milligrams on

1154
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,800
empty stomach first thing in the morning

1155
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:48,319
and clear through your shift without

1156
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,440
making mistake there's like that going

1157
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:53,000
on but I can't do that now and I mean if

1158
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:54,800
I eat Edibles now I'll do the uncle Arn

1159
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,400
I'll smash that 100 milligrams but if I

1160
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,560
get too much beyond that I'm in trouble

1161
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,039
and when I I used to be over to do 1,200

1162
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:01,799
without thinking about it so what's the

1163
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:03,920
secret to making butter cuz I got my own

1164
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,280
recipe everyone has their own recipe I

1165
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:09,119
did I did a crock poot and I always cut

1166
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:11,200
it with water yeah and so I would do um

1167
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:13,800
a couple pounds of butter really fresh

1168
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:15,239
even then I was I was I was freezing the

1169
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,599
trim even though people kept telling me

1170
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:18,239
you didn't it didn't matter but I was

1171
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:20,599
like yes it does [ __ ] I mean I grew

1172
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:21,719
like I we had it everywhere and so I I

1173
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:23,200
would freeze the trim even when we

1174
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:24,598
weren't supposed to only use sugar trim

1175
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:26,679
never use the fans or the any of the

1176
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:28,680
other stuff that put it in a crock pot I

1177
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:30,239
would do 12 to 16 hours in a crock pot

1178
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:32,318
with a couple pounds of butter couple

1179
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:34,519
cups of water and then I keep it at a

1180
00:36:32,318 --> 00:36:36,000
low rolling boil and then I would keep

1181
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:37,800
refilling it with water so I keep a

1182
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,159
certain amount of water in it yeah and

1183
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:42,000
then um then like strain it into a

1184
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:43,719
through a cheesecloth into a metal Bowl

1185
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
put it in the refrigerator let the water

1186
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:47,719
and the butter separate it and then dump

1187
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,039
out that dirty water or save it for

1188
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:50,919
something else and then I would take

1189
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:52,079
that hockey puck of butter and then I

1190
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,880
would melt it down and kind of do a

1191
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:56,039
clarified butter thing where I kind of

1192
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,800
pour off the top where it was just it

1193
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:59,279
was just almost clear it was just

1194
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,519
perfect whereas the lower part was a

1195
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,920
little bit sludger um and that kind of

1196
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:04,358
had more of like I feel like it had more

1197
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,318
of the indicia stuff in it that but that

1198
00:37:04,358 --> 00:37:08,039
might have been all psychosomatic and um

1199
00:37:06,318 --> 00:37:10,519
and when I would make my cupcakes I

1200
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:12,838
would use an Indica for the cake and I

1201
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:14,639
would use a sativa for the icing and so

1202
00:37:12,838 --> 00:37:15,599
people would lick the icing and that and

1203
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:18,318
because you're licking it it's kind of

1204
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,318
sublingual so you're you get lit quick

1205
00:37:18,318 --> 00:37:21,400
you know especially when like you're

1206
00:37:19,318 --> 00:37:23,159
Mega doing the the icing and so they

1207
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,838
have a certain kind of a high then they

1208
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:26,480
eat the cake and that doesn't kick in

1209
00:37:24,838 --> 00:37:28,039
for like another 20 30 minutes takes

1210
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,199
them a completely different direction

1211
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:31,759
I used to do damage I used to do damage

1212
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:34,279
oh we had so much fun sounds like fun

1213
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,319
yeah really exciting yeah we so I was

1214
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,720
told the Native Americans would boil it

1215
00:37:36,318 --> 00:37:39,119
you know this is when I was in high

1216
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:40,679
school so people were like oh yeah you

1217
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,800
do the cheesecloth you wrap it in

1218
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:45,440
cheesecloth with a rock use a big pot

1219
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,760
and you boil it you let it cool if it's

1220
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,119
cold outside you just put it out

1221
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,319
overnight and then you set you cover it

1222
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:51,599
and then you go out the next day and you

1223
00:37:49,318 --> 00:37:53,318
got a disc on the top you know and then

1224
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,519
the more weed you put in and I feel like

1225
00:37:53,318 --> 00:37:56,279
that's the most that's the best way to

1226
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:57,759
make it super super super concentrated

1227
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:00,119
because you can put a [ __ ] ton of Trim

1228
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,880
in there and it's the best but butter is

1229
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:03,519
the best fat is the best carrier like I

1230
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,599
don't care what science is happening I

1231
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:07,159
don't care about Nano anything you give

1232
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,400
me a butter based edible and it's just

1233
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:09,838
going to be stronger than the rest of

1234
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,280
them and I love that's why again I still

1235
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:12,880
mess with big pets I mean because it's

1236
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,519
like those cookies make some cookies

1237
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,240
with butter I love that you know just

1238
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:17,440
the old Tech is always better and they

1239
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:19,118
got to taste good back in the day we

1240
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,318
didn't care as much they tasted like

1241
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:23,280
weed back wanted it to be green oh my

1242
00:38:21,318 --> 00:38:24,480
God it's strong I remember we used to

1243
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,720
eat brownies where they just put the

1244
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,480
weed in the brownies it would burn the

1245
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:30,239
back of your throat I don't think I'm

1246
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,400
supposed to be pulling weed in between

1247
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:33,919
my teeth pulling little Twigs out but it

1248
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,280
was great figuring it out it's just that

1249
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,720
that culture and I just remember like

1250
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:40,040
growing up and then people like giving

1251
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:40,919
you brownies in the hate yeah like brown

1252
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:42,679
to cooking I mean there were people

1253
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:45,000
selling it I guess they were selling it

1254
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:47,000
to like the tourists and like the older

1255
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,440
people and like the yuppies or whatever

1256
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,960
but just being like a teenager they just

1257
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,480
give it to you so you just get cookies

1258
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:54,838
and brownies and sharing brownies oh

1259
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,358
yeah we're g get into that 100% would

1260
00:38:54,838 --> 00:38:59,239
cut school go to Telegraph half in

1261
00:38:56,358 --> 00:39:00,598
Berkeley get as a 250 of pop go to

1262
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:02,318
Blondies get a slice of pizza and the

1263
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:03,920
soda be in people's Park and that was

1264
00:39:02,318 --> 00:39:05,480
the day so we grew up in the same era

1265
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,159
right because that's what we used to do

1266
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:10,240
totally the park over there was amazing

1267
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:12,078
destroyed it yeah before they old Cody

1268
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:15,239
before they moved Cody down to fourth

1269
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:17,359
with the yuppies beautiful blondies

1270
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:19,279
Cody's books and Mo's books that was

1271
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:20,199
like my triangle in Berkeley but that's

1272
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,400
the beauty of the bay what's the beauty

1273
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:22,480
of I guess living anywhere but I do

1274
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,920
appreciate the bay I do love San

1275

Francisco I love Oakland I love the Bay

1276
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,838
Area I love the uh the diversity culture

1277
00:39:26,318 --> 00:39:29,199
we have oh yeah culture it's the best

1278
00:39:27,838 --> 00:39:30,639
culture in the world in my opinion and

1279
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:32,159
there's a lot of great culture in other

1280
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:34,118
places but there's so much diversity

1281
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:35,358
here on all levels it doesn't matter

1282
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:36,400
what you like or what you're into

1283
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:37,759
there's something for you here in the

1284
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,599
Bay Area yeah we're definitely blessed

1285
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,920
foodwise you know you can go to the

1286
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,280
ocean it's like right there you can go

1287
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,880
up to the mountains during the winter

1288
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,680
it's like everything is so close we got

1289
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:48,039
the Redwoods we've got great hiking

1290
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:50,519
camping we're blessed blessed I mean

1291
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:53,159
it's California the weather I still miss

1292
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:55,079
going I used to my my uncle had um some

1293
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:56,440
weed shops in La when I was younger and

1294
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:57,920
he wasn't really smoking at this point

1295
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:00,240
so I would go with him up to humble to

1296
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,880
get packs yeah and just going up on the

1297
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:03,679
mountain and just seeing all the

1298
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:05,720
different types of flowers coming down

1299
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:06,960
and seeing all the variety and stuff

1300
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:09,039
that like never left the mountain like

1301
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,119
we took a lot of stuff that back to LA

1302
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:13,079
but the Brokers always were like cuz I

1303
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:14,519
smoked and he didn't and they're like

1304
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:16,160
we're never selling him this but you

1305
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:17,358
want to smoke a little bit like this is

1306
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:19,399
just doesn't leave the mountain kind of

1307
00:40:17,358 --> 00:40:21,519
a thing and just trying sampling that

1308
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:23,240
and then realizing again like if you're

1309
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:24,599
not up there or going up there you

1310
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:26,000
really don't know how good it can get

1311
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:27,720
kind of a thing like what we get down

1312
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,719
here is just is just what we get down

1313
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:31,159
here kind of a thing and I love that

1314
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:32,318
about this plant in our culture and I

1315
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:33,318
guess it's the beauty of California

1316
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:35,000
because we have that about produce we

1317
00:40:33,318 --> 00:40:36,639
have phenomenal produce top and bottom

1318
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,480
but oh yeah some of the best produce in

1319
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:40,480
the world and I think the abundance of

1320
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,719
produce yeah I love seeing that we're

1321
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,280
starting to see uh cannabis farms grow

1322
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:47,000
food again like because the Mom and Pops

1323
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,480
kind of went away but some of the bigger

1324
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,838
ones are kind of trying to build that

1325
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,000
back into what they're doing so they're

1326
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:53,559
offering food and cannabis from the same

1327
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,119
place and kind of pairing it I know

1328
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:56,519
Happy Day farms does a really good job

1329
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,240
with that and there's a bunch of other

1330
00:40:56,519 --> 00:40:59,838
places that people I popped up recently

1331
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:01,919
they've been doing events I think it's

1332
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:03,799
uh I don't want to say the wrong name

1333
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,400
but there's other folks out there doing

1334
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,560
this and I really like the idea of like

1335
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,358
people being able to understand that

1336
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:09,679
this is an Agricultural Product and it

1337
00:41:08,358 --> 00:41:11,400
doesn't have to be separate from this

1338
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:13,239
this can be part of your experience of

1339
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:15,400
going to Farmers Market buying good

1340
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:17,078
fruits buying veggies buying this kind

1341
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:19,039
of produce as well and having it all

1342
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:20,359
together I like that totally so tell me

1343
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:22,279
about Oakland extracts I know you

1344
00:41:20,358 --> 00:41:24,039
touched on it a little bit about uh

1345
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:26,560
edibles but let's let's dive into

1346
00:41:24,039 --> 00:41:29,079
Oakland xtrax how that came about and uh

1347
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:30,799
where it's going um started it in 2013

1348
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:33,440
uh with my buddy Aaron Tran we both

1349
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,839
worked at Harborside um like I said we

1350
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,200
had been talking about making Edibles we

1351
00:41:34,838 --> 00:41:38,078
kind of wanted to do that and part we

1352
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:39,559
knew part of that process was hash you

1353
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,800
have to learn how to make great hash

1354
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:42,400
especially back then you really need to

1355
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,680
learn how to make great hash to make

1356
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,318
great Edibles and I left Harborside to

1357
00:41:44,679 --> 00:41:47,679
work on a farm and he started working

1358
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:49,119
with some guys at Harborside learning

1359
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:51,279
how to make some hash I started coming

1360
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:52,800
back from the farm and we kind of

1361
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,079
reconnected and we're like okay let's

1362
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,560
let's do this I started bringing him

1363
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,359
like a lot of really really good product

1364
00:41:55,559 --> 00:41:58,559
because I was working on a farm and no

1365
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:00,358
one was doing they're throwing it away

1366
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:01,960
and piles of trim were sitting on this

1367
00:42:00,358 --> 00:42:04,239
Farm just rotting in the sun kind of a

1368
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,920
thing and um this is back when

1369
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:07,679
everyone's just giving trim away so I'd

1370
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,358
bring it home and he would make this

1371
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:10,879
just phenomenal phenomenal wax and

1372
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:12,559
shatter and we were just kind of giving

1373
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,318
it away to our friends and all that and

1374
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:16,199
then one of our friends who's a buyer at

1375
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:18,159
Harbor Side is's like you need to stop

1376
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:20,519
just giving this away you need to sell

1377
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:23,318
this for real and um start selling it in

1378
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:24,920
stores and um and it was this was back

1379
00:42:23,318 --> 00:42:26,159
when they would not accept branded

1380
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:29,119
product when you're just bringing in

1381
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:31,920
slabs of shatter Weare full of wax and

1382
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:34,358
um and I I remember one of the one of

1383
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:36,000
the stores is like you we actually need

1384
00:42:34,358 --> 00:42:37,239
you to name it because it's so much

1385
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
better than the other stuff that we're

1386
00:42:37,239 --> 00:42:40,799
bringing in it's confusing the customers

1387
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,280
they want to know how to ask for yours

1388
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,880
and again it was because I was just

1389
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,519
doing I was just getting really good

1390
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,838
material I kind of didn't have the

1391
00:42:46,519 --> 00:42:50,159
capitalist sense of if you're selling it

1392
00:42:48,838 --> 00:42:51,920
as fast as you can make it you should

1393
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:53,279
just get more trim and make more of it I

1394
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,920
was just getting what I got from these

1395
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,519
guys who was giving me phenomenal trim

1396
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:58,039
and so the product was super super high

1397
00:42:56,519 --> 00:43:00,159
level at all time

1398
00:42:58,039 --> 00:43:02,639
and um and that that then we we needed

1399
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:04,879
to have a name and we're from Oakland

1400
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:06,400
and then I I grew up around Oakland so

1401
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,800
grew up watching the crane and all that

1402
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:12,079
kind of stuff and then and also you know

1403
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:13,280
it was it was so good and so affordable

1404
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:14,559
and like we could sell it in a really

1405
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,599
affordable way this was back when most

1406
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:18,599
of the good wax and shatter was $80 $100

1407
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:19,920
a gram for no reason like we didn't just

1408
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:22,440
I remember working at Harbor Side when

1409
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,800
there was no BHO there was only water

1410
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:25,639
hash cuz Steve and them weren't messing

1411
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:27,119
with butane they didn't like the idea of

1412
00:43:25,639 --> 00:43:29,920
that and I remember when they started

1413
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:32,240
started selling it it went from4 to $60

1414
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,800
to $70 a gram like in a couple of months

1415
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:35,479
cuz it was selling so fast and the you

1416
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,680
know Market forces and the people

1417
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:38,480
producing it started wanting to sell it

1418
00:43:36,679 --> 00:43:40,558
for more so when we started making it we

1419
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,800
realized that because we had access to

1420
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:43,400
this phenomenal Farm it was basically

1421
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:45,000
giving us whatever we wanted we could

1422
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,920
have product out there that was good as

1423
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,400
a $60 or $70 stuff for only like 30

1424
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,880
bucks yeah and that was kind of our

1425
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,400
thing top shelf quality at everyday

1426
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:53,400
price we wanted to have this phenomenal

1427
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,760
product but it not be super expensive

1428
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,318
and that really came from working at

1429
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:58,400
Harborside in Oakland when all of a we

1430
00:43:57,318 --> 00:43:59,440
went from not really having a lot of

1431
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,358
hash to all of a sudden there was a

1432
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,000
bunch of 80 to $100 grams and people

1433
00:44:01,358 --> 00:44:04,400
would be like they didn't even they

1434
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,239
didn't know what it was like they they

1435
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,400
called it super milk yeah and so I was

1436
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:09,838
like why is this supermel $100 a gram

1437
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,920
who no one's paying $100 a gram and the

1438
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:13,279
customer [ __ ] that this is Oakland ain't

1439
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,358
nobody paying $100 a gram and they would

1440
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,400
storm out and us as staff we laugh

1441
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:17,598
because we smoke it we know how good it

1442
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,920
is we also knew how expensive their

1443
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:20,480
price was and it became like this

1444
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:22,159
running joke like this is Oakland ain't

1445
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,079
nobody paying for all that and so when

1446
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:26,000
Tran and I started making it and we it

1447
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:27,960
was like it was really good and it was

1448
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,199
yielding a lot and we had it at a really

1449
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:32,559
low price so like Oak xtrax is

1450
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:34,519
Affordable inapproachable and um that

1451
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:35,440
was really kind of like our initial idea

1452
00:44:34,519 --> 00:44:38,159
was that we just wanted to have really

1453
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:41,400
good hash and we're making shatter and

1454
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:42,920
um and some wax and we kept having

1455
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,880
people like no none of my friends were

1456
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:46,400
dabbing this is blowtorch era yeah so

1457
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,680
dabbing was like something that you had

1458
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,960
to be really comfortable with the torch

1459
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:50,078
so no one in my community I want to say

1460
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,480
no one but I didn't know any brown

1461
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,240
people that were dabbing it looked like

1462
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,920
free based people weren't going for it

1463
00:44:53,239 --> 00:44:56,679
and I kept telling TR like I'm selling

1464
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:58,440
all this shatter but it's like our folks

1465
00:44:56,679 --> 00:44:59,799
really AR buying it and people keep

1466
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:02,760
asking for something they can roll up

1467
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:04,440
and the wax was inconsistent and um

1468
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,760
sometimes it's gooey sometimes it's dry

1469
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,480
and it's it's not for someone who's

1470
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,839
trying to roll something up it's not

1471
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:10,960
convenient for all them always to buy it

1472
00:45:08,838 --> 00:45:12,719
to roll and I kept telling about that

1473
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,199
and he's like well I can make the wax in

1474
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:15,799
these little one G Wafers that are

1475
00:45:14,199 --> 00:45:17,480
really really dry so it be like a little

1476
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,839
vanilla wafer and they can just crumble

1477
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:21,000
it up over a joint blender bowl and

1478
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:22,440
that's really kind of what put us on the

1479
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,599
map so most of people that know openland

1480
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:26,440
extracts from 10 years ago they know

1481
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:29,318
it's from these little one G Wafers that

1482
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:31,599
look like vanilla wafers actually like a

1483
00:45:29,318 --> 00:45:33,119
very small version of this this is this

1484
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:35,079
is a larger one that he he made with

1485
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,880
rosin oh nice and so we're going to

1486
00:45:35,079 --> 00:45:38,079
re-release the we call them coins for a

1487
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,358
minute we're going to re-release them

1488
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:40,960
but we've been really slow about it

1489
00:45:39,358 --> 00:45:43,358
because we we wanted to make it from

1490
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,240
rosin as opposed to wax and not every

1491
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:47,318
type of rosin can you like kind of get

1492
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:48,598
that dry and that that stable really

1493
00:45:47,318 --> 00:45:50,239
cool and so we've really been kind of

1494
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:51,838
trying to refocus on that she microplane

1495
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:54,519
that right over your exactly or really

1496
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:57,039
my thought was like I got I have lots of

1497
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:58,039
friends in Oakland who stand around on

1498
00:45:57,039 --> 00:45:59,558
various street corners they're kind of

1499
00:45:58,039 --> 00:46:00,920
rolling Blunts and they do it

1500
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:01,960
everything's in their hand they take it

1501
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,318
they bust up the wied in their hand

1502
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:05,000
there's no Grinder like everything is

1503
00:46:03,318 --> 00:46:06,199
just two hands going and this is

1504
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,599
something that they can just kind of mix

1505
00:46:06,199 --> 00:46:09,558
right in the go with it and just be

1506
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:11,079
really on the go oh yeah and um that was

1507
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:12,680
kind of well hash holes are trending

1508
00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:15,920
really hard right now yeah that's

1509
00:46:12,679 --> 00:46:15,919
actually what what kind of got us

1510
00:46:17,539 --> 00:46:20,639
[Music]

1511
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:27,318
[Music]

1512
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,599
reinspection want to have something

1513
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:29,838
that's easier for people that are out

1514
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:31,838
there mobile like most people are with

1515
00:46:29,838 --> 00:46:34,039
they're smoking nice um but anyway so we

1516
00:46:31,838 --> 00:46:35,679
we started doing that we did that

1517
00:46:34,039 --> 00:46:37,719
through the medical era when there's no

1518
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:39,679
rules no taxes everything was great

1519
00:46:37,719 --> 00:46:41,759
backyard blasting all that kind of stuff

1520
00:46:39,679 --> 00:46:43,440
and then with prop 215 and then when

1521
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,880
prop 64 happened we actually had like

1522
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,599
serious regulations everything had to

1523
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,720
come out of a licensed facility we had

1524
00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:49,440
to kind of change everything we were

1525
00:46:47,719 --> 00:46:51,399
doing because previously like I said

1526
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,039
blasting outside we had you know ovens

1527
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,559
in the the basement kind of a thing so

1528
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:56,440
we had to actually find a real licensed

1529
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:58,359
facility to work out of and I spent a

1530
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,720
year and a trying to raise the money um

1531
00:46:58,358 --> 00:47:01,358
this is back when you kind of could

1532
00:46:59,719 --> 00:47:03,000
raise money without having real receipts

1533
00:47:01,358 --> 00:47:04,199
it was that weird transition period

1534
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,760
where there's a lot of people coming

1535
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:07,439
into California trying to invest in

1536
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:09,480
companies that were in 215 trying to get

1537
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,240
to 64 but people were being offered

1538
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:12,440
really raw deals and so there's a bunch

1539
00:47:11,239 --> 00:47:13,959
of different times where I got offered

1540
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:15,159
deals that I thought were okay and then

1541
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:16,599
I had someone read it later and they're

1542
00:47:15,159 --> 00:47:18,879
like no you almost sold your life you

1543
00:47:16,599 --> 00:47:20,880
know you gave your life away a lot yeah

1544
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,358
and so I'm lucky that I didn't do that

1545
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,640
but it kind of created issue where we

1546
00:47:22,358 --> 00:47:26,598
didn't really have startup money that

1547
00:47:23,639 --> 00:47:28,039
was a hassle for a long time and I um I

1548
00:47:26,599 --> 00:47:30,519
have know the guys at Jetty since they

1549
00:47:28,039 --> 00:47:31,920
moved up here from San Diego yeah Nate

1550
00:47:30,519 --> 00:47:34,679
Nate's one of my friends yeah I love

1551
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,119
Nate Ron the whole crew and um and Ron

1552
00:47:34,679 --> 00:47:37,440
kept saying because I Ron used to go to

1553
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:38,760
all these events I'd see him at any

1554
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,000
random Oakland event it wasn't just

1555
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:41,319
cannabis events like when they first

1556
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,800
came up here like he made sure they were

1557
00:47:41,318 --> 00:47:43,800
in like going to community events too

1558
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,800
you kind of really understand the

1559
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,920
community he was coming into and I kept

1560
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,519
running into him and we kind of

1561
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:49,480
developed a cool little friendship and

1562
00:47:48,519 --> 00:47:50,800
he's like you know you can just make

1563
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:52,519
your stuff here but I didn't like the

1564
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,880
idea of I don't I really didn't like the

1565
00:47:52,519 --> 00:47:55,400
idea of white labeling I didn't like the

1566
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:58,640
idea of just like someone else making

1567
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:00,318
your stuff right and um they knew Tran

1568
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:02,078
they knew Tran was really a good guy so

1569
00:48:00,318 --> 00:48:03,519
like okay we'll hire Tran or your your

1570
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:05,440
partner who makes everything he can

1571
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:06,759
physically work at our facility and make

1572
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,639
your products but it can still come

1573
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:10,000
through our license facility so we kind

1574
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:11,318
of found a way to be able to get our

1575
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,800
stuff through a license Channel but

1576
00:48:11,318 --> 00:48:14,199
actually still have our hands in the mix

1577
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,599
of it because again I want to make

1578
00:48:14,199 --> 00:48:17,118
because Transformer Chef like he knows

1579
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:18,880
the flavors that we want he knows how we

1580
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:20,160
want things to be absolutely and so he's

1581
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,440
able to kind of pick and choose things

1582
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:23,358
that are there and kind of make it up to

1583
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,960
our specifications and we've been doing

1584
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:27,119
that ever since

1585
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:29,440
nice so what were some of the

1586
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:30,960
difficulties you went through with

1587
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,720
starting your own business in Oakland

1588
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,920
you know we have the equity program and

1589
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:36,279
all that um the equity program is

1590
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:38,000
complicated I was actually on the

1591
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,640
Oakland cannabis Regulatory Commission

1592
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,920
when they created or when we created the

1593
00:48:39,639 --> 00:48:43,838
equity program desay Brooks councilwoman

1594
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:47,680
desay Brooks was the one who created

1595
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:49,279
that and it was born from a good idea

1596
00:48:47,679 --> 00:48:51,399
that like there's definitely a bunch of

1597
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:53,798
people who have been in the Cannabis

1598
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:55,680
business for 20 30 40 years and have

1599
00:48:53,798 --> 00:48:57,000
dealt with all the the punishments and

1600
00:48:55,679 --> 00:48:58,519
repercussions of that and then when

1601
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,679
legalization happened there there was an

1602
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:02,079
opportunity for them to jump straight in

1603
00:49:00,679 --> 00:49:03,679
and so there was definitely a need to

1604
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:06,318
create some kind of system to address

1605
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:08,598
that the system we have is uh doesn't

1606
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:12,199
work very well for a variety of reasons

1607
00:49:08,599 --> 00:49:13,960
um and so I I stayed out of that program

1608
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:15,318
although I I really probably wasn't

1609
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,920
eligible for the program anyway because

1610
00:49:15,318 --> 00:49:18,079
you had to come from a certain zip code

1611
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:19,880
and I've never been to jail and all that

1612
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:21,480
kind of stuff but there was people

1613
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:22,760
finding their ways into the program but

1614
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:24,039
I was really uncomfortable about the

1615
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:25,400
program because I didn't like the

1616
00:49:24,039 --> 00:49:27,400
relationship that it created between you

1617
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:29,639
and the person incubating you right and

1618
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:31,519
it was it and in certain cases it was

1619
00:49:29,639 --> 00:49:33,480
predatory but consistently it was

1620
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:36,199
condescending and I kept seeing these

1621
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:38,599
people it's like I know this does dude

1622
00:49:36,199 --> 00:49:40,919
doesn't know how to do a business plan

1623
00:49:38,599 --> 00:49:42,400
or performa or doesn't know what to Roi

1624
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:44,400
doesn't know all that stuff but they

1625
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,880
know miles more than you about how to

1626
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,960
Market a product in this community so

1627
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:48,640
you're just assuming because they don't

1628
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,119
know how to do these certain things that

1629
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:52,078
they don't have all this other value

1630
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:53,400
that's that's that they can bring in to

1631
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,880
that always made me really uncomfortable

1632
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,240
so I never wanted anything to do with

1633
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,720
that personally in terms of kind of

1634
00:49:56,239 --> 00:50:00,078
signing up for it but I do um but I was

1635
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:01,118
I have been involved in the program I've

1636
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:02,640
advised a lot of people who've been in

1637
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:05,400
the equity program kind of on both sides

1638
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:06,838
of it and um done some Consulting with

1639
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,280
some of the different cities that are

1640
00:50:06,838 --> 00:50:11,039
have like training programs and all that

1641
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:13,400
and I I appreciate the need for that um

1642
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:14,960
we came in when it was medical so we we

1643
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:16,639
were making money before we knew what we

1644
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:19,000
were doing kind of a thing and it

1645
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:21,159
quickly turned into like oh I have to

1646
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,559
now buy a safe there's stacks of cash I

1647
00:50:21,159 --> 00:50:24,279
mean it was just like we didn't we were

1648
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:26,839
just it just kind of erupted in front of

1649
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:29,240
us you know old school medical cannabis

1650
00:50:26,838 --> 00:50:31,558
um when 64 happened all that went away

1651
00:50:29,239 --> 00:50:33,358
um I've been Broker Than Ever the past

1652
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:34,680
couple of years definitely the brokest

1653
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:36,039
I've been since I've been in cannabis

1654
00:50:34,679 --> 00:50:38,399
have been the last three years like

1655
00:50:36,039 --> 00:50:40,159
without question um I feel lucky that

1656
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,680
we're still here there's so many brands

1657
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:44,199
that were like bigger and better brands

1658
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:46,679
that are gone they took money from the

1659
00:50:44,199 --> 00:50:48,118
wrong person or they just they the AR

1660
00:50:46,679 --> 00:50:50,159
got ahead of them and they just they're

1661
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:51,680
just they don't exist and so I feel

1662
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:54,199
lucky this like when I see like I'll see

1663
00:50:51,679 --> 00:50:55,679
Dorian from bezel like bro how are you

1664
00:50:54,199 --> 00:50:56,879

1665
00:50:55,679 --> 00:50:58,838
talk to these guys who've been here

1666
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,200
longer than me and then luckily like old

1667
00:50:58,838 --> 00:51:02,279
school cannabis people are really cool

1668
00:51:00,199 --> 00:51:03,519
about sharing and so I have a lot of

1669
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:04,839
great relationships with people who've

1670
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:06,239
been in the business longer than me

1671
00:51:04,838 --> 00:51:07,679
who've normally been open about hey

1672
00:51:06,239 --> 00:51:10,279
maybe you should try this or this is the

1673
00:51:07,679 --> 00:51:11,879
pivot I ran into Dorian in Maryland a

1674
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:13,200
month ago I was visiting my family and

1675
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:14,559
he was out there and he was trying to

1676
00:51:13,199 --> 00:51:15,798
put me on game about this is how you can

1677
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,440

1678
00:51:15,798 --> 00:51:19,079
opportunities that are here yeah those

1679
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,798

1681
00:51:20,798 --> 00:51:24,759

00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:31,440
oh I'm not going to tell anyone anything

1686
00:51:29,679 --> 00:51:33,598
the trade secrets and all that I still

1687
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,039
feel the old school the Legacy people in

1688
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:36,559
Canada Legacy people will share with

1689
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:37,558
other Legacy people that's for sure

1690
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:39,200
because we want to see each every

1691
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:40,519
succeed like I'll I'll give anyone

1692
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:42,318
advice even if you're some corporate

1693
00:51:40,519 --> 00:51:43,480
jump it's like if you ask me a solid

1694
00:51:42,318 --> 00:51:45,199
question I'm gonna give you an honest

1695
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:47,559
answer like it's just like it's just

1696
00:51:45,199 --> 00:51:50,279
telling the truth you know for sure

1697
00:51:47,559 --> 00:51:52,000
we're all gonna make it if we guess well

1698
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:53,319
I think the ones that are persistent are

1699
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
going to make it like the ones that

1700
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:56,318
aren't taking no for an answer it's like

1701
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
at the end of the day it's like I I

1702
00:51:56,318 --> 00:51:59,519
don't want to be in any other space I

1703
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,960
love this space I'm on the genetic side

1704
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:03,000
so it's a little bit different you know

1705
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:05,519
I feel like I'm more picks and shovels

1706
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,280
in regards to that uh where I work with

1707
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:08,798
cultivation Partners I work with Nursery

1708
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,440
Partners we work with we have Partners

1709
00:52:08,798 --> 00:52:12,400
in all these different spaces but we can

1710
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:15,240
have Partners in every state working

1711
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:17,280
with the genetic side and it's like uh I

1712
00:52:15,239 --> 00:52:19,000
think there's more longevity for us in

1713
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:21,798
in this space doing that than

1714
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,880
cultivation it's just so difficult and

1715
00:52:21,798 --> 00:52:24,719
hats off to my friends that are

1716
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,079
cultivators dude you guys crushing it

1717
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:29,759
you it's like the ones that are doing it

1718
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:33,000
now growing super fire I mean top shelf

1719
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:34,280
flower the only game there is now to be

1720
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,199
successful at is growing top shell

1721
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:37,839
flower if you're in cultivation the mids

1722
00:52:36,199 --> 00:52:39,838
you're you're done you can't grow mids

1723
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:42,639
and survive anymore the price is too low

1724
00:52:39,838 --> 00:52:46,159
yeah now the corporate jums just doing

1725
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:47,519
it for dirt oh yeah oops it's wild we're

1726
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:49,159
we're in Wild times but it is

1727
00:52:47,519 --> 00:52:51,679
interesting I will agree that like when

1728
00:52:49,159 --> 00:52:54,000
64 first happened the Cannabis that we

1729
00:52:51,679 --> 00:52:55,358
had on our shows was a mess it was like

1730
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,798
the people that were doing good work

1731
00:52:55,358 --> 00:52:58,598
were not ready to flip the people that

1732
00:52:56,798 --> 00:53:00,239
were ready to flip into the new

1733
00:52:58,599 --> 00:53:02,119
regulations were just growing scaled up

1734
00:53:00,239 --> 00:53:04,078
trash and I felt like we didn't have

1735
00:53:02,119 --> 00:53:05,720
good weed for a couple years and it was

1736
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:07,079
so hard though cuz the thing is the

1737
00:53:05,719 --> 00:53:08,919
product would sit on the shelf for so

1738
00:53:07,079 --> 00:53:10,599
long or it would sit in some some

1739
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:12,480
Warehouse somewhere everyone tried to

1740
00:53:10,599 --> 00:53:13,920
figure out metric yeah people trying to

1741
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,880
figure out metric and some of my

1742
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:19,599
favorite

1743
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:21,680
Brands like pre uh pre wre when they

1744
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:23,240
went into wreck it's like all of a

1745
00:53:21,679 --> 00:53:25,279
sudden their product is [ __ ] now and I'm

1746
00:53:23,239 --> 00:53:27,919
like how is this possible you've always

1747
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:29,240
been amazing what the best you were so

1748
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,159
like you were the one and I'm not going

1749
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:34,039
to name any names because I feel so bad

1750
00:53:31,159 --> 00:53:34,920
because it was like my favorite product

1751
00:53:34,039 --> 00:53:38,079
in

1752
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:39,599
2017 come 2018 2019 you go to the

1753
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:41,720
shelves and I went to go buy it and I'm

1754
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:44,720
like I can't believe this is the same

1755
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:47,239
company and it's not really their fault

1756
00:53:44,719 --> 00:53:49,598
because it was so difficult to navigate

1757
00:53:47,239 --> 00:53:52,039
and props to them for for trying and

1758
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:53,760
doing it you know what I mean it's like

1759
00:53:52,039 --> 00:53:56,079
but there was so many things to navigate

1760
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,440
with metric and it wasn't easy a lot of

1761
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:58,680
the stuff with metric was these

1762
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,159
companies with lots of money they were

1763
00:53:58,679 --> 00:54:02,239
the first ones to the table because they

1764
00:54:00,159 --> 00:54:03,879
had so much money and so then they have

1765
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:05,639
this product out there that's [ __ ] or

1766
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:07,039
they acquire brand so you know that that

1767
00:54:05,639 --> 00:54:08,519
happened a lot too and they not want to

1768
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:09,920
hire the the head grower what they

1769
00:54:08,519 --> 00:54:11,079
should lose the head grower and then

1770
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,280
destroy the brand because you have some

1771
00:54:11,079 --> 00:54:14,680
amateur and they're trying to follow a

1772
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:17,040
formula oh yeah some guy from uh

1773
00:54:14,679 --> 00:54:19,199
wherever that that like had a had a

1774
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:21,239
garage girl that's now in charge of 300

1775
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:23,879
lights or or whatever I've seen a lot of

1776
00:54:21,239 --> 00:54:25,479
that a lot of that yeah scary but it's

1777
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:27,798
gotten so much better like I really the

1778
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:29,920
past two years particular the top shelf

1779
00:54:27,798 --> 00:54:31,639
has just gotten so much better like fig

1780
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,358
has always been fig but they're amazing

1781
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:35,759

able to find anything good on the

1790
00:54:50,119 --> 00:54:51,960
shelves I mean I didn't need to be in

1791
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:53,280
the store because I have a bunch of

1792

1807
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:22,480
same event like I will do any event that

1808
00:55:20,519 --> 00:55:24,239

1809
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:26,079

1816
00:55:35,318 --> 00:55:38,798
like okay this is where I want to be I

1817
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:40,679
love him I love the rise of the lounges

1818
00:55:38,798 --> 00:55:42,798
I go like I said instead of doing demos

1819
00:55:40,679 --> 00:55:44,480
I can't wait for the lounges in the next

1820
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:46,159
year they're going to pop up everywhere

1821
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,719
too right so finally we can have smoking

1822
00:55:46,159 --> 00:55:50,199
lounges if you guys don't know

1823
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:52,838
California just recently passed the law

1824
00:55:50,199 --> 00:55:54,519
that is going to allow smoking lounges

1825
00:55:52,838 --> 00:55:57,038
it's it's about time we've had some the

1826
00:55:54,519 --> 00:55:58,920
cafe part the cafe we can actually sell

1827
00:55:57,039 --> 00:56:00,440
F and make money where we yeah I mean I

1828
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:02,039
think that's going to be a big game

1829
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,760
changer for California you know we've

1830
00:56:02,039 --> 00:56:06,599
had like there there's a couple in San

1831
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:09,240
Francisco smoking lounges is yet to get

1832
00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:10,880

1833
00:56:09,239 --> 00:56:12,879
Tim mcow they actually have the biggest

1834
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,599
Lounge in nor in California period is is

1835
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:16,599
[ __ ] huge it's still being built out

1836
00:56:14,599 --> 00:56:19,440
so it's it's more big than it is uh

1837
00:56:16,599 --> 00:56:21,160
ready to go and um and Urbana in Oakland

1838
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,679
is opening up in a couple weeks and

1839
00:56:21,159 --> 00:56:23,920
that'll have a really nice Lounge area

1840
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:25,598
but yeah I go to the city I go to m

1841
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,440
greens I go to I just anywhere there's a

1842
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:28,880
lounge like I where I want my product to

1843
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,838
be because I'd rather do a demo there

1844
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:33,079
and actually be able to share things

1845
00:56:30,838 --> 00:56:36,358
with people part of experience old

1846
00:56:33,079 --> 00:56:38,039
school Urban Farm we had epic demo but U

1847
00:56:36,358 --> 00:56:40,318
dab bars going on there and it was just

1848
00:56:38,039 --> 00:56:41,960
fun I miss the deli style with the tooth

1849
00:56:40,318 --> 00:56:43,679
the Chopsticks you know I mean the deli

1850
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:46,639
style pick your

1851
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:48,480
bud the bud you was I think it was uh

1852
00:56:46,639 --> 00:56:49,960
the Divinity tree it was some club that

1853
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,639
was back in the day in San Francisco I

1854
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:53,720
used to go and I oh it was the and it

1855
00:56:51,639 --> 00:56:55,159
was like all experience all the a were

1856
00:56:53,719 --> 00:56:57,480
like four grams or whatever they didn't

1857
00:56:55,159 --> 00:56:59,480
it's over it's fine you can just take it

1858
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:01,039
here take this gummy to go or take this

1859
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:03,199
this the old the old stuff the good

1860
00:57:01,039 --> 00:57:05,240
stuff I I love that but I just love the

1861
00:57:03,199 --> 00:57:06,838
industry in general I don't like there's

1862
00:57:05,239 --> 00:57:08,679
bad things about it but again I like

1863
00:57:06,838 --> 00:57:10,159
there that there's more access than ever

1864
00:57:08,679 --> 00:57:11,879
and if we could just stop locking people

1865
00:57:10,159 --> 00:57:13,480
up and getting free the people who are

1866
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:15,720
locked battle you know because it's just

1867
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:17,000
not right no matter how you look at it

1868
00:57:15,719 --> 00:57:18,598
you know what however you feel about

1869
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,679
legalization the most important part is

1870
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:22,760
that we're not locking people up uh

1871
00:57:20,679 --> 00:57:25,480
we're not locking users up especially

1872
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:28,240
it's like it's so crazy to think that

1873
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:30,400
for the last 40 years we've been putting

1874
00:57:28,239 --> 00:57:32,358
people in jail for cannabis for a plant

1875
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,599
for a plant that only makes the world a

1876
00:57:32,358 --> 00:57:35,279
better place in my opinion yeah

1877
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:36,318
absolutely you know it's it's sad and

1878
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,960
it's sad that how much of that

1879
00:57:36,318 --> 00:57:40,199
conversation has gone away again now

1880
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:41,679
that we're in 6 prop 64 we're in the

1881
00:57:40,199 --> 00:57:43,399
recreational era it's all about making

1882
00:57:41,679 --> 00:57:44,480
money making money and then a lot of the

1883
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:46,160
conversation with us who' have been

1884
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:48,000
around for a while is just we're going

1885
00:57:46,159 --> 00:57:49,199
out of business how do we stay afloat

1886
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,358
but how do how do we deal with the fact

1887
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:51,639
that there's still people being locked

1888
00:57:50,358 --> 00:57:53,519
up there's still people going to prison

1889
00:57:51,639 --> 00:57:55,759
over having a couple plants right it's

1890
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:57,318
not good yeah it's a strange world we

1891
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:58,280
live in you know I think a lot of the

1892
00:57:57,318 --> 00:58:00,920
stuff is

1893
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:03,000
backwards you know but we're wild times

1894
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:04,280
you know postco good times there's

1895
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,838
there's good times and there's good if

1896
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:08,119
you look in every situation there's

1897
00:58:05,838 --> 00:58:10,279
there is some good I love the the the

1898
00:58:08,119 --> 00:58:12,280
the rise of new new cannabis media yeah

1899
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:13,359
like this podcast first smoke of the day

1900
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:15,720
there's all these there's all these

1901
00:58:13,358 --> 00:58:17,038
other podcasts stuff going on on Twitch

1902
00:58:15,719 --> 00:58:18,118
that I can't keep up with and I don't

1903
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:19,880
know what the hell's going on with Tik

1904
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:21,880
Tok I'm too old to know but I just love

1905
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:23,280
the idea that people are using media to

1906
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:24,720
be able to push different messages and

1907
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,798
create community in that way because I

1908
00:58:24,719 --> 00:58:28,759
feel like outside of lounges it's hard

1909
00:58:26,798 --> 00:58:30,199
to create Community but the spaces like

1910
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:32,119
this are a place to create community and

1911
00:58:30,199 --> 00:58:33,358
that's really awesome well and we're

1912
00:58:32,119 --> 00:58:34,640
we're able to tell a story that's so

1913
00:58:33,358 --> 00:58:37,119
much bigger than ourselves it's one

1914
00:58:34,639 --> 00:58:39,960
thing if I was to write my story but now

1915
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:42,960
we're on episode 80 something right and

1916
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:45,559
so going in on episode 80s something uh

1917
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:47,760
we have this story that's told by 80

1918
00:58:45,559 --> 00:58:49,160
other people and if we go to a thousand

1919
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,960
someday which I hope we do of course he

1920
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:53,279
will keep knocking them imagine a

1921
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:54,760
thousand different stories over time and

1922
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,880
and the impact that that potentially has

1923
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:58,520
on the future which I think to me that's

1924
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,559
kind of what it's all about I enjoy

1925
00:58:58,519 --> 00:59:02,239
sitting here talking to everybody but

1926
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:04,319
it's like uh we're we're telling a

1927
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:05,919
bigger story yeah you know and it's one

1928
00:59:04,318 --> 00:59:07,599
I'm getting your perspective today and

1929
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:09,519
then next we got Maya from home and then

1930
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:11,240
we got this person here who's a Works in

1931
00:59:09,519 --> 00:59:12,759
genetics you know so we get these

1932
00:59:11,239 --> 00:59:14,479
different stories about the industry and

1933
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:17,520
it really Paints the true picture of

1934
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:18,838
what's going on because with the media

1935
00:59:17,519 --> 00:59:22,440
as a lot of people

1936
00:59:18,838 --> 00:59:25,279
know uh we're we're given one story

1937
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:26,960
whether it's agenda based uh or whatever

1938
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:29,680
but it's the perspective of somebody who

1939
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:31,519
has one opinion right whereas you can go

1940
00:59:29,679 --> 00:59:33,279
and watch podcasts and then you can

1941
00:59:31,519 --> 00:59:35,079
align with different people and their

1942
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,400
stories and you can kind of pick and

1943
00:59:35,079 --> 00:59:38,760
choose what you want to hear but it's

1944
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,960
all for the most part authentic well I

1945
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:42,160
think it's important because it's it's

1946
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:43,760
like there's so many Brands out there

1947
00:59:42,159 --> 00:59:45,598
they are just kind of faceless and

1948
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:47,200
there's Brands out there that like I

1949
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:48,680
recognize that name but I really don't

1950
00:59:47,199 --> 00:59:50,199
know who that's who that person is I

1951
00:59:48,679 --> 00:59:51,358
don't know that their story but once I'm

1952
00:59:50,199 --> 00:59:52,798
able to hear their stories like oh I

1953
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:54,159
want to support them like I want to be a

1954
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:55,559
part of their movement because I hear

1955
00:59:54,159 --> 00:59:57,838
where they're coming from like I love

1956
00:59:55,559 --> 01:00:00,000
that element of the podcast and just

1957
00:59:57,838 --> 01:00:01,599
cannabis media the ability to meet the

1958
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,920
farmer or meet the people where this is

1959
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:04,519
coming from and really kind of have a

1960
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:05,760
better appreciation of their story and

1961
01:00:04,519 --> 01:00:07,798
again realize these aren't faceless

1962
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:09,240
Brands these often most of these the

1963
01:00:07,798 --> 01:00:10,440
good brands just they're just a couple

1964
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:12,118
friends that kind of got together

1965
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:13,480
because they liked doing one thing and

1966
01:00:12,119 --> 01:00:14,960
they built this world around them and

1967
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:16,480
they're worth supporting they're small

1968
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,358
business owners yeah you know in

1969
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:20,159
California and it's not easy to be a

1970
01:00:18,358 --> 01:00:21,920
small business owner in California it's

1971
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:24,598
very difficult you know we're taxed a

1972
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:27,639
lot heavier than other places uh the tax

1973
01:00:24,599 --> 01:00:28,880
burden's much higher uh but it's just

1974
01:00:27,639 --> 01:00:30,679
it's difficult to be a small business

1975
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:32,599
owner in general yeah it is it's tough

1976
01:00:30,679 --> 01:00:34,239
it's tough you get very used to not

1977
01:00:32,599 --> 01:00:35,838
paying yourself much like I'm I'm good

1978
01:00:34,239 --> 01:00:37,959
at paying other people but not so great

1979
01:00:35,838 --> 01:00:40,400
at paying myself but I'll Pat myself on

1980
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:41,880
yeah exactly but but what you need is

1981
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:43,960
less it's like I just want this I want

1982
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:46,440
my baby to succeed I want this to get to

1983
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:48,039
the next year and so it's easy got level

1984
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:49,079
up yeah it's easy not to do things for

1985
01:00:48,039 --> 01:00:50,960
yourself when you're like cuz I want

1986
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:53,119
this other thing to be able to happen

1987
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:55,079
and so it's exciting yeah one of the

1988
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:58,480
things I'm the most excited about is the

1989
01:00:55,079 --> 01:01:01,480
farm to take a model of in the winery

1990
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:04,039
model where you get to go to the

1991
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:06,920
grow uh whether it's indoor outdoor

1992
01:01:04,039 --> 01:01:09,240
Greenhouse extract company and you get

1993
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:11,760
to talk to the people that work for the

1994
01:01:09,239 --> 01:01:13,759
company and go on a tour potentially and

1995
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:15,440
get to try the product there yeah and I

1996
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:17,119
feel like that's the one big thing that

1997
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:19,079
we're missing and it's slowly starting

1998
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:20,640
to happen and it's it's just going to

1999
01:01:19,079 --> 01:01:23,000
eventually snowball and it's just going

2000
01:01:20,639 --> 01:01:25,318
to be like the micro brew model or you

2001
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,358
know like Lanas you want to get you want

2002
01:01:25,318 --> 01:01:28,719
to get a sense of of what the Cannabis

2003
01:01:27,358 --> 01:01:30,598
industry is going to be like in 10 years

2004
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:32,480
go get a tour loggan is because that's

2005
01:01:30,599 --> 01:01:34,480
the future it's really frustrating that

2006
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:35,960
we're not there yet I've just I've had

2007
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:38,240
so many friends that had grows on

2008
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:40,079
wineries or next to wineries you know

2009
01:01:38,239 --> 01:01:42,118
I've uh there's a club in Livermore that

2010
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:44,079
opened up recently that like it's

2011
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:45,798
there's a winery on the same property

2012
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:46,960
yeah and so like you're at the you're at

2013
01:01:45,798 --> 01:01:48,358
the dispensary then you see this

2014
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:50,079
beautiful Winery and they hear about all

2015
01:01:48,358 --> 01:01:51,759
the events they have at the winery and

2016
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:53,318
like what are your events well you can

2017
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,920
come hang out you know it's but you

2018
01:01:53,318 --> 01:01:56,480
can't smoke you can't consume but we can

2019
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:58,318
go to a winery and do all that and it's

2020
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:59,679
like as if it's not so much more

2021
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:01,719
dangerous to go somewhere drive

2022
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:03,759
somewhere drink and then drive away I

2023
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:05,679
mean can't if you can if we can justify

2024
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:06,920
that activity and say that we created

2025
01:02:05,679 --> 01:02:08,679
safety measures around that we can

2026
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:10,000
certainly do that around cannabis and I

2027
01:02:08,679 --> 01:02:11,639
think that's again that's a way to save

2028
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,639
small mom and park Farms there's a bunch

2029
01:02:11,639 --> 01:02:15,440
of people have small pieces of property

2030
01:02:13,639 --> 01:02:16,879
where they love to be part of a network

2031
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,760
of small farms where people could come

2032
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:20,559
visit them on Sundays and see how they

2033
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:22,200
operate and buy directly from the farm

2034
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:23,440
and have that relationship because it's

2035
01:02:22,199 --> 01:02:24,838
it's so much better when you know the

2036
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,119
person who's either growing your food or

2037
01:02:24,838 --> 01:02:28,920
your cannabis having that direct

2038
01:02:26,119 --> 01:02:30,519
one-on-one it's the best totally yeah

2039
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:31,920
are you guys planning on expanding to

2040
01:02:30,519 --> 01:02:33,199
other states are you guys just really

2041
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:35,480
focusing

2042
01:02:33,199 --> 01:02:37,118
on I'd like to expand to other states so

2043
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:38,240
this has been the conversation I mean

2044
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:39,760
for those of you who don't know if you

2045
01:02:38,239 --> 01:02:42,719
want to succeed in California you get

2046
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:44,920
out of California um like every everyone

2047
01:02:42,719 --> 01:02:46,679
that I've talked to the only way to stay

2048
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:48,599
solvent is to have a presence in another

2049
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:49,919
state California you can build your name

2050
01:02:48,599 --> 01:02:51,318
you can learn you can be part of the

2051
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:52,920
culture but if you actually need to make

2052
01:02:51,318 --> 01:02:54,558
money you need to go somewhere else so

2053
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:56,039
we've been talking about that we've been

2054
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:57,798
really slow with it just because were're

2055
01:02:56,039 --> 01:02:59,240
not anywhere near where we want to be in

2056
01:02:57,798 --> 01:03:01,278
California those last two years have

2057
01:02:59,239 --> 01:03:03,639
been extremely difficult for us and I I

2058
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:05,679
feel super lucky to still be here but I

2059
01:03:03,639 --> 01:03:08,400
have talked to some people back East um

2060
01:03:05,679 --> 01:03:11,558
talked to um some people in Vegas too

2061
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:13,200
actually like I'm not a Vegas person but

2062
01:03:11,559 --> 01:03:14,519
even before the Raiders went to Vegas

2063
01:03:13,199 --> 01:03:16,118
there was always a huge Oakland

2064
01:03:14,519 --> 01:03:18,000
contingent in Vegas and people would

2065
01:03:16,119 --> 01:03:19,760
always send me pictures of our stickers

2066
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,760
like around Vegas randomly like oh

2067
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:22,880
that's cute and then um now that the

2068
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,920
Raiders are there there's even more

2069
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:27,160
series and I went out to MJ Biz a couple

2070
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:28,760
years ago and it was interesting like

2071
01:03:27,159 --> 01:03:30,759
the dispensary owners who have the

2072
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:32,400
option to open lounges were like not

2073
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:33,920
sure what to do with it yeah they're

2074
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:36,278
like I have I talked to this one guy

2075
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:37,880
some policy thing he's like I don't even

2076
01:03:36,278 --> 01:03:39,318
know if I want to do it it's like are

2077
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:41,920
you [ __ ] kidding you don't want to

2078
01:03:39,318 --> 01:03:43,639
have a lounge in Vegas like like but

2079
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:45,278
they didn't they kind of didn't see all

2080
01:03:43,639 --> 01:03:47,358
the what could be done with it and we

2081
01:03:45,278 --> 01:03:49,318
have so much experience here in

2082
01:03:47,358 --> 01:03:50,598
California it'd be crazy not to try to

2083
01:03:49,318 --> 01:03:51,920
take out to the rest of the country and

2084
01:03:50,599 --> 01:03:53,359
do things out the rest of the country

2085
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:56,880
and so I'd love to eventually be able to

2086
01:03:53,358 --> 01:03:58,199
do that but um I got a short up our our

2087
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,200
current business we do a lot of have a

2088
01:03:58,199 --> 01:04:01,278
lot of cartrid we sell a lot of

2089
01:03:59,199 --> 01:04:03,199
cartridges that's probably like 85% of

2090
01:04:01,278 --> 01:04:05,079
our business currently um we've always

2091
01:04:03,199 --> 01:04:07,239
had live resent jars we've gotten into

2092
01:04:05,079 --> 01:04:09,119
rosin recently and then we're going to

2093
01:04:07,239 --> 01:04:10,919
get into Edibles and I really want to

2094
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:12,720
launch Edibles here and get that going

2095
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:14,599
sooner than later and then kind of

2096
01:04:12,719 --> 01:04:15,959
Branch out to other states um I love to

2097
01:04:14,599 --> 01:04:17,160
do a beverage and I think beverages will

2098
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:18,960
work better in other states as well I'm

2099
01:04:17,159 --> 01:04:21,798
excited about beverages I just love the

2100
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:23,720
beverage model too yeah I I'm just

2101
01:04:21,798 --> 01:04:25,159
excited but there's so much additional

2102
01:04:23,719 --> 01:04:27,038
product development that we're that's

2103
01:04:25,159 --> 01:04:28,679
going to be able to happen or not happen

2104
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:30,440
we have the product development so as

2105
01:04:28,679 --> 01:04:32,159
the market expands there'll be more

2106
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:33,599
opportunity to create Niche products and

2107
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:35,480
so things that can't necessarily survive

2108
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:37,278
in a brutal market like here but can

2109
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:38,679
survive acrossing like state lines and

2110
01:04:37,278 --> 01:04:40,278
people are shipping things I'm I'm

2111
01:04:38,679 --> 01:04:43,199
talking to brands are like with the hemp

2112
01:04:40,278 --> 01:04:44,920
thing it's just like it's crazy to me

2113
01:04:43,199 --> 01:04:46,318
I'm like you're doing what like you're

2114
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:48,798
you're making what selling it in

2115
01:04:46,318 --> 01:04:50,358
Tennessee it's just oh Texas Tennessee

2116
01:04:48,798 --> 01:04:52,038
all over yeah I mean we're talking to a

2117
01:04:50,358 --> 01:04:54,318
company out of Tennessee flow Gardens he

2118
01:04:52,039 --> 01:04:57,200
was just on the podcast uh getting our

2119
01:04:54,318 --> 01:04:59,440
product out so that you basically he

2120
01:04:57,199 --> 01:05:02,000
will be our cultivation partner and

2121
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:03,318
doing it as hemp yeah and I think that's

2122
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,400
a it's a great thing it's a beautiful

2123
01:05:03,318 --> 01:05:07,400
thing it's this beautiful loophole and

2124
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:09,318
you know and it's great because access

2125
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:11,318
is important I think and honestly like

2126
01:05:09,318 --> 01:05:12,719
when I the reason I like going to MJ Biz

2127
01:05:11,318 --> 01:05:13,798
or just other events like that is

2128
01:05:12,719 --> 01:05:15,358
talking to people in other states

2129
01:05:13,798 --> 01:05:17,119
because they're so excited like here

2130
01:05:15,358 --> 01:05:19,000
we're kind of jaded we're exhausted

2131
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:20,640
we're burnt out you talk to people I

2132
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,599
talk to these guys from Jersey they made

2133
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:24,078
me want to move to Jersey they were so

2134
01:05:22,599 --> 01:05:25,838
excited about opening their Club they

2135
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:27,519
had all these plans that may or may not

2136
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:29,798
work but just the excitement that they

2137
01:05:27,519 --> 01:05:31,440
had and it was like I would love to be

2138
01:05:29,798 --> 01:05:32,599
able to feel that again and be a part of

2139
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:34,200
something like that again so that's part

2140
01:05:32,599 --> 01:05:35,920
of the drive to go to out ofate is just

2141
01:05:34,199 --> 01:05:37,519
to be around people who have that level

2142
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:38,960
of excitement and energy around it I

2143
01:05:37,519 --> 01:05:40,798
think they only had six licenses in

2144
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:42,519
Jersey originally so yeah we might have

2145
01:05:40,798 --> 01:05:44,719
been talking to the same

2146
01:05:42,519 --> 01:05:46,599
group yeah I was talking to some strange

2147
01:05:44,719 --> 01:05:48,078
characters but um a lot of that really

2148
01:05:46,599 --> 01:05:50,400
comes from being part of the equity

2149
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:52,000
Trade Network uh this one of the The Dr

2150
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:54,559
Distribution Center I work with Equity

2151
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,440
trade drro is a Dro that's made up of a

2152
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:59,599
bunch of small Equity businesses and and

2153
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:00,920
some Legacy businesses as well and they

2154
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:03,480
they've kind of gone National so now

2155
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:05,000
they kind of have a a national trademark

2156
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:06,318
that's they're kind of collecting Equity

2157
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,760
brands from around the country under

2158
01:06:06,318 --> 01:06:10,199
this one umbrella and through them I've

2159
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:11,480
been able to meet all these people in

2160
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:13,439
these different states and it's been

2161
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:14,920
really interesting because our um the

2162
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,720
Cannabis in the black community it's

2163
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:18,358
accepted and not at the same time I mean

2164
01:06:16,719 --> 01:06:19,598
a lot of folks obviously are my

2165
01:06:18,358 --> 01:06:20,719
community are involved in the Cannabis

2166
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:22,440
industry but there's still a lot of

2167
01:06:20,719 --> 01:06:24,000
reticence because of the War on Drugs I

2168
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:25,838
know that was my parents were against me

2169
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,679
being in cannabis and I've met a lot of

2170
01:06:25,838 --> 01:06:29,519
other folks who their family are having

2171
01:06:27,679 --> 01:06:30,879
having issues around that same thing so

2172
01:06:29,519 --> 01:06:32,519
the idea of being able to work with

2173
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:33,920
other folks that kind of look like you

2174
01:06:32,519 --> 01:06:35,519
and kind of work together has been like

2175
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:37,278
really advantageous and it's been a huge

2176
01:06:35,519 --> 01:06:38,759
opportunity and so the folks I met in

2177
01:06:37,278 --> 01:06:40,239
Jersey were were folks that had access

2178
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:41,920
to equity licenses out there and they're

2179
01:06:40,239 --> 01:06:43,639
trying to figure out how to actually get

2180
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,880
it off the ground and there's so many of

2181
01:06:43,639 --> 01:06:46,358
the equity businesses particularly the

2182
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:48,318
ones in La they didn't have the best

2183
01:06:46,358 --> 01:06:49,759
partners and the partners made bad

2184
01:06:48,318 --> 01:06:51,119
decisions for them and so those clubs

2185
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:53,160
are really really struggling and then

2186
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:55,039
seeing like just simple little advice

2187
01:06:53,159 --> 01:06:56,598
you can give people can go a long way so

2188
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:58,000
I'd love opportunity through the equity

2189
01:06:56,599 --> 01:06:59,240
Trade Network to kind of work with these

2190
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,760
other brands in other parts of the

2191
01:06:59,239 --> 01:07:02,118
country and just trying to share the

2192
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:03,960
knowledge that we do have so we can kind

2193
01:07:02,119 --> 01:07:06,160
of all work together which is that's

2194
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:08,838
where the the podcast came from um the

2195
01:07:06,159 --> 01:07:09,879
color in the color in cannabis podcast

2196
01:07:08,838 --> 01:07:11,358
which I should probably be able to say a

2197
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:12,960
little bit easier I've been working on

2198
01:07:11,358 --> 01:07:15,000
for the past year and the idea behind

2199
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:16,639
the podcast was just interviewing other

2200
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:19,559
just folks from different communities

2201
01:07:16,639 --> 01:07:20,960
about their experience in cannabis um I

2202
01:07:19,559 --> 01:07:23,798
think cuz so many of my friends I have

2203
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:25,559
like a a bunch of Arab friends and their

2204
01:07:23,798 --> 01:07:26,920
the pressure they were under from their

2205
01:07:25,559 --> 01:07:28,200
family looks very different than my

2206
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:29,480
Asian friends or looks very different

2207
01:07:28,199 --> 01:07:30,879
than some of my white friends like each

2208
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:32,798
Community kind of has their own

2209
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:35,119
relationship to cannabis I have a friend

2210
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:36,400
that's a her family from Nicaragua and

2211
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:37,920
they're like they're not tripping about

2212
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:39,318
the plant it's just a plant to them it's

2213
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:40,838
a plant it's plant medicine it's

2214
01:07:39,318 --> 01:07:42,679
recreational whatever it is there isn't

2215
01:07:40,838 --> 01:07:44,798
the Judgment attached to it whereas my

2216
01:07:42,679 --> 01:07:46,399
Persian friend it's Haram I mean it's

2217
01:07:44,798 --> 01:07:49,838
all this heavy [ __ ] within his family

2218
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:51,160
about this being a sin and um and so the

2219
01:07:49,838 --> 01:07:52,318
idea of being able to have all these

2220
01:07:51,159 --> 01:07:53,798
different people from these different

2221
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:56,199
backgrounds kind of tell their stories

2222
01:07:53,798 --> 01:07:57,920
and talk about how entrance into

2223
01:07:56,199 --> 01:07:59,278
cannabis how their family and their

2224
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:01,000
their uh their background their ethnic

2225
01:07:59,278 --> 01:08:02,400
background has impacted that that's been

2226
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,920
kind of really interesting and then I

2227
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,160
agree with what you're saying about the

2228
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:06,599
talking to people hearing all these

2229
01:08:05,159 --> 01:08:08,318
different stories and how it gives you

2230
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:09,720
such a fuller view of kind of what

2231
01:08:08,318 --> 01:08:11,759
you're doing and the connections with

2232
01:08:09,719 --> 01:08:13,399
other people and is completely inspired

2233
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:15,000
my business re-inspired my business this

2234
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:16,640
past year working on the podcast just

2235
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,119
again talking to people where they're so

2236
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:20,400
excited about their corner of the

2237
01:08:18,119 --> 01:08:22,039
industry and you're like yeah I do like

2238
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:23,158
it over here I do want to do more of

2239
01:08:22,039 --> 01:08:24,838
this and so that's that's been really a

2240
01:08:23,158 --> 01:08:26,198
lot of fun I get re-inspired weekly you

2241
01:08:24,838 --> 01:08:27,759
know guys like yourself coming on the

2242
01:08:26,198 --> 01:08:29,358
show it's it's always great and you're

2243
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:31,000
so you're on episode number 10 yeah yeah

2244
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:33,319
we just we just launched or just

2245
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:35,039
released episode 10 uh last week it's

2246
01:08:33,319 --> 01:08:36,719
going to be the end of season one we

2247
01:08:35,039 --> 01:08:38,798
have kind of season two lined up have 10

2248
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:40,759
more guests we want to interview and um

2249
01:08:38,798 --> 01:08:43,119
and I have another podcast that's that's

2250
01:08:40,759 --> 01:08:44,520
not just about this as kind of a broader

2251
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:46,278
talking to kind of everyone I know in

2252
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:48,319
the industry kind of a thing right and

2253
01:08:46,279 --> 01:08:50,400
um I I'm more excited kind of about

2254
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:51,719
creating content and media around

2255
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:53,000
cannabis than maybe just selling a

2256
01:08:51,719 --> 01:08:55,158
product right now selling a product is

2257
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,719
really tough and I've talked to so many

2258
01:08:55,158 --> 01:08:58,639
people in other parts of the country who

2259
01:08:56,719 --> 01:09:00,719
just have no idea how any of this works

2260
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:02,199
and there's a hunger to know and again

2261
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:03,480
MJ Biz is one of the things that kind of

2262
01:09:02,198 --> 01:09:04,599
really highlighted that to me there's

2263
01:09:03,479 --> 01:09:06,158
things that we kind of take for granted

2264
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:07,520
we're in California like everyone knows

2265
01:09:06,158 --> 01:09:08,639
these things but when you talk to these

2266
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,120
people in different states or in

2267
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:11,560
different countries they they don't have

2268
01:09:10,119 --> 01:09:13,599
the experience that we have they haven't

2269
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:15,359
seen 50 other businesses fail going down

2270
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:16,359
the same road so that we do have

2271
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:17,719
something that's really important to

2272
01:09:16,359 --> 01:09:19,400
share with all these other people and

2273
01:09:17,719 --> 01:09:21,198
again there's a hunger to know and so

2274
01:09:19,399 --> 01:09:22,798
it's been really exciting being able to

2275
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:24,000
offer that or deliver that and just get

2276
01:09:22,798 --> 01:09:25,079
to know people better and now I'm

2277
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,119
talking to people on the other side of

2278
01:09:25,079 --> 01:09:27,559
the country because they've been

2279
01:09:26,119 --> 01:09:28,838
watching it it's just increased the

2280
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:30,120
conversations I'm had and the networking

2281
01:09:28,838 --> 01:09:32,039

2289
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:45,960
experiences of my life 10 years ago was

go I see these pictures I'm like [ __ ] I

2296
01:09:55,439 --> 01:09:59,000
love being in spaces where the English

2297
01:09:57,238 --> 01:10:00,000
isn't the primary Lang language spoken

2298
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,840
and I'd love to be able to do that

2299
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,198
around cannabis like just be it's it's

2300
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:04,520
so wonderful that we can do that you

2301
01:10:03,198 --> 01:10:05,879
know it's like CU because it's the one

2302
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:07,600
thing that brings us together and people

2303
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:09,679
from all different walks of life getting

2304
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:11,079
together around a plant yeah and having

2305
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:14,000
that same conversation because they love

2306
01:10:11,079 --> 01:10:16,640
the plant I I I have several times I

2307
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,238
have some friends in in the device space

2308
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:19,760
and I've often been like maybe I should

2309
01:10:18,238 --> 01:10:21,039
just get a job with you because you guys

2310
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:22,679
get to go everywhere and you guys get to

2311
01:10:21,039 --> 01:10:25,039
do all the cool stuff and I'm stuck here

2312
01:10:22,679 --> 01:10:26,520
in [ __ ] Cali I I love California but

2313
01:10:25,039 --> 01:10:27,800
like I want to go to Germany I want to

2314
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:30,239
go to Argentina there's all these

2315
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:32,159
amazing places to go so Brazil just in

2316
01:10:30,238 --> 01:10:34,119
Brazil yeah but again that's actually

2317
01:10:32,158 --> 01:10:35,479
part of the motivation with that podcast

2318
01:10:34,119 --> 01:10:37,359
too is realizing that there's all these

2319
01:10:35,479 --> 01:10:39,279
Amazing Stories here but around the

2320
01:10:37,359 --> 01:10:40,880
world I mean cannabis is a multicultural

2321
01:10:39,279 --> 01:10:42,399
activity and I'd love to talk to people

2322
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,880
in Thailand about what their

2323
01:10:42,399 --> 01:10:45,039
relationship to cannabis is and people

2324
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:46,640
have been farming like multiple

2325
01:10:45,039 --> 01:10:49,079
Generations in other countries and what

2326
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:50,840
that looks like India that got go that's

2327
01:10:49,079 --> 01:10:53,079
the home of it you know I mean to be be

2328
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:55,760
able to see something that far back I I

2329
01:10:53,079 --> 01:10:56,920
very um I enjoy Indian culture I

2330
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:58,199
appreciate Indian culture I went to a

2331
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:59,880
Buddhist school for a long time and so

2332
01:10:58,198 --> 01:11:01,158
like I really resonate with a lot of

2333
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:03,400
things that are happening over there and

2334
01:11:01,158 --> 01:11:05,198
so I'd love to actually be able to try

2335
01:11:03,399 --> 01:11:07,158
like the native products and just be

2336
01:11:05,198 --> 01:11:09,799

bet Beyond bomb xra it's so funny how

2343
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:24,880
everything comes full circle but the guy

2344
01:11:22,198 --> 01:11:27,519
from Beyond bomb good friend he used to

2345

2349
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:38,280
talking to somebody about Mickey Martin

2350
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:41,119
the other day and just all the old

2351
01:11:38,279 --> 01:11:42,880
school products and just him yeah

2352
01:11:41,119 --> 01:11:45,198
tainted and Beyond bomb were the two big

2353
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:48,039
companies that yeah that are off the you

2354
01:11:45,198 --> 01:11:49,960
I I think 2005 they were done that's sad

2355
01:11:48,039 --> 01:11:51,639
but you know Trailblazers often

2356
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:53,119
Trailblazers pushing the envelope

2357
01:11:51,639 --> 01:11:54,359
someone has to do it yeah they do and

2358
01:11:53,119 --> 01:11:55,840
they do good work and so I'm just

2359
01:11:54,359 --> 01:11:58,679
excited about where things are are going

2360
01:11:55,840 --> 01:12:01,400
I um excited about new products excited

2361
01:11:58,679 --> 01:12:02,960
to be in the space yeah I mean it's

2362
01:12:01,399 --> 01:12:04,638
exciting times and you know when it's

2363
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:06,119
volatile is when it's exciting you know

2364
01:12:04,639 --> 01:12:08,520
once it's stabilizes it's not going to

2365
01:12:06,119 --> 01:12:10,840
be it'll be exciting in other ways but

2366
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:12,239
the volatility yeah you know well that's

2367
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:13,760
where the real money is I think if you

2368
01:12:12,238 --> 01:12:15,238
want to make a lot of money you go into

2369
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:17,000
that state that has an emerging market

2370
01:12:15,238 --> 01:12:18,879
and you just kind of explode in there

2371
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,679
and be the risk taker but we both know a

2372
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:23,359
lot of people who were that person they

2373
01:12:20,679 --> 01:12:26,000
went to jail like I know several people

2374
01:12:23,359 --> 01:12:27,519
and it's really it's uh it's like I like

2375
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:30,039
opportunity but I don't like the sound

2376
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:32,600
of federal prison no we've had we've had

2377

Luke scarmazzo and rich delisi on the

2378

2380
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:40,320

2381
01:12:38,359 --> 01:12:42,439

like 6 months which is that doesn't ever

2391
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:01,158
happen with the feds right but just um

2392
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,920
but just talking to him and Evelyn both

2393
01:13:01,158 --> 01:13:04,879
people have interviewed and hearing how

2394
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:06,520
they were doing everything right and

2395
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:08,000
then you still wind up in jail like I

2396
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:09,679
don't think people realize when they

2397
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,880
hear about like how important de

2398
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:13,840
criminalization is that it's not just

2399
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:14,760
like some Street dealer that got busted

2400
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:16,560
doing something they shouldn't have been

2401
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:18,079
doing people have done everything right

2402
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,600
and they still get persecuted by the

2403
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:21,840
feds and they still wind up going to

2404
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:23,320
prison and it's just just not right yeah

2405
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:25,800
we live in a backwards World in a lot of

2406
01:13:23,319 --> 01:13:27,519
ways yeah but there's there's time for

2407
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:29,960
change and then we're here now I mean

2408
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:31,639
like yeah you know I remember like

2409
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:33,079
hearing about don't drive through Texas

2410
01:13:31,639 --> 01:13:34,840
because if they catch it with one seed

2411
01:13:33,079 --> 01:13:36,559
you're going toison I'm saying this we'd

2412
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:38,440
be in jail for next thousand years over

2413
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:39,800
here so I'm just seeing like and I love

2414

01:13:50,319 --> 01:13:53,719
these things can be successful and

2421
01:13:52,039 --> 01:13:55,439
thriving in this but not all thriving

2422
01:13:53,719 --> 01:13:57,000
but that we can be here and be doing is

2423
01:13:55,439 --> 01:14:00,000
be working with this plant it's an

2424
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,359

2427
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:06,520
some of the stuff I got here we got all

2428
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:09,079
kinds of good stuff all right I have I

2429
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:11,199
brought some of the Zava some live rosin

2430
01:14:09,079 --> 01:14:13,319
that we just did um I wasn't thinking

2431
01:14:11,198 --> 01:14:15,638
when I left and and then like oh yeah I

2432
01:14:13,319 --> 01:14:19,000
should have product with me so I there's

2433
01:14:15,639 --> 01:14:20,359
not a lot OFA in there and um and then I

2434
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,920
just brought I had some random stuff

2435
01:14:20,359 --> 01:14:23,759
around the house but I have a lot of

2436
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:25,960
goodies I've been working with uh the

2437
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:27,440
folks at Kalia yeah recently and so I've

2438
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:28,880
been getting some goodies from Mark up

2439
01:14:27,439 --> 01:14:30,799
there that's actually where we got our

2440
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:33,359
rosin from recently and then we're going

2441
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:34,840
to we're we're thinking about opening up

2442
01:14:33,359 --> 01:14:36,439
manufacturing from different places I've

2443
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:38,520
always wanted Tran to have his hand on

2444
01:14:36,439 --> 01:14:40,638
it kind of a thing but the opportunity

2445
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:42,600
to get things from Kalia is like

2446
01:14:40,639 --> 01:14:44,079
unbelievable and the fact that Mark and

2447
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:46,000
his team have been so generous with just

2448
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:47,920
here this is amazing you thinking people

2449
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,238
like it and giving it to us at a number

2450
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:51,199
that we can still deliver it at our

2451
01:14:49,238 --> 01:14:55,158
normal like super cheap price is [ __ ]

2452
01:14:51,198 --> 01:14:57,279
awesome right and so um I still like

2453
01:14:55,158 --> 01:15:00,359
good BHO I I'm

2454
01:14:57,279 --> 01:15:04,079
sorry uh but really good uh you know

2455
01:15:00,359 --> 01:15:05,839
live resin yeah good B is phenomenal

2456
01:15:04,079 --> 01:15:07,960
just most people haven't had it yeah

2457
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:09,920
exactly at various points I've because

2458
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:11,679
the market for it got crumbled because

2459
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:13,960
there's cured resin which is cheaper and

2460
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:16,440
whatever and so I keep thinking about

2461
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:17,719
like not not putting out live resin

2462
01:15:16,439 --> 01:15:18,599
anymore at all just because we're

2463
01:15:17,719 --> 01:15:20,198
competing against people that are

2464
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:21,719
selling it for $5 a gram like what are

2465
01:15:20,198 --> 01:15:24,319
we really doing oh yeah but then every

2466
01:15:21,719 --> 01:15:25,880
once in a while I'll run into someone

2467
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:27,840
and it'll be like oh my God that's so

2468
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:30,079
good that's that's why we we got excited

2469
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:32,079
about this thing like I I for a while I

2470
01:15:30,079 --> 01:15:33,319
thought it was it was the fact that

2471
01:15:32,079 --> 01:15:35,000
everything was coming through the Clos

2472
01:15:33,319 --> 01:15:37,238
Loop systems and maybe the Clos Loop

2473
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:40,198
systems couldn't replicate open blasting

2474
01:15:37,238 --> 01:15:41,559
but recently from Mark he gave me some

2475
01:15:40,198 --> 01:15:43,158
live resin that I would have swore was

2476
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:46,520
rosin like there's no way that that was

2477
01:15:43,158 --> 01:15:50,359
that was B so turpy it and it was so

2478
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:51,840
100% the plant like 100% plant and it

2479
01:15:50,359 --> 01:15:53,599
was kind of creamy and [ __ ] I'm like

2480
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:55,119
what are you guys doing but they tweaked

2481
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:57,440
the machines and they're doing us

2482
01:15:55,119 --> 01:16:00,039
Alchemy in the back and so anytime I

2483
01:15:57,439 --> 01:16:02,439
think I don't like a class of products

2484
01:16:00,039 --> 01:16:03,600
like backup weight cuz actually I do

2485
01:16:02,439 --> 01:16:04,799
that with it happens with rosin all the

2486
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:06,560
time because I like flour I like smoking

2487
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:08,520
joints I'm about to Smoke Joint and I

2488
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:10,480
have a friend of mine Jess she's a buyer

2489
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:11,960
at Pharmacy she's like are you dabbing

2490
01:16:10,479 --> 01:16:13,879
like I'm like [ __ ] a dab I'm smoking my

2491
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:15,359
joint she like shut up Taran and she'll

2492
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:16,960
put something in my little rig and I'll

2493
01:16:15,359 --> 01:16:20,079
be like okay you're right I forgot how

2494
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:24,480
good it can really be oh yeah be

2495
01:16:20,079 --> 01:16:25,679
reminded yeah candy yeah Jesus zle is

2496
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:27,119
the real thing here's some of the white

2497
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:30,319
Thorns Z I got some of that from Mark

2498
01:16:27,119 --> 01:16:31,920
the other day my absolute favorite so so

2499
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:35,000
I got an idea with the white Thorn for

2500
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:38,719
cream soda would be amazing yeah it

2501
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:40,760
really love try yeah yeah and then the

2502
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:43,039
second I think that something isn't good

2503
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:45,920
they figure out how to make it better it

2504
01:16:43,039 --> 01:16:48,000
doesn't matter with LED lights I can't

2505
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:49,440
believe that shit's working I mean

2506
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,319
because I used I used to grow 10 years

2507
01:16:49,439 --> 01:16:52,839
ago and LED lights were a joke and they

2508
01:16:51,319 --> 01:16:55,759
someone would always come around BL

2509
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:57,440
right so the blurp sucked yeah and we've

2510
01:16:55,760 --> 01:17:01,639
come a long way since the

2511
01:16:57,439 --> 01:17:03,839
blurp uh big shout out to all these

2512
01:17:01,639 --> 01:17:06,000
lighting companies you know I think

2513
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:07,679
there's 80 big lighting companies or I

2514
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,960
wouldn't say big but there's 80 lighting

2515
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:10,639
companies and there's only four

2516
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:12,600
factories or something like that but

2517
01:17:10,639 --> 01:17:14,319
yeah LED has come a long way Spectrum

2518
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:16,320
tuning now you can dial in your own

2519
01:17:14,319 --> 01:17:17,599
Spectrum you can screw up your plants

2520
01:17:16,319 --> 01:17:19,279
that way too which is a great way to

2521
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:21,000
screw up your plants having relearn from

2522
01:17:19,279 --> 01:17:25,238

and energy and it was a time of such

2611
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:29,800

quality being like it is today like the

2617

day there was some fire yeah like some

2620
01:20:43,719 --> 01:20:46,800
really special stuff too and stuff where

2621
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:48,280
you would only see at one time in your

2622
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:50,760
life we had some stuff called the

2623
01:20:48,279 --> 01:20:52,399
spaceship that we had for a while that

2624
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:56,600
was really really phenomenal and the

2625
01:20:52,399 --> 01:20:58,879
shaman okay the shaman in in fact the

2626
01:20:56,600 --> 01:21:00,639
shaman was one of the things that really

2627
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:02,480
got me excited about breeding CU my

2628
01:21:00,639 --> 01:21:03,679
friend bred the shaman it was a shaman

2629
01:21:02,479 --> 01:21:05,119
it should have been called the shaman

2630
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:08,440
because it was Shaman times the Romulan

2631
01:21:05,119 --> 01:21:10,760
back to the shaman was a back cross and

2632
01:21:08,439 --> 01:21:13,479
it was just so good and it was purple

2633
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:14,840
and it was strong and it was Hey and it

2634
01:21:13,479 --> 01:21:18,039
was turpy

2635
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:19,760
mhm um here some Ray Congo batter or Ray

2636
01:21:18,039 --> 01:21:22,198
cono oil at this point it's been around

2637
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:24,000
way too long but anything Congo we hold

2638
01:21:22,198 --> 01:21:25,439
on to it think for that's stuff that I

2639
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,639
would put in my freezer you know I have

2640
01:21:25,439 --> 01:21:29,399
a little freezer stash and that has I

2641
01:21:27,639 --> 01:21:33,000
don't know a few different kinds we got

2642
01:21:29,399 --> 01:21:36,238
we got jars in there yeah yeah oh

2643
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:38,880
wow I love the Congo I love the Congo

2644
01:21:36,238 --> 01:21:40,638
this smells like tree sap it's so good

2645
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:42,359
it's got its own unique and those things

2646
01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:44,719
have their it's not like the terpinolene

2647
01:21:42,359 --> 01:21:46,679
limine or terpinolene line that most

2648
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:50,000
people think of as Haze it's like it's

2649
01:21:46,679 --> 01:21:53,039
got its own Funk like real good Durban

2650
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:55,039
it wasn't super hazy it was real funky

2651
01:21:53,039 --> 01:21:56,880
and musky

2652
01:21:55,039 --> 01:21:59,079
and you know it has its own thing with

2653
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:00,880
like the anise in it the current one is

2654
01:21:59,079 --> 01:22:02,920
really like I love Durban it's one of my

2655
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:04,800
favorite strains but like I know the

2656
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:07,399
Durban I'm smoking now is not the Durban

2657
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:08,679
that I I smoked like 10 years ago no

2658
01:22:07,399 --> 01:22:10,399
same thing with Lamb's bread like I

2659
01:22:08,679 --> 01:22:12,520
don't see it that often and but Lambs

2660
01:22:10,399 --> 01:22:14,158
bread L is the most unique thing though

2661
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:16,440
it's that's a Musky one right I feel

2662
01:22:14,158 --> 01:22:18,158
like Lambs bread is extremely mus mus

2663
01:22:16,439 --> 01:22:19,839
funky and mus almost cheesy but yeah

2664
01:22:18,158 --> 01:22:21,119
definitely almost cheesy for sure and

2665
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:22,520
the real one it's like I've smelled it

2666
01:22:21,119 --> 01:22:24,000
in other other people's crosses where

2667
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:26,080
they have that expression on the nose

2668
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:28,479
where you're like Lamb's bread yeah

2669
01:22:26,079 --> 01:22:30,319
Shane Sunny chba my my buddy he was at

2670
01:22:28,479 --> 01:22:32,079
Harbor Side and he they were pheno

2671
01:22:30,319 --> 01:22:33,920
hunting 20,000 plants and he took me

2672
01:22:32,079 --> 01:22:35,279
over to the Lamb's bread crosses and

2673
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:38,158
they all smelled like Lambs bread like

2674
01:22:35,279 --> 01:22:40,158
they had that distinct musky nose

2675
01:22:38,158 --> 01:22:42,519
funkiness like you know it's like and

2676
01:22:40,158 --> 01:22:43,719
it's really hard to describe if you've

2677
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:45,639
never spelled it but it's one of those

2678
01:22:43,719 --> 01:22:46,960
things if you smelled it and you smell

2679
01:22:45,639 --> 01:22:48,920
it again you'll remember that the rest

2680
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:51,560
of your life yeah I missed that I feel

2681
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:53,359
like just the way the Advent of purples

2682
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:54,760
really kind of hurt indicas in general

2683
01:22:53,359 --> 01:22:57,039
because people started obsessing about

2684
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:59,079
color I feel like uh the same thing has

2685
01:22:57,039 --> 01:23:00,679
happened with this candy gas Obsession

2686
01:22:59,079 --> 01:23:02,679
like it's great but it's like we're

2687
01:23:00,679 --> 01:23:04,880
losing so many things because that's the

2688
01:23:02,679 --> 01:23:07,079
wave and again as quickly as I say that

2689
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:09,000
I will admit every single time somebody

2690
01:23:07,079 --> 01:23:11,519
hands me a Lemon Cherry gelato I'm like

2691
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:12,600
damn that tastes good so I'm embarrassed

2692
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:14,080
just like the white Thorn I'm

2693
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:16,280
embarrassed that I'd like something like

2694
01:23:14,079 --> 01:23:18,079
that's so common and so pedestrian but

2695
01:23:16,279 --> 01:23:20,119
great flavor profiles are great for a

2696
01:23:18,079 --> 01:23:22,119
reason well it's funny cuz if the if

2697
01:23:20,119 --> 01:23:23,519
white Thorn wasn't popular you would

2698
01:23:22,119 --> 01:23:26,319
still like it the same oh yeah for sure

2699
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:27,440
I don't care yeah with lcg if it was I

2700
01:23:26,319 --> 01:23:29,238
don't care what you call it I just like

2701
01:23:27,439 --> 01:23:30,919
it yeah Sunset sherbet some people were

2702
01:23:29,238 --> 01:23:32,839
like hating on Sunset sherbet last week

2703
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:34,679
and I'm like dude how can you hate on

2704
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:35,960
like real good Sunset sherbet I think

2705
01:23:34,679 --> 01:23:36,800
they haven't had it is the issue I feel

2706
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:38,920
like you don't know what you're talking

2707
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:42,159
about if if you hate on Sunset sherbet

2708
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:43,760
like it it never got its day but it's

2709
01:23:42,158 --> 01:23:44,879
just as good if not better I like it

2710
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:47,440
better than the

2711
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:49,600
gelato but it's its own unique thing and

2712
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:51,079
it's like really good [ __ ] Sunset

2713
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:53,480
sherbet is some of the best stuff out

2714
01:23:51,079 --> 01:23:55,479
there yeah and it's it's so like it's

2715
01:23:53,479 --> 01:23:57,439
grower by grower is batch by batch I

2716
01:23:55,479 --> 01:23:59,119
think when people I hear people hate on

2717
01:23:57,439 --> 01:24:00,479
a classic I just like you probably

2718
01:23:59,119 --> 01:24:03,679
haven't had the real version like you

2719
01:24:00,479 --> 01:24:05,599
had some water down BS where it Jack I

2720
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:07,719
get hating on Jack because so much Jack

2721
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:09,520
bad Jack went around but if you only

2722
01:24:07,719 --> 01:24:11,239
think Jack is like something that's very

2723
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:13,440
linear you didn't get really good Jack

2724
01:24:11,238 --> 01:24:17,638
because the Jack back in the day was

2725
01:24:13,439 --> 01:24:19,279
strong complex had amazing flavor uh but

2726
01:24:17,639 --> 01:24:21,079
it's not the jack that most people think

2727
01:24:19,279 --> 01:24:22,519
of as Jack today and I think there's so

2728
01:24:21,079 --> 01:24:24,760
many things like that train wreck real

2729
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:26,040
train wreck is phenomenal strong real

2730
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:27,400
train record that's one of the few

2731
01:24:26,039 --> 01:24:29,359
strains where I've smoked it where it

2732
01:24:27,399 --> 01:24:31,039
was like too strong like I had to put it

2733
01:24:29,359 --> 01:24:32,399
down and kind of relax a little bit like

2734
01:24:31,039 --> 01:24:33,479
the true vers like there's a reason why

2735
01:24:32,399 --> 01:24:35,439
it was called train wreck like people

2736
01:24:33,479 --> 01:24:37,879
think these things are games like a real

2737
01:24:35,439 --> 01:24:39,439
AK-47 would do something to you and

2738
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:40,639
people just again they got the watered

2739
01:24:39,439 --> 01:24:42,960
down version of it and they don't know

2740
01:24:40,639 --> 01:24:44,880
the real expression yeah I like a lot of

2741
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:48,079
the old stuff I just it's you don't see

2742
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:49,560
people growing it to the full capability

2743
01:24:48,079 --> 01:24:50,960
you know I feel like people aren't

2744
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:52,760
pushing it as hard as they used to and

2745
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:54,399
there was there was more of it but I

2746
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:55,520
feel like there was also less Growers

2747
01:24:54,399 --> 01:24:57,000
and there was more passionate people it

2748
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:59,719
was illegal for one thing you're taking

2749
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:03,319
big risks and so you had to have bigger

2750
01:24:59,719 --> 01:25:04,800
balls yeah and also there was mids back

2751
01:25:03,319 --> 01:25:06,399
then yeah absolutely there was

2752
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:08,039
absolutely mids you know besides the

2753
01:25:06,399 --> 01:25:09,519
Mexican dirt weed there was people that

2754
01:25:08,039 --> 01:25:11,000
grew mids that thought it was amazing a

2755
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:12,280
lot everyone thought there we yeah yeah

2756
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,560
yeah I mean everything that not

2757
01:25:12,279 --> 01:25:15,840
everything but so much what came out of

2758
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:17,760
BC for us was mids although I was when I

2759
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:19,360
lived in Seattle I had phenomenal things

2760
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:22,159
coming out of Vancouver that would just

2761
01:25:19,359 --> 01:25:24,359
m your face then by the time you get it

2762
01:25:22,158 --> 01:25:25,719
get got down to here it was BC Buds and

2763
01:25:24,359 --> 01:25:27,319
it was just it was a dirty work yeah it

2764
01:25:25,719 --> 01:25:29,079
was a pound that was this big you can

2765
01:25:27,319 --> 01:25:31,399
play football with it you know it's not

2766
01:25:29,079 --> 01:25:33,238
you know I I think they would Smash It

2767
01:25:31,399 --> 01:25:36,439
and they would use O3 to get rid of the

2768
01:25:33,238 --> 01:25:37,959
smell so it all smelled kind of like hey

2769
01:25:36,439 --> 01:25:39,238
um but that wasn't necessarily the good

2770
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:40,960
stuff that was just the stuff that was

2771
01:25:39,238 --> 01:25:42,759
floating around yeah I would uh when I

2772
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:44,319
lived I lived in uh I went to Evergreen

2773
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:45,920
State College for my last year of uh

2774
01:25:44,319 --> 01:25:48,559
College last couple years of college and

2775
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:51,679
we spent a lot of time in Seattle and um

2776
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:53,320
I remember getting weed from people like

2777
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:55,000
kind of like I guess like humble I'd

2778
01:25:53,319 --> 01:25:57,198
find people they'd still weed out of a

2779
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:59,319
duffel bag but it would be like

2780
01:25:57,198 --> 01:26:00,759
phenomenal it would be this phenomenal

2781
01:25:59,319 --> 01:26:02,279
indoor I don't know where the hell this

2782
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:03,520
[ __ ] came from and they're just like

2783
01:26:02,279 --> 01:26:04,920
stick your hand in and take whatever you

2784
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:06,199
want and I'm just like I'm from Oakland

2785
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:08,118
I'm like I'm not sticking my hand in

2786
01:26:06,198 --> 01:26:10,000
[ __ ] like I don't I I can't wrap my

2787
01:26:08,118 --> 01:26:11,439
brain around this but we would get such

2788
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,399
amazing weed and it was from these

2789
01:26:11,439 --> 01:26:17,719
little weed nerds like I got weed up

2790
01:26:13,399 --> 01:26:21,079
there that it I didn't I'm this is uh

2791
01:26:17,719 --> 01:26:22,880
9798 99 there's weed that I got randomly

2792
01:26:21,079 --> 01:26:24,399
from dudes at this this one particular

2793
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:26,639
coffee shop in Seattle that's probably

2794
01:26:24,399 --> 01:26:27,920
still not not there anymore like and it

2795
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:29,440
was better than anything I've had

2796
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:31,840
probably since I mean it was just

2797
01:26:29,439 --> 01:26:34,079
phenomenal I work in Seattle I love

2798
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:36,520
Seattle always been weed nerds up there

2799
01:26:34,079 --> 01:26:37,800
and those kids are geniuses this some

2800
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:39,719
[ __ ] supposedly the [ __ ] that came from

2801
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:41,480
udubb or whatever all the stories about

2802
01:26:39,719 --> 01:26:42,840
all that nonsense and all that and all

2803
01:26:41,479 --> 01:26:44,359
the stuff coming down from Alaska and

2804
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:46,000
all the stories about that and all that

2805
01:26:44,359 --> 01:26:47,158
stuff it was it was phenomenal

2806
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:51,399
permafrost I don't know if you remember

2807
01:26:47,158 --> 01:26:53,759
permafrost from up there but ATF ATF ATF

2808
01:26:51,399 --> 01:26:55,638
and then before is ATF I mean when I

2809
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:57,600
first heard ATF it was matusan Thunder

2810
01:26:55,639 --> 01:26:59,679
[ __ ] there was yeah they had both I I

2811
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:01,920
think I remember Alaskan first but then

2812
01:26:59,679 --> 01:27:03,960
I remember both the matusa and the

2813
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:05,399
Alaskan Thunder I wasn't sure what came

2814
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:06,639
I just remember just like and then you

2815
01:27:05,399 --> 01:27:08,279
found it and you're like okay this is

2816
01:27:06,639 --> 01:27:11,440
why this is the thing yeah Seattle had

2817
01:27:08,279 --> 01:27:12,800
good flower it was just really hard if

2818
01:27:11,439 --> 01:27:15,919
you lived in Seattle and you were

2819
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:17,800
cultivating it was hard to keep your bud

2820
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:19,440
nice because of the humidity yeah and it

2821
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:20,880
was always super humid during the winter

2822
01:27:19,439 --> 01:27:22,799
especially and I mean I think their

2823
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:25,118
summers are drier now than I think they

2824
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:26,719
typically were but higher humidity

2825
01:27:25,118 --> 01:27:31,279
environments it

2826
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:34,118
requires uh indoor trimming indoor uh

2827
01:27:31,279 --> 01:27:35,759
basically storage and then if you're

2828
01:27:34,118 --> 01:27:37,599
like dispensing it you need to have some

2829
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:39,560
sort of bag or seal on it and then every

2830
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:41,039
time you open the jar you got to shut it

2831
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:42,920
right away otherwise your Bud's going to

2832
01:27:41,039 --> 01:27:45,600
get soggy right because it'll absorb all

2833
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:47,840
that moisture and humidity plays a huge

2834
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:49,440
role in the quality of your flour

2835
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:51,480
chirpin are volatile they'll go away as

2836
01:27:49,439 --> 01:27:55,158
soon as it gets humid again and you dry

2837
01:27:51,479 --> 01:27:57,198
it out then get it humid it's even worse

2838
01:27:55,158 --> 01:27:59,599
yeah I had a lot of wet weed up there

2839
01:27:57,198 --> 01:28:01,039
not even just wet just not not dry

2840
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:02,600
exactly it wasn't dry and crispy it was

2841
01:28:01,039 --> 01:28:04,238
just soft I think it was pretty part of

2842
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:06,719
the it was part of like how it was it

2843
01:28:04,238 --> 01:28:08,079
was just most people had spongy flour

2844
01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:09,359
they trying to roll a joint with it of

2845
01:28:08,079 --> 01:28:10,760
the shitty little papers because it

2846
01:28:09,359 --> 01:28:12,079
wasn't a good paper selection back in

2847
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:15,039
the day

2848
