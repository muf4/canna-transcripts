here we've been talking about doing this

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,719
for a while I'm glad we finally got to

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,560
catch up yeah it's awesome I remember

11
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:32,200
being here like a year and a half ago

12
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:34,320
two years years time flies when you

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,000
first had it and it's just looking

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,960
amazing building a facility is no joke

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,119
people don't understand it takes twice

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,039
as much money and takes twice as long as

17
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:45,439
you typically start out thinking it's

18
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:47,840
going to so true and when you want to do

19
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:50,679
it right you're a long game person and

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,480
so am I right and so you take your time

21
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:57,159
slow and steady 100% and develop it

22
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:58,718
proper and uh good things take time so

23
00:00:57,159 --> 00:01:01,319
very happy for you James though it's

24
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,719
looking good in here life's an adventure

25
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,118
it's about it's about the journey not

26
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,280
the destination you know cuz the

27
00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:09,478
destination is death true no one gets

28
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,680
out of here alive no well that not that

29
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:13,560
we know of yeah right my favorite

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,759
teacher says it's all about becoming the

31
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,000
master dancer so you can dance with

32
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,118
everything that life throws at you yeah

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,879
and it's just a dance you know there's

34
00:01:20,118 --> 00:01:26,319
all kinds of dances for sure but yeah um

35
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:29,438
I think enduring pain and appreciating

36
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,959
the struggle is part of the journey and

37
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:32,879
as I've got older that's the one thing

38
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:36,719
I've learned is the struggle is where

39
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:38,798
it's at yeah I just did a video about it

40
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:41,359
about how the worthy opponent or the

41
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,600
worthy Tyrant or things that cross us or

42
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:46,718
challenge us yeah is actually what

43
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:50,078
brings out our greatest Soul expression

44
00:01:46,718 --> 00:01:52,679
sure and you don't run from it there's a

45
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:55,118
sense I'm almost 50 I'm 47 and so I've

46
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:58,159
been feeling also that same thing where

47
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:59,959
you kind of lean into it the pain and

48
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,759
the challenge and the intensity because

49
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:04,000
you know what's coming is the same I

50
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:05,478
always say that the measure of the

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,599
challenge matches the measure of the

52
00:02:05,478 --> 00:02:11,038
gift your enemies make you stronger they

53
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:13,439
do y they do and so in that I think in

54
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:16,238
that mentality you can be a Victor in

55
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:19,079
every situation never a victim

56
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,200
absolutely yeah yeah that's very cool

57
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,480
yeah getting older has

58
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:26,359
it it's so funny because getting older

59
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:29,079
definitely has its benefits too I mean

60
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,560
when I was younger when I was 18 I

61
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,920
thought the

62
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,640
age I'm at right now was so old and now

63
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:37,479
that I'm at that age I'm like it's not

64
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:40,479
that old but I know we're the same age

65
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:42,280
too so it's funny I know it's a trip I

66
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:44,280
mean I think that cannabis Keeps Us

67
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,878
young even though I say that the

68
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,120
Cannabis industry ages you in dog years

69
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:52,679
sure and I definitely look a lot older

70
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,319
than when we first met yeah um but I

71
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,159
also think there's a sense of

72
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:58,759
youthfulness that comes from just being

73
00:02:57,158 --> 00:03:00,400
with the plant and the kind of the

74
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:03,399
Purity not all the B [ __ ] of the

75
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,680
industry but the Purity yeah of that

76
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:09,039
passion for the plant as you always do

77
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:12,200
your hashtag that's what keeps us young

78
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:15,079
and vibrant and connected and

79
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:16,878
enthusiastic yeah I think we're blessed

80
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,440
in to be in an industry that you can be

81
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:20,120
extremely passionate about and I think

82
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:22,359
the more you put into it the more you

83
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,519
get back and whatever you do in life if

84
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,920
you're passionate about it you're going

85
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:31,080
to be good at it good at it at a certain

86
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:32,958
point I think so yeah just continue

87
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,719
see yeah it's it's all about

88
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,519
perseverance it's all about not stopping

89
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:41,000
yeah this industry is rough is people

90
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:43,840
are like you know how the [ __ ] you know

91
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,239
do you do this with the magazine and you

92
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,000
know I just say don't stop yeah because

93
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,360
no matter what happens if you don't stop

94
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,360
and you stay consistent you're going to

95
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,400
hit your mark and yeah I'm definitely

96
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,799
feeling that and experiencing that and

97
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,879
it's like you're you're your own

98
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:04,079
constant yeah you're your own Center in

99
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:06,840
the storm not circumstance not people

100
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:08,239
not situations it's you yeah and I feel

101
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,039
like that's also the kind of deep

102
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,959
Medicine of the plant too and I'm

103
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:15,158
finding that in business kind of very

104
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:17,639
cool that the spiritual and the business

105
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:19,120
are merging into one and and that's what

106
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:21,478
I feel the Renaissance that I always

107
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,800
talk about is about yeah that was going

108
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:24,758
to be the subject for the podcast was

109
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,759
the green Renaissance cuz I think you

110
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:30,800
you coined that term

111
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:32,280
and a large majority of the industry

112
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,160
definitely can relate to the green

113
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:36,679
Renaissance movement especially the the

114
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,880
people in the industry that were here

115
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,800
before

116
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:43,719
legalization that they even before you

117
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,759
know Pro 215 in medical but like that

118
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,840
green Renaissance movement which it is

119
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:50,319
you know I think there's a lot of us

120
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:53,359
that can relate to that I mean the newer

121
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:55,360
generation maybe they see it but they

122
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,840
aren't necessarily the ones who created

123
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,960
it they can jump on board right right

124
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:02,638
right yeah no I mean it's pretty

125
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:05,758
profound James because you know I became

126
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,478
a certified herbalist 26 years ago and

127
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:11,759
that's when I got key into just from my

128
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:15,000
background with art and culture and

129
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,600
studying Global theologies you know I

130
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,918
felt as a young woman that you know

131
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,639
Mother Earth was propagating

132
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:23,478
Consciousness with her plants and I saw

133
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:25,000
that the Psychedelic movement and the

134
00:05:23,478 --> 00:05:27,240
Canabis movement the counterculture

135
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,759
movement in general over the last

136
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,918
century and a quarter was really about

137
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,160
these kind of counterculture Rebels

138
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:36,959
through time that were pushing the

139
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,160
envelope open and what the commonality

140
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:40,638
was was working with the plants right

141
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,800
and the plants opening up their

142
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,560
Consciousness and then I found it really

143
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,960
fascinating that a lot of these people

144
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,918
ended up being Visionaries who were

145
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:52,198
creating new styles of business new

146
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:54,680
styles of companies and how companies

147
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:58,000
you know the idea of conscious Commerce

148
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:00,600
or sacred Commerce that started emerging

149
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,360
from the hippies and you know it's just

150
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,039
carrying through time and the hippies

151
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,120
and the yippies yeah exactly and so you

152
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:09,959
know 12 years ago when I came into skunk

153
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,879
and I had the opportunity to really coin

154
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:14,318
it um I wanted to contrast that the

155
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:15,918
green Rush even though we were all

156
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,080
dealing with it and are still dealing

157
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:20,799
with it and we'll be dealing with it for

158
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:23,959
the next 10 20 years as prohibition

159
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,639
fully ends and we deal with the Quagmire

160
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:27,519
of

161
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,160
legalization I just kept feeling like we

162
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:31,079
need to talk about the Renaissance we

163
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,680
need to talk about what's actually

164
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:35,198
happening that we're in the midst of a

165
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,680
second Renaissance and back then it was

166
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:41,038
like who's this crazy [ __ ] [ __ ]

167
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,400
talking about a Renaissance yeah but now

168
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:45,680
oh my goodness it's like extremely

169
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:48,359
relevant and everybody that I'm speaking

170
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,800
to no matter where I go in the world is

171
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,199
feeling it and seeing it and that's been

172
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,199
really profound it's almost as big as

173
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,680
the separation between the right and the

174
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:01,000
left right because I feel like we were

175
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:04,680
all Blended more so before

176
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,598
2020 and then covid happened and there

177
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,759
was this big separation and I feel like

178
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:10,279
that

179
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,319
separation uh left and right it's not

180
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:15,598
the same as with the green Renaissance

181
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:18,080
it's you know but it is there it is and

182
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:20,639
there is a separation there's a sh

183
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:23,120
you're seeing it more so because I feel

184
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,598
like everybody before

185
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,560
2018 was really part of that movement

186
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:30,439
right to build it up it was illegal

187
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,720
people were pushing boundaries and now

188
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:34,839
we're seeing people that are in it for

189
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,759
the money or people that never saw that

190
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:38,478
side of it they never saw the struggle

191
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:41,560
they never saw people going to jail for

192
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:43,318
20 years or 40 years or whatever it is

193
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:46,399
right and so there's a different

194
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:48,919
perspective and I think moving forward

195
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:50,439
it's just great to be able to remind the

196
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:51,878
younger generation and the people that

197
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:54,079
are getting into the industry that have

198
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:55,759
only been here for four years that these

199
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:58,000
are the struggles that we had to go

200
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,199
through and oral history of cannabis

201
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,959
that's why we're doing this show you

202
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,960
have skunk magazine now yeah and skunk

203
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:05,839
magazine is an oral history of cannabis

204
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:08,560
something that a hundred years from now

205
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:11,079
we can look back on and go okay Mila

206
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,680
Jansen for example she was special and

207
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:16,519
this is why she was special and also the

208
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,840
crazy times you know I feel like there's

209
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:20,878
so much stuff that's counterintuitive

210
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:22,519
that people are like oh man this this

211
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,759
this and actually it's the complete

212
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:28,719
opposite but yeah yeah it's it's quite

213
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,680
fascinating I mean being a part of you

214
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,080
know I've been in the industry for 18

215
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,959
years and part of the global space right

216
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,680
so I got to see all the different

217
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:39,399
marketplaces and all the different

218
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:42,799
movements in unique countries unique

219
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:48,080
states but with skunk when I came in 12

220
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:52,039
years ago being a historian or telling

221
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:54,680
stories throughout the last 12 years

222
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:56,599
it's pretty profound and it's it's

223
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:58,599
suited to me because I like to think of

224
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,079
things in terms of decades and centuries

225
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,278
of time mhm mhm and certainly when you

226
00:09:01,078 --> 00:09:05,919
were talking about the pandemic it's a

227
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:07,759
parallel in the last Renaissance 20

228
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:09,759
million died in the black plague and

229
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:12,838
that caused the shakeup of church and

230
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:16,278
state and allowed people to start to

231
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:19,760
find ways to gain wealth gain land gain

232
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:22,159
upward mobility in the economic class

233
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,759
and it's similar and different the

234
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:25,360
reason why I call it green is because

235
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:27,399
this Renaissance is really about people

236
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,639
becoming Earth connected again and

237
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:31,799
connected to the plants under

238
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:33,879
understanding how sustainable how

239
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:37,639
powerful and self-sufficient we really

240
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:39,639
can be yeah um when we learn uh that we

241
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:41,199
are stewards we're we're meant to

242
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:43,439
practice husbandry we're meant to live

243
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,440
in in communion with the Earth and with

244
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,120
the seasons and yeah it's been

245
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:52,560
fascinating to kind of hold that line

246
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,600
yeah for something so pure and so

247
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:57,759
connected with the heart and what's real

248
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:00,278
and what's true amidst all the craziness

249
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:03,200
of this industry and then also just stay

250
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:06,360
connected with the purity of the

251
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,920
storytelling based upon Merit we're not

252
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,399
a payto playay you know people can't

253
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:13,240
just buy their way in it's about Merit

254
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:16,120
yeah and like you said Nila for instance

255
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,159
has greatly inspired me as a woman in

256
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,000
business and as a woman just devoted to

257
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,838
the plants yeah she's like Benjamin

258
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,320
Button she keeps getting younger it's

259
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:27,680
wild yeah yeah yeah she's amazing and so

260
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,040
for me it just brings me great pleasure

261
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:33,000
when I took over creatively I really got

262
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:35,199
to evolve the magazine I took the purest

263
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,799
Parts but I started representing men and

264
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,560
women equally as Educators which can be

265
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:43,120
challenging because there aren't as many

266
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:45,078
female breeders or female Growers yet

267
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,320
and then just all the people around you

268
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:50,679
know black latino native Asian

269
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:54,000
lgbtq and a rich a rich culture of

270
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:56,199
everybody speaking in the space um you

271
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,799
know skunk isn't a homogeneous voice

272
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,399
it's really about spotlighting thought

273
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:03,679
leaders and Visionaries globally and

274
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:07,440
having them all speak in the space and

275
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:09,199
that just yeah it's um it's amazing and

276
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,000
it just it's all happened because the

277
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,720
universe and the plants led me here you

278
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,919
know yeah if you listen to the plant it

279
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:19,759
speaks yeah that's it that's my secret

280
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:22,039
sauce for sure I just listen within we

281
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:24,039
live in a really interesting time you

282
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:25,958
know I think they were talking about

283
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:28,480
like walking barefoot being so hippie

284
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:31,239
dippy 20 years ago now we got guys like

285
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,879
Gary bre uh who's talking about

286
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:36,320
grounding now yeah and it's not so

287
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:39,240
hippie anymore there's proven proven

288
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,959
studies that actually grounding uh is

289
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,879
good for you and it used to be such a

290
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:45,039
hippie dippy thing and now a lot of

291
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:47,559
things are going in that direction and

292
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:49,759
we're having science backup stuff that

293
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:52,119
we once thought was just really strange

294
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:54,879
and and different and yeah pretty

295
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:57,039
amazing times yeah no I I really we

296
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:58,720
truly are in a Renaissance and you know

297
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:00,559
I agree James it's been really

298
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,879
gratifying because when I was young

299
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:06,518
woman and studying herbology I learned a

300
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:08,240
lot of the kind of things that were not

301
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:10,200
really looked at from society like

302
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,519
sitting down and communing with the

303
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:15,360
plants yeah speaking to the plants one

304
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:18,198
of my courses we went out and we looked

305
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,800
at the genetic signature of the plant

306
00:12:18,198 --> 00:12:22,599
and we sat with the plant and we let

307
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:25,519
this the plant speak to us about what

308
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:28,079
its medicine was and I think that a lot

309
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:30,198
of these things that seem so strange the

310
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:32,638
Renaissance is really

311
00:12:30,198 --> 00:12:35,319
it's really fascinating to see how so

312
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,600
many people are coming out with it yeah

313
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,160
and as as you said science is now

314
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,480
backing it sure even Organics what I've

315
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:44,198
been really pleased about is like I said

316
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,278
I've been talking about Organics even

317
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:49,078
before I got into cannabis 18 years ago

318
00:12:46,278 --> 00:12:51,838
I was fighting for organic textiles and

319
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:53,000
farm to table and organic farming and

320
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,040
sustainable

321
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,078
practices and um it's just fascinating

322
00:12:56,039 --> 00:13:00,838
to me especially in the industry right

323
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:02,239
now back you know skunk is the only

324
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:04,320
cannabis magazine which many people

325
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,278
don't know is the only cannabis magazine

326
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,360
in the world devoted to Organics which

327
00:13:06,278 --> 00:13:11,958
trips me out that we're the only one but

328
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:14,560
that's the truth and you know back 15

329
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:16,638
years ago it was definitely French and

330
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:19,518
it's still in the minority it's not the

331
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:22,000
norm most people are still using salts

332
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,560
but what I've seen is that a lot of the

333
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
quickening that's happening over the

334
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:28,078
last five years is a lot of people are

335
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,600
abandoning salts not because they

336
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:31,879
necessarily care about about Mother

337
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,560
Earth or the soils and the waterways

338
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:36,439
which we do but because they see the

339
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:38,518
science because they see the yields

340
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,519
because they see the turps and it's like

341
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:42,799
what you don't want to make money you

342
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:44,519
have a problem with making more money

343
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:46,519
and they don't give a [ __ ] about Mother

344
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:49,000
Earth but they want to make more money

345
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:52,440
and it's pretty crazy to see all of

346
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,839
these BigTime indoor Growers yeah

347
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:58,079
abandoning their salt programs and

348
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,959
moving into the future and seeing that

349
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:02,319
it's actually giving them better results

350
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:04,479
it's pretty gratifying yeah and I think

351
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,399
there's a happy medium like the Sanic

352
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,039
model where it's like you can use salts

353
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:10,759
you can do stuff I think at the end of

354
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:13,039
the day we want to give the plant what

355
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:16,800
it deserves to represent the best

356
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:19,599
version of itself yeah and I'm I'm you

357
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:21,719
know I believe in salt and I believe in

358
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,839
organic and I believe that it's all okay

359
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,879
I Do Love Organic if I'm going to smoke

360
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,639
stuff I I like smoking organic flour

361
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:29,759
just up at can Organics they grew some

362
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,759
amazing

363
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:34,639
amazing stuff but I also have friends

364
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:36,600
that grow with Coco and use uh inputs

365
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,000
that are also organic that do really

366
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,680
good yeah it's funny and on a commercial

367
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,078
scale I think there's a happy medium

368
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:45,638
somewhere in the middle yeah I mean I'm

369
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:47,638
not gonna you know I'm I'm about the

370
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:49,959
future and how we're evolving towards

371
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:53,079
and that's fine and and at the same time

372
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:54,159
I'm realistic about the industry yeah so

373
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:57,399
and I know we've gotten into this

374
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:59,799
conversation before my job is to hold a

375
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:02,679
standard of the future always said skunk

376
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:05,519
is a magazine of the future yeah I'm not

377
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:07,799
necessarily just covering culture I'm

378
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,839
creating culture I'm a culture maker

379
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:13,319
right and so my responsibility is is

380
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:16,240
towards Mother Earth and Humanity right

381
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,000
not just towards what works now or

382
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,120
what's worked in the past and what

383
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,839
performs sure in my mind James we're

384
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:25,320
like coming out of 125 years of

385
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:28,959
Prohibition yeah and what prohibition

386
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:30,680
did to farming uh and agriculture

387
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:33,719
culture in general and how we had to

388
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:34,958
approach it and go indoors which many

389
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,040
people around the world they're going to

390
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:40,278
have to grow indoors so I'm not you know

391
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:43,519
to me the epitome is yes if you can have

392
00:15:40,278 --> 00:15:45,759
outdoor organic Sun grown flow it's

393
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,198
purest with mother nature but I'm also

394
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:51,079
not a Fanatic in that sense I want to

395
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:53,838
see I guess cleaner and more sustainable

396
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:56,799
growing practices across the board right

397
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:59,920
and just more Consciousness that oh what

398
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:02,519
happens Downstream from you yeah

399
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:04,799
100% that's it and to me it's like we

400
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:06,959
want to encourage people of of all

401
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:10,240
different types of growing yeah indoor

402
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:12,799
outdoor light dep Greenhouse you name it

403
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,959
Hydro I want to see if there's ways that

404
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,559
we can do things more sustainably and to

405
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,638
me it's a conversation and it's an

406
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:22,958
evolution yeah and it's education and I

407
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:24,759
think I I would guess that the majority

408
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:27,239
of people don't even know that the

409
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:29,680
reason we're growing indoors is because

410
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,919
of prohibition yeah so so it's so funny

411
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:34,399
because with without prohibition we may

412
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:36,599
all just still be going outside or we

413
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,318
wouldn't have gotten here so quickly and

414
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,920
we'd be behind technology wise but

415
00:16:39,318 --> 00:16:44,639
people started growing to hide their

416
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:46,919
plants started growing indoors 100% and

417
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,360
uh yeah and and that's where I like to

418
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:51,240
go to the root of things and think about

419
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,480
that and then think about how I can

420
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:57,399
respond to that yeah versus just talking

421
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,720
about the effect right and so going to

422
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:01,919
the roote yeah you see the origin of

423
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,519
that was that and that's what why I'm

424
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:06,879
fascinated with oh well if we were just

425
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:08,838
doing this because it wasn't allowed

426
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,319
because we were hiding yeah and then all

427
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:15,198
the input output old system of salts

428
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:17,918
came into being from that that's fine we

429
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,919
don't need to shame or you know

430
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:22,439
denigrate the past but it's like okay

431
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:25,160
well as we free ourselves up can we

432
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:28,240
continue to evolve can we continue to

433
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,919
you know do better in general cuz I

434
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,079
believe James you know we're at a

435
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,520
Crossroads when I think about the

436
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:36,119
Renaissance it's like I know that we

437
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:39,200
have the intelligence and the technology

438
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:41,439
to be regenerative in in practically

439
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,798
every industry around the world that's

440
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,480
the truth the main thing that holds us

441
00:17:43,798 --> 00:17:48,918
back as a society is not desire it's not

442
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,360
intelligence it's not the capability

443
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:54,280
it's the corruption and greed yeah uh

444
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:56,119
we're styed a bit by the fact that

445
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:58,918
corporations are kind of ruling our

446
00:17:56,119 --> 00:18:01,399
governments and sty meing I think that

447
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:03,919
that forward progression yeah at some

448
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:07,840
point it's going to push to the edge and

449
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:09,799
push over and I do see that um but you

450
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:11,839
know we're seeing organic farming from

451
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:14,359
the you know the hippies and the 60s it

452
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:16,798
was like very Fringe yeah and now every

453
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:19,519
Market you go on to has an organic

454
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:22,079
section yeah the 80s and 90s and for

455
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:24,960
Organics was rough you know but I think

456
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:27,199
the 60s and70s is where it started and

457
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,079
gone back and forth with it but now I

458
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,240
would say the most of my friends eat

459
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:35,359
organic or mostly organic yeah and

460
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:38,200
people are aware you know it's aess and

461
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:40,000
I and it just takes Decades of time and

462
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,960
I know you know there's some things

463
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,759
happening on the planet that are not

464
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:47,519
going to wait that long yeah and it is

465
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:50,279
what it is but for my part you know I'm

466
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:52,918
devoted till the end of my days to

467
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:54,879
helping Foster more sustainable

468
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:58,159
regenerative practices and I use the

469
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:00,640
term organic but I I want you know

470
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:02,880
everybody know that organic is kind of a

471
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,520
bastardized term yeah and I heard you

472
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,840
use the term Sanic and I've talked with

473
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:09,798
different scientists I I think that

474
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:11,558
we're going to continue to evolve our

475
00:19:09,798 --> 00:19:14,158
understandings and our vernaculars

476
00:19:11,558 --> 00:19:16,599
myself included and skunk wants to

477
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:18,919
evolve with it you know so I just think

478
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:21,558
it's an evolution James I don't think

479
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:23,200
that anything is really set in stone no

480
00:19:21,558 --> 00:19:25,480
and we're just learning how to optimize

481
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,919
the plants and genetics too like we're

482
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,480
learning about genetics and where they

483
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:30,720
should be grown especially when you look

484
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,798
at outdoors and what's optimal for what

485
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,960
region and you know understanding

486
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:36,240
breeding lines more absolutely you know

487
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,519
we're just scratching the surface of all

488
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,400
that and some of the big Pharma

489
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:41,480
companies they they've they're they're a

490
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,240
little bit ahead of us but like as a

491
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,640
whole we're sharing information we share

492
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,558
it in Skunk magazine I got my breeding

493
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,038
book yeah got all kinds of stuff so

494
00:19:47,558 --> 00:19:51,200
there's information out there for people

495
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:52,839
that are really looking for it and this

496
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,400
is the kind of stuff that was it's this

497
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:55,798
is the beauty of the internet right

498
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,679
there's a whole dark side to the

499
00:19:55,798 --> 00:19:59,079
internet and all the other stuff but the

500
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,519
beauty of the internet is sharing

501
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:03,519
information and if you know where to go

502
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:06,158
to get reliable information it can be an

503
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:08,240
amazing thing yeah I think so and I I

504
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,280
often say that the Shadow and light work

505
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,159
together it's universal law I'm very

506
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:15,759
into hermetic principles and one of

507
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:18,240
those principles is just that those two

508
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:20,679
polarities are always in Union yeah and

509
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,038
so they work together to birth new

510
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:25,038
realities yeah and you know it's just

511
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:28,158
like the womb and the the masculine

512
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:31,038
principle you know creates life and as

513
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,640
gardeners and Farmers people know you

514
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:36,879
know you're working with the Shadow and

515
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:39,880
light to to create a balance and to

516
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,880
birth you know your plants your food and

517
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:46,280
so yeah I like to think of that too that

518
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,000
you know we are in a a a land of Shadow

519
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:50,000
and light and there's a lot of Shadow

520
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,119
that's happening and amidst that there's

521
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,480
great

522
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:56,239
Amazing Discoveries of just light and

523
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,079
and Consciousness and I I think that

524
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,120
that is what always excites me and keeps

525
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:01,399
me going

526
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:04,439
yeah is is just keep pushing forward and

527
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:07,759
keep writing um this Evolution and help

528
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:10,320
in any way you can yeah to help the good

529
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:13,000
that's being fostered right yeah yeah so

530
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:14,918
spannabis this year was amazing oh I

531
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,798
love it it's a great event and this was

532
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:21,200
the biggest turnout in a long long time

533
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:23,839
yeah it felt really just pulsing with

534
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,919
energy and I've gone that I think that

535
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:30,839
was my 15th one yeah I've been going for

536
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:33,440
a very long time um my grandmother is

537
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:35,439
from Spain from Catalan um she was

538
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:39,038
southern France Northern Spain and she

539
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:41,400
spoke Spanish English French and Catalan

540
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:44,440
when she was growing up so whenever I go

541
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:47,559
back it's just like it's breathing and

542
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:52,558
it the food you know I grew up eating

543
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:54,918
Toria Espanola and P Tom and all the the

544
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:58,240
different coma I was like a part of my

545
00:21:54,919 --> 00:22:01,240
life MH and so yeah just being there

546
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,798
just feels so wonderful and even with

547
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:05,960
the conservative

548
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:08,440
backlash that's happening well there is

549
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,960
conservative backlash for sure it was

550
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,798
ridiculous you could feel it there I

551
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,600
mean they they did raids the night

552
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:16,400

555
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,320
don't know 60,000 people that were in

556
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:24,200

other things smoke learn about stuff see

563
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:40,759
what the latest and greatest and it's

564
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:44,759
like this Collective energy and it was

565
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:47,679
just so bright this year uh postco it

566
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:50,960
was kind of rough coming back in and now

567
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,600
there's this New Hope and it's not kind

568
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,120
of you don't feel it here in California

569
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:56,000
as much there's like people are like

570
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:59,759
depressed about the industry there's a

571
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,359
lot of negative and over there you see

572
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:03,158
like everybody who went felt the

573
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:05,599
positive because people were so excited

574
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:07,559
about the industry so excited I mean I

575
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:09,719
feel like over in Europe there's like

576
00:23:07,558 --> 00:23:12,639
this new turn of things Germany going

577
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,240
legal Portugal really you know pushing

578
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,880
for they you know they're doing

579
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,919
production over there that's going to go

580
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:21,240
International that's uh pretty amazing

581
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:22,919
and so the the energy is definitely

582
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,880
different over there and it's nice and

583
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:26,440
refreshing and I feel like bringing that

584
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,919
back to California bringing that back to

585
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,798
the United States is great is then it

586
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:34,720
motivates people all over again like

587
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:36,200
There's Hope absolutely James 100% I

588
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,679
mean what I've been feeling and what

589
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:41,240
I've been saying kind of over the last

590
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:43,600
six seven years yeah is that in any one

591
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,159
state or country you're going to be

592
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:47,399
dealing with the Quagmire of

593
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:49,360
legalization which can be extremely

594
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,960
depressing yeah and you're dealing with

595
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:54,359
genocide of farmers genocide of small

596
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:57,798
mom and pop businesses and take your

597
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:59,798
pick I mean any country or state they

598
00:23:57,798 --> 00:24:02,119
all have their kind of own version of

599
00:23:59,798 --> 00:24:05,240
asinine laws and over taxation

600
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:08,959
overregulation I'm hopeful for Germany I

601
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:11,240
got on paper it looks kind of very cool

602
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,038
it looks better than a lot of what we've

603
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,278
seen out there but what I've been

604
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:17,960
telling people for a long time is don't

605
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:20,919
be entrenched yeah if you can if you get

606
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:24,440
to the level where you can be a global

607
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:27,399
educator and have Global projects and

608
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:29,320
different Global things happening that

609
00:24:27,398 --> 00:24:31,398
this is a wonderful way to protect

610
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:32,599
yourself right and I'm constantly

611
00:24:31,398 --> 00:24:34,558
encouraging because I'm a brand

612
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:37,199
incubator I'm in service to Brands

613
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:39,639
Rising yeah to the next level and a lot

614
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,360
of times I'll advise people in any way

615
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:45,038
you can find a way to be a global

616
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:47,719
educator especially if you've given 20

617
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:51,480
30 years to this industry and to the

618
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:54,360
plant find a way to reach out even if

619
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:57,000
you remain doing Commerce in one state

620
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:59,038
one country but find a way to reach out

621
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,359
and extend your voice because I feel

622
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:03,919
like that's going to be the thing that

623
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:06,278
gives you lasting staying power and

624
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:09,759
those brands that are able to do that

625
00:25:06,278 --> 00:25:12,759
Journey will I believe exist for a very

626
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:15,000
long you know the next several decades

627
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:16,319
if they want well it's all about Legacy

628
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,319
I think as you get older it's like what

629
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:21,158
do you want to leave to the Next

630
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:23,038
Generation you know which brings to the

631
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:24,840
next subject that brings us to the next

632
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:27,519
subject that I had which was the Next

633
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:30,519

636
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:36,839
industry uh you know from being this

637

has a long future in this industry and

646
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,079
he is the next generation and it's great

647
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:03,278
seeing somebody like Sage who is very

648
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:05,678
passionate about cannabis but sees the

649
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:09,240
business side of it as well yeah he's a

650

last season by himself yielded 71 pounds

653
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:21,559
moved them all at 600 a pound which was

654
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:24,319
a huge accomplishment considering the

655
00:26:21,558 --> 00:26:27,720
climate and there were dark moments

656
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:30,000
where we talked and it was like you know

657
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:32,798
just [ __ ] can continue whatever you do

658
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,440
don't stop and stay with it and it was a

659
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:38,599
hard season too cuz it was a late start

660
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,960
wet season and then had to finish early

661
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:43,558
cuz it was wet rain and so it was

662
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,798
particularly challenging season as well

663
00:26:43,558 --> 00:26:48,200
so I was proud of him but it wasn't

664
00:26:45,798 --> 00:26:51,759
sunshine and rainbows and you know he's

665
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:54,278
seen I've raised him in a very um I

666
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:57,919
think old world way uh which we

667
00:26:54,278 --> 00:27:00,759
connected on um but helping him to do a

668
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:02,278
lot of apprenticeship helping him I

669
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:03,798
pulled him out of conventional School

670
00:27:02,278 --> 00:27:06,480
even though he went to a charter school

671
00:27:03,798 --> 00:27:09,200
and he went to a constructivism school W

672
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,079
which was learned by doing but because I

673
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,919
raised him when I was a young mom I was

674
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:15,240
studying herbology and I raised him on

675
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:17,640
the land and I taught him a lot of

676
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,399
survival skills and you know how to

677
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,919
build fire how to build shelter how to

678
00:27:19,398 --> 00:27:25,119
eat in forage wild edibles and how to

679
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:27,120
make his own medicine and heal himself I

680
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:29,678
taught him those things as a young

681
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:32,038
person and taught him also a lot of

682
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,399
practical things and I believe in that I

683
00:27:32,038 --> 00:27:36,679
think that it's missing a lot from our

684
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:39,439
world right now but teaching our young

685
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:42,679
people how to cook how to balance their

686
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:46,038
budget how to save money how to go out

687
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:48,679
and shop responsibly had to have respect

688
00:27:46,038 --> 00:27:50,919
you know for the dollar Basics too these

689
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:53,519
are the basics that aren't taught I mean

690
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:54,960
Common Sense isn't common unfortunately

691
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:56,480
but yeah the younger generation those

692
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,880
are the things you know it's like they

693
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,679
spend like all day in school but they

694
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,159
don't ever learn that and I've really

695
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,360
been a big believer and I think the

696
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:07,278
Renaissance definitely has to happen

697
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:09,278
within education because we know so much

698
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:10,759
yeah about how we have different styles

699
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:12,240
of Learners and a lot of people in

700
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:15,158
cannabis frankly are kinesthetic

701
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,038
Learners they learn by doing and they

702
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:19,840
need apprenticeship that's why growing

703
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:21,519
plants is so beneficial to younger

704
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:23,678
people whether you're growing tomatoes

705
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:25,679
or whether you're growing cannabis yeah

706
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:29,000
or whatever you're growing because you

707
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:31,600
learn commitment you learn

708
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,839
uh dedication and you learn that it's

709
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:36,199
not about you it's about what that plant

710
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:38,240
needs if you want to be successful you

711
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,000
have to be regimen you have to be able

712
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,558
to wake up and water the plant when the

713
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,200
plant needs water or give that plant

714
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:46,480
whatever it needs and sometimes your

715
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,278
needs or wants have to come second

716
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,759
totally and so that's what I love about

717
00:28:48,278 --> 00:28:52,240
growing that's like one of the most

718
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:54,879
amazing things and so these younger

719
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,599
generation kids they all need to grow

720
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:00,278
whether it's tomatoes in their backyard

721
00:28:56,599 --> 00:29:02,359
grow some peas some some herbs whatever

722
00:29:00,278 --> 00:29:03,880
it is I think get connected to the land

723
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:06,278
again we talk about that a lot is

724
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:10,000
getting that connection back to the

725
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:11,079
Earth to the soil 100 and uh you know I

726
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,599
think that's one of the biggest problems

727
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:15,480
is the disconnect with that it's true

728
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:17,558
that's why I chose a charter school for

729
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:20,079
sage because they had a whole gardening

730
00:29:17,558 --> 00:29:23,839
program yeah and they taught the kids it

731
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:25,599
was actually a a course and they grew

732
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:28,959
their own food and they did their own

733
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:31,719
maintenance of the garden and and uh it

734
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,480
helped me so that when I when he came

735
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,679
home then he had understandings of

736
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,480
things that I was ready to teach him but

737
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:41,320
I definitely would encourage you know

738
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:43,079
all parents to take take hold of that

739
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:46,480
for your kids and for yourself because

740
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:49,038
it does bring so much joy when we do

741
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,798
spend time putting our hands in the soil

742
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:52,640
and it is extremely healing and it's

743
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:55,679
cool because science is really proving

744
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,720
it yeah that scientifically we can now

745
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,360
prove that getting all of those microbes

746
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:02,240
and and working with the microbiome is

747
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:05,519
actually healing to our person and to

748
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,839
our own uh you know yes our own health

749
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:10,720
ex discipline aspect of it is just so

750
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:13,398
great and then it's so rewarding to be

751
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,720
able to eat something that you grew

752
00:30:13,398 --> 00:30:17,639
smoke something that you consume it in

753
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,960
one way or another but like seeing it

754
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:22,960
from the very beginning to the end where

755
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:25,200
there's no disconnect where you saw that

756
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,319
and if you had problems you know you see

757
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,960
the problems at the end too oh I felt

758
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:32,240
like you know I this conversation with

759
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:34,960
sage but I felt like he grew so much in

760
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,759
ways that you can't learn from anybody

761
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,120
else and you can't learn it from your

762
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:42,960
parent just telling you you know it

763
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:45,359
really is about your ass being on the

764
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,720
line you're on the frying pan and you've

765
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:50,479
got to [ __ ] deliver for yourself for

766
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:52,960
the plants for your project and it it

767
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,200
does develop you it does develop you

768
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:59,159
greatly I agree James and I think it was

769
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:02,519
beautiful to watch uh you know and also

770
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:04,760
give space right give space to him and

771
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:06,960
yeah I mean it was an ass kicker and

772
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:09,319
it's just it's incredible because now he

773
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,480
knows what he can do now you you learn

774
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:14,038
how strong you are you learn how capable

775
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:15,839
you are Yeah by not turning away and

776
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:17,558
staying the course till the very end and

777
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:20,079
doing a job well done and finishing

778
00:31:17,558 --> 00:31:21,960
failing failing a lot failing a lot

779
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:25,439
failing is a part of life that's it's

780
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:27,600
one of the most looking back failure is

781
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,240
one of the most important parts of life

782
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:31,480
because is you can't be good at

783
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:33,679
everything it's not god-given talent

784
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,440
that makes you successful it's failing

785
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:38,519
and getting back up and doing it again

786
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,440
and keeping keeping on and I think

787
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:43,440
that's just so important to experience

788
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:45,320
failure and experience loss and struggle

789
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,200
and all those amazing things but

790
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:50,439
especially failure it's okay to fail

791
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,399
it's okay to try something and fail it's

792
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,759
okay if you're older and you fail you

793
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:56,359
just got to get back up and keep on

794
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:58,679
getting up and some people give up and

795
00:31:56,359 --> 00:32:00,439
that's really sad yeah

796
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:02,798
I I agree you know I went through a

797
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:05,720
battle uh last year that I'm not really

798
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:08,359
talking about just yet but I did find

799
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:10,600
that again I mean I was I know this

800
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:12,439
because I've read so many you know text

801
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:15,000
sacred texts that talk about the hero's

802
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:17,919
journey or the heroine's journey and how

803
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,919
you know being obliterated yeah is what

804
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:24,200
actually makes you into the greatest

805
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:26,240
expression of your soul yeah and I I was

806
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:29,159
talking actually with Nikki from Nikki

807
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:31,720
and Swami um and she's a friend I was

808
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:36,320
talking with her this morning and was

809
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:39,759
reminded of the Bhagavad Gita and how

810
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:41,879
Shiva um talked to Hanuman and ravana

811
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:44,599
and said that you know whoever wants to

812
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:46,440
play the hero or the villain the villain

813
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:49,558
will repeat many less

814
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:51,639
lifetimes and it always spoke to me that

815
00:32:49,558 --> 00:32:55,319
the the villain or the person that

816
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:57,719
crosses you is sacred because it does

817
00:32:55,319 --> 00:33:01,678
make you and I think that I'm stronger

818
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:04,399
than than I've ever been and it doesn't

819
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:07,000
matter what comes my way I know that I

820
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:09,479
can attend like I have the strongest sea

821
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,679
legs James that I've ever had in my life

822
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:15,599
and it was from the obliteration it was

823
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:17,559
from really going to zero and I think a

824
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:19,199
lot of people in the industry are facing

825
00:33:17,558 --> 00:33:23,038
that through these different kind of

826
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:25,840
genocidal moments in legalization and

827
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:27,798
what we've had to go through to try and

828
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:30,759
exist in this industry that's just so

829
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:33,720
tumultuous yeah so I say it not just for

830
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:34,960
myself but for all of us that don't fear

831
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,839
like you're saying don't fear the

832
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:41,360
obliteration Don't Fear The failure and

833
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:44,759
understand that what was within you that

834
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:46,798
made you create something beautiful is

835
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:49,798
within you and nothing can take it away

836
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:52,240
from you no circumstance no person and

837
00:33:49,798 --> 00:33:54,918
that you can create it again nobody can

838
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,638
take what's inside of you away from you

839
00:33:54,919 --> 00:34:00,000
and I think that there's that strength

840
00:33:56,638 --> 00:34:02,839
now that I have to know that that Center

841
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,000
can is Untouchable it's Untouchable by

842
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:08,838
circumstance and no matter where I go

843
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,480
I'll do the work that I'm doing and I

844
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:13,078
think that that's true for a lot of

845
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:16,320
people that have been able to withstand

846
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:18,839
test after test yeah and some days you

847
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,480
just got to get up and you got to get up

848
00:34:18,838 --> 00:34:23,599
in the morning and show up for yourself

849
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,440
right and don't worry about your friends

850
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,879
don't worry about other people show up

851
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,000
you know and sometimes it's being

852
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:31,358
present and I think present is such a

853
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,838
big thing too uh because we can all live

854
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:35,519
in the future and think of how great it

855
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:37,878
could be or how bad it was but sometimes

856
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:39,480
we just got to focus on right now and

857
00:34:37,878 --> 00:34:43,440
today and how do we make this day the

858
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:45,838
best it could be 100% present moment

859
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,280
Consciousness is that's my practice I

860
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:50,199
mean maybe people don't know some people

861
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:52,040
do in the industry but my I was in the

862
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:54,319
health and wellness Industries in yoga

863
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:56,878
industry I ran a yoga studio and taught

864
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:59,440
yoga to kids and studied a lot of the

865
00:34:56,878 --> 00:35:01,920
sacred text and my practice is present

866
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,960
moment practice Yeah and in the present

867
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,559
moment practice I do think it's a very

868
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:09,280
much a secret sauce and business as well

869
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:11,279
because while everybody's getting

870
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,400
distracted by what other people are

871
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,640
doing or you know what's going to happen

872
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:18,639
in the future or what happened in the

873
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:20,598
past if you're in the present there's

874
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:23,279
always opportunity in the present

875
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:25,320
there's always treasure in the present

876
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,560
and if you're present and you're

877
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:31,599
listening you will get guidance on how

878
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:34,119
to move through and where to go who to

879
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:36,720
talk to where to be what to do the the

880
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:38,920
inner guidance system has answers every

881
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:41,319
second of the day and I think that when

882
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:43,720
we cultivate presence and that's really

883
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:45,359
my devotion James you know skunk is

884
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:47,118
definitely teaching people to grow fire

885
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:50,239
weed with fire genetics and that's our

886
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:52,200
backbone yeah but underneath that

887
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:54,639
there's definitely this feeling of

888
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:57,159
seeding Consciousness right so that more

889
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:58,799
and more people can access that for

890
00:35:57,159 --> 00:36:01,799
themselves because it's available to

891
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:04,880
each individual yeah and I think it's so

892
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:08,000
powerful to know that the guidance is

893
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:10,880
always there uh I think of the bork song

894
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,480
her song All is full of love but she

895
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:16,920
speaks about how love is there for us

896
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:19,119
247 but if you're not picking up the

897
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,159
phone if your doors are shut if your

898
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:23,280
windows are shut if you're cutting

899
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:24,799
yourself off then you're cutting

900
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,640
yourself off from that which is

901
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:31,318
available for you 247 right and and it's

902
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:33,559
available for everyone no one's exempt

903
00:36:31,318 --> 00:36:36,440
and so I do like that and I do want to

904
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:38,519
in my further work as I continue to go

905
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:40,639
um I'm definitely going to be working on

906
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:42,519
and I'm writing couple books and I want

907
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:45,400
to do more of that work as I continue to

908
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:47,920
stabilize skunk but those Worlds Of

909
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:51,559
Consciousness and commerce yeah and

910
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:54,318
plant medicine merging together in Union

911
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:56,799
not compartmentalized not separate that

912
00:36:54,318 --> 00:36:58,358
they're in Union symbiotic yeah and that

913
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,680
there's this whole

914
00:36:58,358 --> 00:37:03,759
right that we can all feel from like you

915
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:06,799
said it there's no place to arrive

916
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:08,599
there's no end goal we're just present

917
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,720
and we're on the journey yeah and we're

918
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:12,400
doing the next thing that we need to do

919
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:15,039
each step of the way you got to enjoy

920
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,680
the journey yeah I it's an amazing it's

921
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:18,519
an amazing experience once you can look

922
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:21,719
at it from that perspective too and I

923
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:25,519
think it it makes the tough times seem

924
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:29,239
less tough I think so I found levity I'm

925
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:30,239
a very um I think serious person and

926
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:34,000
very

927
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:36,598
sincere uh in in how I approach things

928
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,838
and yet you know the universe is is

929
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:41,760
really always encouraging us to I think

930
00:37:38,838 --> 00:37:45,639
find levity and and kind of relax into

931
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:48,119
the Divine Comedy of it and and also

932
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:52,159
just attend you know attend with

933
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:54,280
discipline and sincerity to our task but

934
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:56,118
yeah James I I do think I mean and they

935
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:58,400
talk about it that I think that

936
00:37:56,119 --> 00:38:00,240
transition from 40s and to 50s there is

937
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,200
an invitation if you've done your work

938
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:03,879
and you've done your inner work no

939
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:07,039
matter what field you're in no matter

940
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:09,838
where you are that there is a sense of

941
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:12,719
uh peace that can come from just being

942
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:15,239
present I agree yeah well and I think

943
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:16,838
going into my 40s is when I became a

944
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:18,358
better Storyteller and I see that with a

945
00:38:16,838 --> 00:38:20,358
lot of my friends that are transitioning

946
00:38:18,358 --> 00:38:21,719
from their 40s to 50s it's like when you

947
00:38:20,358 --> 00:38:24,719
become a Storyteller because you've

948
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:26,959
experienced so much you can tell stories

949
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:28,679
and there may be some genetic side to

950
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,240
that where

951
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:32,719
uh we it's by Design so that we can tell

952
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:35,039
the younger generation this is what you

953
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:37,318
need to do to be successful or this is

954
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:39,559
what you need to do to stay alive in

955
00:38:37,318 --> 00:38:41,318
business and other things but uh it's

956
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:43,039
amaz my book I would never wrote a book

957
00:38:41,318 --> 00:38:45,199
in my 20s I would I never thought I

958
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:48,000
would write a book and then writing a

959
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:49,159
textbook it's pretty wild yeah uh and

960
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,199
then you guys have a magazine I've

961
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:52,960
written some articles over over the last

962
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:55,159
and I want you to participate in the

963
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,440
next issue I want to put an excerpt in

964
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:59,559
there but yeah I do and I I think

965
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:03,318
looking at nature I like nature to

966
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:05,679
inform me in life I think it's so cool

967
00:39:03,318 --> 00:39:08,880
and what you just said about nature I

968
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:11,639
think of like the the trees that die and

969
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:15,400
they call them nurse trees but I learned

970
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:17,679
how they give and are giving certain n

971
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:21,639
nutrients that are needed to each

972
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:25,440
individual tree they'll give themselves

973
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:27,920
yeah to nourish their growth right and I

974
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,960
think that that's when we feel Joy I

975
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:33,079
think that the more we can I I forget

976
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:35,039
who said it if it was Joseph Campbell

977
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:36,440
but it was the idea that if you align

978
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:39,159
yourself to

979
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:42,079
Nature is the goal through observation

980
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:45,039
and that really is the ancient art of

981
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:48,280
learning yeah and study was through

982
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:52,079
observation and through observing nature

983
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:53,920
then we got the insight and the wisdom

984
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,640
and I feel like that is the Renaissance

985
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,400
too is those of us that are kind of

986
00:39:55,639 --> 00:40:01,239
Renaissance people you're a renaissance

987
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:04,480
man I'm a Renaissance woman is that

988
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:08,719
we're the embodiments of it and in the

989
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:12,960
listening to Nature she's guiding us on

990
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:15,000
how to do things more like her more in a

991
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,039
better way and I think about that in

992
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,838
business a lot that we are strengthening

993
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:22,159
the my silal network and that's what I'm

994
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:24,719
doing with kind of the expansion that

995
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:27,318
I'm doing and different Revenue

996
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:29,239
generating streams and the way that I'm

997
00:40:27,318 --> 00:40:32,960
doing that right now is definitely

998
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:35,759
attempting to model myself off of nature

999
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:38,240
yeah we live in such an amazing time I I

1000
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,680
think it's just with technology we're

1001
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:43,639
we're in the infancy of some of it and

1002
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:45,118
we're long past that in other aspects of

1003
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:46,480
it medicine we're just starting to

1004
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,400
scratch the surface and we're going to

1005
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,960
back to plant medicine yeah which is

1006
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,440
amazing we're undoing

1007
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:56,280
rockefeller's you know campaign of

1008
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:58,079
ignorance you know that's profound to me

1009
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:01,359
cuz like l literally I think on the

1010
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:03,920
first class of herb school when I was

1011
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:07,519
like 22 right

1012
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,358
23 um they said you know Rockefeller he

1013
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:11,960
went after the Apothecary and the

1014
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:13,440
apothecarist his campaign was successful

1015
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:16,039
he formed the American Medical

1016
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,159
Association and he started pushing pills

1017
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:21,039
yeah and they started to go down you

1018
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:23,199
know and get herbs and plants say from

1019
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:25,679
South America but then they would create

1020
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:28,199
isolates they would isolate a

1021
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:30,639
constituent they would concentrate that

1022
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:32,239
constituent and that's why you know

1023
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:33,598
people don't know but there's all the

1024
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:35,679
Pharmaceuticals they have those crazy

1025
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:38,000
warnings yeah because all the natural

1026
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:42,078
plant buffers and the whole plant

1027
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:44,079
medicine was taken away and so I learned

1028
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:47,039
about Rockefellers harm and then I

1029
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:49,480
learned also about the harm of isolates

1030
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:52,239
yeah and how people became disconnected

1031
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:54,039
from nature through that process not

1032
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:55,519
knowing where things came from whereas

1033
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:58,000
when you went into the Apothecary you

1034
00:41:55,519 --> 00:42:00,480
could see the tea or the tincture and

1035
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,838
which plant it was from and so I see a

1036
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:06,280
returning to that and I see again it's

1037
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:08,559
exciting more and more people that are

1038
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:10,599
going to get off of pharmaceuticals or

1039
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:13,519
at least learn I'm not saying I'm not a

1040
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:15,480
fanatical person so I'm not saying all

1041
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:18,400
Pharmaceuticals are bad or all

1042
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:21,599
allopathic medicine is bad yeah I'm more

1043
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:23,960
of the modern and the ancient coming

1044
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:26,000
together in Union yeah and I I think a

1045
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:28,358
lot of times in modern medicine we're

1046
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,800
treating symptoms than going to the root

1047
00:42:28,358 --> 00:42:32,440
of the problem and that that that's with

1048
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,519
politics that's with medicine that's

1049
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:36,480
with everything and it's so I I think a

1050
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:38,480
lot of times I go to the the

1051
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,358
counterintuitive side of stuff but it

1052
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,639
seems the opposite of what it really is

1053
00:42:40,358 --> 00:42:43,759
and sometimes we just look at that

1054
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:46,239
symptom is that's the problem and really

1055
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:48,640
we have to go much deeper to the root of

1056
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:49,759
the problem yeah and throughout history

1057
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:50,960
it's been like that I mean we're

1058
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,319
fighting

1059
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:56,079
issues uh we've been fighting issues

1060
00:42:53,318 --> 00:42:58,239
forever throughout time yeah you know

1061
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:00,200
and but that is the doing of the harm

1062
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:02,358
and I think that you know this second

1063
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:05,318
Renaissance is about going to the root

1064
00:43:02,358 --> 00:43:07,279
of things yeah and that we actually have

1065
00:43:05,318 --> 00:43:10,480
the technology like you're talking about

1066
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:12,319
the tech the light side of this

1067
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,838
technology and I've always said like to

1068
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:19,239
fear the internet or to fear AI is to

1069
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:21,159
fear ourselves in the sense that we are

1070
00:43:19,239 --> 00:43:22,719
that our brain is that and we were

1071
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:23,598
talking when you're talking about kind

1072
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:26,519
of

1073
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:29,119
other perceptions or sensory perceptions

1074
00:43:26,519 --> 00:43:31,599
that we have beyond our five senses and

1075
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,599
we do have them you know we are able to

1076
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:34,400
communicate

1077
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:37,079
non-verbally uh you know I've always

1078
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,160
said that love is akin to light because

1079
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:42,599
love travels at the speed of light yeah

1080
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:44,960
if I think of you you feel it in a in a

1081
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:46,599
split second and then you'll call me or

1082
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,679
say something or you know that I was

1083
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:50,559
thinking of you because you'll think

1084
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:53,679
about me too this is all happening but

1085
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:56,800
it's been so uh pushed down because they

1086
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:59,519
didn't want us yeah to be as capable as

1087
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:03,440
that right so now it's just part of us

1088
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:07,239
all kind of coming to

1089
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:09,920
remembering taking the stigma away from

1090
00:44:07,239 --> 00:44:12,919
what we just naturally do well yeah and

1091
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:14,760
we talk about vibrations and love being

1092
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:17,000
uh powerful vibration but the only

1093
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:19,839
vibration that's more powerful than love

1094
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,760
is authenticity oh my gosh that's so

1095
00:44:19,838 --> 00:44:25,039
funny I read that article yeah I that's

1096
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:28,720
so funny that that made a huge impact on

1097
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:30,279
me because uh for me when I read that it

1098
00:44:28,719 --> 00:44:33,480
was just a few like maybe it was a

1099
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:35,920
couple months ago and it really spoke to

1100
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:38,719
something deep because in all these

1101
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:41,200
tests I think that what we're finding

1102
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:43,118
I've always believed that like cannabis

1103
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:45,318
you talk about Bob Marley and how he

1104
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:47,079
said the herb reveals you to yourself

1105
00:44:45,318 --> 00:44:48,920
right and I always told Sage when he

1106
00:44:47,079 --> 00:44:51,240
started in biing I'm like listen the

1107
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:53,400
plant is going to reveal you to yourself

1108
00:44:51,239 --> 00:44:56,159
and what she reveals you have to do the

1109
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:58,318
work you have to integrate the lessons

1110
00:44:56,159 --> 00:45:02,279
that she's showing you you you can't

1111
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:04,079
just use her and then not do the work

1112
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:08,200
because she's encouraging you on how to

1113
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:10,680
keep rising and I think that um you know

1114
00:45:08,199 --> 00:45:14,439
that's really what's happening is that

1115
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:16,358
there's this this opportunity that not

1116
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:18,920
only is she encouraging us to be

1117
00:45:16,358 --> 00:45:21,719
conscious but deeper than that is this

1118
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:24,519
feeling of self-love and unconditional

1119
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:25,719
love yeah because I've realized now as

1120
00:45:24,519 --> 00:45:30,639
an older

1121
00:45:25,719 --> 00:45:32,679
woman um that unconditional love of self

1122
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:34,519
is really the practice because when we

1123
00:45:32,679 --> 00:45:37,480
get into a space of unconditionally

1124
00:45:34,519 --> 00:45:40,519
loving ourselves first off we can make

1125
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:42,960
it through anything and then second off

1126
00:45:40,519 --> 00:45:45,838
we can actually be of service to our

1127
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:48,358
community and be loving to our community

1128
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:50,960
in a way where we're not expecting

1129
00:45:48,358 --> 00:45:53,279
anything from anybody we don't need

1130
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:55,838
anything from anybody right but we can

1131
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:58,680
just show up in our wholeness and be

1132
00:45:55,838 --> 00:46:00,719
present and the root of that is the

1133
00:45:58,679 --> 00:46:03,598
unconditional love and acceptance of

1134
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:06,279
self and that to me is authenticity yeah

1135
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:08,800
you can't be authentic if you don't

1136
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:11,920
fully love yourself there's something

1137
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:13,240
there there's something off and it's you

1138
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,119
know I think a lot of people deal with

1139
00:46:13,239 --> 00:46:18,358
it and I have a lot of compassion myself

1140
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:20,519
included of impostor syndrome or just

1141
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:23,598
kind of not accepting the self or

1142
00:46:20,519 --> 00:46:26,280
judging or berading the self and I think

1143
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:29,119
that that also as we get seasoned and as

1144
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:31,640
we age hope if we're doing our work we

1145
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,640
come into a space where we do accept

1146
00:46:31,639 --> 00:46:35,118
ourselves completely and I do accept

1147
00:46:33,639 --> 00:46:39,039
myself completely my strengths my

1148
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:41,760
weaknesses my failures my successes and

1149
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:43,880
in that unconditional loving I feel like

1150
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:47,319
I can really be relaxed and authentic

1151
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:50,358
and I'll actually do good for my

1152
00:46:47,318 --> 00:46:52,558
community yeah it's amazing I know it is

1153

have to tell me this stuff was special

1183
00:48:04,239 --> 00:48:10,078
you can smell it it has an amazing

1184
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:11,720
blueberry nose but the effect more than

1185
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:14,039
anything is what I really like about

1186
00:48:11,719 --> 00:48:17,719

he's a great photographer he helped

1193
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:34,200
start

1194
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:36,039
canacon uh uh Hempfest he worked with

1195
00:48:34,199 --> 00:48:38,639
Hempfest he was a volunteer for many

1196
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:40,279
years uh he took the first photo of me

1197
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:42,960
when I was in high times in

1198
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:45,240
2012 and he's also a breeder and a

1199
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:48,240
grower and very passionate he's a

1200
00:48:45,239 --> 00:48:51,039
revolutionary in his own right and uh a

1201
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:54,439
really good guy and he's always excited

1202
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:57,119
to talk about flower and cannabis and

1203
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:59,838
everything else seeds breeding storing

1204
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:01,079
pollen he's special he is special the

1205
00:48:59,838 --> 00:49:03,679
flow is

1206
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:07,599
special the effect of the flow is really

1207
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:08,960
special and the flavor and uh the flavor

1208
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:10,119
kind of matches the effect it's a

1209
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,838
strange thing to say because we're

1210
00:49:10,119 --> 00:49:16,960
talking about two different perceptions

1211
00:49:11,838 --> 00:49:19,519
but the flavor is uh mild but turpy

1212
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,199
uhhuh but it has this nice blueberry

1213
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:23,280
like that coats your mouth and just

1214
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:25,919
stays with you yeah and it's in my upper

1215
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:27,720
palette there's this sense of like Pine

1216
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:30,559
like a pine forest and then there's

1217
00:49:27,719 --> 00:49:33,719
blueberry yeah on the tongue yeah it's

1218
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:36,200
complex it's not just one thing but even

1219
00:49:33,719 --> 00:49:39,439
the effect is like

1220
00:49:36,199 --> 00:49:41,558
uh it's it's not a super super long

1221
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,599
effect but it's it's really enjoyable

1222
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:44,680
and I feel like it's one of those things

1223
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:47,119
I could smoke all day long and just be

1224
00:49:44,679 --> 00:49:48,919
happy I felt yeah I feel like a

1225
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:49,960
brightening right away and it's one of

1226
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:53,960
those ones it doesn't get you tight

1227
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:55,960
behind the eyes it's very productive and

1228
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:58,240
yeah Alison Drayson she really likes it

1229
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:01,039

that I really like covering the

1264
00:51:16,679 --> 00:51:20,598
conscious men in the industry because it

1265
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:23,358

as she journeyed um and I just love it I

1282
00:52:04,199 --> 00:52:09,960
just think that that's so wonderful to

1283
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:12,040
have um a conscious transition yeah

1284
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,838
that's surrounded by everyone you love

1285
00:52:12,039 --> 00:52:16,199
it's such a blessing not everybody gets

1286
00:52:13,838 --> 00:52:18,318
that not everybody gets that for sure

1287
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:20,558
and it's just it yeah I mean we live in

1288
00:52:18,318 --> 00:52:21,960
an amazing time with cannabis being

1289
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:24,040
where it's at where we can openly talk

1290
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:26,119
about it and so it's great to be able to

1291
00:52:24,039 --> 00:52:27,920
get these stories and and be able to

1292
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:31,720
pass on stuff for the Next Generation as

1293
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:34,358
well yes it is yeah absolutely we got to

1294
00:52:31,719 --> 00:52:37,759
keep going absolutely so skunk magazine

1295
00:52:34,358 --> 00:52:39,798
is special in many ways but one thing

1296
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:42,680
that I I think that makes skunk magazine

1297
00:52:39,798 --> 00:52:44,559
is really special is it's very inclusive

1298
00:52:42,679 --> 00:52:47,039
rather than exclusive for its writers

1299
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:49,319
you get writers from all walks of life

1300
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:51,679
for those guys that are watching or

1301
00:52:49,318 --> 00:52:53,199
ladies that are watching the show if you

1302
00:52:51,679 --> 00:52:54,440
guys want to write an article you can

1303
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:56,719
submit it to skunk and they will

1304
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:58,240
consider publishing it if it's good I

1305
00:52:56,719 --> 00:53:00,318
don't think you get that with most

1306
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:04,798
magazines and I think that's one of the

1307
00:53:00,318 --> 00:53:07,318
beauties of skunk yeah thank you yeah I

1308
00:53:04,798 --> 00:53:09,920
really wanted it to have a a community

1309
00:53:07,318 --> 00:53:11,599
feeling a global Community feeling

1310
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:14,240
because we are a global magazine and

1311
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:17,920
that was really important to me and when

1312
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:20,118
I took over creatively I said about to

1313
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:22,798
create a different type of program with

1314
00:53:20,119 --> 00:53:25,599
writing yeah and so I have like 80 to

1315
00:53:22,798 --> 00:53:28,239
100 contributors globally and they're

1316
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:31,720
all told of deadlines and they're all

1317
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:34,798
invited in and they can submit content

1318
00:53:31,719 --> 00:53:36,399
which if it's worthy it can be published

1319
00:53:34,798 --> 00:53:37,920
in that issue it could be published

1320
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,400
online or it could be published in the

1321
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:41,960
next issue so it's

1322
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:45,519
open-ended because you know dealing with

1323
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:48,960
Stoners I learned quickly that if I just

1324
00:53:45,519 --> 00:53:52,079
had the set people I might be short a

1325
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:54,679
few articles so now I have this flow

1326
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:57,359
where we get more content that we need

1327
00:53:54,679 --> 00:53:59,159
and then we do that that thing where we

1328
00:53:57,358 --> 00:54:01,239
either push it online or push it to the

1329
00:53:59,159 --> 00:54:04,039
next issue and it works out really well

1330
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:05,719
yeah and then you know a lot of people

1331
00:54:04,039 --> 00:54:08,400
will say they can write and they can't

1332
00:54:05,719 --> 00:54:09,798
write and so that's what it is proof is

1333
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:13,240
in the pudding everybody thinks they can

1334
00:54:09,798 --> 00:54:15,400
do people can try and if it's good

1335
00:54:13,239 --> 00:54:17,919
definitely will'll consider it and we

1336
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:19,318
want to encourage that you know Brandon

1337
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,798
rust has been writing some good stuff

1338
00:54:19,318 --> 00:54:23,199
for you guys yeah so he's amazing in

1339
00:54:21,798 --> 00:54:25,639
Organics you know he does some good

1340
00:54:23,199 --> 00:54:27,358
stuff he's really well spoken he's a

1341
00:54:25,639 --> 00:54:28,879
real good writer

1342
00:54:27,358 --> 00:54:31,159
uh yeah he's really well-rounded and

1343
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:33,358
really passionate about cannabis yeah no

1344
00:54:31,159 --> 00:54:35,759
I really likeed that and I it is very

1345
00:54:33,358 --> 00:54:37,558
different because and I've been you know

1346
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:40,400
people have not understood what I was

1347
00:54:37,559 --> 00:54:42,760
doing but now I think that they are

1348
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:45,280
understanding and there's something

1349
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:47,160
about it where it's not like the other

1350
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:48,960
Rags where you can just kind of buy your

1351
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:51,838
way in and then there's an advertorial

1352
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:54,199
article yeah I'm honing in on thought

1353
00:54:51,838 --> 00:54:56,719
leaders Visionaries M and they're

1354
00:54:54,199 --> 00:54:59,558
usually company owners yeah or somebody

1355
00:54:56,719 --> 00:55:01,598
on staff at the company and then they

1356
00:54:59,559 --> 00:55:03,960
tell the story of their brand through

1357
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:06,559
education right I do believe that the

1358
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:10,440
future of marketing is

1359
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:13,000
authenticity and uh open-source DIY kind

1360
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:15,559
of intimate feeling right that that's

1361
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:19,280
what people are really responding to the

1362
00:55:15,559 --> 00:55:22,920
old way of just pushing advertorial

1363
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:26,440
content and that feeling of lack of

1364
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:29,079
substance or lack of soul soul or lack

1365
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:31,679
of meaningfulness I think that a lot of

1366
00:55:29,079 --> 00:55:34,000
end consumers are really not into and

1367
00:55:31,679 --> 00:55:36,000
they're not going to respond to it as

1368
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,440
they will with this type of thing so

1369
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,920
what I love about it is that it's

1370
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:43,559
actually coming from the people a lot of

1371
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:45,480
the content is coming from the people

1372
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:48,760
that are living it right and they're

1373
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:51,119
sharing their insights and and then it's

1374
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:53,400
actually something I mean I want every

1375
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:55,838
skunk is is a collectible it's like an

1376
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:59,720
educational tone right and I just pushed

1377
00:55:55,838 --> 00:56:01,318
the page is up to 160 Pages um yeah

1378
00:55:59,719 --> 00:56:03,318
after printing my book I understand what

1379
00:56:01,318 --> 00:56:05,239
that means and a lot of people don't but

1380
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:08,639
it means that you're paying more money

1381
00:56:05,239 --> 00:56:11,239
for your your magazine and uh buying a

1382
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:13,279
car every quarter yeah well we're 380

1383
00:56:11,239 --> 00:56:15,519

1384
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:18,000
it's not cheap yeah I do it every

1385
00:56:15,519 --> 00:56:21,199
quarter without fail yeah and it's uh

1386
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:24,760
it's intense it is intense but you know

1387
00:56:21,199 --> 00:56:27,038

together and then also um thriving yeah

1417
00:57:37,318 --> 00:57:42,759
together I think that you know in this

1418
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,480
Renaissance also I've been told that

1419
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:48,280
those of us that are activated globally

1420
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:51,358
on behalf of healing and empowerment are

1421
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:55,000
going to thrive in the bones of a Dying

1422
00:57:51,358 --> 00:57:58,400
World and crumbling societal structures

1423
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:01,679
those that are actually in healing

1424
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:04,400
medicine empowerment in some way there's

1425
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:06,919
a pathway for you to thrive because

1426
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:08,358
Millions more people around the planet

1427
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:10,960
are going to need to access their

1428
00:58:08,358 --> 00:58:13,519
healing and and access you know

1429
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:15,720
Alternative forms of medicine right so

1430
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:18,038
and that's why I say just keep going no

1431
00:58:15,719 --> 00:58:19,358
matter what keep going um and that's

1432
00:58:18,039 --> 00:58:22,000
what we're going to do with these

1433
00:58:19,358 --> 00:58:24,759
different programs of monetization I'm

1434
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:27,119
also I just sold 30 pounds of chocolate

1435
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:30,240
skunk into the California Market with

1436
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:33,599

1437
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:35,558
be doing 30 lounds of seed no 30 lbs of

1438
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:38,559

1439
00:58:35,559 --> 00:58:41,839

1440
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:45,359
successful program and I have another

you know 15 licensing deals on the table

1442
00:58:45,358 --> 00:58:50,078
so that's another way that I'm going to

1443
00:58:46,679 --> 00:58:52,679
be protecting skunk is working with

1444
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:56,559

flower award-winning hash makers divers

1446
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:01,798

1447
00:58:58,039 --> 00:59:05,119
to protect skunk and remain agile yeah

1448
00:59:01,798 --> 00:59:07,440
and also do something of substance where

1449
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:09,480
I'm I'm telling the story of what the

1450

1452
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:20,280
journey through the the magazine so it's

1453
00:59:18,358 --> 00:59:22,440
it's pretty exciting to bring those

1454
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:25,359
worlds together and I've been waiting to

1455
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:28,960
do that for a long time so a lot of

1456
00:59:25,358 --> 00:59:31,838
people think that books and magazines

1457
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:33,920
are dying and they're going away yeah

1458
00:59:31,838 --> 00:59:36,239
how do you feel about that oh my God if

1459
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,920
I had a nickel for everybody who has

1460
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:40,598
said to me Prince is

1461
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:43,838
dead and I mean it's just laughable to

1462
00:59:40,599 --> 00:59:46,079
me because you know I'm an alchemist in

1463
00:59:43,838 --> 00:59:50,239
the sense that I think of things

1464
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:53,280
magically and um have studied magic and

1465
00:59:50,239 --> 00:59:55,439
the thing that I know about you know the

1466
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:56,760
written word is that the written word

1467
00:59:55,440 --> 01:00:00,200
will always have

1468
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:01,839
power um there's the power of the word

1469
01:00:00,199 --> 01:00:05,399
and there's nothing that's ever going to

1470
01:00:01,838 --> 01:00:08,000
change that and you know I've evolved

1471
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:09,920
with the times we only do four issues a

1472
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,599
year we do them with the seasons we do

1473
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:15,599
quarterly and we have a rich

1474
01:00:12,599 --> 01:00:17,480
storytelling online Rich storytelling

1475
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:19,359
through social and we're actually

1476
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:23,400
bringing our forums back this year as

1477
01:00:19,358 --> 01:00:26,358
well right on the cusp of that um so

1478
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:28,480
they will be back hopefully by the Fall

1479
01:00:26,358 --> 01:00:31,038
so I'm not about having all my eggs in

1480
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:32,838
any one basket but there's something

1481
01:00:31,039 --> 01:00:35,520
about the power of print that will

1482
01:00:32,838 --> 01:00:39,038
always remain I believe and I believe

1483
01:00:35,519 --> 01:00:41,239
also that um you know in the pandemic a

1484
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:43,079
lot more people went to you know

1485
01:00:41,239 --> 01:00:45,919
independent book stores started coming

1486
01:00:43,079 --> 01:00:48,160
back and a lot more people I think

1487
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:49,480
changed forever yeah there's certain

1488
01:00:48,159 --> 01:00:52,598
things that change in our world where

1489
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:55,039
we're never going back the the old way

1490
01:00:52,599 --> 01:00:58,039
of of doing certain things like the

1491
01:00:55,039 --> 01:01:00,160
classic 9 to5 and the classic office job

1492
01:00:58,039 --> 01:01:03,240
has kind of been turned upside down on

1493
01:01:00,159 --> 01:01:05,078
its head they still exist but a lot of

1494
01:01:03,239 --> 01:01:07,439
people so many more people work from

1495
01:01:05,079 --> 01:01:10,119
home or have Flex schedules yeah work

1496
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:12,079
410 all kind I mean there's so that was

1497
01:01:10,119 --> 01:01:14,680
going on a little before but now it's

1498
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:16,760
definitely more extreme than it ever has

1499
01:01:14,679 --> 01:01:19,279
been with people working from home

1500
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:21,440
people people doing you know working

1501
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:24,280
multiple jobs where they have small work

1502
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:26,519
schedules yeah so I think it's Dynamic

1503
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:28,798
it's about being dynamic more than

1504
01:01:26,519 --> 01:01:30,920
anything and being multi fasted and

1505
01:01:28,798 --> 01:01:34,038
that's really what I'm about I would

1506
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:36,280
like to print skunk on hemp I'm

1507
01:01:34,039 --> 01:01:39,520
definitely want to do that but I will

1508
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:41,319
always print skunk ouch yeah I know I

1509
01:01:39,519 --> 01:01:43,480
know it's wild well we got to talk about

1510
01:01:41,318 --> 01:01:44,798
that I think this it sounds amazing and

1511
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:46,519
I mean I think it would be we're not

1512
01:01:44,798 --> 01:01:48,000
there yet no we're not there yet we will

1513
01:01:46,519 --> 01:01:50,199
be there we will be there we're just not

1514
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:53,880
there yet yeah so I'd like to be the

1515
01:01:50,199 --> 01:01:55,960
first to do it um working on it and you

1516
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:57,920
know we're going to be launching also

1517
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:59,880
I'm working on a new project we're going

1518
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:02,119
to be doing something called the

1519
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:05,240
Cannabis guide book and it's going to be

1520
01:02:02,119 --> 01:02:07,440
a free magazine and it's going to be

1521
01:02:05,239 --> 01:02:10,318
more for the end consumer and more for

1522
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:12,278
the mainstream consumer yeah and it's

1523
01:02:10,318 --> 01:02:15,400
going to be you know a mixture of like a

1524
01:02:12,278 --> 01:02:17,358
Michelin book showing the best in show

1525
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:20,960
along with like a little bit of Rolling

1526
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:23,639
Stones and a little bit of uh

1527
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:26,079
monacle um it's something that I've been

1528
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:29,598
waiting to do I did a free magazine like

1529
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:32,278
years ago mhm um the highway but this is

1530
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:35,000
going to be something different and and

1531
01:02:32,278 --> 01:02:37,079
again it's needed there's not really

1532
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,679
anything out there that's going to be

1533
01:02:37,079 --> 01:02:41,798
quite like this we're going to have a

1534
01:02:38,679 --> 01:02:44,118
Marketplace component as well um that's

1535
01:02:41,798 --> 01:02:47,239
going to be very affordable to work with

1536
01:02:44,119 --> 01:02:50,278
us for the small mom and pop

1537
01:02:47,239 --> 01:02:51,879
dispensaries for the craft farmer so

1538
01:02:50,278 --> 01:02:54,159
definitely inspired by whole earth

1539
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:56,440
catalog as well if you know that

1540
01:02:54,159 --> 01:02:58,719
counterculture publication it had very

1541
01:02:56,440 --> 01:03:01,079
much a Marketplace feeling so we're

1542
01:02:58,719 --> 01:03:04,480
going to be bringing those feelings back

1543
01:03:01,079 --> 01:03:06,559
cuz I'm like I love counterculture Rags

1544
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:07,920
through time like I've studied them and

1545
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:10,319
I really I don't know if you know

1546
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:12,720
Richard jurgenson who has the archive up

1547
01:03:10,318 --> 01:03:15,519
in Willets but he has an amazing

1548
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:20,719
collection of magazines uh through time

1549
01:03:15,519 --> 01:03:23,519
over the last you know 75 years 80 years

1550
01:03:20,719 --> 01:03:26,278
um and so I get inspired by things that

1551
01:03:23,519 --> 01:03:30,000
have been passed and then ways that we

1552
01:03:26,278 --> 01:03:33,559
can kind of bring those good ideas back

1553
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:36,400
but in a modern way so I'm excited about

1554
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:40,160
this and it's going to be bilingual but

1555
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:42,960
again it's not to me like we still need

1556
01:03:40,159 --> 01:03:45,000
print and I think that print won't die I

1557
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:47,440
just think it's evolving and I don't

1558
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:51,639
think it's dead and I just I'll be a

1559
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:53,639
long standing a person in that regard

1560
01:03:51,639 --> 01:03:56,440
because you know it's already existed

1561
01:03:53,639 --> 01:03:58,639
for thousands of years and

1562
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:00,519
it's not going anywhere it's something

1563
01:03:58,639 --> 01:04:02,598
ancient and I think that it's going to

1564
01:04:00,519 --> 01:04:06,719
continue to evolve but we'll continue to

1565
01:04:02,599 --> 01:04:09,240
evolve with it right yeah nice yeah so

1566
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:10,598
if you had one piece of advice usually I

1567
01:04:09,239 --> 01:04:12,558
ask about one piece of advice for

1568
01:04:10,599 --> 01:04:14,680
yourself but if you have one piece of

1569
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:16,079
advice for the younger generation for

1570
01:04:14,679 --> 01:04:19,000
Sage's

1571
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:21,680
generation one piece of advice that you

1572
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:23,559
could share with everybody uh about the

1573
01:04:21,679 --> 01:04:27,318
industry about yourself what would that

1574
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:30,240
be I say you know basically the most

1575
01:04:27,318 --> 01:04:34,318
important thing is be your own

1576
01:04:30,239 --> 01:04:37,598
constant be your own guiding force and

1577
01:04:34,318 --> 01:04:40,079
seek the answers within don't look

1578
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:42,160
outside of yourself in the sense of you

1579
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:45,760
know ever comparing yourself to anyone

1580
01:04:42,159 --> 01:04:48,159
else try as much as you can to cultivate

1581
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:51,079
that presence with yourself in the

1582
01:04:48,159 --> 01:04:53,920
moment and listen within and follow that

1583
01:04:51,079 --> 01:04:56,160
follow your own inner Moonlight and let

1584
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:58,920
that guide you because that will protect

1585
01:04:56,159 --> 01:05:01,920
you through anything and just turn down

1586
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:04,798
the noise on the outside as much as you

1587
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:08,240
can certainly get inspired by those

1588
01:05:04,798 --> 01:05:11,239
people that inspire you also seek them

1589
01:05:08,239 --> 01:05:13,278
out and I think that you know old school

1590
01:05:11,239 --> 01:05:15,959
apprenticeship I've always told Sage you

1591
01:05:13,278 --> 01:05:19,798
know learn from everybody that you can

1592
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:21,760
and learn every aspect that you can and

1593
01:05:19,798 --> 01:05:24,639
you know he's been studying hash

1594
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:26,920
making um for several years now and now

1595
01:05:24,639 --> 01:05:30,440
he's just been going through chopping

1596
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:33,200
fresh frozen and that whole process and

1597
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:36,400
it's fascinating and no matter what he

1598
01:05:33,199 --> 01:05:39,078
settles on doing it's just wonderful

1599
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:43,639
when you show up for life and you're

1600
01:05:39,079 --> 01:05:47,278
willing to learn and study and grow and

1601
01:05:43,639 --> 01:05:50,719
attend to a a a situation I think that a

1602
01:05:47,278 --> 01:05:55,239
lot of young people um you know they

1603
01:05:50,719 --> 01:05:57,759
need to understand that it's about time

1604
01:05:55,239 --> 01:05:59,838
over time is how they're going to get

1605
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:01,880
the best results and have the most

1606
01:05:59,838 --> 01:06:04,679
meaningfulness in their life yeah they

1607
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:07,680
can't expect something to happen so

1608
01:06:04,679 --> 01:06:10,838
quickly in in one year or two years you

1609
01:06:07,679 --> 01:06:12,919
know that it's when you devoted 10 years

1610
01:06:10,838 --> 01:06:15,719
15 years that you start to see the

1611
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:17,760
results of your work a lifetime yeah no

1612
01:06:15,719 --> 01:06:19,798
and just continuing on so and that's

1613
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:22,599
perseverance I would say to a lot of

1614
01:06:19,798 --> 01:06:25,199
