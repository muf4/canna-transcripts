mutual friend organic Brian oh yeah and

18
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:51,800
I've been making uh a blend of organic

19
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:54,399
freeze dried fruits and sucret of all

20
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:57,198
the forms of bricks sucret seems to be

21
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,320
the number one it's less processed it's

22
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:02,000
like these beautiful granulars they

23
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:05,040
sweep off the ground and it tastes

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,159
better than molasses wow and Oldtimer

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,320
told me so I took a note when he said

26
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:15,118
Sucrets the one Mark theves represent

27
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:17,959
doos and uh I built this new blend to

28
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:22,078
boost tpin to boost

29
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:23,639
THC and uh a side thing that came out of

30
00:01:22,078 --> 00:01:26,758
it that might be bigger than both of

31
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,560
those is it preserves the quality of the

32
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:35,438
Cannabis really so I brought some bud to

33
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:38,599
show yeah uh that's four years old wow

34
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:41,438
and it's bright green and it's amazing

35
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:43,798
looking to where like more of that needs

36
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:46,798
to happen because as we know in the jars

37
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:49,560
it's like yeah if they don't smooth it

38
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,200
quick enough then we're all in trouble

39
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,079
well has a short shelf life I like the

40
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,040
tur loocks for improving shelf life I

41
00:01:53,078 --> 00:01:57,078
think the tur blocks do a great job

42
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,399
uhhuh uh you know we mentioned turls in

43
00:01:57,078 --> 00:02:02,118
my breeding book sweet I'm a huge fan uh

44
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,239
but yeah and then I think improving the

45
00:02:02,118 --> 00:02:05,078
quality of the flour you know that

46
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:06,959
sounds amazing I think you know because

47
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:09,000
you're combining all these fruits and I

48
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:12,719
have some vegetables in there too and

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,800
what have you uh the health of the plant

50
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:19,080
and the the Vigor with the bricks yeah

51
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:23,120
is like so key so you know just making

52
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:25,360
it be able to repel bugs not get mold be

53
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,840
happy right optimal plant Health at the

54
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,599
end of the day we're all looking for

55
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:32,000
optimal plant Health yeah you said Leo

56
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:34,479
uh from offici andado and he told me you

57

63
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,200
about how you got started in the

64
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:52,479
industry the journey the journey let's

65
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:56,280
go back to the beginning when did you

66
00:02:52,479 --> 00:03:00,598
start smoking I first grew my first

67
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:04,680
plant uh in India in the Kulu mountains

68
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:08,238
when I was 12 really and my mom and my

69
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,439
pops uh kind of bailed me out because I

70
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,200
didn't fit in with the jocks and I

71
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:15,158
didn't fit in with the preppies and I

72
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:19,079
was in a New England old school hick out

73
00:03:15,158 --> 00:03:22,479
town so my subculture of skateboarders

74
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:25,000
and uh and delinquents kind of ran a

75
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:26,798
little wild and she would say to the

76
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
governor people if they asked how I was

77
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:32,760
doing that I wasn't in jail or the

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,878
hospital so was doing good and uh they

79
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:36,840
kind of made an intervention and they

80
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:39,438
took me to India for a year took me out

81
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:43,479
of eighth grade to show me the

82
00:03:39,438 --> 00:03:47,079
world and well I was free in India I had

83
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:49,639
a account uh at one of the local stores

84
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:53,159
that had fireworks so I got to like

85
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:54,679
build multi-stage fireworks and there

86
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:57,639
was wild

87
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,959
cannabis and I you know had a connection

88
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:03,078
with the plant where I didn't even

89
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:04,878
choose it I started a garden uh behind

90
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:08,439
my house that I was living at and in the

91
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:11,798
center of one of the beds what comes up

92
00:04:08,438 --> 00:04:13,680
a glorious plant and it's legal in India

93
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:16,600
so my mom was like sure you know rock

94
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:20,079
and roll with that thing nice and I grew

95
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:23,960
that we had a really fun time one time

96
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:26,879
we went down to the river and we cut all

97
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:29,879
this feral cannabis and we piled it up

98
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,759
in like a giant pile and lit it on fire

99
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:33,680
and we were dancing around it and we

100
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:38,560
didn't even know like we were pretty

101
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:41,120
innocent you know uh and I said children

102
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,079
weed of the Corn you know right it was

103
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,840
mashing and fed cows put cows to sleep

104
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:49,399
there's cows everywhere so we're like

105
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:52,799
let's feed the cows but uh yeah I got

106
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:54,879
connected to it early on and then uh I

107
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,680
kind of got my act together I went to

108
00:04:54,879 --> 00:05:00,519
art school in Boston and that's when I

109
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:04,280
started working with the Canadian

110
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:06,319
yeah and as you know you know before uh

111
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:08,758
I've heard you mention the green Bud

112
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:12,319
wave that came in and we were getting

113
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:15,759
like the Canadian ice and other

114
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:18,519
strains and boy was it glorious the

115
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,080
orange crush there's the ice there yeah

116
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:22,599
there was so many good ones I think they

117
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:25,560
called the freeze too right yeah yeah

118
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:28,639
yeah yeah and that stuff was moving good

119
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:31,680
and Boston had the most colleges per

120
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:35,319
capita in the United States and it was

121
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,519
like you know duffel bags at the door in

122
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:40,840
Good Times back in the day you know

123
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:43,038
where uh that city was good to me and it

124
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:46,719
kind of I had made some great friends

125
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:50,240
there and and Dove deeper into the you

126
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:53,680
know cannabis life I smoked I'm leaving

127
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,800
out the most important part so after I

128
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,959
came back from India I was still

129
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,079
connected to the plant and I'd cleaned

130
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:04,038
my brain up a little bit and I was more

131
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:07,079
on point and doing okay in school so you

132
00:06:04,038 --> 00:06:09,279
know no problems parents are happy and

133
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:12,318
every day before Home Room we'd go down

134
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:15,439
to an abandoned old church and we'd all

135
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:18,639
fade on a blunt and East Coast used to

136
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:21,478
be uh Phillies and you know we'd smoke

137
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,478
the Philly before home room and life was

138
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:26,918
glorious and I sat around with those

139
00:06:23,478 --> 00:06:30,199
guys and I said James that I don't know

140
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:32,439
what it was about her but I knew I was

141
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:34,520
going to smoke in my entire life and

142
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:37,199
that like it was so I'm like I was in

143
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:40,439
love with it yeah and you know to

144
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,560
parallel that then forward from Boston

145
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:47,360
you know kind of got into the other side

146
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:50,478
of things and uh and I moved to

147
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,639
California I was going to school for uh

148
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:55,399
computer animation in Boston at school

149
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:58,360
of Museum of Fine Arts and toughs and I

150
00:06:55,399 --> 00:07:00,878
also did kind of graph and some other

151
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,840
art and and

152
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:05,280
uh then I saw what was happening out

153
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:07,598
here in California and I was going to

154
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:09,439
have to get a job out here so came to

155
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:12,279
take a peek and it was like Boston was

156
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:14,519
in the dirt you know so competing

157
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:17,159
against the best animation schools

158
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:21,159
around where the industry is right and

159
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:25,599
so I toured around California with my

160
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:30,639
dad was an epic road trip we we drove

161
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:33,360
from La uh up to the bay and at one

162
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:37,680
point on the trip we go by vandenbberg

163
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:40,120
Air Force Base and my dad was like oh I

164
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,280
did not want to stop here and we were

165
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,560
prepared for like the whole way up the

166
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:48,158
five it's developed and then before you

167
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:52,120
hit vandenbberg there's like a 70 mile

168
00:07:48,158 --> 00:07:54,240
Gap and like a 70 mile Gap after it

169
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,639
right and the whole secret or the

170
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,519
conspiracy my dad was a big conspiracy

171
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:03,478
Guy taught me a lot and he was like they

172
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:07,519
fly everything in from the ocean there

173
00:08:03,478 --> 00:08:10,680
and it's like one Road in one road out

174
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:13,478
and we rolled into this town kind of

175
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,959
uneasy and it was really strange with

176
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:18,598
there was all the houses the cars were

177
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:20,959
parked in the driveways no lights no

178
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:22,878
people and we pull in there's like one

179
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:25,878
gas station so we get gas and my old

180
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:29,240
man's like leave the car run and he goes

181
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:30,800
into the uh get some things and uh and

182
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,879
get the gas and while I'm sitting there

183
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,399
Sheriff pulls up and he pulls up and he

184
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:38,120
rolls the window down a little bit and

185
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:41,479
he just stares and I'm like okay this is

186
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:44,120
a little strange and then behind him

187
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:47,519
comes the homeland security vehicle they

188
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:50,919
roll down the window they stare I'm like

189
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,919
okay this is getting really strange so

190
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:55,439
I'm like I'm gonna take five and just

191
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:57,399

193
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:03,320
graph and you know having good time

194
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:06,519
coming up the road and this bathroom had

195
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:08,440
like uh a word scratched in the wall

196
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:11,919
like out of a horror movie like a

197
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:16,000
thousand times the same word and I was

198
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:17,360
like oh really sketchy now so I come out

199

204
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:32,000

220
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:12,799
people that I met there totally and uh

221
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:15,159
then I was out there doing that and I

222
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:18,759
started picking back up things with the

223
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:21,039
Cannabis and uh I had my father he was

00:10:34,278 --> 00:10:38,559
was friends with Paul stamitz oh wow and

231
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:41,079
he moved into my apartment and he

232
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:44,919
started growing mushrooms in one of the

233
00:10:41,078 --> 00:10:47,479
old uh roommates rooms and then I was

234
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:50,599
like Dad you know I love the mushrooms

235
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:55,120
and all but we should really be growing

236
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:58,839
some cannabis so pops was like let's go

237
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,799

know the master grower in the back and

240
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,320
the humility and the wisdom and

241
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:13,680
father-son relationship nice and we

242

00:11:21,078 --> 00:11:25,239
been those were really good years you

247
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,399

cannabis and cannabis legalization we

249
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:32,480
were medical and yeah it was a special

250
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,679
time right especially in Oakland yeah

251
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,120

265
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:10,078

people for 36 we'd be like no we're

267

passing on that we're moving on down and

268
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,240
you used to do the run to where it was

269
00:12:15,078 --> 00:12:19,479
like you had to work Miracle your rent

270
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,480
was due and you go out and you go

271
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,639
through around town and hit your spots

272
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,680
and the you know my dad put it most

273
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,879
eloquently that I've ever heard in my

274
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:31,799
life is we spend a short time with the

275
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:35,600
plant I like to think of myself as a

276
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:37,639
Shepherd of the plant sure and you know

277
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,959
we don't know where it's going yeah but

278
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:42,680
my dad told me the plant knows where

279
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:45,559
it's going yeah it knows every joint it

280
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:47,679
knows every bowl pack it knows you know

281
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:49,799
all the people it's going to touch so to

282
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:52,838
be a part of it and help it's along its

283
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:55,719
way you know yeah a booster rocket of

284
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:57,560
sorts right sure we're all just stewards

285
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:00,360
at the end of the day

286
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:04,159
bless so you you know that

287
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:08,519
Journey uh you know that's kind of what

288
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:12,919
kicked it off and then in 2012 was the

289
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:14,519
Fallout when indor you know vanished uh

290
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:17,479
for the most part I remember going to

291
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:19,440
the grow stores and uh they told me

292
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,879
don't buy anything go next door to our

293
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,000
used warehouse and it was there was more

294
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:26,198
equipment in the used Warehouse yeah

295
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,559
than there was in the main store so I

296
00:13:26,198 --> 00:13:31,359
went to some people for wisdom I worked

297
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:33,599
with my father father um I was fortunate

298
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,680
enough to be around people that I

299
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,360
wouldn't have if I wasn't rolling with

300
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:41,958
him that really cared about me and took

301
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:45,360
care of me and uh I asked for wisdom

302
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:48,879
from one of my mentors Steve Smith uh

303
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,759
owned H net uh with his family he was

304
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:54,278
running that with his wife at the time

305
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:57,159
Kathy and uh his boys helped him out too

306
00:13:54,278 --> 00:13:59,519
and Steve uh mentored me and said well

307
00:13:57,159 --> 00:14:01,639
and during this transition

308
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:05,799
uh I think it's best for you to maybe

309
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:09,560
look up to mesino yeah and you know

310
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:13,000
expand so he told me Willets was a great

311
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:15,399
place and we started looking for real

312
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,600
estate and little did I know that

313
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:22,120
shutting down the 50 lighter because I

314
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:25,680
was so tired we had three houses going

315
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:28,560
and it was like forever harvests forever

316
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:30,479
trims and back like you we were saying

317
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:33,319
back in the day when we had one house

318
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,159
with 14 lights and everybody was happy

319
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:38,000
and we were making paper it was less

320
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:41,278
complicated yeah and then you know more

321
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,198
houses more work to where I was you know

322
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:48,879
at the tail end after you know almost 10

323
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:51,679
years in the bay burning out so it was a

324
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:55,078
revitalization of my cannabis Spirit

325
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:57,559
yeah and the warrior marches on but yeah

326
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:59,039
so let's talk about the genetics in 2003

327
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:00,599
what what kind of genetics were you guys

328
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:03,120
running when you first started growing

329
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:08,278
what rhymes with

330
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:12,159
2003 GDP nice yeah uh I was fortunate

331
00:15:08,278 --> 00:15:13,600
enough to run the uh Hell's Angels cut

332
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:16,919
and I don't know if you rever ran into

333
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:20,079
the Flatt top purple uhuh they only had

334
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:22,439
it at Grassroots and Grassroots was a

335
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:25,599
really great Club to me back in the day

336
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:28,399
Dan and Kevin are legendary they used to

337
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,879
take their employees to Hawaii like take

338
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:34,519
care of people was family you know and

339
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:38,039
Legendary Legendary and I also liked the

340
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:40,198
KKL I actually met the guy who made urle

341
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:42,360
really I'm like I don't think anybody

342
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:46,159
have you do you know anybody that knows

343
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:49,039
him uhuh he's totally unknown yeah uh I

344
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:49,879
was at one of the first farmers markets

345
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:52,519
in

346
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:53,720
mesino and there was an Oldtimer smoking

347
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:56,959
a

348
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:59,360
bong so I was like okay this gu is

349
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:01,719
serious yeah and I got the hanging with

350
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:05,120
him for a little bit and chatting and

351
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:09,199
he's like yeah you know URL I made

352
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,360
purple URL and I was like what and uh he

353
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:14,639
says to

354
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:18,000
me uh GDP just took my Ur and put big

355
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:20,198
butt on it and big bud sucks yeah and I

356
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,799
was like we all know if you came in with

357
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:26,159
a pack of the Urkle Done Right versus a

358
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:29,359
pack of the GDP the KKL was taken KKL

359
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:31,000
was fire the urk was amazing it wasn't

360
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,399
as big of buds though it was definitely

361
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,559
smaller buds but the TPS were there it

362
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:38,318
had that real floral floral TP you know

363
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:41,119
right you didn't have to cut the top off

364
00:16:38,318 --> 00:16:43,198
on week eight right because they rot we

365
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,399
all dealt with GDP where it was the most

366
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:48,039
beautiful

367
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:49,639
plant oh it was the slowest vegging too

368
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:51,599
they were the shortest slowest vegging

369
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:55,360
plants yeah it was good stuff I used to

370
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:58,920
use the Dual Spectrum the HPS with the

371
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,800
metal H wow and that veg things for me

372
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:03,318
the best is still my you know I haven't

373
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:06,038
gotten into the new LED world so I'm old

374
00:17:03,318 --> 00:17:08,438
school in that sense I like HPS I still

375
00:17:06,038 --> 00:17:11,359
like HPS I still think HPS creates a

376
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:14,199
great product uh you know LED creates a

377
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:17,678
good product too what's your opinion

378
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:21,120
on seeds that are bred under

379
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:26,000
HPS and Performing

380
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:28,078
outperforming uh the new LEDs with the

381
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,679
old school HPS because of maybe

382
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:31,759
epigenetic

383
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,559
and I'm like is that a far some people

384
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:37,038
say not true some people say true so I'm

385
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:38,519
just you know looking for more show me

386
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:40,200
the money show me the results I mean I

387
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:42,480
think we're we're r&amp; ding stuff right

388
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,880
now so I'm doing a lot of R&amp;D side by

389
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,240
side LED versus HPS also with seed

390
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,320
production I know with reversals I can

391
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,720
tell you reversals under HPS are

392
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:53,558
significantly better uh you know we're

393
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,120
talking about far red and stuff like

394
00:17:53,558 --> 00:17:58,440
that in the Spectrum right I think that

395
00:17:56,119 --> 00:18:00,918
adds to it so I do my reversals right

396
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,798
now but also experimenting on what is

397
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:06,280
the best way to do a reversal not only

398
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:08,440
reversal spray but also Spectrum um you

399
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:10,480
know and then collecting pollen versus

400
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,159
using life plants I prefer using live

401
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,319
plants when I'm pollinating but

402
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:16,679
collecting pollen is a you know a way to

403
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:19,439
hedge your bets for sure yeah I like

404
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:22,280
taking the tops off of a live pant and

405
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,600
putting them into a bag and then you

406
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:26,599
know getting the right before when the

407
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:29,359
bells are just about to open they're all

408
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:31,439
swollen yeah and I just Zam in the

409
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:34,000
garden I've even put on my spirit

410
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,200
animals a wolf sometimes when I'm doing

411
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,240
the breeding it's my most passionate

412
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:41,558
it's my heart so I put my wolf suit on

413
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,919
and I head out and I pull out the branch

414
00:18:41,558 --> 00:18:46,200
out of the bag when there's no wind and

415
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,960
I just open the flowerettes because I'm

416
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,720
like you I want that natural drift I

417
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,798
don't get a paintbrush anymore I've

418
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,159
tried that the hair's been all red

419
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:54,558
magnetism too we're talking about

420
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:56,760
magnetism there's all kinds of other

421
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:58,000
things that play I do a pollen I do a

422
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:59,839
pollen wand I don't know if you ever

423
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,798
seen that where you take when you're

424
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:03,279
when you're pollen's dumping on those

425
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:05,639
branches and you really want to hit the

426
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:08,480
room up rather than shaking it I'll take

427
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:10,720
and cut off the mail flowers tape up

428
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,839
several of them like a bouquet and walk

429
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,400
around dusting them you know you get

430
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:17,000
some good swings and it definitely

431
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,080
floats and you know pollen's a lot of

432
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,240
fun I think that that side of the the

433
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:24,599
plant is amazing to work with I did a

434
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:27,000
garden I I don't have neighbors close by

435
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:28,798
and I had retired out of you know

436
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:34,000
commercially growing and I just did a

437
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:36,960
seed patch and I let everything go and I

438
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,640
had multiple males and you know I called

439
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,640
the ones that I might not have liked but

440
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,038
I left a lot and I really got to watch

441
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:46,960
them just in their natural habitat come

442
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:49,400
to fruition and you know I made the note

443
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,919
as a breeder you know we spend this time

444
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:54,679
doing the selection but the plants seem

445
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:58,120
to also know to where I had my early

446
00:19:54,679 --> 00:20:00,480
males get on my early girls yeah and you

447
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:02,719
know the L ones you know Finding their

448
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:06,038
mates and whatnot and it was really

449
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:08,159
special to me to just let them Zen and I

450
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:10,879
was walking through James where I bumped

451
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:13,360
into a plant and it was like a pollen

452
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,480
Cloud yeah and there's videos of me just

453
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:17,959
surrounded by pollen and it's sparkling

454
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,679
and I'm like that's our fairy dust yeah

455
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,640
well and it's amazing time it's it's

456
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,000
amazing to see pollen fly if you've

457
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:26,159
really seen pollen fly where it's like a

458
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
wall it's almost like a cloud coming in

459
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,000
it's just and then sometimes it'll just

460
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,319
sail over the top of the canopy that's

461
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,679
that's great you know first time I ever

462
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:37,079
readed now I got to tell you the story

463
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:40,640
so I asked the gouts it's one of the

464
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:43,199
most legendary families in Round Valley

465
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:49,159
U Mikey G is a real legend in the

466
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:53,919
industry 23 pound plant 23b plant

467
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:56,600
23b plant 20 feet tall by 12T wide yeah

468
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:59,240
oh wow plus he was growing the pink

469
00:20:56,599 --> 00:21:01,558
Cadillac and I got to see it like this

470
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,480
guy's been amending his hoes so long

471
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:06,558
there's like a pallet of chicken [ __ ]

472
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:10,120
per hole wow and they're mounded up all

473
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:13,480
high been reworked and reworked he's got

474
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:17,759
big mounds and I saw that plant and I

475
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:20,480
was like man of course his name is Mikey

476
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:23,038
and I'm like ca he's Michael Jordan and

477
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:27,200
then uh he walks up to and he's like

478
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:30,640
it's got three layers of netting and

479
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:33,360
he's he's like takes a huge Cola and

480
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,600
it's probably a half pound and he bends

481
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:38,038
it down all the way to the ground like

482
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:40,399
rubs the ground and he's like look at

483
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:43,000
how strong it is and you and I know some

484
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,679
strains can bend and some will snap yeah

485
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,440
but just to see that strength and that

486
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,240
connection totally and I had set out for

487
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,720
a couple years after that being like I'm

488
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,798
going to grow a 20 PB plane and I was

489
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:58,720
like well maybe in the future but I

490
00:21:55,798 --> 00:22:01,278
recognized you know I'm good at ball but

491
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,200
you're seeing Michael Jordan yeah and

492
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:09,440
you know just to be around them and to

493
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:12,080
see that Zen uh Magic totally yeah yeah

494
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:15,200
when your limit six plants that that can

495
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:17,119
go a long ways hey 25 they used to when

496
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,400
I first moved to meno they were like

497
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:22,759
unless you pull 250 you're just losing

498
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,240
yeah and it was like that's was a

499
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:29,720
daunting task coming from indoor rooms

500
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:33,240
were like 20 lb yeah 40 lb

501
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:37,640
but uh I got there yeah yeah yeah yeah

502
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:41,558
nice and I was part of uh the the

503
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:44,799
911 program in mesino with the 99 plants

504
00:22:41,558 --> 00:22:47,278
which was the I wish we could go back

505
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:49,278
yeah old doc hop used to give out the

506
00:22:47,278 --> 00:22:52,119
shirts where you'd go there and there'd

507
00:22:49,278 --> 00:22:54,679
be line for like three hours wow with

508
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:57,839
like 50 people because he said that you

509
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:59,559
could grow 99 plants with his shirt yeah

510
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:00,918
and if the sh sh busted you I don't

511
00:22:59,558 --> 00:23:03,558
think he was going to tell you that you

512
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:07,720
could but a lot of people including me

513
00:23:03,558 --> 00:23:10,319
were under that Mirage sure and you know

514
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:12,159
in cannabis there's a constant you know

515
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:14,759
people have to realize that that's been

516
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:17,679
a it's it's a difficult industry to

517
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:20,599
navigate like you and me finding good

518
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:23,519
advice or the right people it's the most

519
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:26,079
valuable thing yeah people talk about

520
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:28,599
Terah and yeah there's the ground and

521
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:31,439
the air and the dirt but don't forget

522
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:33,839
about the friendships and the farmers

523
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,320
and like that is the knowledge the

524
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:38,359
knowledge right like we go to somebody's

525
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:40,599
Garden there's always something that

526
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:43,079
shines yeah where you're like everybody

527
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:48,000
grows different and you know a thousand

528
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:50,199
ways to skin a cat but uh you see that

529
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,200
gold and everybody I pick up you know

530
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,240
the little nuances and something from

531
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,159
this Garden something from that garden

532
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,200
and it takes years to get good that's

533
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,278
what a lot of people don't understand

534
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,600
they want an instant gratification

535
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:01,880
you know you'll have good weed you might

536
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:04,119
have good weed your first time you might

537
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,919
not right but if you keep doing it no

538
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:08,278
matter what you are going to get good

539
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,600
and that's just how it works I

540
00:24:08,278 --> 00:24:11,720
everything's kind of like that in life

541
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:13,439
but definitely growing and if you're

542
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,400
passionate you love it you are going to

543
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,919
get to grow good weed it's just a matter

544
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:20,000
of time we had hard apprentices

545
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,919
apprenticeships back in the day you know

546
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,159
you and I worked in a a criminal time

547
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:27,440
where you wore a lot of hats in this

548
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:28,919
business you know you're an electrician

549
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,558
Security man

550
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:34,200
uh family man contractor

551
00:24:31,558 --> 00:24:36,519
contractor you the funny stories you

552
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,440
tell people I tried not to drift too far

553
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:41,359
or at least you could connect somewhat

554
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:43,600
to reality to be like oh yeah I'm heac

555
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:47,199
guy we're working on a double stage

556
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:49,879
system with you know we're silencing the

557
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,679
motors right yeah that was key they

558
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,120
bubble wrapped the motors back in the

559
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,360
day cuz that thing was humming at

560
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:57,759
midnight yeah and it quieted up yeah I

561
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:58,839
mean there was a lot of problems to be

562
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:02,200
solved back

563
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:03,720
then uh and then without the internet it

564
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,679
was all about the circle of people you

565
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,759
knew now the internet's open it up with

566
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,640
information but it's still hard to

567
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:13,079
decipher what's right and what's wrong

568
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,000
you know because you'll hear on the

569
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:18,960
internet 20 different opinions on the

570
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:23,759
same thing salt versus organic versus

571
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:25,159
cocoa versus aquaponics uh you know dwc

572
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:26,759
whatever and they're all they're all

573
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:28,919
fine you just have to learn how to tweak

574
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:31,359
them and get them for you and figure out

575
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:33,440
if that's the path you want to go down

576
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:35,519
right I think it's really you know

577
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,278
interesting now that the Market's

578
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:39,679
expanding and we're getting into

579
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:42,679
agricultural equipment and yeah what

580
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:46,200
they're talking about and uh you know

581
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:48,000
moving things forward in large Fields uh

582
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:51,919
specifically I've been talking with

583
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:57,079
someone that grows this amazing varietal

584
00:25:51,919 --> 00:26:00,159
uh of knf uh and fiber and it's a

585
00:25:57,079 --> 00:26:02,678
hibiscus Hy hybrid wow and the seeds

586
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:05,360
look like triangles they're black

587
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:08,399
they're like the size of a dime really

588
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:13,079
and it grows the stock is like

589
00:26:08,398 --> 00:26:17,239
30% more uh than any other stock on like

590
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:19,119
in the game yeah and it doesn't have THC

591
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,079
it doesn't have CBD so all these

592
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:25,278
pitfalls that now we're seeing you know

593
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:27,439
like um my buddies in Iowa and he's one

594
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:28,839
of the only four licenses and he grows

595
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,840
CBG

596
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:35,639
yeah and CBG helps people we don't even

597
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:40,119
understand how much yet cancer yep it's

598
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:42,799
a winner and thca CBG they are just

599
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:44,639
amazing golden he was the first time he

600
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:46,558
grew it he was all paranoid because he's

601
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,840
like what's up with this stuff on the

602
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:51,798
plants and he said it was almost like a

603
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:55,278
powder yeah and that was the

604
00:26:51,798 --> 00:26:58,599
CVG I guess an expression of non

605
00:26:55,278 --> 00:27:00,839
psychoactive uh both both thca and CB BG

606
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:03,199
non psychoactive CBD is also non

607
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:05,398
psychoactive but I mean all these

608
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,519
cannabinoids are extremely beneficial

609
00:27:05,398 --> 00:27:09,479
we're just scratching the surface on how

610
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:12,359
they can be used and how they can be

611
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:15,120
worked in with drugs and other things

612
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:17,359
you know on the drug Discovery side I

613
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:18,558
think we're going there and it's not

614
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:21,199
going to stop and we're going to learn a

615
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:23,720
lot right so we were talking this guy's

616
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:27,120
in contract and working with some large

617
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:31,278
people in oil and gas yeah and this

618
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:35,239
plant is three times uh uh reduces the

619
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:38,079
carbon FR uh footprint three times of

620
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:40,359
rainforest yeah so there's a lot of

621
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:42,439
incentive and like like I was saying

622
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:44,479
with the World Market opening up it's

623
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:48,919
like we're working with an

624
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:53,960

648
00:28:56,278 --> 00:29:03,720
and they drink it in India it's still

649
00:28:58,359 --> 00:29:08,519
ceremony drank by the uh military once a

650
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:12,839
year and Steve Smith had made some at

651
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:14,519
hopenet and I tried brownies and uh

652
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:17,038
everything under the sun and when I

653
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:19,000
drank this drink I was like what is

654
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:21,240
happening yeah well people don't believe

655
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,079
wheed is psychedelic but it can be

656
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:26,079
psychedelic I've had the same kind of

657
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:29,079
experience with bang so right and so you

658
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:31,678
know uh he was kind of my grand father

659
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:34,359
uh and my mentor and I went to him and I

660
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:37,640
said you know I really like your milk

661
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:39,359
and I want to make something like it and

662
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:42,840
he said as long as you make something

663
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:47,959
different then go for it and so I was

664
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:51,000
like let's put hemp milk in it yeah and

665
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:53,120
instead of cow milk all these problems

666
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,839
with milk and people being lactose

667
00:29:53,119 --> 00:30:00,119
intolerant not to mention that my genius

668
00:29:56,839 --> 00:30:02,359
idea there that I felt felt was putting

669
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:06,199
it in with the plant yeah and so I'm

670
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:08,038
like the hemp is it the herb is it it's

671
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:11,080
multi-dimensional

672
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:12,720
Multiverse and uh we started making this

673
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:16,558
hemp uh

674
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:19,480
infused chocolate milk and so like you

675
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:21,839
said psychedelic it surely was the

676
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:25,519
stories that I hear you know I served

677
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:28,240
over 400,000 bottles wow and I like the

678
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:30,558
good stories versus the bad ones sure

679
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,759
you know you hear a lot more bad stories

680
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:37,440
than you do good stories so

681
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:39,640
paranoia oh list goes on but you know

682
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,120
what shines for me is when you know we

683
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:43,600
would drink it with a couple of friends

684
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:45,398
and you'd feel like you're in high

685
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:48,959
school and people start bouncing around

686
00:30:45,398 --> 00:30:53,639
the trampoline laughing nonstop having a

687
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:56,038
great time and the wavelength of it uh

688
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:59,159
we always put in multiple strains we

689
00:30:56,038 --> 00:31:01,398
were like into the Entourage effect I

690
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:04,159
wanted to fill the wheel out before it

691
00:31:01,398 --> 00:31:07,239
was even the wheel yeah and you know

692
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:09,240
when I said my dad invented fresh frozen

693
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,000
it was specific for like edible

694
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,960
manufacturer I'm sure there's some other

695
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,960
people that also were experimenting with

696
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:20,278
that at the time uh and we were running

697
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:21,960
trim at the table and uh the old man

698
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:23,519
didn't want to deal with it so he said

699
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:26,159
just stick it in the freezer with the

700
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:28,200
garbage bag and then you know we're

701
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:30,519
running through material making the milk

702
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:34,278
and he said grabb that bag out of the

703
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:36,558
freezer let's try that out yeah and uh

704
00:31:34,278 --> 00:31:39,759
we started working with that and it was

705
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:42,119
like yeah just like live Rosen you know

706
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:46,240
there's a world of difference so we were

707
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:48,959
like we're running with this and uh we

708
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:52,399
built that up James to where even out in

709
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:54,278
mesino I had a 10K garden and we put on

710
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:57,278
Leatherman gloves and we strip the

711
00:31:54,278 --> 00:31:59,638
entire garden and we pack them into 5B

712
00:31:57,278 --> 00:32:02,919
bricks I seen people doing fresh frozen

713
00:31:59,638 --> 00:32:05,398
manufacturing and it's painful I'm like

714
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:07,759
having 20 trimmers come out to your farm

715
00:32:05,398 --> 00:32:10,239
and sit on a table and manicure it all

716
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:12,319
fresh that's nice and all but I don't

717
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,638
have the money to pay for that and I

718
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:16,599
don't want to see it come out of my

719
00:32:13,638 --> 00:32:19,599
pocket M and I had one of the most

720
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:22,439
robust extraction techniques ever to see

721
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:25,839
cannabis with putting it into a boiling

722
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:30,360
kettle of milk and just letting it ride

723
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:34,319
when we made the milk and uh got things

724
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:37,479
going uh you expanded uh we were

725
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:40,038
inspired like you said by uh the

726
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,639
hallucinogenic experience it offered so

727
00:32:40,038 --> 00:32:45,319
we came up with the name

728
00:32:41,638 --> 00:32:49,119
chakaa nice inspired by Co Capelli and

729
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:52,200
iasa oh yeah and like you said people

730
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:54,158
would have an experience and it put that

731
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,720
into perspective like we had a guy who

732
00:32:54,159 --> 00:33:00,760
was cocky at the trim table and he was

733
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:03,360
like bro Edibles don't don't hit me I

734
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:05,798
I'm not even sweating I'll I'll Ace a

735
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:08,879
huge amount of Wasa and my dad and I

736
00:33:05,798 --> 00:33:10,480
were like this is gonna be fun yeah and

737
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,919
you know we waited and got the last

738
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,480
bottom of the barrel just like in a

739
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:17,519
whiskey barrel you know really good

740
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:20,079
stuff back then and uh we filled up a

741
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,798
glass for him and it was like you needed

742
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:26,359
2 ounces of this stuff and you were

743
00:33:21,798 --> 00:33:29,558
floor yeah and he drank the glass and

744
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:31,439
uh he bringing him back to his place

745
00:33:29,558 --> 00:33:32,638
after it was after the trim we made sure

746
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,120
not to give it to him while we're

747
00:33:32,638 --> 00:33:37,240
working sure so right before he leaves

748
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:40,879
and we I'm giving him a ride back from

749
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:42,399
Oakland to San Francisco and he's he's

750
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,159
starting to get a little

751
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:46,959
shaky and uh I said to him what are you

the like parked and ready to go in like

764
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:18,320
10 seconds and he opens the door slowly

765
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:20,720
and he stands up and he holds the door

766
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,720
and he just

767
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:25,760
stands and then he gets back in the car

768
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:28,559
and he's like I can't go in there right

769
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,800

775
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:44,919
now so I leave him at his house and I'm

776
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,399
looking at him in the rear view as I'm

777
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:49,559
pulling off and he's just standing in

778
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:52,480
the middle of the row oh man and he said

779
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:54,878
he calls his roommate up uh from his

780
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:58,559
couch and he couldn't even talk it was

781
00:34:54,878 --> 00:35:00,838
like his roommate like heard murmuring

782
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:02,440
and he's like wait are you in your room

783
00:35:00,838 --> 00:35:03,920
right now cuz you could hear murmuring

784
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,760
from the other room he's like in the

785
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:09,280
living room and he's there on the couch

786
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:11,880
and he was like it was a threed day long

787
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,760
trip James W he was like it was more

788
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:16,119
powerful than any psychedelic he had

789
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:21,440
ever taken he was like all I did was

790
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:23,760
sleep and eat and like fry yeah so you

791
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,280
know not that I want people to go that

792
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:29,359
far but again like you were saying that

793
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:31,440
you can have the cere monial experience

794
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:33,039
you can repair it is a ceremonial

795
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,800
experience at a certain level and people

796
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:36,838
don't most people unless you've gone

797
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,880
there you wouldn't fully understand you

798
00:35:36,838 --> 00:35:41,279
know it's not just heightened perception

799
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:43,000
you know your perception's heightened or

800
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,519
whatever it's like you can get full

801
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:49,039
colors you can have crazy

802
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:50,239
experiences it's not hallucinate yeah I

803
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:53,838
wouldn't say you're going to hallucinate

804
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:55,439
like LSD right or like mushrooms or like

805
00:35:53,838 --> 00:35:58,279
some of these other but it is

806
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,920
psychedelic definitely especially colors

807
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:03,319
man I've seen some Wild colors and had

00:43:31,559 --> 00:43:37,200
I I turn it over and and work it and

970
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:39,239
then depending on sometimes I'm like

971
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:41,519
experimenting with taking it stuff

972
00:43:39,239 --> 00:43:44,199
that's partially broken down yeah

973
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:47,719
because I've done experiments with tpin

974
00:43:44,199 --> 00:43:50,838
where I put in fresh crushed grapes uh

975
00:43:47,719 --> 00:43:52,879
my friend had concord grapes and I

976
00:43:50,838 --> 00:43:55,078
crushed them up like The Wine Guys my

977
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,720
feet and threw it on top of the plants

978
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:59,280
and there was mad fruit flies but it was

979
00:43:56,719 --> 00:44:02,159
outdoor so I didn't care and you know

980
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:05,240
that year was kind of a little bit of a

981
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:07,838
hint but then the next year the plant

982
00:44:05,239 --> 00:44:09,598
tastes like pure grape that's awesome so

983
00:44:07,838 --> 00:44:12,279
I'm like there's something to be said to

984
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:14,359
letting it just organically break down

985
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:16,480
yeah so I'm leaving chunks of fruit in

986
00:44:14,358 --> 00:44:22,199
this time you know I saw apples in the

987
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:24,039
pile and uh uh rose buds and uh

988
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:26,679
different fruits I have an amazing

989
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:29,480
ancient Orchard uh around my property

990
00:44:26,679 --> 00:44:32,558
and on my property wow so was like I was

991
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:35,318
just getting hairs I'm getting uh

992
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:38,480
everything that drops and you know huge

993
00:44:35,318 --> 00:44:41,679
side by side loads of fruit dumping it

994
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:45,400
yeah awesome yeah so building the dirt I

995
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:47,919
mean it's fun again uh people say farmer

996
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:52,079
this is a big thing that I got so like

997
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:54,838
wrecked on do you know what farmer means

998
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:57,680
historically someone who works the farm

999
00:44:54,838 --> 00:45:01,880
I thought so too MH and until I found

1000
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:05,719
out historically a farmer is a tax

1001
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:07,318
man and he collected taxes and back in

1002
00:45:05,719 --> 00:45:11,078
the days when we're talking about these

1003
00:45:07,318 --> 00:45:14,000
Farms they were huge yeah and there were

1004
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:17,200
workers and peasants and the workers and

1005
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:20,400
the peasant worked the fields and the

1006
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:23,439
farmer collected the taxes huh so I'm

1007
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,160
like I'm not a farmer anymore I'm done

1008
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:27,679
with that with cannabis I don't

1009
00:45:25,159 --> 00:45:32,399
represent myself like that

1010
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:35,799
uh and on that note I said what's an

1011
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:38,599
Eden a garden and I'm like I'm a

1012
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:41,160
gardener nice yeah and I like saying

1013
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:43,760
that you know totally Gardener you know

1014
00:45:41,159 --> 00:45:46,838
Steward Gardener yeah that's what's up

1015
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:49,480
yeah the Garden of Eden Y and so I

1016
00:45:46,838 --> 00:45:52,000
planted fruit trees this year in my

1017
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:55,559
patch it was one of my favorite

1018
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,599
experiences of my life to go to the uh

1019
00:45:55,559 --> 00:46:00,200
grow store where you know spent a

1020
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:04,400
hundred bracks and nutrients over the

1021
00:46:00,199 --> 00:46:06,838
years and dirt and pick up trees and I

1022
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:09,160
was just smiling and everybody there was

1023
00:46:06,838 --> 00:46:12,039
so happy and I planted them for my

1024
00:46:09,159 --> 00:46:14,480
family for my children for my wife I

1025
00:46:12,039 --> 00:46:16,400
said me and you have difficult things

1026
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:19,240
staying in the Cannabis with our

1027
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:21,079
families is extremely challenging yeah

1028
00:46:19,239 --> 00:46:23,199
it's uh different than a lot of other

1029
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:28,160
Industries where there's ups and

1030
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:32,358
downs and uh unexpected territory so you

1031
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:36,879
know to have uh the family with you and

1032
00:46:32,358 --> 00:46:40,719
behind you is sacred and uh they help me

1033
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:43,720
uh to this day and I put roses in the

1034
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:46,639
garden James because sometimes me and my

1035
00:46:43,719 --> 00:46:50,519
wife might have a tough day and I said I

1036
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:53,318
want to remind myself to how beautiful

1037
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:55,639
love is and that if I plant more roses

1038
00:46:53,318 --> 00:46:58,480
in the garden that'll remind me how

1039
00:46:55,639 --> 00:47:01,159
beautiful my life is and my wife is and

1040
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:03,838
my children are and all the great people

1041
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:07,239
on this planet that's awesome and you

1042
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:09,000
know more of that flee yeah and I said

1043
00:47:07,239 --> 00:47:11,879
the trees will grow up around and the

1044
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,838
ganja plants will grow in the center you

1045
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:16,960
can eat the fruit I always love walking

1046
00:47:13,838 --> 00:47:18,960
around outdoor patches with fruit trees

1047
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,240
yeah and it's like on the garden tour

1048
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,760
like when you go through your room it's

1049
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:26,039
room to room you know outdoor it's uh

1050
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,480
bed to bed and you're eating the fresh

1051
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:30,880
fruit because everything is ready it's

1052
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:33,159
harvest time it all comes down it all

1053
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,440
comes down yeah so let's talk about

1054
00:47:33,159 --> 00:47:36,399
genetics for a little bit I mean you're

1055
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:40,318
a breeder you do seed production you do

1056
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:43,358
a lot of stuff I brought my box you

1057
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:45,279
brought the box from my this is part of

1058
00:47:43,358 --> 00:47:47,318
my seed Vault and it's a little dirty

1059
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:49,119
because it's dirty on the hill yeah you

1060
00:47:47,318 --> 00:47:51,279
know people talk about how you keep your

1061
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:53,880
seeds this is a good thing I like to

1062
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:57,519
keep mine in this generic box in the

1063
00:47:53,880 --> 00:48:01,440
garage in a cool place nice

1064
00:47:57,519 --> 00:48:05,480
and uh you control humidity uh it stays

1065
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:08,240
ambient and cool yeah it's a three star

1066
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:12,519
uh garage with an office and a two room

1067
00:48:08,239 --> 00:48:15,358
so the back room is Just Kosher nice and

1068
00:48:12,519 --> 00:48:18,960
uh yeah if I need to close the door run

1069
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:21,719
a heater I mean a cooler I'm dyslexic

1070
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:24,519
yeah part of my genius people don't know

1071
00:48:21,719 --> 00:48:27,519
about dyslexia they always look at it as

1072
00:48:24,519 --> 00:48:30,280
a uh you know I was brought up as a

1073
00:48:27,519 --> 00:48:32,440
learning disability MH and it's like my

1074
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:35,640
mom was an amazing Advocate taking me to

1075
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:38,880
India helping me with my dyslexia and

1076
00:48:35,639 --> 00:48:41,679
what people don't realize is people with

1077
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:43,599
dyslexia uh get confused like the bus

1078
00:48:41,679 --> 00:48:45,279
going from the left to the right usually

1079
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:46,599
people know their route and they go to

1080
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:50,040
the right side and they come up with

1081
00:48:46,599 --> 00:48:52,119
similar answers but when you're dyslexic

1082
00:48:50,039 --> 00:48:54,719
you go to the other side and I love the

1083
00:48:52,119 --> 00:48:56,798
saying straight out of left field yeah

1084
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:59,279
and you come up with something different

1085
00:48:56,798 --> 00:49:01,639
and also have ADD where like I can

1086
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:04,280
single task better than anyone in the

1087
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:06,679
room and you know people talk about add

1088
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:09,280
with being losing your attention and not

1089
00:49:06,679 --> 00:49:12,519
being a to focus but it's actually quite

1090
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:15,960
the opposite absolutely so you know I'm

1091
00:49:12,519 --> 00:49:17,920
loving that Superhero aspect and you

1092
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:19,798
know my mom went to a seminar about

1093
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,720
dyslexia and after they told them all

1094
00:49:19,798 --> 00:49:24,079
these brilliant things that dyslexics

1095
00:49:21,719 --> 00:49:25,879
can do the first question from the crowd

1096
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:28,119
was what do I have to do to become

1097
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:30,480
dyslexic

1098
00:49:28,119 --> 00:49:31,280
so to everyone out there that has that

1099
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,480
you

1100
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:37,040
know I I applaud you and it can be

1101
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:40,838
challenging but it can also be rewarding

1102
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:43,759
so yeah and genetics so I brought the

1103
00:49:40,838 --> 00:49:47,519
Box Black Sheep

1104
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:49,480
genetics and I had I said you know I

1105
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:51,719
wanted to really just show you some of

1106
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:54,440
the work and here it is like me and you

1107
00:49:51,719 --> 00:49:58,639
make it I have fancy

1108
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:58,639
packaging show you some of that

1109
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:05,599
cool with the colors absolutely but then

1110
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:09,200
I also got our tried and true Sif good

1111
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:12,440
stuff yeah so I brought out some of my

1112
00:50:09,199 --> 00:50:14,439
library we can start checking out I came

1113
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:16,798
up with a really cool thing I think for

1114
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:20,200
the industry you know I like to be

1115
00:50:16,798 --> 00:50:23,199
creative I'm an inventor I'm an

1116
00:50:20,199 --> 00:50:26,239
alchemist uh and so there's all this

1117
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:27,719
waste yeah and the seed packages you

1118
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:32,879
know

1119
00:50:27,719 --> 00:50:36,598
nobody cares about this right right so I

1120
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:39,358
said I've counted so many seeds with the

1121
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:42,160
cards with the spinnies with a lot of

1122
00:50:39,358 --> 00:50:47,920
things and then I had the Epiphany what

1123
00:50:42,159 --> 00:50:50,519
about a pill pack and uh that pill packs

1124
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:54,720
are made specific sizes so they have

1125
00:50:50,519 --> 00:50:57,400
like z z in a Range sure and then I said

1126
00:50:54,719 --> 00:51:00,318
I could just go over the swipe card like

1127
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:02,880
the P they way they fill pill packs is

1128
00:51:00,318 --> 00:51:04,838
they have a board and you set them in

1129
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:08,920
and then you just swipe a card over it

1130
00:51:04,838 --> 00:51:12,558
it fills to the volume right so I match

1131
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:14,680
the volume to the quantity of seeds and

1132
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:18,519
the size of the seed and then I'm

1133
00:51:14,679 --> 00:51:21,159
putting them in these gelatin pill packs

1134
00:51:18,519 --> 00:51:23,759
nice and I'm like that's biodegradable

1135
00:51:21,159 --> 00:51:25,960
yes it's a great way to compact it and

1136
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:31,079
then you know the future of this is to

1137
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:33,400
have you know a 10 um cell pack sure and

1138
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:34,240
have 10 I shared pollen last year with

1139
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:37,039
10

1140
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:39,639
farms and it was an experiment James let

1141
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:42,480
me tell you to where some of them made

1142
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:45,000
some seeds some of them didn't that's

1143
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:48,719
how it goes yeah that's how it goes I

1144
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:51,519
feel you my my goal is that one day we

1145
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:54,919
can share pollen and put in 10 of our

1146
00:51:51,519 --> 00:51:57,559
selects from each different breeder nice

1147
00:51:54,920 --> 00:52:00,240
and gift you know that as you know

1148
00:51:57,559 --> 00:52:01,559
ultimate fenal hunt yeah well and it's

1149
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:03,239
really great if you have something that

1150
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:04,960
you really like and to be able to take

1151
00:52:03,239 --> 00:52:06,159
the pollen from that put it on 10

1152
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,798
different things from 10 different

1153
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:11,358
people and then grow those out and and

1154
00:52:08,798 --> 00:52:13,639
look at what was passed on by the

1155
00:52:11,358 --> 00:52:15,558
parents uh you get some interesting

1156
00:52:13,639 --> 00:52:16,598
results and you really start to

1157
00:52:15,559 --> 00:52:17,839
understand your lines better I think

1158
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:18,798
that's a great way to understand your

1159
00:52:17,838 --> 00:52:21,679
breeding

1160
00:52:18,798 --> 00:52:23,559
lines uh and it's also a fun way to

1161
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:25,000
collaborate with your friends and people

1162
00:52:23,559 --> 00:52:27,359
that are out there you know it's it's

1163

great higher Heights is you know has

1164
00:52:27,358 --> 00:52:33,639
high standards yeah and uh he was like

1165
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:36,599
unless you make the four plants I'm not

1166
00:52:33,639 --> 00:52:38,558
even willing to accept it as yours wow

1167
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:41,000
and you know he says you make the first

1168
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:43,960
cross Y and then you make the second

1169
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:46,559
cross and then you cross cross those and

1170
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:48,760
then it's yours right and he works with

1171

the world like two times over for it and

1198

1199
00:54:00,838 --> 00:54:06,440
with his white caviar which was really

1200
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:08,240
nice plan I know he's doing some

1201

1205
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:19,000
to hit him up I don't think he has it

1206
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:21,960
right now but somebody has it out there

1207

Frenchie kept everything Frenchie was

1208
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:26,760
the Vault for him yeah he explained that

1209
00:54:24,159 --> 00:54:28,358
as every seed they got I just got some

1210
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:30,000
of his vanilla berry pie I don't know if

1211
00:54:28,358 --> 00:54:32,558
you remember that one I ran it so yeah

1212
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,559
so I did too and in 2018 I ran it it was

1213
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:38,280
out in probably 2016 same year and so

1214
00:54:35,559 --> 00:54:40,960
out of a patch of a lot of plants in my

1215
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:43,599
buddy's backyard there was this little

1216
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:45,480
area of these white plants and and they

1217
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:46,640
stood out from 50 feet away and

1218
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:49,838
everybody that would go back there would

1219
00:54:46,639 --> 00:54:52,318
be like what's that what's that we lost

1220
00:54:49,838 --> 00:54:55,199
the cut it was the best and the turps

1221
00:54:52,318 --> 00:54:58,400
were amazing it was super turpy it was

1222
00:54:55,199 --> 00:55:01,159
berries and it was ass and it was amaz

1223
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:03,519
amazing nose I mean it was very very

1224
00:55:01,159 --> 00:55:05,519
loud all of the Expressions were loud

1225
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:07,719
out of 10 seeds or 12 seeds I don't

1226
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:09,960
remember what it was but super white and

1227
00:55:07,719 --> 00:55:11,480
super Frosty and sticky like the old

1228
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:13,559
school sticky you don't see sticky as

1229
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:16,880
much as you used to I hear you uh it's

1230
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:20,119
like a photographic memory for me James

1231
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:23,599
and I could see vanilla berry pie on row

1232
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:25,240
five in my upper patch 18 and it was

1233
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:27,960
similar because we had people walking

1234
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:29,879
through the gardens and I kid you not

1235
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:33,639
people said the exact same thing coming

1236
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:36,920
through my patch being like what's that

1237
00:55:33,639 --> 00:55:40,798
and the structure of it it branched out

1238
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:44,680
it grew so uniformed and strong strong

1239
00:55:40,798 --> 00:55:47,119
and just boom boom boom just kept going

1240
00:55:44,679 --> 00:55:48,480
yeah yep so Leo gave me 20 of those

1241
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:51,798
seeds we're running them here that's

1242
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:53,639
what we're in the middle run I'm glad to

1243
00:55:51,798 --> 00:55:55,639
bring back some of these things you're

1244
00:55:53,639 --> 00:55:58,679
talking about bringing that back guess

1245
00:55:55,639 --> 00:56:00,598
what I have popped what do you got I

1246
00:55:58,679 --> 00:56:05,719
Caleb the

1247
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:10,280
librarian uh CSI yeah and just released

1248
00:56:05,719 --> 00:56:11,159
GDP yeah I saw yeah and and Bubba he's

1249
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:14,079
got

1250
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:16,358
Bubba bro I gave the Bubba to one of the

1251
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:17,839
best indoor Growers that I knew and I

1252
00:56:16,358 --> 00:56:20,279
was like I'm not sure if you're going to

1253
00:56:17,838 --> 00:56:23,440
want to run this and he was like

1254
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:25,319
definitely yeah and I was like yes I and

1255
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,679
as much as you and I can grow you know

1256
00:56:25,318 --> 00:56:27,960
you got to give some other things to

1257
00:56:26,679 --> 00:56:31,480
other people because we can't grow it

1258
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:33,760
all no so I'm doing the GDP and I'm

1259
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:36,079
doing the Urkel from him yeah and then

1260
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:38,240
Urkel tends to be trickier where he ran

1261
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:42,680
a couple different fenos he's on his

1262
00:56:38,239 --> 00:56:47,000
chit yeah and uh so he had like plant

1263
00:56:42,679 --> 00:56:50,480
number 106 and 103 and then he made a

1264
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:53,199
cross of Grape Ape Urkle and I was like

1265
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:55,240
yes please I really want to revitalize

1266
00:56:53,199 --> 00:56:57,879
the pers so what do you think Grape Ape

1267
00:56:55,239 --> 00:56:59,399
is genetics wi cuz I I don't know that

1268
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:01,079
I'm not asking as a trick question or

1269
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:02,798
anything but like Grape Ape there was

1270
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:06,039
the big argument between Grape Ape and

1271
00:57:02,798 --> 00:57:07,480
GDP being sisters I don't know they're

1272
00:57:06,039 --> 00:57:09,079
they're very different plants I mean

1273
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:12,838
they're completely they grow very

1274
00:57:09,079 --> 00:57:16,280
different from what I understand Mr pers

1275
00:57:12,838 --> 00:57:18,679
man made the great paper yeah rest in

1276
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:19,960
peace Mr pers yeah there's there's

1277
00:57:18,679 --> 00:57:21,159
somebody else out there trying to take

1278
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:23,960
credit we're not even going to say his

1279
00:57:21,159 --> 00:57:26,000
name on the show but uh you know either

1280
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:29,199
way it doesn't even matter same thing

1281
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:31,760
with GDP they're both amazing yes Grape

1282
00:57:29,199 --> 00:57:34,879
Ape was a it would stack it would get

1283
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:38,200
huge whereas [ __ ] GDP would be small

1284
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:40,318
and dude pungent super pungent and I

1285
00:57:38,199 --> 00:57:43,598
think grap apape was more subtle we used

1286
00:57:40,318 --> 00:57:45,279
to run nine plants in a 4x4 we had

1287
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:48,160
played with all the numbers it's like if

1288
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:51,319
you were growing GDP the magic number

1289
00:57:48,159 --> 00:57:53,759
was nine for us nice yeah my dad used to

1290
00:57:51,318 --> 00:57:55,679
run a flashlight over my canopy when I

1291
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:57,799
started apprenticing under him and he

1292
00:57:55,679 --> 00:58:01,480
said if you could see the light and I

1293
00:57:57,798 --> 00:58:04,358
was screwing up wow and you know our

1294
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:06,920
cies were so solid and we used to run

1295
00:58:04,358 --> 00:58:08,920
you know uh back in the day there was

1296
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:11,880
two types of Growers I'd like to say you

1297
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:14,039
know in the on the ends there was the PG

1298
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:16,760
e Growers and there was the other

1299
00:58:14,039 --> 00:58:19,440
Growers right and so we were putting up

1300
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:21,960
three lights per table yeah with the

1301
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:25,480
ultimate goal of getting you know 4 lbs

1302
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:29,159
out of a 4x8 table three lights per 3

1303
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:32,519
600s 3, 3000s on a

1304
00:58:29,159 --> 00:58:34,798
3, my old man was a Savage where we

1305
00:58:32,519 --> 00:58:37,440
bought horux and were suckers for a

1306
00:58:34,798 --> 00:58:41,440
while and then he was like check this

1307
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:44,639
out son and he pops open a case and it's

1308
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:47,599
Gees yeah and he got him for 20 bucks

1309
00:58:44,639 --> 00:58:50,798
and he was like we're relamping every

1310
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:52,880
run and he loveed cleaning the ball out

1311
00:58:50,798 --> 00:58:56,358
right next to each other you'd have

1312
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:59,599
3000s on a 4x4 that's it split the table

1313
00:58:56,358 --> 00:59:01,400
with 3000 totally yeah yeah we did I did

1314
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:05,200
600s I never did thousands like that but

1315
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:08,720
we did 300 we used to do uh e and flow

1316
00:59:05,199 --> 00:59:11,480
flood and drain yeah and GDP was like I

1317
00:59:08,719 --> 00:59:14,078
grew it for years I mothered it for

1318
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:16,240
years I had like I said the Hell's

1319
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:19,880
Angels cut which was

1320
00:59:16,239 --> 00:59:23,000
amazing and uh I found that it was like

1321
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:26,838
a swamp plant James yeah I used to flood

1322
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:28,599
my tray for 12 hours and and then let

1323
00:59:26,838 --> 00:59:31,519
them out and it was the purplest

1324
00:59:28,599 --> 00:59:33,119
happiest plant it ever could be so what

1325
00:59:31,519 --> 00:59:36,038
type of hoods did you use when you were

1326
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:38,599
going 3000s did you guys use the air

1327
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:42,200
cooled so you were we were we were using

1328
00:59:38,599 --> 00:59:44,318
6 inch air cooled yeah uh my old man

1329
00:59:42,199 --> 00:59:48,199
would go to the grow we used to go up

1330
00:59:44,318 --> 00:59:51,279
the street here to grower Choice yeah uh

1331
00:59:48,199 --> 00:59:53,318
and Metallica's uh band would come in

1332
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:54,920
and buy stuff from them and we'd see

1333
00:59:53,318 --> 00:59:58,119
other people and they had their pites

1334
00:59:54,920 --> 01:00:01,079
that are like scary ious PES known a man

1335
00:59:58,119 --> 01:00:03,760
yeah and uh my dad would break out the

1336
01:00:01,079 --> 01:00:06,559
light meter at the grow store and he was

1337
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:08,440
friends with Steve and he'd have Steve

1338
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:11,400
Turn All the Lights On and my dad would

1339
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:15,400
geek uh he was a scientist my father

1340
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:18,400
actually did missile propulsion for

1341
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:21,240
rathon and uh so he was just straight

1342
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:24,358
specking the lights and we found the top

1343
01:00:21,239 --> 01:00:26,639
ballast from you know all the ones they

1344
01:00:24,358 --> 01:00:31,440
had and at that time believe we were

1345
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:34,598
working with hux or no it wasn't Sun Sun

1346
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:36,880
something Sun Sun System Sun Sun systems

1347
01:00:34,599 --> 01:00:38,559
or something like that the old thousand

1348
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:41,960
watt metal

1349
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:44,839
B and we used to have to replace caps

1350
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:47,798
bring it to the grow store get a new cap

1351
01:00:44,838 --> 01:00:49,960
totally ballasts were separate whole

1352
01:00:47,798 --> 01:00:51,639
whole different world back then right

1353
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:53,480
you could put the ball above the room if

1354
01:00:51,639 --> 01:00:54,719
you wanted to if you're real smart you

1355
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:57,280
put them above the room because there's

1356
01:00:54,719 --> 01:00:59,959
all that buzzing right right we used to

1357
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:02,280
also hang our cleaners our scrubbers

1358
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:04,240
yeah above the room and on that you know

1359
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:06,680
I love because so many people use the

1360
01:01:04,239 --> 01:01:08,679
scrubbers the right way and when you use

1361
01:01:06,679 --> 01:01:11,719
a scrubber the right way what are you

1362
01:01:08,679 --> 01:01:14,719
doing using it the wrong way because the

1363
01:01:11,719 --> 01:01:17,439
way I came to figure it out was you run

1364
01:01:14,719 --> 01:01:21,318
it backwards really and we used to

1365
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:22,720
reverse the flow and instead of blow out

1366
01:01:21,318 --> 01:01:25,400
we'd suck

1367
01:01:22,719 --> 01:01:27,959
in and my dad would joke about it

1368
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:30,400
because we had a 12inch fan on top of a

1369
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:32,960
big you know can yeah and you'd be like

1370
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:35,240
don't get your hair CAU in that hippie

1371
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:37,798
like hold on your hat and stuff you know

1372
01:01:35,239 --> 01:01:40,118
and people were walking by it but it was

1373
01:01:37,798 --> 01:01:43,759
way more productive and you didn't have

1374
01:01:40,119 --> 01:01:47,119
to duct it or you know just to reverse

1375
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:50,200
it and slam it back out yeah my old man

1376
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:52,400
was diligent about building the rooms

1377
01:01:50,199 --> 01:01:55,078
where when you shut the door it would

1378
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:56,599
suck yeah Bo you had that reverse

1379
01:01:55,079 --> 01:01:59,318
pressure you know

1380
01:01:56,599 --> 01:02:02,039
yeah yeah yeah all about that reverse

1381
01:01:59,318 --> 01:02:04,318
pressure hey I said your new room's flat

1382
01:02:02,039 --> 01:02:05,960
white I love it my favorite color in a

1383
01:02:04,318 --> 01:02:07,719
grow room yeah so let's talk about how

1384
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:09,400
you got started with breeding you you

1385
01:02:07,719 --> 01:02:12,159
know did you what did you start breeding

1386
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:15,639
for I was started breeding because you

1387
01:02:12,159 --> 01:02:18,838
know I had done all other facets where

1388
01:02:15,639 --> 01:02:22,598
you know you get tired of repeat and I

1389
01:02:18,838 --> 01:02:26,159
always like to my old man said push the

1390
01:02:22,599 --> 01:02:28,119
science um and experiment some sometimes

1391
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:29,920
I get pissed because he'd run around

1392
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:32,640
perfect and they change something up and

1393
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:35,680
it wouldn't be as good but he made his

1394
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:40,318
case for you know uh pushing things

1395
01:02:35,679 --> 01:02:43,960
forward and uh on that

1396
01:02:40,318 --> 01:02:47,679
note I think when I had finished up you

1397
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:48,639
know indoors and went to outs then I did

1398
01:02:47,679 --> 01:02:52,919
some

1399
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:56,519
depths uh and I did greenhouse and you

1400
01:02:52,920 --> 01:03:00,039
know the the final frontier for me was

1401
01:02:56,519 --> 01:03:03,639
breeding yeah and so you know to have

1402
01:03:00,039 --> 01:03:05,440
the chance to make my own plant was the

1403
01:03:03,639 --> 01:03:09,639
most special

1404
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:13,159
opportunity and I went into that and you

1405
01:03:09,639 --> 01:03:14,719
said the PLL chucking before and I was

1406
01:03:13,159 --> 01:03:17,558
halfway into that

1407
01:03:14,719 --> 01:03:20,759
story uh with I got inspired by the

1408
01:03:17,559 --> 01:03:23,599
gouder family Mikey G and his father and

1409
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:26,799
I was like I'm going to ask the illst

1410
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:30,200
breeder I know how to do it yeah

1411
01:03:26,798 --> 01:03:34,960
and um I went to

1412
01:03:30,199 --> 01:03:38,838
him he says to me so you gotta separate

1413
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:42,159
out the mail that you like and repot it

1414
01:03:38,838 --> 01:03:46,078
up about a mile away from everything and

1415
01:03:42,159 --> 01:03:48,118
he's like you put it into a big pot or

1416
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:51,760
in the ground just like you do the other

1417
01:03:48,119 --> 01:03:54,640
plants and you let it get huge and I was

1418
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:56,520
like man this is a huge undertaking like

1419
01:03:54,639 --> 01:03:59,440
this is a serious problem

1420
01:03:56,519 --> 01:04:03,199
yeah but with his wisdom I I went on

1421
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:05,599
that kind of route and I had this uh

1422
01:04:03,199 --> 01:04:08,879
male that was Giant in my garden that I

1423
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:15,680
let rip and uh I didn't know what the

1424
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:18,079
hell to do with it and uh so I banged it

1425
01:04:15,679 --> 01:04:21,759
a little bit and the pollen drifted on

1426
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:23,680
like three plants and I was like oh well

1427
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:26,599
and I was growing was at the time so I

1428
01:04:23,679 --> 01:04:28,399
was like I want to make seeds in every

1429
01:04:26,599 --> 01:04:31,359
because we use hemp seed I was like

1430
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:34,119
it'll be even better chocolate milk yeah

1431
01:04:31,358 --> 01:04:36,440
and so I was like oh I messed that up

1432
01:04:34,119 --> 01:04:37,960
I'm by myself as we know in cannabis you

1433
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:40,000
can have a lot of friends when it comes

1434
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:44,720
to working in the field you're on your

1435
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:49,358
own and I took the plant and I

1436
01:04:44,719 --> 01:04:53,679
went and the PLL went up like 50 fet in

1437
01:04:49,358 --> 01:04:56,880
the air with a huge plume and I was

1438
01:04:53,679 --> 01:04:59,759
like and I watched it just crushed the

1439
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:02,240
entire patch nice and I was like well I

1440
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:05,520
guess I check that

1441
01:05:02,239 --> 01:05:07,959
box and you know uh then getting more

1442
01:05:05,519 --> 01:05:10,400
into it and you know really being

1443
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:11,480
inspired with learning about you know

1444
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:14,400
punet

1445
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:16,039
squares about uh you know

1446
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:19,200
ibls

1447
01:05:16,039 --> 01:05:20,440
s1s you know uh breeding forwards

1448
01:05:19,199 --> 01:05:24,879
breeding

1449
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:27,880
backwards and uh and all the diversity

1450
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:29,440
and I was in hot spot in Round Valley

1451
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:33,278
that has some of the most ancient

1452
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:35,960
genetics you know from natives from uh

1453
01:05:33,278 --> 01:05:39,079
veterans from a lot of people who have

1454
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:41,480
grown there over the years and I was

1455
01:05:39,079 --> 01:05:44,559
really fortunate with to be able to go

1456
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:46,798
to these breeders and start you know uh

1457
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:48,960
getting the genetics that I liked and a

1458
01:05:46,798 --> 01:05:51,079
breeder told me a long time ago and he

1459
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,519
was spot on when he said to me you know

1460
01:05:51,079 --> 01:05:54,798
when you start breeding you'll figure

1461
01:05:52,519 --> 01:05:56,480
out what flavors you like and we all

1462
01:05:54,798 --> 01:05:58,639
like different flavors

1463
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:01,639
and that's going to kind of drive your

1464
01:05:58,639 --> 01:06:04,519
train so you know with that in mind then

1465
01:06:01,639 --> 01:06:07,960
I started to you know find specific

1466
01:06:04,519 --> 01:06:12,119
cultivars and uh and Growers and reach

1467
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:14,240
out to them build that terar Network and

1468
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:16,240
develop you know my

1469
01:06:14,239 --> 01:06:19,598
own

1470
01:06:16,239 --> 01:06:22,199
and so fast forward to

1471
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:25,720
today I got a couple more we'll run

1472
01:06:22,199 --> 01:06:29,078
through oh these are special

1473
01:06:25,719 --> 01:06:32,358
somebody gifted me these at eag Clash

1474
01:06:29,079 --> 01:06:35,798
and they're hemp seeds James that grow

1475
01:06:32,358 --> 01:06:38,960
25 foot tall hemp plants oh I need some

1476
01:06:35,798 --> 01:06:41,798
of those yes you're getting right now

1477
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:44,798
and I want you to see how large the

1478
01:06:41,798 --> 01:06:47,119
seeds are take a look and I got some

1479
01:06:44,798 --> 01:06:53,079
other seeds but we can put those next to

1480
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:56,519
holy [ __ ] oh my God big huge seeds it is

1481
01:06:53,079 --> 01:06:59,240
unreal how uh I was so ped I said that's

1482
01:06:56,519 --> 01:07:01,639
what I went to Ego Clash for and I was

1483
01:06:59,239 --> 01:07:04,919
like it's just another like we said the

1484
01:07:01,639 --> 01:07:07,440
plan is so diverse like no one you can

1485
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:09,440
constantly experiment these are 0 z i I

1486
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:10,679
would guess I can weigh this and I'm

1487
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:12,880
pretty good at guessing weight because

1488
01:07:10,679 --> 01:07:16,440
I've done it so much but these are 04s

1489
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:19,200
you don't see 0 Z4s almost never right

1490
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:22,159
these are I have some 01 so these are

1491
01:07:19,199 --> 01:07:24,598
four times bigger if not bigger than

1492
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:27,639
that so I got the here's some other

1493
01:07:24,599 --> 01:07:30,359
flavors the Lemon Cherry

1494
01:07:27,639 --> 01:07:33,719
skunk that's awesome I got

1495
01:07:30,358 --> 01:07:36,719
G10 uh G10 I said is the highest note

1496
01:07:33,719 --> 01:07:39,679
you can hit when people sing yeah this

1497
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:42,038
[ __ ] gets you high kicks you in the nuts

1498
01:07:39,679 --> 01:07:44,440
oh yes and not only that are you ready

1499
01:07:42,039 --> 01:07:47,880
for drum roll yeah drum roll drum roll

1500
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:51,440
we got it finishes in August and it's

1501
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:54,039
not an Autoflower really no Autoflower

1502
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:58,798
genetics in it it's got early Afghan

1503
01:07:54,039 --> 01:08:01,278
genetics that I believe have like this

1504
01:07:58,798 --> 01:08:04,838
really early photo period

1505
01:08:01,278 --> 01:08:06,440
yeah uh and it's hard to sex those

1506
01:08:04,838 --> 01:08:08,480
plants I've noticed some of these ones

1507
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:11,000
that I found and I bred I have a couple

1508
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:14,318
strains that finish in August I did a

1509
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:16,600
collab with Leo uh and I called one the

1510
01:08:14,318 --> 01:08:20,560
Rainbird and there's this bird that

1511
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:24,279
shows up uh it's also called like the

1512
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:27,839
pikaa and uh it shows up before

1513
01:08:24,279 --> 01:08:29,480
monsoons and people always talk about

1514
01:08:27,838 --> 01:08:32,119
science and

1515
01:08:29,479 --> 01:08:34,599
spirit and that's a big vice for me in

1516
01:08:32,119 --> 01:08:39,079
our industry as we know there's been

1517
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:40,960
lots of turmoil there so this bird

1518
01:08:39,079 --> 01:08:43,960
represents the

1519
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:46,719
spirit and uh science caught up with the

1520
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:51,880
bird and they were able to track the

1521
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:56,239
bird and so to prove the lore comes to

1522
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:58,719
find out James the spirit story and the

1523
01:08:56,238 --> 01:09:01,559
legend is true and that the bird

1524
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:03,520
migrates in front of the rain and so if

1525
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:05,839
you see that bird that means that the

1526
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:06,560
monsoon is coming or that the rain is on

1527
01:09:05,838 --> 01:09:09,798
its

1528
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:13,039
way and thus they're giving it that name

1529
01:09:09,798 --> 01:09:16,439
because the Cannabis comes in before the

1530
01:09:13,039 --> 01:09:18,880
rain and I said the people in Maine the

1531
01:09:16,439 --> 01:09:22,198
people in Canada the people in all these

1532
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:24,440
climates need those genetics yeah you

1533
01:09:22,198 --> 01:09:26,079
know they are out there in their fields

1534
01:09:24,439 --> 01:09:29,358
there's the happiest person and then

1535
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:32,600
they're crying because Frost came yeah

1536
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:34,359
and it just devastated them speaking of

1537
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:37,159
that we've talked about a frost solution

1538
01:09:34,359 --> 01:09:39,759
for everyone too and what we said is to

1539
01:09:37,158 --> 01:09:42,960
wait till the sun is

1540
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:46,119
cresting and as it's tracking in on the

1541
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:48,520
patch to spray the plants with

1542
01:09:46,119 --> 01:09:51,439
water and maybe there's a chance I

1543
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:53,759
haven't tried it yet but you know if you

1544
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:55,919
caught it in that window maybe it

1545
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:59,760
wouldn't burn

1546
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:02,560
and uh yeah so doing genetics that

1547
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:04,840
finish early for people giving people

1548
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:09,560
what they need you know working with the

1549
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:11,520
plant to make the magic yeah so the true

1550
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:15,760
breeding work is in the pheno hunting in

1551
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:17,239
the selection process 100 seeds minimum

1552
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:19,520
100 seeds minimum for you to do your

1553
01:10:17,238 --> 01:10:22,359
selections minimum yep and you do your

1554
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:25,080
selections outside uh mostly you do

1555
01:10:22,359 --> 01:10:25,839
inside I'm doing them all outside now

1556
01:10:25,079 --> 01:10:27,479
yeah

1557
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:30,360
well you're breeding for outside too I

1558
01:10:27,479 --> 01:10:32,238
feel like correct you breed indoors for

1559
01:10:30,359 --> 01:10:34,079
indoor plants you breed outdoors I mean

1560
01:10:32,238 --> 01:10:35,639
you can do both you could do you can

1561
01:10:34,079 --> 01:10:37,119
make your seeds indoor for outdoor but I

1562
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:38,480
think a lot of guys when you're doing

1563
01:10:37,119 --> 01:10:40,119
the selection process if you're growing

1564
01:10:38,479 --> 01:10:42,319
for outdoor you better be selecting for

1565
01:10:40,119 --> 01:10:45,198
outdoor for that specific region it's

1566
01:10:42,319 --> 01:10:47,319
complicated though when I like pass on a

1567
01:10:45,198 --> 01:10:50,279
plant outdoors because it doesn't check

1568
01:10:47,319 --> 01:10:54,198
the three boxes yeah one box isn't

1569
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:56,479
checked it's gone and then my friend

1570
01:10:54,198 --> 01:10:58,079
calls me up and he's like do you still

1571
01:10:56,479 --> 01:11:00,238
have any of number

1572
01:10:58,079 --> 01:11:03,279
four and I'm like what are you talking

1573
01:11:00,238 --> 01:11:06,519
about and he's like bro come over to my

1574
01:11:03,279 --> 01:11:10,599
greenhouse and take a look and he's like

1575
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:12,679
it's the one yeah and so you never know

1576
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:14,360
the expressions in the multi-

1577
01:11:12,679 --> 01:11:17,279
environments and I'm like there needs to

1578
01:11:14,359 --> 01:11:19,479
be more of that and more science you

1579
01:11:17,279 --> 01:11:22,840
know because again when people come to

1580
01:11:19,479 --> 01:11:25,079
us for genetics we might have it oh yeah

1581
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:27,640
it doesn't work in this environment but

1582
01:11:25,079 --> 01:11:29,279
it slays in this one variety testing in

1583
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:31,159
multiple environments it's always good

1584
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:33,559
because it Expressions come so

1585
01:11:31,158 --> 01:11:35,879
differently outdoor from one region to

1586
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:38,159
the next can be completely different

1587
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:40,199
Greenhouse can be different side by side

1588
01:11:38,158 --> 01:11:42,719
with your outdoor so I'm bringing back

1589
01:11:40,198 --> 01:11:46,799
the skunk did you see the latest issue

1590
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:50,279
of uh skunk magazine I did not okay well

1591
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:53,920
Julie is an angel absolutely and uh I

1592
01:11:50,279 --> 01:11:55,759
got in there uh with a strain review uh

1593
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:58,880
on the winter issue

1594
01:11:55,760 --> 01:12:00,400
nice and unlike I've ever seen in any

1595
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:04,400
strain reviews

1596
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:09,479
James I put a mail in that is a first

1597
01:12:04,399 --> 01:12:14,879
that is a first danst stud bro this

1598
01:12:09,479 --> 01:12:18,319
male BW me away and it's like it has a

1599
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:23,279
story of course the I'm not worthy plant

1600
01:12:18,319 --> 01:12:26,439
does yeah and I found this skunk in my

1601
01:12:23,279 --> 01:12:28,759
patch H where I had had one plant come

1602
01:12:26,439 --> 01:12:31,399
up and I thought the patch got

duffel bags in the

1713
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:06,960
airports and uh back to Las Vegas so I'm

1714
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:10,199
riding his

1715
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:12,719
car uh you know you're pretty special to

1716
01:18:10,198 --> 01:18:14,238
ride with the Godfather and I'm

1717
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:16,198
wondering what we're going to talk about

1718
01:18:14,238 --> 01:18:20,439
one of my favorite places to be in the

1719
01:18:16,198 --> 01:18:22,000
car he says to me I went to uh Las Vegas

1720
01:18:20,439 --> 01:18:24,960
and I was working with this guy and he

1721
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:27,760
was growing in pools and he ripped out

1722
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:30,239
12 pools and they were in all these

1723
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:33,560
different places and they would just go

1724
01:18:30,238 --> 01:18:36,479
like me and open broadcast seed and then

1725
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:38,480
grow it up in the pool crazy and so he

1726
01:18:36,479 --> 01:18:43,158
said he went to check in on things with

1727
01:18:38,479 --> 01:18:46,238
his partner and that uh the person uh

1728
01:18:43,158 --> 01:18:48,479
coming to the gate was late and he was

1729
01:18:46,238 --> 01:18:51,158
in a fancy like the guy had a fancy

1730
01:18:48,479 --> 01:18:53,959
Corvette and was sipping around because

1731
01:18:51,158 --> 01:18:56,279
he's the magic man right and no is a

1732
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:58,880
partner with

1733
01:18:56,279 --> 01:19:01,399
and so he's trying to repress him and

1734
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:04,560
the guy that came up to the gate he goes

1735
01:19:01,399 --> 01:19:06,599
off on him and it was his son he started

1736
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:08,159
yelling at him why weren't you here you

1737
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:11,560
should have been here you knew we were

1738
01:19:08,158 --> 01:19:14,158
coming and so the Godfather said red

1739
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:18,560
flag there's something

1740
01:19:14,158 --> 01:19:22,000
wrong and so he said I called up my

1741
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:24,560
family I told them that I didn't think I

1742
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:26,479
was going to be able to come home and

1743
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:28,960
that that I was going to have to see

1744
01:19:26,479 --> 01:19:31,198
this thing through and he said he stayed

1745
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:34,679
a couple days and sure enough there were

1746
01:19:31,198 --> 01:19:38,158
like three more other buyer or partners

1747
01:19:34,679 --> 01:19:40,960
that he didn't know about oh wow so he

1748
01:19:38,158 --> 01:19:44,000
had to stay there and see the course

1749
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:47,439
from from you know middle to

1750
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:50,520
finish and he said to me you know the

1751
01:19:47,439 --> 01:19:55,399
hard part was when I told that to my

1752
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:58,080
family she said that's okay his wife but

1753
01:19:55,399 --> 01:20:00,000
I might not be here when you come

1754
01:19:58,079 --> 01:20:02,399
home and he

1755
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:05,520
stayed yeah and she wasn't there when he

1756
01:20:02,399 --> 01:20:07,920
came home and that was a story you know

1757
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:11,159
that when you hear it changes you he

1758
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:13,800
shared it with me for a reason and you

1759
01:20:11,158 --> 01:20:17,198
know I'm grateful again to have my

1760
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:21,239
family and again they learned to get

1761
01:20:17,198 --> 01:20:24,158
along later and he had a another

01:24:30,079 --> 01:24:34,639
flower that's in your hand which I his

1853
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:37,600
name because he I gave him a nickname

1854
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:41,560
because he's he's just a rogue character

1855
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:44,079
he lives in a cave so I'm coined him the

1856
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:46,440
caveman nice that's his new nickname and

1857
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:49,399
he likes it so it's going to stick and

1858
01:24:46,439 --> 01:24:52,399
this weed was cured in a cave and I'm

1859
01:24:49,399 --> 01:24:54,118
like some estate aging where you know I

1860
01:24:52,399 --> 01:24:56,799
had to do some love when I got at home a

1861
01:24:54,118 --> 01:24:59,359
little little bit but the long cure

1862
01:24:56,800 --> 01:25:01,960
getting getting wet getting dry but not

1863
01:24:59,359 --> 01:25:05,319
too much no fuzz on this yeah yeah and

1864

just bringing out those great flavors so

1865
01:25:05,319 --> 01:25:10,479
part of the gift is James that this is

1866
01:25:08,238 --> 01:25:12,759
my favorite strain of the year that's

1867
01:25:10,479 --> 01:25:14,759
awesome and there's seeds in it for you

1868
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:16,920
that's even better so I'm like you got

1869
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:18,560
the genetics you get to smoke it through

1870
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:20,719
one of my favorite ways to pull seeds

1871
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:22,840
out is smoke them through and drop them

1872
01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:26,000
in a little special jar we'll run some

1873
