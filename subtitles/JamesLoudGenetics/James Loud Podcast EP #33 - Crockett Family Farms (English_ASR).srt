11
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:28,920
been uh making seeds together for a long

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,480
time and you've been making seeds for a

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,118
long time and you've been with your

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,160
father for quite some time as well yeah

15
00:00:32,118 --> 00:00:36,600
about 11 years now when I turned 18

16
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:39,000
legally I started you know working but

17
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,760
as a kid I was always involved you know

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,119
holes and whatnot so fantastic all the

19
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:47,718
the young back breaking work yeah that's

20
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:50,320
what that's what you start out at

21
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:52,760
yeah totally yeah and that's the best

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,198
way is to I mean if you're in a kitchen

23
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:55,640
the best way to learn how to cook and

24
00:00:54,198 --> 00:00:57,320
everything else is start at the bottom

25
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,558
as a dishwasher and learn your way up

26
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,198
and I think same thing with growing

27
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:03,119
being a water boy at some point in your

28
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:04,478
life is pretty important you know like

29
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,319
learning how to hand water I don't care

30
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:07,359
how much automation you have I think

31
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:09,319
there's something to be said for

32
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:11,000
learning how to hand water properly yeah

33
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,399
there's there's stuff that automation

34
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,359
yeah you can work with dryb backs and

35
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,080
all these other things but there's

36
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:16,679
something special about hand watering

37
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:19,359
definitely definitely and just

38
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,079
understanding you know um all the

39
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:25,159
positions all the way through the best

40
00:01:22,078 --> 00:01:26,919
uh way to learn is to learn everything

41
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:28,200
yeah and have a real well-rounded

42
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,239
understanding of everything and like

43
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,600
especially when you get a scale like you

44
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:34,879
guys have a farm you need to know when

45
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:36,759
people don't show up or whatever you

46
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:38,000
need to know how to fill in the gaps

47
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:41,478
yeah how to fill in the gaps how to

48
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,560
train new people and you know just to to

49
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:45,399
to be able to walk around and kind of at

50
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:49,118
a glance see what people are doing and

51
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:50,799
see you know if it's correct or not

52
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:52,680
totally trim jail is an important place

53
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,799
to go for part of your life I swear

54
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,039
right right no windows movies totally I

55
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,320
mean there was a point where I used to

56
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:59,879
sleep next to my plants when I was

57
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,839
trimming them you know or whatever you

58
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:04,640
know I'd have stuff in the bed and I I

59
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,240
have allergies now that I can't do that

60
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,759
but I think it's important to learn how

61
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,679
to trim um and learn how to trim

62
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:13,479
efficiently and learning that like if

63
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:16,479
you can trim one gram in one minute

64
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:18,919
that's a pound of flour in a day yeah

65
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:20,840
that was always my example but and and

66
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:24,000
you know when I started trimming you

67
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:28,159
know it wasn't even really a job it was

68
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,280
an a uh an honor totally you know like

69
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:31,959
it like if you got invited because I'm

70
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,000
going to harvest or somebody's going to

71
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:35,840
harvest some weed right you know and

72
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,280
this is way before we used to call them

73
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,800
trim parties

74
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,158
right I mean you're lucky if I feed you

75
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,680
yeah like you you're you're GNA go home

76
00:02:42,158 --> 00:02:46,479
with some really good green you know

77
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,800
some really good bud that's not

78
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:51,238
available to anybody else and maybe some

79
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:55,040
scissor hash if you're lucky yeah then

80
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:57,039
it turned into a you know a whole circus

81
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:58,560
at some points you know with some of

82
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:01,079
these bigger harvests and outdoor

83
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,680
Harvest you see you know and it's you

84
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:07,000
have to have 20 30 people there camping

85
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,599
out doing all kind you know it's it

86
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,598
sometimes sleeping out for months into

87
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:12,439
February March you know I've seen that

88
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:15,399
before at some places you know it's

89
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:17,120
pretty it's done till it's done you just

90
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,920
you know and I've seen some workers that

91
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,360
just are pretty wild they'll get up in

92
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:21,878
the morning and trim till they go to bed

93
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,280
and they'll do that for seven days in a

94
00:03:21,878 --> 00:03:27,479
row for months straight yeah yeah I we

95
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,000
we had a few people that that you know

96
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:31,679
good people that would come up and take

97
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,158
it real serious and and make some pretty

98
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,959
good money and that was their only form

99
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:38,798
of you know money for the year and they

100
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,640
would make enough to survive on the Year

101
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,879
by trimming you know totally I've seen

102
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:43,598
people come from other countries and

103
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:45,079
rock it out and that's all they did for

104
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,399
years they come trim and then they

105
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,640
travel the rest of the year yep and you

106
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,158
could do that yeah so but I think

107
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:53,679
trimming prices were more expensive back

108
00:03:51,158 --> 00:03:56,318
then I think they were

109
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,879
yeah so yeah so tell tell me how you got

110
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:01,438
started in the industry I I think it's a

111
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:04,399
long complex story I'm sure uh well you

112
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:06,438
know a 30,000 foot view you know I I was

113
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,519
kind of born into it my family were

114
00:04:06,438 --> 00:04:13,959
Growers before me growing up you know it

115
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:16,079
was a it was a different type of um

116
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:17,959
situation back then you know you can get

117
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,040
in really serious trouble a lot of my

118
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:22,040
family members did go to jail and prison

119
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,080
for different things at different points

120
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:27,240
this was the mid 80s uh yeah this is the

121
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:31,198
mid 80s and um I mean all the way up

122
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:33,600
into the you know 94 in even some after

123
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,439
you know when even after 215 passed

124
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,160
there was some people still going to

125
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:40,240
jail without cards and doing things a

126
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,919
little too big and you know this and

127
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,918
that but um yeah so I mean I I kind of

128
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:48,758
grew up in the culture in in in more of

129
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:51,599
a a more coveted culture back then you

130
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:53,800
know um saying that you were a grower

131
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,560
wasn't just like showing up and clocking

132
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,120
in and going into a $5 million facility

133
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,519
and doing the job that they had trained

134
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:05,120
you to do you know being a grower was

135
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:07,198
was everything it was being able to to

136
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,600
successfully pull off a crop after the

137
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:13,038
year and trim it and store it and sell

138
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:16,479
it and everything and Survive by this

139
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:19,680
and it was just a it was almost um it

140
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:21,639
was just a different type of time then

141
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,038
it was like there were there was there

142
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:26,319
was not as many Growers right there

143
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:28,279
wasn't it was harder to find and it was

144
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,800
a more special thing if you knew

145
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:34,159
somebody if you knew some Growers up on

146
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,720
the mountain and you you know you could

147
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,880
make a living off that you could go up

148
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,639
and get you know bud and take it back

149
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,519
and sell it for 50 bucks an eth or

150
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,960
whatever this is you know in the 90s and

151
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:48,839
stuff but that' be like 400 bucks

152
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:51,318
today you know and uh but it it was you

153
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:53,679
know and that was when you know 50 bucks

154
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:55,560
an eth then you know minimum wage is

155
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,000
probably three or four dollars an hour

156
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:01,839
totally you know as a whole it was a lot

157
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,879
you know to to spend that much money for

158
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:06,079
that small amount when everybody's

159
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:09,759
smoking you know pressed or brick weed

160
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:12,079
or or whatever that's so much more

161
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,759
inexpensive and people held genetics so

162
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:16,240
close too t they didn't let it out yeah

163
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,240
it wasn't there wasn't the circulation

164
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,720
of genetics like there is now totally

165
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,560
totally and and even regions like even

166
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,120
like in Jamaica like like orange Hill

167
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,918
and these different places it was kind

168
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,720
of like that here too right there would

169
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:32,359
there were certain F like oh families or

170
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:35,800
Crews or people and areas that were more

171
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:38,479
famous for specific strains yeah you

172
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,560
know like uh you know I heard on your

173
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:41,800
other podcast you were talking about

174
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,680
blueberry like the Oregon blueberry uhuh

175
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:47,439
that was a specific place you know what

176
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,598
I mean and and uh you know over time the

177
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:51,240
cut gets out and it gets wherever but

178
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:53,439
that cut I haven't seen it around very

179
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:57,400
much no me neither I I actually lived in

180
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:59,199
Oregon for a while and the the late 90s

181
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:02,918
and I know what you're talking about

182
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,800
yeah the snowbud the dog the blueberry

183
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:06,279
all the Trinity you know that's a

184
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,680
trinity is more well known but the other

185
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:09,439
ones you know and there was a corn there

186
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,519
was the corn and it had the looked like

187
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:16,000
corn on the cob yeah yeah so yeah but um

188
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:18,478
yeah so so I mean different places have

189
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,439
different like we in in our area you

190
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:22,000
know it was more of a citrus we had we

191
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:23,839
were always dealing with the Calo and we

192
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,839
had like these Citrus skunks and like

193
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:29,079
you know different hazes a lot uh back

194
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:31,079
then when I was younger younger and I

195
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:32,918
was in charge of any of that you know I

196
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:37,359
was just kind of there what area was

197
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:38,839
that um we're above Fresno in the in the

198
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,080
right below the king's cany National

199
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:45,918
Park oh wow yeah nice yeah that's where

200
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:49,560
it's kind of Southern sieras but uh see

201
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:52,198
Foothills is we we have a really great

202
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,959
micro climate where we're at we we don't

203
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:58,158
get any rain

204
00:07:53,959 --> 00:08:00,158
from basically the end of April till

205
00:07:58,158 --> 00:08:02,478
Thanksgiving it's super super dry it's

206
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:05,918
super dry and we can escape the heat

207
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:07,918
from the elevation so we have a very

208
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:10,560
very specific microclimate that does

209
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:11,918
really well for outdoor nice um and

210
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,199
Greenhouse anything you know that

211
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:19,158
depends on the on the weather right nice

212
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:21,680
so what kind of genetics were you guys

213
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:24,319
working with back in the 80s and a lot a

214
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,800
lot of skunk yeah a lot of like like I

215
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:30,560
say like Helio skunk um

216
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:34,360
hazes um and and and honestly there

217
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:38,599
there was a few um varieties that they

218
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:40,278
would get just from good brick we right

219
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:42,919
you know because back then there were

220
00:08:40,278 --> 00:08:45,240
like I'm talking about when I was a kid

221
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:47,199
there were we didn't have indoors right

222
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,799
we didn't have a greenhouse everything

223
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,920
was outside everything was off your

224
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:55,479
property yeah you're you're literally

225
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:58,759
crawling through the mountains and

226
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:01,519
running water lines off of creeks and

227
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:06,000
and growing growing very very different

228
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:08,480
than you would today or even the last 20

229
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,039
years you know right um it was it was a

230
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,920
different thing and so every year they

231
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:16,799
would just start everything with seed MH

232
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:18,399
um and um cloning didn't go on very much

233
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,799
cloning didn't really go on this one I

234
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,839
mean I'm talking late 80s I mean there

235
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:25,039
there was indoor don't get me wrong sure

236
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:28,399
of course but it was when you were going

237
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:29,958
to grow outside it was always from seed

238
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,919
and you would start a and you would make

239
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:34,958
your own seed and in fact that was one

240
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:38,078
of my very first jobs that I ever had um

241
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:41,199
was making the seed cuz I couldn't I

242
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:42,919
couldn't go to the out to the crops

243
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,560
because I was too young and they would

244
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:46,838
think I was going to get in trouble or

245
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:49,719
something like that so around our house

246
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:53,480
we had different areas that well one

247
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:56,360
specific area that we would plant and

248
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,759
leave a mail in and make seeds for the

249
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,159
next year but it would literally be like

250
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:03,319
one mail yeah and we would make enough

251
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:04,559
seeds for our you know all we needed was

252
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,560
a few thousand so you had to do some

253
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:09,119
good selections on that mail hopefully

254
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:10,479
yeah yeah and I I always had help with

255
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,360
all that stuff but I was in charge of

256
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,600
like watering it keeping it you know

257
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,959
getting it going and all that but um

258
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:20,120
yeah so we would grow from seed and a

259
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:23,159
lot of the seed would just be like I say

260
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,759
made so one year if if you didn't make a

261
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:27,799
good selection and it did or it just

262
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:30,958
didn't take well that was the next

263
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:33,199
year's whole deal almost you know we we

264
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:36,439
had a few different spots that had a few

265
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:39,560
different varieties but it was mostly

266
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:41,639
very vanilla like it was very like this

267
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:43,039
spot has this this spot has this it

268
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:44,399
wasn't like hey there's a bunch of

269
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:45,799
different things in here and a bunch of

270
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,600
different things in here right and names

271
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:49,639
weren't as important they were not they

272
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,240
were not as important you you'd kind of

273
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:54,278
have a name and most of the time when

274
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,799
you'd get a name it was from somebody

275
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:57,679
else or a whole bunch of people calling

276
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:59,919
it something else like we we had the

277
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:03,319
Calo for a long time and people call it

278
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:06,278
uh the Cheeto Bud CU it was very orange

279
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:08,160
haired and like this orange hair and

280
00:11:06,278 --> 00:11:10,039
like people would just name these things

281
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,879
these things and then that's it just

282
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:15,120
stuck you know it wasn't like hey I I

283
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:17,320
put these things together and I call it

284
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,799
this yeah it didn't really happen like

285
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,040
that the lineages weren't as well

286
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:22,359
understood or or I mean maybe they were

287
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:25,559
better understood because there was less

288
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,680
lineage to work with yeah but uh but

289
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:30,479
yeah everyone's got to have all these

290
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:32,278
names and they're related not yet yeah

291
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,639
but but really at the end of the day the

292
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:38,000
focus should be on quality definitely

293
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:40,200
definitely you know the the the quality

294
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,159
is is what's going to make or break you

295
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,959
you know you can't survive by just

296
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:47,919
putting out subpar flow especially back

297
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:49,518
then you know I guess it might have even

298
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:52,240
been easier back then because the only

299
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,000
real competition you had was brick weed

300
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,600
yeah so it was I

301
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
guess I mean I think you could grow

302
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,399
shitty weed up until about five years

303
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,480
years ago and you were probably doing

304
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:05,159
okay I think a lot of people got by on

305
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,839
mediocre flower yeah mids Dusty mids

306
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:10,399
uhhuh you know so but those guys have

307
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:13,959
most of them have went away yeah so

308
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,559
luckily yeah well you know with the the

309
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:18,000
the laws and the regulations kind of

310
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:22,679
clamping down and making it a little bit

311
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,600
more you know risky to to do and um and

312
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:28,319
then if you're not very good and the the

313
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,000
the competition is so stiff it's just

314
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,320
even with genetics all these things you

315
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,600
know yeah yeah for sure for sure um you

316
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,680
know there's

317
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,000
more especially with genetics there's

318
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:41,838
more seed companies now than I'd ever

319
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,440
seen every year there's so much more

320
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,160
because I think a lot of people see the

321
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,000
value in it but anybody can make seeds

322
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:49,719
it's making great genetics is a whole

323
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,120
different story yes yes yeah I mean

324
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:56,560
there's a big difference between seed

325
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:58,159
production and breeding for quality and

326
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:59,799
and I mean you always want to breed for

327
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:01,198
Quality if you're doing seed production

328
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:03,359
but there's a whole different thing when

329
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:05,319
you're actually making packs of seeds to

330
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,360
put out to people for me anyway yeah I

331
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:10,360
agreed you know uh with seed production

332
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,759
I focus on on different types of things

333
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,278
um you know structure uh flowering time

334
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:16,639
and not only flowering time but when it

335
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:21,078
will come in outside you know you have a

336
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:23,079
a 60-day flowering plant versus a 50-day

337
00:13:21,078 --> 00:13:24,759
flowering plant well you're like well

338
00:13:23,078 --> 00:13:27,159
this one's going to I'm going to harvest

339
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:30,439
this one 10 days before I harvest this

340
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:32,879
yeah and it's not true outside no it's

341
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:35,880
when that initiates flowering that's why

342
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:38,759
you can have a a haze that takes a 100

343
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:41,838
days inside and it could be done October

344
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:44,559
10th because it initiated in July yeah

345
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,639
and you can have something that that is

346
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:48,679
uh you know 60 days and it's not done

347
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,480
till Halloween like the strawberry

348
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:53,159
banana right like the strawberry banana

349
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,120
is a great example so uh when did you

350
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:56,919
start getting into selling seeds I know

351
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,440
you worked with DNA but were you doing

352
00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:03,599
stuff with seeds before you guys kind of

353
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:05,480
started working together um actually

354
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:09,959
selling

355
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:13,000
seeds I sold them kind of in bulk not in

356
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:16,198
packaging MH to different people back in

357
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,720
the day but with DNA that's when I

358
00:14:16,198 --> 00:14:21,519
actually started selling seeds nice yeah

359
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,879
like to the public yeah you guys had a

360
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,839
long run together yeah yeah I mean some

361
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:29,799
great great genetics came about your

362
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:30,920
collaborations with DNA you guys won a

363
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:34,198
ton of

364
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:36,360
Cups uh you know and it was like it was

365
00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:38,919
pretty impressive yeah I always I mean

366
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,519
those guys like share a really warm spot

367
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:43,479
in my heart I those they're my brothers

368
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:44,759
right there but um and I'll never forget

369
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,199
you know all of the things that they

370
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:48,278
helped me get through especially in

371
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:51,240
Amsterdam and getting the seed company

372
00:14:48,278 --> 00:14:54,320
going and and introducing me to people

373
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:57,240
now I've I've uh been fortunate enough

374
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:00,399
to get full control of my company back

375
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:03,600
and Beyond you know just crock it and go

376
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:07,159
do like my own directions yeah and uh I

377
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,680
I'm really uh like stoked I we're we're

378
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:11,120
really uh having some fun you know

379
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:14,000
because it only happened about a year

380
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,278
ago yeah you know so we' had been I've

381
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,919
been with DNA for so long that we were

382
00:15:16,278 --> 00:15:20,600
doing projects together and I was

383
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:22,679
working more towards all of that stuff

384
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:26,519
and really not focusing on Crockett very

385
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:29,638
much yeah so now the focus is all on on

386
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:31,480
uh on our farm and and what we can do

387
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:34,278
and and doing things that we really

388
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:36,759
enjoy doing and and bringing back things

389
00:15:34,278 --> 00:15:38,919
that that maybe people would enjoy that

390
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:41,399
had forgotten about that we still have

391
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:42,838
and and just getting together with

392
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:45,440
people that I normally wouldn't work

393
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:47,480
with right um because you know of

394
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,639
whatever I was doing I was too busy or

395
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,879
this or that you know so it's been a

396
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:53,440
it's been a good ride yeah yeah there

397
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:55,078
was some great genetics that came out of

398
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,360
all that and strawberry banana being

399
00:15:55,078 --> 00:15:59,000
like the first washer I mean there's

400
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,919
been washers throughout history but like

401
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,839
as far as that was one that really

402
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:05,120
changed the game I think to a degree

403
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:08,600
yeah strawberry banana you know I I

404
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:11,198
think I we made that in 2006 and that

405
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:14,879
was me and a friend of mine Craig in one

406
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:19,159
of our our first Endeavors together and

407
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:21,919
uh we went to Amsterdam together and uh

408
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:22,879
bought a bunch of seeds and uh ended up

409
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:25,958
getting

410
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:29,759
uh um some of Simon's bubble gum was one

411
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:31,518
of them oh yeah right and uh we came

412
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,720
home and we started making some seeds

413
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:37,480
and we crossed it with the banana OG and

414
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,319
lo and behold this beautiful plant came

415
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:42,079
out of it but we only made a few seeds

416
00:16:39,318 --> 00:16:44,958
there was only a few seeds to be made

417
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:48,000
like out of that that little project you

418
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:51,758
know and so they never really got

419
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:56,600
released um and uh the original cut you

420
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:58,560
know I I I coveted for a probably half a

421
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,800
decade almost until I gave it to Da and

422
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:04,519
Aaron and then they started producing it

423
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:08,639
in Amsterdam and made a few runs with it

424
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:10,759
um you know in fim form um and uh it's

425
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,038
just never really been released since

426
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:15,318
then it's always been something I just

427
00:17:12,038 --> 00:17:17,279
bred with yeah you know and uh yeah it

428
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:20,318
dumps it's it's one of the the first

429
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:23,879
real hash plants that I I had created

430
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:27,359
that really really dumped like everybody

431
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:30,440
like the size of the heads the the the

432
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:32,399
easily collectible as in the yeah it has

433
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,440
that gritty feel to it yeah you can

434
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,960
almost pick up a head with your fingers

435
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:40,360
I mean it's it's a it's an incredible

436
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,000
plant it really is and um in fact I got

437
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:43,319
two joints of it right here so whenever

438
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,319
that's

439
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:46,918
awesome yeah we should probably fire one

440
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:49,558
of those up but let's talk about you for

441
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:52,200
a minute so you got raised in the

442
00:17:49,558 --> 00:17:54,798
industry yeah so I mean it was never

443
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:58,240
really a secret you know growing up I

444
00:17:54,798 --> 00:18:00,240
wasn't necessarily involved too much on

445
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,480
it because I was you know underage and

446
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:06,000
whatnot but yeah I was digging holes and

447
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:08,679
and carrying soil in and bamboo steaks

448
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,079
and and that kind of aspect for a long

449
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:15,400
time and then uh yeah let me like he

450
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:18,798
said I earned my spot in the trim room

451
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:22,280
and uh learned how to trim and whatnot

452
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:23,879
through a season and uh yeah that was

453
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:26,000
like a whole experience like dealing

454
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,880
with you know all of his friends that

455
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,279
were like cultured and everybody knew

456
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,120
what they were doing and I was kind of

457
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:36,279
new to the whole thing and and uh it was

458
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:38,959
a cool cool experience but uh eventually

459
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:41,639
I started growing on my own and and uh

460
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,759
obviously he was like right there beside

461
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,840
me teaching me like hey do this do this

462
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:47,839
you know get your spot ready now it's

463
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:50,639
time now's the time to plant you know

464
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:54,319
like um setting me up for just you know

465
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:56,759
success so and uh as soon as I was of a

466
00:18:54,319 --> 00:19:01,079
of age I started working right under his

467
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:03,599
wing you know um working on designing um

468
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:06,000
you know grows and we built out loud

469
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:07,480
pack and bunch of cool and I was

470
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,919
involved in all of it so I started

471
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,759
getting like this more Broad View on the

472
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:14,400
Cannabis industry instead of just like

473
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:16,119
my high school experience yeah um I was

474
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,120
you know growing it and cultivating it

475
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:20,439
and I was included on like breeding

476
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:22,000
projects and stuff so and at the same

477
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,240
time I'm still going to school college

478
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,558
and stuff so like I'm also applying the

479
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,200
stuff I'm learning in my Horticultural

480
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:32,639
class and my business classes and and um

481
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,080
working with like the legal stuff and

482
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,640
you know the stuff that like my friends

483
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:37,079
had no idea they knew about the hype

484
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,400
strains and all the stuff but they're

485
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:42,199
like yeah I grew a plant in my backyard

486
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,519
and you know whatnot and I'm like yeah

487
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,240
yeah you know how much it cost to trim

488
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:47,000

able to go to any of the cups back in

531
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,000
the day how long have you been kind of

532
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,240
in the industry like I guess the first

533
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,519
cups in the US were 2010 but did you go

534
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:26,720
to any of the European ones yeah so the

535
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:29,839
first um the first cup that I went to

536
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,798
was in Denver and 2013 nice that was a

537
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:33,879
good cup yeah that was a really good cup

538
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:36,240
had great experience Milo with his big

539
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,400
Booth rest in peace Milo but man there

540
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,159
was that yeah that was a good experience

541
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,320
and that was like the transition phase

542
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:45,080
yeah from where it was before to kind of

543
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:47,000
where it is now like those years were

544
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:49,879
those years were special yeah they were

545
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,759
they were there's that those are some of

546
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:54,240
the most fun and special times I'd ever

547
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:55,960
had and those were when you guys were

548
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,640
crushing the cups too you guys were

549
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,640
every every event DNA and crocketts

550
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,640
getting called up for like literally

551
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,440
every event there was a handful and

552
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:09,320
sometimes it was like they got called up

553
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:12,038
over and over we won a lot of awards we

554
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:13,720
we did we we won a lot T just yeah and

555
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:17,000
the Tangi had its peak like when the

556
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:19,720
Tangi was peing and you know it it was

557
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,599
tough to compete with Tangi at that time

558
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,400
because Tangi was such a specific thing

559
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:25,158
so we talk about hype weed like gelados

560
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:28,600
and stuff like that Tangi was that at

561
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:31,600
its time and if you were a judge and you

562
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:33,119
like DNA and you like Tangi everybody

563
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:34,918
knows what Tangi is all the other stuff

564
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:36,599
there's subtleties but Tangi is like oh

565
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:38,440
yeah it's like there's nothing and like

566
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:39,759
someone else couldn't enter it and call

567
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,919
it something else because it would get

568
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:45,400
disqualified too and in the early days

569
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:48,640
you know it was uh the early days of BHO

570
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:50,759
right um when it started really hitting

571
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,600
with with with everyone and everybody

572
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:55,599
wanted shatter right and and all these

573
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:58,519
these hash makers and these guys were

574
00:22:55,599 --> 00:23:02,119
all making um shatter

575
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:05,400
and um and most of the time with the

576
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:07,399
shatter there was no flavor right they

577
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:10,080
Bland it's all land and it was just this

578
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:12,360
or that it wasn't very tppy yeah and so

579
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:15,079
like Tangi was one of those varieties

580
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:18,759
that the turps came through on it so it

581
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:23,240
was an easy way when judges were picking

582
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:26,278
out the the like nothing nothing got he

583
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:29,200
wins you know totally so um but yeah

584
00:23:26,278 --> 00:23:32,759
that was a great run in a great time I

585
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:36,679
mean uh those those were great days and

586
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:38,960
and uh yeah Brian helped me through

587
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:42,120
almost all of the you the shows in the

588
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,919
US like almost every single one did you

589
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:46,000
guys go to the first one 2010 in s

590
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,960
Francisco yeah yeah that's where I met

591
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,679
where we met I think that yeah that's I

592
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,720
think that is where we met it was either

593
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,840
that or in Amsterdam I'm not sure the

594
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:58,159
the one in 2010 is where I

595
00:23:53,839 --> 00:24:00,959
showed um Aaron and uh and our other

596
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:03,159
buddy Sergio uh the Tangi for the first

597
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,120
time oh wow yeah that's that's the one

598
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:06,000
in San

599
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:08,439
Francisco I showed it to him for the

600
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,200
first time and uh yeah that's when they

601
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:13,960
they loved it and uh and I actually came

602
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,360
and brought them a cut of it and uh it

603
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,558
took off from there and those were like

604
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:20,719
OG gas guys too that's the funny thing

605
00:24:17,558 --> 00:24:23,359
is like these OG gas guys are like Tangy

606
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,399
and then then that became a big thing so

607
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:27,240
yeah I like gas too but so let's go into

608
00:24:25,398 --> 00:24:28,839
the Tangi a little bit how did that come

609
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,880
about I love hear the backstory on the

610
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:33,519
Tangi because well you know we had been

611
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:40,480
messing with the Calio for the longest

612
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:43,079
time M and 14 week Calo or 14 to 16 the

613
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:46,720

614
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:50,639
October 10th Calo okay you know um it

615
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:53,360
was it was the the shorter variety nice

616
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:56,000
you know um the GU indoor in the bay it

617
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:58,439
was like 14 to 16 weeks I had a friend

618
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,519
Sean Alberts that that grew it at one

619
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:06,640
point but yeah um and then you know W

620
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:09,240
with that it yeah ours isn't that long

621
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:13,759
it's it's more of

622
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:16,079
like 10 to 12 weeks yeah you know um

623
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:19,398
that's doable 14 to 16 that's that's

624
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:21,158
pretty crazy yeah um but uh you know

625
00:25:19,398 --> 00:25:23,639
that and I was I was messing around with

626
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:25,200
a lot of skunks like Island sweet skunk

627
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,159
and citrus skunk and all these different

628
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:31,600

00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:35,720
great skunk that was was was just

630
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:38,719
beautiful and uh and uh we had bread

631
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:41,120
with it with our Calo because the Calo

632
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,360
that we have is from seed we've been

633
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:46,918
making seeds from it for a long time and

634
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:51,398
it's not pure Calo it's not the Calo

635
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:53,520
it's it's what we had up on the mountain

636
00:25:51,398 --> 00:25:56,359
like it's it's our kind of it's your

637
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:57,679
calo calo it was just called that like I

638
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:59,000
said back in the day there W the name

639
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,840
names weren't there they weren't

640
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,558
important there wasn't the importance

641
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:05,879
played on names as much yeah and uh so

642
00:26:03,558 --> 00:26:07,759
this other Citrus skunk and we the cross

643
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:11,760
just made this

644
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:15,398
beautiful um Aroma of like pure oranges

645
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:17,839
and it ranges too like if you planted

646
00:26:15,398 --> 00:26:21,879
20 female

647
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:24,439
tangies you'll get an array of the the

648
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:26,480
the structure and the potency and all of

649
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:29,399
that will be right there it it'll be

650
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,880
pretty stable but the tpping profile

651
00:26:29,398 --> 00:26:35,239
itself will differ from like an an

652
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:37,440
orange peel to an orange juicey peel

653
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,640
with the the fresh squeeze yeah that

654
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,720
fresh squeeze kind of almost orange

655
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,159
blossom like I've I've smoked I've

656
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,960
smoked a bunch of different tangies over

657
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:46,880
the years purple Tangi too and you have

658
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,759
a blood blood orange Tang BL orange and

659
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:52,080
the purple Tangi was uh off of the

660
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:56,158
original Tangi stock that I had got to

661
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:57,918
uh o OG Steve yeah yeah well so I have

662
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,520
this thing about like with phen hunting

663
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,960
now I'm sharing weed with my friends

664
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:03,879
like typically I prefer the if I'm

665
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:06,558
asking for feedback I prefer giving a

666
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,720
joint a big joint and they don't get to

667
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:09,240
look at the weed because we know what

668
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,798
good weed looks like right we know what

669
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,399
good color looks like we know all about

670
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:13,639
the structure but like I'm more

671
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:15,079
concerned about the flavor and the

672
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,360
effect and if you give everybody joints

673
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:18,398
you get the same kind of response and I

674
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:20,240
feel like more than likely people are

675
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:22,519
going to smoke those joints because

676
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:25,000
they're easy to smoke yeah Light It Up

677
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:27,278
flavor on this is amazing the flour it's

678
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,359
not super eye appealing like as far as

679
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:32,000
like bag appeel typically compared to

680
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:34,278
some of the you know I guess depending

681
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,919
on what you're looking for but like you

682
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:38,519
put it in a joint it smokes amazing you

683
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:42,480
put it in hash it smokes some of the

684
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:45,480
best yeah and it dumps I mean and the

685
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,159
the there's a few different varieties of

686
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,159
strawberry banana out there because they

687
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:51,880
come from the different seeds you know

688
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:56,320
and and so the the one that was from the

689
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:58,760
original clone there is is pretty eye

690
00:27:56,319 --> 00:28:01,158
appealing the like it the Aesthetics on

691
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:02,879
it is very very nice it's just frosted

692
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:05,559
where you can just hit it and just it

693
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:08,000
just rains and the buds get a little bit

694
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:11,079
bigger but it is a little leafier and I

695
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,119
think that's that's what helps it like

696
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:18,558
get such a big yield right on you know

697
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:20,079
hash so on on a wash nice but um yeah

698
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:22,639
it's it's beautiful it's a it's a

699
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:25,000
beautiful plant so you guys also have a

700
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,440
farm too for vegetables you guys selling

701
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,359
vegetables uh or promoting them online

702
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:33,480
at least I I've seen something about

703
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:36,000
that um no

704
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:39,240

718
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:12,200
lot of outcrosses we have like three

719
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:17,200
basic

720
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:21,720
focuses um you know seed production

721
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:25,759
for uh you know THC seed production for

722
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:32,240
hemp and then you know seed production

723
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:36,319
for for or just breeding for um THC for

724
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:39,038
our packs and for the brand so we we run

725
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:40,720
three that's kind of our three resources

726
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:43,879
right there so like depending on what

727
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,960
you're looking for if you're looking to

728
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:48,278
to get something outside and you want to

729
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:50,000
plant 10 acres or 20 acres of something

730
00:29:48,278 --> 00:29:53,599
and you need it to be done by a certain

731
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,119
day you know we can help with that um

732
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:57,038
obviously with autos and different

733
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:58,359
things like that on the larger scale

734
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:01,759
stuff

735
00:29:58,359 --> 00:30:04,719
um but uh the fun stuff is the stuff

736
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:06,879
that goes on just in our on our farm

737
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:10,640
yeah yeah that in the Andor and all the

738
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:13,880
hunting and popping your 30y old seeds

739
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:16,440
and yeah hoping for one to pop you're

740
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:19,440
like they have they have a embryo rescue

741
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,840
now yeah we yeah just it's pretty wild

742
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,558
yeah that is pretty cool it's like

743
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:24,519
surgery it's like the game of operation

744
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:26,759
almost on this you got to pop it off

745
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:29,000
with a pair of tweezers like you pop the

746
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:31,079
the uh shell the coat of the seed off

747
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,919
you pop that yeah and then you actually

748
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:37,918
take the embryo out and yeah put it in

749
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:40,440
something that's more um suitable for it

750
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,759
to to be able to to recover yeah and

751
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,880
sometimes you can actually just take it

752
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:46,359
out and put it in agar and grow it and

753
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:49,240
like with hormones it's

754
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:50,918
crazy but yeah 30 40 50 year old seeds

755
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:54,200
but I think they've popped seeds that

756
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:57,120
are thousands years old so if that's

757
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:59,519
possible anything's possible right yeah

758
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:02,759
but but uh you know our Focus like right

759
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:04,558
now is is making new varieties testing

760
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:08,319
the varieties that we've already made

761
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:11,558
yeah um getting uh into the other spaces

762
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:13,398
of of other states for our our products

763
00:31:11,558 --> 00:31:15,398
to be able to be available you know

764
00:31:13,398 --> 00:31:16,918
trying to expand a little bit are you

765
00:31:15,398 --> 00:31:18,839
still doing the European thing are you

766
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:22,200
guys just focused on the US now or no we

767
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:25,359
do we're worldwide we do uh you know we

768
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:27,919
have full distribution almost everywhere

769
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:30,199
that's fantastic um here we're focusing

770
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,960
more on just you know testing out the

771
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:35,080
stuff that we've already made yeah we've

772
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:36,880
got so much so many things we we have a

773
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:40,918
we've got a test you mentioned Milo

774
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:42,639
earlier yeah and uh yeah he he came and

775
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:43,480
he came to the states I think it was

776
00:31:42,638 --> 00:31:46,000
like

777
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:48,880
2018 and came to my house and stayed at

778
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,759
my house for like a week and um he

779
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,720
brought a bunch of seeds from cheese and

780
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:56,158
blue cheese and and all all these

781
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:58,798
different things that he had uh uh some

782
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,799
of his original stuff right yeah yeah

783
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:02,200
and so we when after he passed I was

784
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:04,519
like man I'm going to plant i' never

785
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,840
planted them I just always just had them

786
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:07,359
right and I was like I'm going to plant

787
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:10,839
these seeds so we planted all those

788
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:11,918
seeds and we just uh you know uh we're

789
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:14,199
we're actually like kind of going

790
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:16,120
through them right now we we picked a

791
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,600
cheese winner we picked a blue cheese

792
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:21,278
mail I yeah and I've never really had

793
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:22,879
like a true experience with cheese like

794
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:25,000
like offensive cheese where it's almost

795
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,399
borderline offensive I didn't even know

796
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,798
like I was like growing up me and my

797
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:29,798
friends we thought we knew what cheese

798
00:32:27,798 --> 00:32:31,480
was we bought weed chees or cheese you

799
00:32:29,798 --> 00:32:33,278
know what I mean and then we started

800
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:36,079
growing some of these out and I'm like

801
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:38,359
yeah I had no idea what cheese was super

802
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:40,199
loud it's very loud there's like some

803
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:41,798
are sweeter and all the stuff I'm like I

804
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,440
thought it was supposed to smell like

805
00:32:41,798 --> 00:32:46,839
cheese or something you know like that's

806
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:50,159
what I was expecting and it's hasn't

807
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:52,278
been that so far so I'm we haven't

808
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,679
smoked any of these varieties yet so I

809
00:32:52,278 --> 00:32:57,558
haven't like got to they're almost done

810
00:32:54,679 --> 00:32:59,080
yeah that sounds exciting that's the

811
00:32:57,558 --> 00:33:00,558
beauty of popping seeds and then having

812
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:02,158
to wait so long before you actually get

813
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:04,119
to try to smoke it you think about it a

814
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,880
lot sometimes it's a big let down and

815
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:07,359
other times stuff that like looks a

816
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:09,480
certain way it changes so much it

817
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:11,119
changes from the time you harvest it

818
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,278
even where you're like it looks all

819
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:14,359
right and then you go to smoke it and

820
00:33:12,278 --> 00:33:16,440
it's like the most amazing smoke yeah

821
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:18,319
but the one that looks so good that

822
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:21,080
yielded so much is just kind of a big

823
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:23,960
let down yeah yeah yeah the whole the

824
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:26,599
whole process is a lot of fun definitely

825
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,639
you guys uh go to any events right now

826

873
00:35:17,358 --> 00:35:22,119
definitely he introduced us to the loud

874
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,880
Berry I remember I was like this yeah

875
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:24,559
this is amazing what is this it was like

876
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:28,440
the

877
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:30,599
fruitiest i' ever SM Hunted that out of

878
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:33,200
so many seeds the laberry was pheno

879
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:35,838
hunted out of we we had done so much and

880
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:37,919
then he got a 10pack popped them and

881
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:39,559
then found the loud Berry wow and I mean

882
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,240
literally there was so many there was

883
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:42,880
probably 1500 seeds that had gone

884
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:45,039
through different people's hands yeah

885
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:48,160
for him to get that one out of a 10 pack

886
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:51,400
pretty amazing that is wow an amazing

887
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:52,879
but it's it's also uh proof that you

888
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,358
have to be able to grow really good weed

889
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,280
to be able to feno hunt because the

890
00:35:55,358 --> 00:35:59,119
thing is I think a lot of then there was

891
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,880
a lot of good fenos too but like really

892
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,400
the best Expressions they stand out but

893
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,000
you have to be able to grow to a certain

894
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,079
level and if you can't then a lot of

895
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,400
your stuff just looks the same and

896
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,160
you're going to miss a lot of the good

897
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:12,240
stuff that's super special yeah you got

898
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:13,920
to bring it to its fullest potential if

899
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:15,639
you could you know well then there's

900
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,000
like the drying and the curing and all

901
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:19,879
those things are super good and if you

902
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:23,400
can't do those right yeah that's half of

903
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:25,720
it that's where usually people ruin it

904
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:28,079
ruin it at the end you know right at the

905
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:29,919
end after all this they ruin it in a

906
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,720
week's period or two weeks by drawing it

907
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,079
too fast or drawing it too slow or you

908
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:35,519
know having the environmental usually

909
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:38,240
it's just an environmental thing they're

910
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:39,800
scaring it up but yeah there is a lot of

911
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:41,479
well and it's also there's an art to it

912
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,240
I think a lot of people can follow

913
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:45,719
recipes anybody can follow recipe but

914
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:48,759
it's like it's when there's an art to it

915
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:50,118
that that separates people for sure yeah

916
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:52,680
so because there's a lot of stuff you

917
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:54,800
can't read about it's like uh when

918
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:57,078
because the Bud's different sizes so

919
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,800
like do I pull it out of the room today

920
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:01,359
or do I wait another day like if you

921
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:04,240
just follow the recipe it doesn't always

922
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:06,039
work no it does not being able to just

923
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:09,199
kind of eyeball things and touch and

924
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:11,159
feel and you know just kind of you know

925
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:12,879
always bend to the snap you know what I

926
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:15,078
mean there's just little things that

927
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,119
totally you know so but yeah the canle

928
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:18,720
brush have you guys seen that now it's

929
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:22,039
been around for a while that little

930
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:25,959
nylon looks like a baster for like yeah

931
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:28,039
it's like a meat exactly and those I

932
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,800
thought I thought it was kind of a joke

933
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:31,519
like I was like you got to be kidding me

934
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,000
like people use this and then one of my

935
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:35,400
buddies he crushes it with it and they

936
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,880
do like four to five pounds a day uh

937
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:39,240
metric but still it's like four to five

938
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,000
pounds of trimming but he also grows

939
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:43,598
really big buds and he keeps the

940
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,760
environmentals perfect and just because

941
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:46,240
you know just because it doesn't work

942
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,560
for somebody doesn't mean it won't work

943
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:50,000
for somebody else so I was totally blown

944
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:51,759
away and the thing is is like a lot of

945
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,559
the top shelf guys because if you do it

946
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,280
right you're actually touching the bud

947
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:58,799
less and then you have your temperature

948
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:00,720
and humidity set to where the tricomes

949
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,880
are pliable but they're not going to

950
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:05,199
snap and so then when you brush you're

951
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,480
not [ __ ] up the tricomes and you're

952
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:08,078
getting all the butt off but you have to

953
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:12,039
have chunky buds you can't do it with

954
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:13,839
lar it strin specific for sure yeah I've

955
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:16,838
used one a few times like they've had

956
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:19,199
them at facilities and yeah like oh well

957
00:38:16,838 --> 00:38:20,920
this kind of work uh yeah I totally

958
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:22,399
wasn't sold on in the beginning I was

959
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,480
like you got to be kidding me that

960
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,200
people are coming out with different

961
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:27,119
stuff all the time it's cool though I

962
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:30,399
like seeing it I saw some cool you guys

963
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:33,039
would like the under canopy lights oh

964
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,160
soen for green hous and for indoor

965
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:35,358
whatever like I feel like it's just

966
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:37,358
another thing but they're talking about

967
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:39,358
25% yield increases and stuff and I

968
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:40,598
think that's cool but I really get like

969
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:42,559
where you either have mixed light or

970
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:44,240
greenhouse and you could put under

971
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:46,880
canopy light and get all the stuff that

972
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:49,239
doesn't really fill out to to harden up

973
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,000
a little bit yeah yeah there is that

974
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:55,519
light too uh it goes around a pot like

975
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,519
so it's like um beta product I think or

976
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:59,039
whatever but it's supposed to go around

977
00:38:56,519 --> 00:39:00,719
on a specific size pot and your plant

978
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:03,599
like is growing up through it and it

979
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:05,199
shines up but it's like some uh UV

980
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,838
that's supposed to like sterilize

981
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:10,439
everything interesting you run it like

982
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:13,000
60 seconds or something a night or

983
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:15,480
something like that and supposed to work

984
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,880
I have one I'm starting to use it so see

985
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,800
if it works but I've heard like good

986
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,960
things about it but everyone's like I

987
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,960
don't know how far you're supposed to be

988
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:24,720
away from it when it turns on CU like

989
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:27,079
I'm using it in a tint so I'm like okay

990
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:28,719
is the tint really blocking these like

991
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:30,400
Rays right here going through I'm like I

992
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:33,358
think I'm gonna leave the building and

993
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,880
like then I'll let it turn on right but

994
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:38,920
better than microwaves I guess maybe I

995
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:41,920
don't know yeah it says it kills DNA on

996
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:44,720
it so I'm like oh [ __ ] that's not good

997
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,720
send him to Don and

998
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:50,720
Aaron oh man let's go back into some

999
00:39:48,318 --> 00:39:52,358
breeding talk about like uh separating

1000
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:55,519
males like you guys do you do a lot of

1001
00:39:52,358 --> 00:39:57,039
male breeding also feminized yeah but uh

1002
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:58,039
regular breeding

1003
00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:00,639
with true

1004
00:39:58,039 --> 00:40:02,599
males oh yes you keep them alive in

1005
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:04,920
Clone form for a long time or how how do

1006
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:07,119
you guys do that we do we do we do keep

1007
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:10,200
specific clones Al or specific males

1008
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,920
alive in Clone form yeah um there are

1009
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:14,078
some that we have that are very

1010
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:17,280
difficult do that because they turn to

1011
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:19,519
like flower a lot more even in even if

1012
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,880
as soon as they like touch the pot and

1013
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:22,800
like their Roots start bounding they

1014
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,400
like even if you have them on 24 they

1015
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,359
exactly 24 and they'll flip but you just

1016
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,720
got to keep cloning them after yeah they

1017
00:40:26,358 --> 00:40:32,119
Autoflower yeah so so we have a few of

1018
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:36,439
those and and and uh that makes it kind

1019
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:38,240
of a pain but um we we do check um quite

1020
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:41,519
often just to make sure nothing's going

1021
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:45,799
on but um we keep our males in Clone

1022
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:47,838
form we um we we're constantly looking

1023
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:51,400
and constantly checking and using

1024
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:55,599
different males and growing side by side

1025
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:58,240
males and and and you can turn a male as

1026
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:00,318
well yeah back right and so we'll

1027
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:02,318
sometimes we'll do that and just see how

1028
00:41:00,318 --> 00:41:05,159
much resin we can kind of produce on

1029
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:06,920
these males and get a smell from them

1030
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:09,159
and kind of pick out our males in

1031
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:11,519
different ways like that not just and

1032
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:14,799
obviously with structure and just you

1033
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:17,039
know a stem rub and looking at it right

1034
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,599
but I mean you got to have some sort of

1035
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:21,239
after 40 years you you figure You' you

1036
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:24,000
pick up a couple tips along the way

1037
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:25,759
tricks yeah but yeah and observations

1038
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,838
and I think the real one is growing the

1039
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:31,079
next gener a out and seeing how well you

1040
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:33,599
did but there are definitely identifiers

1041
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:36,680
I mean stemra but also triome production

1042
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:38,800
on the mail yeah yeah the definitely how

1043
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:42,559
they they're structured too like if

1044
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:46,359
they're long and short compared to their

1045
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:49,078
uh female counterparts siblings yeah

1046
00:41:46,358 --> 00:41:52,480
yeah so yeah I mean we we do a lot of

1047
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:54,200
different things with with you know just

1048
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,079
the selection that we were we've been

1049
00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:58,960
doing even lately I mean just using it

1050
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:00,640
in in different ways too you taking our

1051
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,039
taking our males like you know a

1052
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:05,000
specific variety male and female and

1053
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:08,079
going both directions you know

1054
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,760
reciprocal yeah um you know reciprocal

1055
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:14,039
doing reciprocal breeding yeah totally

1056
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:15,560
um that's that's what I like to do

1057
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:17,960
that's where I find my most success when

1058
00:42:15,559 --> 00:42:20,279
I'm looking for to to find something

1059
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:22,000
that I want to happen yeah that's when I

1060
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:25,119
can kind of make that happen because

1061
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,800
it's more predictable totally well you

1062
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:28,838
could be missing out a lot of stuff and

1063
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:32,240
then it's like depending on if the

1064
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:34,400
traits from the father or the mother you

1065
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:37,318
know you totally could miss out on some

1066
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:39,039
of the best stuff yeah so and until you

1067
00:42:37,318 --> 00:42:40,400
know your lines really well those are

1068
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:42,719
the kind of things you have to do and

1069
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,400
even still it's always interesting

1070
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:48,598
seeing the results but also space and

1071
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:51,559
time so time is the one thing we don't

1072
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:53,760
have enough of yeah yeah and space is a

1073
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:55,640
close second yeah

1074
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,240
seriously well yeah so where do you see

1075
00:42:55,639 --> 00:43:00,400
the future the the industry going you

1076
00:42:57,239 --> 00:43:02,159
know I think you have your your foot in

1077
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,680
the genetics and are you guys going to

1078
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:06,960
go into other products to try to predict

1079
00:43:04,679 --> 00:43:08,719
it it's it's definitely difficult I mean

1080
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,280
there's there's no I I couldn't have

1081
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:13,519
predicted it 10 years ago to where it's

1082
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:17,160
at right now you know it's it was it's

1083
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:19,599
definitely going in a in a in a bigger

1084
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:21,159
more commercial Direction yeah you know

1085
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:23,359
but at the same time a lot of these

1086
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:26,480
people that kind of jumped into it and

1087
00:43:23,358 --> 00:43:29,558
had all this this big money kind of

1088
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:32,960
dropped out or are dropping out and the

1089
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:35,240
the smaller the smaller more you know

1090
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:38,000
Boutique the more the more heavy weed

1091
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:38,000
the the better

1092
00:43:38,039 --> 00:43:43,960
weed absolutely quen weed's coming back

1093
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:45,760
it's not all about purple even though

1094
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:48,119
purple has its place or whatever but

1095
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:51,800
like it all has its place yeah you know

1096
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:54,119
and it's all so subjective I think good

1097
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:57,000
flower is not always I mean it's pretty

1098
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:58,480
obvious you know like good and bad but

1099
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,440
it's making a comeback and I think the

1100
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:03,599
commercial stuff Boutique would be great

1101
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:06,519
I would love to see farm to table or

1102
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:08,400
like these uh these micro Brewery type

1103
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:10,159
models pop up all over California to

1104
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,240
where you can go to the farm and you can

1105
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:13,719
buy flour at the farm of the stuff that

1106
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:16,078
you see growing where you can talk to

1107
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:17,879
the farmer and he can tells you all the

1108
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:19,559
things he's put into that plant over

1109
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:21,480
Generations or how he bred it to get it

1110
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:23,119
to that point yeah I think that's part

1111
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:24,519
of like a bigger experience that like

1112
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:26,358
we're missing a little bit that would be

1113
00:44:24,519 --> 00:44:28,559
pretty amazing yeah definitely

1114
00:44:26,358 --> 00:44:31,279
definitely I mean you can do it with

1115
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:34,720
wine you can do it with almost anything

1116
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:37,280
you know so Wine's not schedule three

1117
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:39,279
that's pretty wild the whole scheduling

1118
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:41,280
when they could just deschedule it but

1119
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,559
yeah but yeah and I think we we've been

1120
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,720
taking steps we're still going in the

1121
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:47,000
right direction as far as I'm concerned

1122
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:50,759
yeah yeah and and and I'm seeing you

1123
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:53,400
know a lot of the weeding out of of of a

1124
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:55,079
lot of the boof and a lot of the the the

1125
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,039
meds even like the stuff that's coming

1126
00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:59,079
around on you know the traditional

1127
00:44:57,039 --> 00:45:01,079
market and this and that there I mean

1128
00:44:59,079 --> 00:45:02,880
the quality is rising in a lot of things

1129
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:06,280

1155
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,519
well it's the hype around I mean it's

1156
00:45:57,318 --> 00:46:01,920
like just because you have access to

1157
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:03,759
good genetics now you can be a breeder

1158
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,960
and it's it is what it is I mean I'm not

1159
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,800
gonna I'm happy people are working with

1160
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:10,280
the plant if they're producing good

1161
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:12,200
quality genetics that's even better

1162
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:14,720
they're smoking good flour that's even

1163
00:46:12,199 --> 00:46:17,480
better yeah know right the end of the

1164
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:19,838
day I mean content is I mean it's

1165
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:22,159
interesting you know I mean it is yeah I

1166
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:24,519
feel like we're also going to see a big

1167
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:26,399
uh comeback with a lot of the genetics

1168
00:46:24,519 --> 00:46:28,519
we liked when we were younger and I

1169
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,960
think even getting land race obviously

1170
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:32,440
the land race stuff has kind of been a

1171
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:33,599
Hot Topic lately but I feel like we're

1172
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:35,519
just going to keep going in that

1173
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:38,240
direction because the we need more

1174
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:39,838
diversity and and it's like the top 40s

1175
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:41,558
list so like what's popular today isn't

1176
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:44,279
going to be popular tomorrow well I mean

1177
00:46:41,559 --> 00:46:46,119
when we were uh younger you we're

1178
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:47,519
probably the same we're the same age

1179
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:49,838

those are guys they made Blue Dream as

1288
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:06,039
well

1289
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:10,200
maybe um yeah Haze Brothers right yeah

1290
00:51:06,039 --> 00:51:11,798
yeah yeah that's the I mean there's been

1291
00:51:10,199 --> 00:51:13,919
so many like even that the we were

1292
00:51:11,798 --> 00:51:16,318
talking about Jason earlier that Ranger

1293
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:21,039
that's that's like a Mexican Haze that's

1294
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:23,599
like a a just a a Maj pod of that thing

1295
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:26,318
is legendary yeah is the cut around

1296
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:28,359
still no I don't believe so so the the

1297
00:51:26,318 --> 00:51:32,960
only thing we have is seed form of

1298
00:51:28,358 --> 00:51:38,119
hybrids of it yeah um and uh but that is

1299
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:40,920
a a really really unique variety that is

1300
00:51:38,119 --> 00:51:42,838
is it doesn't really look like much yeah

1301
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:44,440
like it's very leafy but it's super

1302
00:51:42,838 --> 00:51:46,358
Frosty it it almost has that Oregon

1303
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:50,639
blueberry look to where it has that it's

1304
00:51:46,358 --> 00:51:54,039
like really like frost like bluish

1305
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:57,480
purple like you know and uh but it's

1306
00:51:54,039 --> 00:52:01,000
long flowering it's it's like a pain in

1307
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:03,920
the ass plant to grow but it is really

1308
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:06,480
good the effects on that are probably

1309
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:08,838
some of the my favorite that I found in

1310
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,400
my life yeah that Ranger well it's funny

1311
00:52:08,838 --> 00:52:12,199
because Haze can go in a lot of

1312
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,639
different directions with effect because

1313
00:52:12,199 --> 00:52:17,679
and and even within African if you go

1314
00:52:14,639 --> 00:52:19,879
Durban versus Congo the Durban kicks

1315
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:21,639
your ass and then you got the Congo and

1316
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:23,240
it makes you super happy and laugh like

1317
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:25,798
crazy and it's like those are Regions

1318
00:52:23,239 --> 00:52:29,039
they're not that far apart in sense you

1319
00:52:25,798 --> 00:52:30,920
know yeah um that they're on the same

1320
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:33,000
continent but but yeah completely

1321
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:35,760
different effects and flavor and then

1322
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,079
you got that anise licorice with the

1323
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,640
with the deran which I really like

1324
00:52:37,079 --> 00:52:42,119
that's one of my favorites as well yeah

1325
00:52:39,639 --> 00:52:45,199
the anything black licorice or Anise is

1326
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:47,039
like a totally yeah especially if it's

1327
00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:49,879
like coating like that Menthol almost

1328
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:51,159
like a menthol coat with it or yeah so

1329
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:53,200
yeah are you guys working with land R

1330
00:52:51,159 --> 00:52:56,239
stuff bringing them back yeah definitely

1331
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:59,639
we have like uh pakist Pakistan and that

1332
00:52:56,239 --> 00:53:02,118
black African Haze oh yeah

1333
00:52:59,639 --> 00:53:03,558
Vietnam black African Haze fire what

1334
00:53:02,119 --> 00:53:07,440
else was there there's a few other ones

1335
00:53:03,559 --> 00:53:09,720
but yeah there there's a tie um Tai yeah

1336
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,039
very interesting thing the pakis the

1337
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:15,118
Pakistan and

1338
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:17,679
the the uh the African Haze those are

1339
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:20,599
the two that really stood out like

1340
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:22,199
honestly like different than everything

1341
00:53:20,599 --> 00:53:24,200
like if you had some pounds of that and

1342
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:25,519
you went around and tried to like you

1343
00:53:24,199 --> 00:53:27,399
showed some people they'd be like what

1344
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:29,960
is this like I've never even seen this

1345
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:32,440
you does even look like weed yeah it's

1346
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:35,318
very leaky and and and well well the

1347
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:37,440
Pakistan had had a all decent structure

1348
00:53:35,318 --> 00:53:39,480
but it was still kind of Airy and but it

1349
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,119
has like that food smell it was just

1350
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:44,079
like this crazy resin on it too it was

1351
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:47,240
just like turning it was small but it

1352
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:49,119
would like turn to sand like real quick

1353
00:53:47,239 --> 00:53:54,239
but it was was pretty interesting and

1354
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:57,599
then the African Haze was Giant and uh

1355
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:59,519
the resin on that was was a like like

1356
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:01,680
extraordinary but it takes a lot of seed

1357
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:04,039
the butts were very thin and it was a

1358
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:05,159
lot of leaf around them too yeah if

1359
00:54:04,039 --> 00:54:06,719
you're looking to grow something

1360
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:07,920
different those are great options

1361
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:09,519
especially because we're growing stuff

1362
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,119
that's so similar a lot and then you get

1363
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:14,000
something I think that's why the freak

1364
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:15,519
Show becames and also like freak Show

1365
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,440
doesn't put out a ton of leaf it's like

1366
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:21,358
a low Leaf to to flower ratio but it's

1367
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,838
different yeah completely different now

1368
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:25,679
they got a purple freak Show too they

1369
00:54:22,838 --> 00:54:27,279
got yeah two different expressions

1370
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:29,118
adding things into some of those land

1371
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:31,280
race stuff I mean some some some of that

1372
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:34,838
stuff's one step away you know like one

1373
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:37,839
two steps away yeah yeah yeah like Oreos

1374
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:40,838
that's I feel that's a it's once yeah

1375
00:54:37,838 --> 00:54:42,358
purple punch and Oreos are like you know

1376
00:54:40,838 --> 00:54:45,000
I don't bag on strange usually on my

1377
00:54:42,358 --> 00:54:46,679
show at all but like I feel like they're

1378
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,159
good and they're one step away from

1379
00:54:46,679 --> 00:54:51,000
being great I think Mike from exotic did

1380
00:54:49,159 --> 00:54:52,920
a lot with the purple punch that made it

1381
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,400
great made it better the red runs was

1382
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:56,680
like the best expression well you know

1383
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:58,480
when you're when you're looking for

1384
00:54:56,679 --> 00:55:00,838
stuff you know you want to look at you

1385
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:03,920
know the purple punch it's not what you

1386
00:55:00,838 --> 00:55:07,480
want to smoke but growing the groin wise

1387
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:09,559
I mean it's it looks pretty good and it

1388
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:10,880
puts off a lot of resin and and

1389
00:55:09,559 --> 00:55:13,680
everything else but it's not what you

1390
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:16,200
want but if you if you have something

1391
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:18,440
else that's dominating with flavor and

1392
00:55:16,199 --> 00:55:20,399
smell and you put that to it you know

1393
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:22,240
hopefully that it'll retain its flavor

1394
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:26,318
and smell and not Tain too much and you

1395
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:28,078
can you take advantage of that structure

1396
00:55:26,318 --> 00:55:30,239
problem with the Oreos is it has like

1397
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:32,400
these chocolatey weird the turps are

1398
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:34,399
really weird yeah and so like it doesn't

1399
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:36,400
smoke like you you like it to smoke and

1400
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:39,440
the effects are okay the effects are

1401
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:40,838
fine but like as far as like Flavor it's

1402
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,720
it has something that's going to compete

1403
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:45,358
with stuff too but I think it's so

1404
00:55:42,719 --> 00:55:46,639
Frosty you know I feel like more of

1405
00:55:45,358 --> 00:55:48,440
those crosses you get a couple

1406
00:55:46,639 --> 00:55:50,199
Generations away where it has a turps of

1407
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:52,798
something else yeah it'll do it has

1408
00:55:50,199 --> 00:55:54,038
potential yeah I mean we we've done that

1409
00:55:52,798 --> 00:55:55,759
a lot of times in the past with

1410
00:55:54,039 --> 00:55:58,640
different things but you know like there

1411
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:00,799
was a Blackberry that never oh my God

1412
00:55:58,639 --> 00:56:03,960
the Blackberry from nor it was tested

1413
00:56:00,798 --> 00:56:05,559
like 8% THC it was the darkest Bud too

1414
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:07,079
it was super black and it looked amazing

1415
00:56:05,559 --> 00:56:08,920
but it didn't get you high but you had

1416
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:10,640
to T it was so covered though and hash

1417
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:12,440
you're were like oh my God sometimes it

1418
00:56:10,639 --> 00:56:14,038
would like flower in the bedroom out too

1419
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:15,599
you'd be like you'd have to thin it out

1420
00:56:14,039 --> 00:56:17,119
cuz they just start flowering a few

1421
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:18,519
steps away though like you're talking

1422
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:20,680
you know and like it's like these

1423
00:56:18,519 --> 00:56:23,318
different things that that have like it

1424
00:56:20,679 --> 00:56:25,838
was a cool plant for breeding purposes

1425
00:56:23,318 --> 00:56:28,318
I'm sure yeah especially lock in that

1426
00:56:25,838 --> 00:56:29,639
that color pretty easily I think yeah

1427
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:31,880
something like that but yeah I remember

1428
00:56:29,639 --> 00:56:33,400
it did not get you high and and it's

1429
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:35,079
funny CU Green Crack was one where it

1430
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:37,318
would like get you high but then after

1431
00:56:35,079 --> 00:56:38,400
you had a tolerance your tolerance would

1432
00:56:37,318 --> 00:56:39,838
kill it and then you would you could

1433
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,559
smoke a whole joint of it you could

1434
00:56:39,838 --> 00:56:43,159
smoke a pound a day it wouldn't you

1435
00:56:41,559 --> 00:56:44,519
wouldn't be high at all that's what I I

1436
00:56:43,159 --> 00:56:46,038
think I told you that before I was like

1437
00:56:44,519 --> 00:56:47,838
I love green crack I want to get like

1438
00:56:46,039 --> 00:56:50,359
one ounce a year yeah that's all you

1439
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:51,838
need like the first couple days the

1440
00:56:50,358 --> 00:56:53,920
first day with it is great cuz it gets

1441
00:56:51,838 --> 00:56:55,318
you super lit but then if you have a

1442
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:56,559
high tolerance to your friends come over

1443
00:56:55,318 --> 00:56:58,558
and you're like dude you got to try this

1444
00:56:56,559 --> 00:56:59,960
and you don't really prep them for it

1445
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:03,359
man they're they're going to be on the

1446
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:08,519
couch yeah so we still have a good Green

1447
00:57:03,358 --> 00:57:11,558
Crack cut we do nice I need to get that

1448
00:57:08,519 --> 00:57:13,719
yeah we have an excellent one yeah it

1449
00:57:11,559 --> 00:57:15,920
actually washes a little bit too yeah so

1450
00:57:13,719 --> 00:57:17,798
it's pretty wild because I feel like

1451
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,880
there are genetics in Pocket certain

1452
00:57:17,798 --> 00:57:21,079
things like green crack I I've been

1453
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:22,960
looking for a green crack for a long

1454
00:57:21,079 --> 00:57:25,920
time and I'm like and then I just bumped

1455
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:28,240
into the cat piss guy my my cat cat piss

1456
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:31,280
buddy well he's somebody who actually

1457
00:57:28,239 --> 00:57:32,838
grew the cat piss back in the day so I

1458
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,640
can get his feedback on the cat piss

1459
00:57:32,838 --> 00:57:35,838
that I

1460
00:57:33,639 --> 00:57:38,239
know you know it's like because there's

1461
00:57:35,838 --> 00:57:40,078
cat pisses in Aroma and so there's this

1462
00:57:38,239 --> 00:57:42,679
huge war going on of everybody like I

1463
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:44,359
created the cat piss yeah or I was given

1464
00:57:42,679 --> 00:57:45,798
the cat piss and I'm valo and you didn't

1465
00:57:44,358 --> 00:57:48,279
create the cat piss and then there's the

1466
00:57:45,798 --> 00:57:50,000
SoCal ciss and the NorCal ciss and

1467
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:52,359
they're different they should have named

1468
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,280
it something else but you know it's like

1469
00:57:52,358 --> 00:57:56,639
it's a description of an aroma and and

1470
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:58,359
it's a it's it's a funny thing because

1471
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:59,719
capus was the best thing growing up and

1472
00:57:58,358 --> 00:58:02,318
it looked the worst I was going to say

1473
00:57:59,719 --> 00:58:05,199
it's very very old you know cuz people

1474
00:58:02,318 --> 00:58:08,119
were calling a ciss a long time ago yeah

1475
00:58:05,199 --> 00:58:10,439
well 90s is when I saw it yeah the first

1476
00:58:08,119 --> 00:58:12,480
time but then I heard some hippie at a

1477
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:14,639
Grateful Dead show or not Grateful Dead

1478
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:16,159
it was dead in company he was saying no

1479
00:58:14,639 --> 00:58:18,000
no I'm pretty sure they had cat piss

1480
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:19,759
back in the 70s they had stuff they

1481
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,760
called cat piss he said it probably

1482
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:23,200
wasn't the same thing but like C it

1483
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:25,039
makes sense because catpiss is the

1484
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:27,000
description of a smell yeah it's like

1485
00:58:25,039 --> 00:58:30,920
blue dream where it's a very specific

1486
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:33,000
name name yeah yeah I need to uh to uh

1487
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:34,519
bring you up that green crack and a few

1488
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,400
other ones I'll give you a list of some

1489
00:58:34,519 --> 00:58:38,599
stuff that I have man yeah I'd love to

1490
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:42,000
trade some genetics so we got some cool

1491
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:43,559
stuff too for sure U yeah and I got some

1492
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,079
really cool Autos I'm working with right

1493
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:49,359
now that are got full color expression

1494
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:51,240
gelato taste you know it's been and it's

1495
00:58:49,358 --> 00:58:53,679
been a while coming but yeah and then

1496
00:58:51,239 --> 00:58:55,919
using some genetics to get reinforce the

1497
00:58:53,679 --> 00:58:58,519
color because I thought I could do it on

1498
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:00,599
my own and never could and then got some

1499
00:58:58,519 --> 00:59:04,318
amazing stuff Mandalorian full full

1500
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:05,720
duplex gnome gnome yeah gnome yeah gnome

1501
00:59:04,318 --> 00:59:06,880
they're doing really interesting stuff

1502
00:59:05,719 --> 00:59:09,318
color-wise

1503
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:11,880
yeah so yeah that that black strap

1504
00:59:09,318 --> 00:59:13,759
actually breeds pretty true to the color

1505
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:15,200
so incorporating that in through a

1506
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:17,799
couple Generations you can get good

1507
00:59:15,199 --> 00:59:20,078
color that's cool but yeah so you guys

1508
00:59:17,798 --> 00:59:21,960
do auto breeding too yeah yeah I

1509
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:25,318
actually brought you some stuff dude

1510
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:26,880
that's awesome um

1511
00:59:25,318 --> 00:59:29,000
yeah I got some black Cuban Haze and

1512
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:31,240
some piff we were smoking some piff out

1513
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,079
there in New York a few months ago it's

1514
00:59:31,239 --> 00:59:35,479
like everybody's got piff and S right

1515
00:59:33,079 --> 00:59:36,880
now especially with how you know what I

1516
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:39,280
mean there's like everybody's growing

1517
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:41,358
and every it's around every corner and

1518
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:42,960
everybody's got P everyone's got sour

1519
00:59:41,358 --> 00:59:44,440
but nobody has the real Sour my buddy's

1520
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:46,720
coming a little bit later day he's got

1521
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:48,000
real Sour and I love Sour Diesel I've

1522
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:50,719
always loved Sour Diesel it's one of

1523
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,480
those things like I hadn't realized how

1524
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:53,798
much I'd even though I missed it a lot I

1525
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:55,199
hadn't realized how much i' missed it

1526
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:57,280
until I actually saw saw it again for

1527
00:59:55,199 --> 00:59:58,960
the first time in like I don't know five

1528
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:01,039
or six years where it was like the real

1529
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:04,599
deal where it's like that you open the

1530
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:06,680
bag and you get hit with like that um

1531
01:00:04,599 --> 01:00:09,798
like the burn of it smells like burnt

1532
01:00:06,679 --> 01:00:11,879
tires burnt rubber like yeah it smells

1533
01:00:09,798 --> 01:00:13,599
like might burn your eyes you're like oh

1534
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:15,440
[ __ ] it's offensive a little bit and

1535
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:18,599
then you squeeze the buzzes and it's got

1536
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:20,400
like the lime and the pine yeah and it's

1537
01:00:18,599 --> 01:00:22,039
funny cuz like over the years you like

1538
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,318
as you've moved further away from stuff

1539
01:00:22,039 --> 01:00:24,680
you don't completely forget what it

1540
01:00:23,318 --> 01:00:26,798
smells like cuz you smell it again and

1541
01:00:24,679 --> 01:00:30,798
like I know that's it yeah but like you

1542
01:00:26,798 --> 01:00:32,559
forget how amazing stuff is definitely

1543
01:00:30,798 --> 01:00:34,038
and I've always loved sour and the funny

1544
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:36,480
thing is like this stuff tests probably

1545
01:00:34,039 --> 01:00:39,160
like 14 or 15% and it [ __ ] gets you

1546
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:41,519
ripped yeah well I mean we all know that

1547
01:00:39,159 --> 01:00:42,838
that story I mean I I had an LA con that

1548
01:00:41,519 --> 01:00:45,920
would test it like

1549
01:00:42,838 --> 01:00:48,199
18% La con was fire and it would just it

1550
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:49,519
would just floor me every time and and

1551
01:00:48,199 --> 01:00:51,439
it was right right when everybody

1552
01:00:49,519 --> 01:00:54,639
started really testing a lot of stuff

1553
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:56,480
and and I'm like man this is low you you

1554
01:00:54,639 --> 01:01:00,159
know and and some of this other stuff is

1555
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:03,318
higher but I it it the effect on me it

1556
01:01:00,159 --> 01:01:05,920
it wasn't uh as strong you know big nugs

1557
01:01:03,318 --> 01:01:07,920
La con oh yeah it was a good yielder and

1558
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:11,960
they had orange hairs too they had nice

1559
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:15,798
orange hairs short and stout yeah long

1560
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:18,400
veg but uh definitely worth it yeah and

1561
01:01:15,798 --> 01:01:20,239
smoked really good definitely joint yeah

1562
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:22,079
it was joint weed it would wreck your

1563
01:01:20,239 --> 01:01:24,279
day if you weren't ready for it too yeah

1564
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:25,839
yeah so but yeah good I miss a lot of

1565
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:28,680
those OG's I feel like that's going to

1566
01:01:25,838 --> 01:01:29,920
make a comeback too like the gas and all

1567
01:01:28,679 --> 01:01:31,838
these things are going to make comebacks

1568
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:33,798
in their own way with crosses but I feel

1569
01:01:31,838 --> 01:01:36,159
like the nostalgic stuff that we grew up

1570
01:01:33,798 --> 01:01:38,280
with and where if people can find it

1571
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:40,519
either in seed form or a clone getting

1572
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:42,760
bred back into this stuff yeah because a

1573
01:01:40,519 --> 01:01:44,599
lot of people have a lot of OG crosses

1574
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:46,240
OG is one of those other things that

1575
01:01:44,599 --> 01:01:49,400
it's like when you cross it you don't

1576
01:01:46,239 --> 01:01:50,838
necessarily get an OG almost no you

1577
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:54,798
don't because it's because of recessive

1578
01:01:50,838 --> 01:01:57,519
traits so like and and so having an OG

1579
01:01:54,798 --> 01:01:59,480
that actually shows an OG traits you

1580
01:01:57,519 --> 01:02:01,400
know the the shape the buds the the

1581
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:04,679
smells the you know everything that's

1582
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:06,639
not just you know a hybrid of it I mean

1583
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:08,639
those are kind of hard to find right now

1584
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:10,199
yeah and you did some good OG seeds a

1585
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:12,118
while back and I feel like it's so funny

1586
01:02:10,199 --> 01:02:15,639
because I think you did the koshers yeah

1587
01:02:12,119 --> 01:02:20,200
I did I did kosher um what we said we

1588
01:02:15,639 --> 01:02:22,679
called kosher OG yeah um and I did uh

1589
01:02:20,199 --> 01:02:28,399
the version of the Holy Grail yeah and I

1590
01:02:22,679 --> 01:02:30,759
did uh Sauer kosher mhm um and uh hell's

1591
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:33,760
fire but there wasn't a lot of straight

1592
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:35,119
OG seeds forever and then they tried to

1593
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:37,039
do them over in Europe and they put it

1594
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:38,519
with White Widow and then you know or or

1595
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:40,920
critical or whatever they were using to

1596
01:02:38,519 --> 01:02:42,440
breed it with for their donors uh and

1597
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:44,920
they completely ruined it because like

1598
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:46,880
those recessive traits are difficult to

1599
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:49,039
breed back defin you have something so

1600
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:52,838
dominant so definitely and something

1601
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:55,680
that so like it o OG takes on you know

1602
01:02:52,838 --> 01:02:57,960
flavor right uh from just how white

1603
01:02:55,679 --> 01:03:00,318
widow does it does yeah exactly the same

1604
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:04,000
thing so it's hard to keep that OG like

1605
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:06,278
funk you know like it's I don't but um

1606
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,119
it always turns into more gas because

1607
01:03:06,278 --> 01:03:11,079
and to me it's like there's a difference

1608
01:03:08,119 --> 01:03:13,640
between like the gas and the funk yeah

1609
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:16,039
OG is gassy don't get me wrong it's it's

1610
01:03:13,639 --> 01:03:19,519
gas but it's like it's got that it's got

1611
01:03:16,039 --> 01:03:22,200
that P piny earthy bement fun that's the

1612
01:03:19,519 --> 01:03:24,318
best yeah like yeah I love that earthy

1613
01:03:22,199 --> 01:03:26,358
like Pine where you get the it almost

1614
01:03:24,318 --> 01:03:28,400
smells like fresh pine needles and and

1615
01:03:26,358 --> 01:03:31,719
that I mean that's one when you grow It

1616
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:33,278
Outdoors it comes out amazing like it's

1617
01:03:31,719 --> 01:03:35,199
it's one thing the guys growing in

1618
01:03:33,278 --> 01:03:36,679
indoors I love it but like the outdoor

1619
01:03:35,199 --> 01:03:38,679
like those are the outdoor those are the

1620
01:03:36,679 --> 01:03:40,558
years I remember you know with the sour

1621
01:03:38,679 --> 01:03:42,679
that was outdoor the ogs that were

1622
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:44,920
outdoor yeah there's a bunch of outdoor

1623
01:03:42,679 --> 01:03:46,719
and it's just those were better for

1624
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:48,240
smoke like if you're a smoker for flavor

1625
01:03:46,719 --> 01:03:50,199
I felt like those back in the day were

1626
01:03:48,239 --> 01:03:51,838
amazing oh yeah especially the sour

1627
01:03:50,199 --> 01:03:53,679
stuff yeah and you smoke those to the

1628
01:03:51,838 --> 01:03:56,480
roach like it tasted good like there was

1629
01:03:53,679 --> 01:03:57,838
only a handful of stuff that I was able

1630
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:59,278
to get when I was younger that would

1631
01:03:57,838 --> 01:04:01,838
you'd smoke it to the roach and it would

1632
01:03:59,278 --> 01:04:05,519
be absolutely amazing but the outdoor a

1633
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:08,000
lot of that stuff it no yeah yeah sour

1634
01:04:05,519 --> 01:04:09,400
I've always been I love sour even in the

1635
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,599
garden right now we have a bunch of

1636
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:14,559
headbands and sour and Kims and i95s and

1637
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:16,240
I love headband too that's another one

1638
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:19,240
like we have a headband that we've had

1639
01:04:16,239 --> 01:04:22,558
for a long time and OG's we've got all

1640
01:04:19,239 --> 01:04:24,798
the old still yeah the it's funny cuz

1641
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:26,720
the gassie from like n the chem dog

1642
01:04:24,798 --> 01:04:28,920
and the gassy from the OG are two

1643
01:04:26,719 --> 01:04:31,519
different kind of gases you got that

1644
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:35,400
burnt rubber

1645
01:04:31,519 --> 01:04:37,159
latexy like super pungent and then OG is

1646
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:39,519
super pungent as well and super loud but

1647
01:04:37,159 --> 01:04:42,798
it's like gassy like Rocket Fuel kind of

1648
01:04:39,519 --> 01:04:46,559
gas yeah like gasoline rather than burnt

1649
01:04:42,798 --> 01:04:49,960
Tire yeah but yeah I love both of them

1650
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:52,000
and this has that nice Earth to it yeah

1651
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:54,278
yeah is that the ghost or that was the

1652
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,719
ghost yeah it's really good yeah that

1653
01:04:54,278 --> 01:04:58,960
one's a good

1654
01:04:55,719 --> 01:05:01,278
one it has the effect I mean OG is OG

1655
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:04,119
like what I like about OG the most is

1656
01:05:01,278 --> 01:05:07,639
just how how the effect on it it's like

1657
01:05:04,119 --> 01:05:10,079
that it's hard to find weed that that

1658
01:05:07,639 --> 01:05:12,118
will hit you like that totally you know

1659
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:14,760
um make your eyes all low this is this

1660
01:05:12,119 --> 01:05:15,480
one though this one smells you tell me

1661
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:17,480
what

1662
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:20,679
it this is

1663
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:20,679
good it's

1664
01:05:23,079 --> 01:05:28,400

Tangy for sure yeah but it's funny

1670
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:47,278
because this is really on the blossom

1671
01:05:45,519 --> 01:05:48,880
side like the the fresh squeeze juice

1672
01:05:47,278 --> 01:05:51,440
and not the Ry side and I do like the

1673
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:54,240
Rind too I think the Rind is especially

1674
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:57,599
extract like that rind is pretty amazing

1675
01:05:54,239 --> 01:06:00,439

1677
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:04,440
sickle

1678
01:06:01,838 --> 01:06:06,880
like well so you guys seen Agent Orange

1680
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:12,358
guy rest in peace like yeah yeah I mean

1681
01:06:10,039 --> 01:06:14,520
I grew so much of his stuff too like had

1682
01:06:12,358 --> 01:06:16,400
a lot of TPS in his stuff yeah Jack the

1683
01:06:14,519 --> 01:06:20,199
Ripper

1684
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:21,838
and D I can't Chernobyl Chernobyl yeah

1685
01:06:20,199 --> 01:06:23,480
we had the there's like the Chernobyl

1686
01:06:21,838 --> 01:06:24,558
and then there was the golden ticket cut

1687
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:26,240
of the chern

1688
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:29,680
I remember that yeah there was it wasn't

1689
01:06:26,239 --> 01:06:33,679
a it wasn't the Slimer yeah sler or the

1690
01:06:29,679 --> 01:06:36,358
golden ticket both I drew both of those

1691
01:06:33,679 --> 01:06:37,838
itun yeah there was but he had like all

1692
01:06:36,358 --> 01:06:39,920
kinds of great stuff the agent orange

1693
01:06:37,838 --> 01:06:41,880
was really so I didn't like the agent

1694
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:44,760
orange until I saw it grown at House of

1695
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:47,720
coltivar in 2018 I thought it was bunk

1696
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:50,440
because I in the you know early 2000s

1697
01:06:47,719 --> 01:06:53,159
there was Calo that I was exposed to and

1698
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:54,880
then Tangi and then agent orange I saw

1699
01:06:53,159 --> 01:06:57,759
agent orange and I'm like W this stuff

1700
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:59,798
that I saw was very linear it was like

1701
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:01,839
just an orange it was almost like a

1702
01:06:59,798 --> 01:07:04,880
orange color and no complexity at all

1703
01:07:01,838 --> 01:07:06,440
right so not color but orange uh smell

1704
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:09,039
that was very linear there was no

1705
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:11,079
complexity at all and then uh I went to

1706
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:13,000
House of cultivar in 2018 and he had

1707
01:07:11,079 --> 01:07:14,240
stuff labeled agent orange and I didn't

1708
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,880
want to smell it and he's like no dude

1709
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:18,399
this is good and I'm like okay so I

1710
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:20,200
smelled it and I was like this is an

1711
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,920
anent orange there's no way this is it

1712
01:07:20,199 --> 01:07:23,558
wasn't Tangi but it was just another

1713
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:25,639
anent orange and at first I was like

1714
01:07:23,559 --> 01:07:29,400
well maybe Tangi because it smelled more

1715
01:07:25,639 --> 01:07:31,960
like Tangi than agent orange but it was

1716
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:33,480
different than Tangi and he it was from

1717
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:35,039
seed and so you just never know when you

1718
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:37,440
get seeds you ever someone might get

1719
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:39,920
that one winner loud Berry yeah and then

1720
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:42,039
the the you know the turps on on the

1721
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:44,920
agan orange I've grown it you know it's

1722
01:07:42,039 --> 01:07:46,839
it's uh for for the ones that I had they

1723
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:48,760
were they were more orange peel and

1724
01:07:46,838 --> 01:07:52,358
orange rind but they there was orange

1725
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:56,160
turps to them yeah um what I I thought

1726
01:07:52,358 --> 01:07:58,400
had a amazing TPS from sub subcool was

1727
01:07:56,159 --> 01:07:59,920
uh Jil Bean the Jil Bean Jill Bean was

1728
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:01,519
good too oh Jill's taking credit for

1729
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:04,400
that

1730
01:08:01,519 --> 01:08:06,880
oh I don't know bought it a long time

1731
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:09,000
ago I didn't totally yeah I mean that

1732
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:11,400
had great turs yeah that had great turps

1733
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:13,239
but I think with all their stuff it

1734
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:15,559
almost all had flavor and they had so

1735
01:08:13,239 --> 01:08:17,198
like the green Avengers yeah they had

1736
01:08:15,559 --> 01:08:18,719
like literally they had some of the best

1737
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:20,919
guys working for them you know I'm good

1738
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:23,158
friends with a bunch of them and it's

1739
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:25,640
like uh you know between Pat here is

1740
01:08:23,158 --> 01:08:29,599
from the farm they had Shane uh Sunny

1741

Chiba Odie was there all you know that

1742
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:34,640
that was quite a and there's a bunch

1743
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:36,159
more the good old days the good old days

1744
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:38,838
those were fun events though like the

1745
01:08:36,158 --> 01:08:40,358
old old events it was like a you know

1746
01:08:38,838 --> 01:08:42,519
it's hard to describe and even put it

1747
01:08:40,359 --> 01:08:44,279
into words but it's kind of how disco

1748
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:46,199
and once disco was done it was done they

1749
01:08:44,279 --> 01:08:48,279
still try to do disco now but it's not

1750
01:08:46,198 --> 01:08:50,119
what it was back then yeah and cups were

1751
01:08:48,279 --> 01:08:53,560
kind of like that way to put it it was

1752
01:08:50,119 --> 01:08:55,158
like a big family it's like we had the

1753
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:56,440
most most amazing times but it was like

1754
01:08:55,158 --> 01:08:58,079
the same people would go to all the

1755
01:08:56,439 --> 01:08:59,639
events and so we were like a big family

1756
01:08:58,079 --> 01:09:00,838

01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:08,319
expect and there was probably like 250

1760
01:09:06,039 --> 01:09:09,759
of us that all kind of went and we all

1761
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:11,000
intermingled maybe it wasn't that much

1762
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:13,079
maybe it was like a hundred that were

1763
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,880
pretty constant but still that's a lot

1764
01:09:13,079 --> 01:09:17,238
you know that's a lot everybody kind of

1765
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:19,520
knew everybody and yeah and we were all

1766
01:09:17,238 --> 01:09:21,238
there for for weed because we like we

1767
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:22,520
like flour like we like the Cannabis

1768
01:09:21,238 --> 01:09:24,399
which I think it's an amazing thing that

1769
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:26,400
it can bring all of us together

1770
01:09:24,399 --> 01:09:27,920
yeah definitely especially when it was

1771
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:30,119
like in Amsterdam and stuff and

1772
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:31,759
everybody would jam there yeah oh yeah

1773
01:09:30,119 --> 01:09:34,679

1774

1781
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:55,560

1782
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:57,279

people that I've been friends with long

1785
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:05,440
time and so yeah and there's such good

1786
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:06,920
food and you know it's it's very social

1787
01:10:05,439 --> 01:10:08,359
and I don't do social stuff like I used

1788
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:10,880
to we used to do it like once or twice a

1789
01:10:08,359 --> 01:10:12,719
month right and now it's like oh maybe

1790
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:14,800
like twice a year three times a year we

1791
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:17,920
get to really break loose as we're

1792
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:20,560
getting older but I think that's how it

1793
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:22,600
goes yeah yeah well I mean there I

1794

01:11:11,399 --> 01:11:16,198
everybody selling seeds the whole time

1818
01:11:13,279 --> 01:11:17,840

1819
01:11:16,198 --> 01:11:22,198
packs of seeds that we had

1820
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:24,440
sold and um how many minutes they were

1821
01:11:22,198 --> 01:11:27,039
and the and the time that we were open

1822
01:11:24,439 --> 01:11:30,079
right selling seeds and it was more than

1823
01:11:27,039 --> 01:11:32,479
like two or three packs a minute wow

1824
01:11:30,079 --> 01:11:35,000
yeah it was crazy that that was the our

1825
01:11:32,479 --> 01:11:36,599
the heat of our our was that at Colorado

1826
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,639
yeah but we ran out that's why it didn't

1827
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:40,560
we didn't last the whole time like we

1828
01:11:38,639 --> 01:11:42,239
ran out in like 4 or five hours it was

1829
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:43,800
just like those are the best though when

1830
01:11:42,238 --> 01:11:46,638
you can sell out at shows that's only

1831

especially if you're going anywhere

1833
01:11:48,238 --> 01:11:51,479
destination if you sell out you don't

1834
