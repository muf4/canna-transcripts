43
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:45,658
and we started smoking

44
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,978

eyes right

46
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:52,679
this the first time I ever got off

47
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:54,840
smoking I closed my eyes

48
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,180
and I thought they they were closed for

49
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,939
like five minutes and when I opened them

50
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,740
we were like almost in the same spot you

51
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:03,319
know we were going like 60 miles an hour

52
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:06,599
downfall Avenue

53
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:09,239
but that was the first time I smoked pot

54
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:13,019
and then um

55
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm not too not too long after that

57
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,680
right probably before I yeah I was

58
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:20,939

59
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,020
selling it

60
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:24,000
because

61
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,099
um we were in front of the stores where

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,080

what happened with that I'd go into

193
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:45,300
detail you know you you said 37 years I

194
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,519
did I did 32 calendars straight I did a

195
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,978
little bid the first time same type of

196
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:52,560
deal you know but

197
00:07:49,978 --> 00:07:54,538
but I think they were they were really

198
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,538
aggravated with me that because what

199
00:07:54,538 --> 00:08:00,360
they did was they gave me um

200
00:07:57,538 --> 00:08:03,060
the first time they gave me five five

201
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:06,419
years since no seven five year sentences

202
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:09,000
running wild wow so there was a lot of

203
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:11,818
time I had to knock for a five year off

204
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,038
every time to get to the last five to

205
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:18,000
the last five to seven so

206
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:20,459
it was like 35 35 right so um so I knew

207
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,839
it was an illegal sense right when they

208
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:23,818
gave it to me right

209
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:25,079
so I said I said to my lawyer I said hey

210
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:26,699
man what's the deal he said man don't

211
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:28,439
say a word let's just let them process

212
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:30,419
everything

213
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:32,038
so they processed everything they sent

214
00:08:30,418 --> 00:08:33,958
us away to prison

215
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:36,059
I called my lawyer when I got there he

216
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:38,098
said oh no problem I got a thing set up

217
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:41,939
for you for rehearing we went back they

218
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:45,959

219
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:49,080
um 369 on a five but I had to I had done

220
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:51,000
two years in the county so I only had to

221
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,100
do like a year and a half you know right

222
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,399
well and that's when Rick came into the

223
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:58,440
picture I bet like after well what

224
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,080
happened was I placed that first case

225
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,360
was um I wasn't really in the picture I

226
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:06,600
was around I was very young I was a baby

227
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,639
oh so you were a baby I was about five

228
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,560
uh when he got out the first time I was

229
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,240
about six years old and my mom had kind

230
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:15,359
of like kidnapped me and brought me to

231
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:18,500

me too yeah yeah so I it's it's like

233
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:24,179
basically the first case I wasn't really

234
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,940
involved in because my mother had taken

235
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:29,579
me and kind of like ran away with me and

236
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,600
then when my pops got out

237
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,360

down

599
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:37,798
went underneath the wave

600
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:40,079
and then when it popped back up another

601

00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:55,859
okay so that was the Maria deal so we're

657
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:58,019
coming back the windows get sold then

658
00:25:55,859 --> 00:25:59,399
it takes us a bunch of hours to get

659
00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:02,038
everything squared away and we're back

660
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,538
on our on our course yeah so you got the

661
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:07,200
pump going getting the water out of

662
00:26:03,538 --> 00:26:09,480
there oh man forget about it the boat is

663
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:13,259
luckily it didn't sink because it had a

664
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:16,159
a sealed up engine room yeah we get all

665
00:26:13,259 --> 00:26:16,158
the water pumped out

666
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:21,298
we we go over this Reef in the Bahamas

667
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,400
and we cut a hole through the reefs to

668
00:26:21,298 --> 00:26:25,619
go into this little Lagoon around the

669
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,840
back of the reef

670
00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:29,819
we sat there for three days

671
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:32,699
with the boat going up and down eight

672
00:26:29,819 --> 00:26:35,240
nine feet at a time yeah

673
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:39,558
you know with the anchor out

674
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,558
we lost all food

675
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:45,778
and SEPTA had some fish in the freezer

676
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:47,580
and that's what we survived on and

677
00:26:45,778 --> 00:26:50,220
here's the wildest part when we were

678
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:52,079
leaving Jamaica I had met this Rasta guy

679
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:54,058
down there

680
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:56,460
which was looking out for us on the

681
00:26:54,058 --> 00:26:58,558
heavy duty Chinese smoke down there you

682
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:01,019
know the Chinese people down there go to

683
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:03,839
best smoke so he made sure to laid the

684
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:05,099
best smoke right he had the dreadlocks I

685
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:07,379
mean for real

686
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:10,500
hanging off dead hair you know like for

687
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:12,900
10 years he had a way down his back

688
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:15,538
and when I'm leaving he's helping him

689
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:17,460
load the boat but he comes back after we

690
00:27:15,538 --> 00:27:18,480
got all the weed on the boat and he says

691
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,278
to me

692
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,778
he's waving to me and I'd say hey what's

693
00:27:20,278 --> 00:27:23,579
up he said uh

694
00:27:21,778 --> 00:27:27,919
man I just bought you some food and

695
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:27,918
stuff he brought me pineapples mangoes

696
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:35,940
all the stuff right and none of it was

697
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,700
really ripe

698
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:41,159
so I had two holes in the back

699
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:43,019
that had propane tanks in it when I only

700
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:44,880
had one propane tank aboard one of them

701
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:46,500
big ones you know yeah and the other

702
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,960
hole was empty that there wasn't a tank

703
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:51,419
in it so I opened it up and I put that

704
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,100
stuff in there and when I closed it the

705
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:54,778
string that was on it you know I tied

706
00:27:53,099 --> 00:27:56,339
off so it wouldn't lay in the bottom

707
00:27:54,778 --> 00:27:59,099
yeah

708
00:27:56,339 --> 00:28:01,918
and that's what fed us within three or

709
00:27:59,099 --> 00:28:04,500
four days that and and the fish that we

710
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,240
had nice and then we took the wooden

711
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:09,538
windows down

712
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:11,819
and we drove right into into Lighthouse

713
00:28:09,538 --> 00:28:13,319
Point with the boat you know like we

714
00:28:11,819 --> 00:28:15,960
were fishing guys and we were coming

715
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:17,460
home from fishing

716
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,340
and uh

717
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:22,740

718
00:28:20,339 --> 00:28:24,298

00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:09,780

873
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:20,820

874
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,480
group that grow over there by Negril

875
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:26,940
yeah but the weed went from like decent

876
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,039
until outrageous holy [ __ ] that was the

877
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:31,200
Chinese people real Landry [ __ ] and

878
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:34,019
there wasn't wasn't much of that it was

879
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:36,178
like even Lamb's bread is like hard I

880
00:34:34,019 --> 00:34:38,699
haven't even seen it in Jamaica I never

881
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:40,320
actually seen it I've seen it here I've

882
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:43,739
seen some hybrids of it I definitely

883
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:46,379
know the [ __ ] musky Terps but uh yeah

884
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:48,719
and so when you were getting flour in

885
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:50,398
Jamaica do you remember the strains that

886
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:53,579
they have specific strains or was it

887
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:55,378
just a good weed or no it was just it

888
00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:58,500
was either the Chinese people had it

889
00:34:55,378 --> 00:35:02,299
yeah what did you make inside it

890
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:02,300

892
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:09,780
any of the Chinese smoke that you got

893
00:35:06,858 --> 00:35:12,000

beat both trials the first time uh

985

never went back on it well

1011
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:32,338
and that's what he told him in court and

1012
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:34,740

morning I get to California

1064
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:44,820
and my phone I call my father who tells

1065
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:47,159
me yeah man you're on the front page of

1066
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:49,260
the Sun Sentinel I said you know I

1067
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:52,219
thought he was [ __ ] kidding me but

1068
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:55,980
meanwhile I was under in the front page

1069
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:57,959
for one month straight wow the Miami

1070
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:59,880
Herald and the Sun Sentinel in Fort

1071
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:01,619
Lauderdale a month straight they had a

1072
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:04,619
story on me every day

1073
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:07,260
and when they arrested me

1074
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:11,460
they are an odd me to my father

1075
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:12,839
no you know not a not a Cash Pawn Yeah

1076
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:15,599
because

1077
00:42:12,838 --> 00:42:17,099
when when I was in California I said to

1078
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:19,320
my father I ain't [ __ ] going back to

1079
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:21,838
Florida I'm going to Mexico I said [ __ ]

1080
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:25,500
this house I'll go to Mexico you know

1081
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:29,420
start something going for Mexico right

1082
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:29,420
but my father talked me out of it

1083
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,358
and that that was the beginning

1084
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:42,000
of really

1085
00:42:37,858 --> 00:42:44,098
all of this all that yeah

1086
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,019
and I hate to say it like that and it

1087
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:48,480
sounds very one part of it it sounds

1088
00:42:46,019 --> 00:42:51,000
very selfish you're a partner no but but

1089
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:53,338
so so here's my look my Outlook on that

1090
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,719
in my opinion is that if it wasn't for

1091
00:42:53,338 --> 00:42:56,400
people that pushed the envelope like

1092
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:59,159
yourself there would be none of this

1093
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,240
around today like it is now it may be in

1094
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:02,338
some different form but it would

1095
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:03,838
probably still be illegal you know and

1096
00:43:02,338 --> 00:43:05,759
there would be a small group but it's

1097
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:07,858
really the people that push the envelope

1098
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,180
that made the difference you know for

1099
00:43:07,858 --> 00:43:12,719
legalization

1100
00:43:09,179 --> 00:43:15,299
yeah so because yeah

1101
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:17,578
and the demand to understand it also so

1102
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:20,160
that's just a product and people start

1103
00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:22,019
well there had to be a supply it was so

1104
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:23,818
wild for me when I was a kid yeah

1105
00:43:22,019 --> 00:43:24,960
because I couldn't believe it I'd buy a

1106
00:43:23,818 --> 00:43:27,539
pound

1107
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:31,679
and I'd nickel it up into nickel bags

1108
00:43:27,539 --> 00:43:33,599
yeah now a shot glass was a Nickelback

1109
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:34,980

1110
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:36,480

00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:38,639
half you know

1112

settle down

1267
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:57,659
you know I'm kind of settling down but

1268
00:49:55,679 --> 00:49:59,639
this whole thing that's going on right

1269
00:49:57,659 --> 00:50:01,980
now yeah I want to make sure I'm a part

1270
00:49:59,639 --> 00:50:03,838
of it I want to go down to History part

1273
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:08,338
definitely I need to I need to do this

1274
00:50:06,659 --> 00:50:10,618
yeah

1275
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:12,900
now is the time I mean I feel like the

1276
00:50:10,619 --> 00:50:14,039
people that are still here

1277
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:15,240
you know we're looking at each other

1278
00:50:14,039 --> 00:50:18,358
like hey

1279
00:50:15,239 --> 00:50:20,699
we got this yes you know and I mean it's

1280
00:50:18,358 --> 00:50:22,799
tough It's been tough in the industry uh

1281
00:50:20,699 --> 00:50:24,000
whether you're doing cultivation or

1282
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,039
genetics or anything like that there's

1283
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,838
more competition but there's a lot of

1284
00:50:26,039 --> 00:50:30,358
[ __ ] products on the market I think

1285
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:32,940
there's definitely a place for high-end

1286
00:50:30,358 --> 00:50:34,679
Boutique products and authentic people

1287
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:37,858
yep

1288
00:50:34,679 --> 00:50:39,059
so I think that's a big part of it

1289
00:50:37,858 --> 00:50:40,259
um so tell us a little bit about your

00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:51,660
set all new records for for True leaf

1398
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:55,318
it's like it doesn't last more than two

1399
00:54:51,659 --> 00:54:57,058
days right and but that now that

1400
00:54:55,318 --> 00:54:58,800
it's changed

1401
00:54:57,059 --> 00:55:02,339
as soon as it runs out they fill it back

1402
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:04,859
up again well yeah so my my feeling on

1403
00:55:02,338 --> 00:55:08,039
wreck and one of the problems with all

1404
00:55:04,858 --> 00:55:09,960
this wreck cannabis is that a lot of

1405
00:55:08,039 --> 00:55:12,000
it's not fresh if you get Fresh Products

1406
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:13,019
it's a lot better if it moves if the

1407
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,239
companies are moving their product but

1408
00:55:13,019 --> 00:55:17,099
if you're getting it you know even six

1409
00:55:15,239 --> 00:55:18,479
eight weeks after harvest Sometimes some

1410
00:55:17,099 --> 00:55:19,980
of these Brands the flour tastes like

1411
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,838
[ __ ] even though the genetics were good

1412
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:25,318
it might have even been grown correctly

1413
00:55:21,838 --> 00:55:27,838
but yeah I think the flowers were

1414
00:55:25,318 --> 00:55:32,338
hitting at what 28 or something I don't

1415
00:55:27,838 --> 00:55:38,279
know the 29 yeah and then the uh the

1416
00:55:32,338 --> 00:55:40,980
pre-rolls were 23 uh 24 9. yeah he I

1417

1423
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,559
I mean I buy pre-rolls from dispensaries

1424
00:55:53,519 --> 00:55:57,900

1425

that Market's really stable you know I

1435
00:56:17,099 --> 00:56:21,838
mean they went through their second

1436
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:23,399
um recession but yeah it's it's

1437

00:56:28,619 --> 00:56:33,780
can give a

1441
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:36,420
a person like a a more I guess valuable

1442
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:38,760
product from their essay you know what

1443
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:40,380
do you guys think of the pre-rolls that

1444
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:44,099
are infused with either diamonds or

1445
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:46,140
rosin hash holes if it works if people

1446
00:56:44,099 --> 00:56:47,880
if there's a market for it I you know I

1447
00:56:46,139 --> 00:56:49,500
support it like a lot of the hassles I

1448
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:51,539
know it's a niche market makes a lot of

1449
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:54,659
sense you know right

1450
00:56:51,539 --> 00:56:57,500
um some of the some of the infused stuff

1451
00:56:54,659 --> 00:56:57,500
can be kind of

1452
00:56:59,239 --> 00:57:05,279
yeah I like I like it to be like

1453
00:57:02,099 --> 00:57:06,838
some sort of quality kept to it yeah

1454
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,819
um but most of the stuff that I see is

1455
00:57:06,838 --> 00:57:11,219

this is the same thing yeah oh it's got

1495
00:58:35,639 --> 00:58:39,598
a tip in the middle yeah and then you

1496
00:58:37,858 --> 00:58:41,460
just put the filter inside super fire

1497

right nothing like this yeah I mean we

1783
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:43,020
had a flip phone you know a little

1784
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:45,179
burner you could send a picture you

1785
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:46,679
could flush it down the toilet right you

1786
01:09:45,179 --> 01:09:49,199
know it was a little thing like this pig

1787
01:09:46,679 --> 01:09:50,579
if when it closed it was like that big

1788
01:09:49,198 --> 01:09:53,039
you could flush it right down and throw

1789
01:09:50,579 --> 01:09:55,019
it wow they never catch you with it

1790
01:09:53,039 --> 01:09:58,198
so where were you incarcerated

1791
01:09:55,020 --> 01:10:00,960

1795
01:10:05,579 --> 01:10:09,719

1796
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:11,880
comfortable there and you're they see it

1797
01:10:09,719 --> 01:10:14,100

1800
01:10:15,539 --> 01:10:20,819
going on you know we got the officers

1801
01:10:17,579 --> 01:10:22,319

1802
01:10:20,819 --> 01:10:26,519

and I helped so many people in there it

1805
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:33,840
was incredible my thing was when I got

1806
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:35,640
off the bus to whatever it is to keep

1807
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:37,560
this brain occupied because this [ __ ]

1808
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:40,079
here will have me hanging inside the

1809
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:42,000
cell I'll hang myself

1810
01:10:40,079 --> 01:10:43,859
you know I can't go with that [ __ ] my

1811
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:48,738
wife's looking around out there you know

1812
01:10:43,859 --> 01:10:48,738
I just had to all that right you know

1813
01:10:48,899 --> 01:10:54,059
and I made it

1814
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:55,319
here I am talking to you amazing

1815
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:59,280
there we go

1816
01:10:55,319 --> 01:11:01,559
yeah it's it's been an amazing journey

1817
01:10:59,279 --> 01:11:03,359
so in the next five years where do you

1818
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:05,840
guys see your uh company and where do

1819
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:07,679
you see the Cannabis industry going

1820
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:10,319
hmm

1821
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:12,899
yeah that's a really good question

1822
01:11:10,319 --> 01:11:13,880
um where do I see the Cannabis industry

1823
01:11:12,899 --> 01:11:16,859
going

1824
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:19,859
well I think everybody's kind of like

1825
01:11:16,859 --> 01:11:21,859
sitting on a edge of their seats

1826
01:11:19,859 --> 01:11:24,839
wondering if this is going to go federal

1827
01:11:21,859 --> 01:11:26,639
legal not that that's like encompassing

1828
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:29,279
how everything's gonna go but I think a

1829
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:31,320
lot of people are trying to

1830
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:32,939
structure their next moves around that

1831
01:11:31,319 --> 01:11:34,559
you know

1832
01:11:32,939 --> 01:11:38,099
um but

1833
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:40,620
I think that cannabis because it's it's

1834
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:43,860
so niche

1835
01:11:40,619 --> 01:11:47,039
it's a special plant it's not like

1836
01:11:43,859 --> 01:11:48,359
it's not like um a Marlboro cigarette

1837
01:11:47,039 --> 01:11:50,640
it's not like a cigarette where you

1838
01:11:48,359 --> 01:11:52,619
could be like okay that cigarette just

1839
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:55,380
tastes like that every time it's just

1840
01:11:52,619 --> 01:11:58,439
like it's it has to do with like people

1841
01:11:55,380 --> 01:12:00,600
really loving new terpenes

1842
01:11:58,439 --> 01:12:03,779
um new ways that the plant makes them

1843
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:05,280
feel or makes them heal you know there's

1844
01:12:03,779 --> 01:12:07,259
there's different ways that people use

1845
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:08,639
it some people use it recreationally and

1846
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:11,760
some some people use it to heal

1847
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:14,520
themselves I think Dennis perone said

1848
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:17,219
yeah whether uh what is it whether you

1849
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:18,840
believe it or not it's it's medicine I

1850
01:12:17,219 --> 01:12:21,300
think whether you know it or not I know

1851
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:22,860
it I know it me and my cousin have

1852
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:24,420
tripped so much of it because we always

1853
01:12:22,859 --> 01:12:26,279
smoke so much tree and we're always like

1854
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:28,679
why do we smoke so much [ __ ] treat

1855
01:12:26,279 --> 01:12:30,599
why do we love it so much yeah but we

1856
01:12:28,679 --> 01:12:32,940
had a very traumatic use

1857
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:34,920
so it's like a way that I know and

1858
01:12:32,939 --> 01:12:37,678
almost guarantee that that's how I deal

1859
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:39,539
with my PTSD you know like not having a

1860
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:43,440
parent growing up or

1861
01:12:39,539 --> 01:12:46,019
watching The Perils of how you know his

1862
01:12:43,439 --> 01:12:48,359
hit what what he went through made our

1863
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:50,520
family go through not even to do with

1864
01:12:48,359 --> 01:12:53,219
cannabis just like family [ __ ] you know

1865
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:55,440
right I think the Cannabis will um

1866
01:12:53,219 --> 01:12:58,140
always have it's

1867
01:12:55,439 --> 01:13:00,419
there'll be a very commercial heavy wave

1868
01:12:58,140 --> 01:13:03,179
I think that will just keep happening as

1869
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:04,440
each state conforms to how it deals with

1870
01:13:03,179 --> 01:13:05,819
cannabis

1871
01:13:04,439 --> 01:13:08,099
you know because each state has

1872
01:13:05,819 --> 01:13:08,939
different approach to it it's like

1873
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:10,440
um

1874
01:13:08,939 --> 01:13:12,238
and uh

1875
01:13:10,439 --> 01:13:14,759
I think that

1876
01:13:12,238 --> 01:13:17,218
over time just like good cannabis will

1877
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:20,699
always hold its weight you know like

1878
01:13:17,219 --> 01:13:23,520
certain people want really good cannabis

1879
01:13:20,698 --> 01:13:26,460
there's always going to be a demand yeah

1880
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:28,140
connoisseur flour yeah I I think and

1881
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:29,698
extracts I think x-ray for sure because

1882
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:30,960
it's always breaking through to like a

1883
01:13:29,698 --> 01:13:32,339
new level and they're they're always

1884
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:34,020
coming out with new different forms of

1885
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:35,579
extract it seems like I mean I like the

1886
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:36,780
Ross and I think that's cool but I

1887
01:13:35,579 --> 01:13:39,539
really like that at the end of the day

1888
01:13:36,779 --> 01:13:41,880
good flower yeah I love melt I love like

1889
01:13:39,539 --> 01:13:44,460
all the full melts you know yeah but

1890
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:45,679
flour is definitely like a key

1891
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:49,560
key

1892
01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:52,020
cannabis component you know better than

1893
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:54,719
I I kind of feel like

1894
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:56,340
you can't just smoke one or the other

1895
01:13:54,719 --> 01:13:59,399
you know what I mean it's good to like

1896
01:13:56,340 --> 01:14:00,960
indulge in both variety I like variety

1897
01:13:59,399 --> 01:14:04,079
and I like smoking sativas and I like

1898
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:06,600
smoking strong indicas

1899
01:14:04,079 --> 01:14:08,519
you know I like I I'm on a mix right you

1900
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:10,020
want to have like if it is the Indica

1901
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:12,719
City because it's all pretty much hybrid

1902
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:17,460
anyway but I like I like floral Terps

1903
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:19,560
yeah I like floral terms yes yes candy I

1904
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:21,658
like Skittles I like anything curves

1905
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:23,340
yeah

1906
01:14:21,658 --> 01:14:25,799
which a lot of those are good but I like

1907
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:27,659
old cams I like old ogs I like me too

1908
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:29,659
dude I like the when they punch you in

1909
01:14:27,658 --> 01:14:32,460
the face

1910
01:14:29,658 --> 01:14:36,059
I think the tricycle G is like stapled

1911
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:37,800
cannabis for anybody's stash for sure

1912
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:39,719
for sure and like that super silver was

1913
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:42,119
good it definitely got me high like the

1914
01:14:39,719 --> 01:14:43,859
first hit I took I felt like right off

1915
01:14:42,119 --> 01:14:46,859
bow right off

1916
01:14:43,859 --> 01:14:49,380
I smoked so much of it in the Amsterdam

1917
01:14:46,859 --> 01:14:53,880
so what do you like to smoke

1918
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:55,619
what what are your type uh indica

1919
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:57,060
so do you have any particular strains

1920
01:14:55,619 --> 01:14:59,340
you guys sell some strains you guys want

1921
01:14:57,060 --> 01:15:01,500
to talk about this strange you guys we

1922
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:04,679
got Flamingo Kush on the market in

1923
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:06,658
Florida Indica which is like a Indica

1924
01:15:04,679 --> 01:15:10,560
hybrid

1925
01:15:06,658 --> 01:15:13,920
um Indica dominant hybrid I would say

1926
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:16,560
uh it's like uh it's a very very strong

1927
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:17,460
cushy

1928
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:20,280
um

1929
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:23,939
is it like an OG yeah it is it's a it's

1930
01:15:20,279 --> 01:15:26,460
a cross of um it's a cushman's Fino

1931
01:15:23,939 --> 01:15:28,019
nice so that's it's uh I think they

1932
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:32,939
popped something like 25 different

1933
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:34,860
different uh seeds and then we chose 18.

1934
01:15:32,939 --> 01:15:37,079
number 18. yeah

1935
01:15:34,859 --> 01:15:40,380
it's out of that batch yeah

1936
01:15:37,079 --> 01:15:42,479
and then you know the way Lord goes you

1937
01:15:40,380 --> 01:15:44,520
have to rename things so it becomes a

1938
01:15:42,479 --> 01:15:46,738
whole like uh with the Department of

1939
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:48,000
Health yeah I'll give it a name you want

1940
01:15:46,738 --> 01:15:50,519
to explain that because I'm not even

1941
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,560
familiar well I just know that we had to

1942
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:54,360
choose a name and it had to be approved

1943
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:56,880
by the Department of Health oh wow it

1944
01:15:54,359 --> 01:15:58,920
was like the first name was not approved

1945
01:15:56,880 --> 01:16:00,960
and then it came back to us on the

1946
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:03,119
second round and yeah we were doing

1947
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:07,319
going with an alligator Gator thing you

1948
01:16:03,119 --> 01:16:09,119
know and they improve it hmm

1949
01:16:07,319 --> 01:16:11,939
because the animal probably goes to

1950
01:16:09,119 --> 01:16:14,819

seeing some weed in the 80s late 70s

1987
01:17:25,738 --> 01:17:31,799
that the bottom of the leaf yeah was

1988
01:17:28,859 --> 01:17:35,158
purple yeah from temperature and the top

1989
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:37,260
of the leaf was green yeah or a reddish

1990
01:17:35,158 --> 01:17:39,059
stressed too and then when it would

1991
01:17:37,260 --> 01:17:42,119
start to Bud

1992
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:44,340

1993
01:17:42,119 --> 01:17:46,619
I mean embedded in it

1994
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:49,500
with the Crystal and then the little bit

1995
01:17:46,619 --> 01:17:51,420
of red and the orange yeah and then it's

1996
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:52,738
like

1997
01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:54,840

01:19:17,279 --> 01:19:20,099
I started with the zoom style so you

2039
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:21,960
could always start with just a zoom

2040
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:25,020
style from your your laptop do it at

2041
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:27,000
home and you know I think it's yeah you

2044
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:35,219
reconnect with and oh for sure yeah I

2045
01:19:32,158 --> 01:19:37,079
wanted to um yeah it's it's like

2046
01:19:35,219 --> 01:19:38,520
or when you were breaking down how did

2047
01:19:37,079 --> 01:19:41,158
the business come about I kind of wanted

2048
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:45,179
to break down to you how like

2049
01:19:41,158 --> 01:19:48,000
probably the first time I ever

2050
01:19:45,179 --> 01:19:50,460
had mentioned what what I what what I

2051
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,779
thought could be for my father

2052
01:19:50,460 --> 01:19:54,800
was probably

2053
01:19:51,779 --> 01:19:54,800
um I would say

2054
01:19:56,520 --> 01:20:01,500
eight or nine years ago maybe 10 years

2055
01:19:59,399 --> 01:20:04,198
ago now huh

2056
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:05,640
we were on a phone call and you know

2057
01:20:04,198 --> 01:20:07,859
[ __ ] was just starting to become

2058
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:10,800
transparent that it was legal legalizing

2059
01:20:07,859 --> 01:20:12,899
everywhere and kind of normalizing in a

2060
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:15,119
way in people's eyes and I was like yo

2061
01:20:12,899 --> 01:20:16,439
he was like you know is it [ __ ] like

2062
01:20:15,119 --> 01:20:18,119
he was like kind of tripping like are

2063
01:20:16,439 --> 01:20:20,519
people really making money off this [ __ ]

2064
01:20:18,119 --> 01:20:22,319
every day is this really happening and I

2065
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:24,420
was like yeah it's really happening I

2066
01:20:22,319 --> 01:20:27,000
said you're gonna get out you know

2067
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:30,899
and um I remember saying to him at that

2068
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:31,859
point yo uh we I'll carve a lane out for

2069
01:20:30,899 --> 01:20:33,960
you

2070
01:20:31,859 --> 01:20:36,779
and we'll make sure that you know

2071
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:39,480
there's there's a restitution kinda

2072
01:20:36,779 --> 01:20:41,158
put forth for you so we can make sure

2073
01:20:39,479 --> 01:20:43,500
you get something back for all the

2074
01:20:41,158 --> 01:20:47,399
sacrifice you've gone through you know

2075
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:49,500
and um it's wild to that's probably how

2076
01:20:47,399 --> 01:20:52,259
this all came about you know

2077
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:54,719
a lot of people say it's this or that or

2078
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:56,699
but everything starts with kind of like

2079
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:59,698
an idea you know and I really remember

2080
01:20:56,698 --> 01:21:03,000
like tripping even like after meeting

2081
01:20:59,698 --> 01:21:04,559
you and seeing span of this and

2082
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,179
seeing the whole evolution of the

2083
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:07,739
Cannabis industry it just blew me away

2084
01:21:06,179 --> 01:21:09,600
and I knew that it was actually going to

2085
01:21:07,738 --> 01:21:10,979
happen that's why I started saying it to

2086
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:12,659
people like you at that point I was

2087
01:21:10,979 --> 01:21:13,979

2088
01:21:12,658 --> 01:21:15,658
you know you were calling I've been

2089
