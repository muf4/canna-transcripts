I believe at MJ Biz a few years back

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,239
yeah and that's one of my favorite Parts

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,199
about this industry right we all kind of

20
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:57,718
meet each other well you know one person

21
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,518
or even at MJ Biz at the end of the year

22
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,558
right um You just run into each other

23
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:05,280
and I love that you know it's a Titan

24
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:07,560
group I love mjbiz mjbiz is special um

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,799
last year was a really great mjbiz and I

26
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,759
feel like it wasn't as well attended

27
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,118
maybe as some of the previous ones but

28
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:15,959
everybody that was there was serious

29
00:01:14,118 --> 00:01:18,118
about doing business yeah you know real

30
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:21,000
serious and I feel like there was a

31
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:23,040
focus on the business side there wasn't

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,560
a lot of window Shoppers or Tire kickers

33
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,000
because you get a lot of those people

34
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,960
there were people serious about doing

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,680
consulting I mean I had a lot of great

36
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:32,879
meetings and it wasn't just just let's

37
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,479
go to Vegas and have fun which that's

38
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,399
I've had good times with that as well at

39
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:40,000
MJ but like it was a lot more serious

40
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:42,280
and the quality of the people there it

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,718
was it was really amazing yeah yeah I

42
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:48,320
actually got my start what was it

43
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:50,839
2016 at MJ Biz before when I was just

44
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:52,839
launching Growers Network I think maybe

45
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,200
we had launched that month I think it

46
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,320
was like around November at that time

47
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,640
and compared to last year so

48
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:02,798
2023 um they split the hall

49
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,079
so you have all post Harvest and more of

50
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,118
the bigger hall and then cultivation was

51
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:10,560
you know a smaller Hall and I think some

52
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:13,120
people kind of got lost um some people

53
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,479
thought it was just that one Hall and

54
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,680
they're like oh where's my favorite

55
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:20,159
lighting brand or whatever right um so

56
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,599
yeah I definitely saw a drop off in kind

57
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:25,199
of foot traffic um but with everything

58
00:02:22,598 --> 00:02:26,679
going on I I really do hope um that this

59
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,479
year it's going to be bigger and

60
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:32,719
actually I don't know if I told you this

61
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:35,039
but we have a massive Community uh

62
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,719
activation absolutely I'm I'm a part of

63
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,639

for myself on our show and through

80
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,959
social media connecting me with guys

81
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,840
like Horizon Light Lift you know it's

82
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:23,039

85
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,360
about calling them up and asking them to

86
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,438
come on the show if it wasn't for you

87
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,879

88
00:03:31,438 --> 00:03:35,560
platform which I've really benefited

89
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:37,199
from I think we've mutually benefited

90
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,438
from and it's just great because we have

91
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,919
this community of great people you know

92
00:03:39,438 --> 00:03:43,039

93
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:45,399

00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,479
have similar goals and see the industry

99
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,598
through a similar lens and I think

100
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:00,280
that's so important it really is I mean

101
00:03:58,598 --> 00:04:01,798
Community is everything

102
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,039
um you know the first company I started

103
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:06,480
Growers Network it was about that right

104
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:09,039
it was Community for people growing at

105
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:11,560
home yeah um and and grow world you know

106
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,878

107
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,878
community and a little bit more on the

108
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:18,478
commercial leaning side but same ethos

109
00:04:15,878 --> 00:04:20,759

110
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:23,439

116
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:38,799
challenges in starting um you know kind

117
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:42,959
of going back 2016 2017 in caner crib's

so uh many years later once I left and

00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:50,439
started grow world I wanted to have

121
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:53,279
almost like an agency right where we

122
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:56,519

bringing different people together and

127
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,199
helping them do business together is

128
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,120
what we specialize in right I mean

129
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,038

130
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,959
so great you know so how did you get

131
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:14,399

132
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:17,000
pretty amazing journey you've been on

133

135
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:26,038
23 and I'm going to bring you way way

136
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:29,400
way back um so I was going to the

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:43,360
I was finishing school um I had uh

167
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:45,199
worked at a drone company again like the

168
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,598
furthest away from Cannabis we were

169
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:52,038
building Fleet management software for

170
00:06:47,598 --> 00:06:53,598
drones um and then that uh kind of went

171
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:54,839
got to a place where I'm like yeah I

172
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:56,639
don't really want to drop out and move

173
00:06:54,839 --> 00:07:00,119
to Silicon Valley I'd rather just stay

174
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:03,160
finish school um and at that point it

175
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,280
was around my senior year now um and I

176
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,840
was roommates with Nate so Nate was

177
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:09,038
building up Grower's house this

178
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:10,719
e-commerce website if someone's not

179
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:12,680
familiar they have everything under the

180
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,160
sun uh for your grow operation right

181
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:18,319
like an online Hydra store and uh we are

182
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,039
talking about building a community for

183
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,759
the people that shopped at Grower's

184
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:25,079
house so that was really the the early

185
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:27,879
beginnings and honestly we talked about

186
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:30,159
it for a while I think the turning point

187
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:33,400
for me is I met his father

188
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,560
so his father was like a 70-year-old uh

189
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:37,878
serial entrepreneur from Brooklyn just

190
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:41,319
like super strong characters names

191
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:43,400
Paulie um he had built up this um

192
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:45,520
massive kind of e-commerce before

193
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:47,000
e-commerce was a thing type company

194
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:49,038
right and I was like you know I was I

195
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,918
was finishing up during my senior year

196
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:53,639
and I was uh best friends with Nate met

197
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:56,158
his dad and I was like I think he can

198
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:58,680
mentor me um I think I can learn a lot

199
00:07:56,158 --> 00:08:00,120
from him so I actually decided to stay

200
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,360
in Tucson

201
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,598
um build Growers network.org from the

202
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,520
ground up um within kind of as like a

203
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:09,839
sister company to Growers house because

204
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:13,000
they were separate um and about a year

205
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:16,158
into that James um I started canic cribs

206
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,918
as a way to drive traffic um like

207
00:08:16,158 --> 00:08:19,918
internally as a way to drive traffic to

208
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:22,799
Grower's house and Growers Network

209
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:24,519
externally of course to educate um show

210
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,079
all the different technology and ways to

211
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:31,319
grow nice yeah can of cribs is a special

212
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:34,399
show uh you kind

213
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:37,879
of really set the bar for what could be

214
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:40,000
done within the realm of cannabis using

215
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:42,000
social media using that platform

216
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,120
highlighting Growers and and the garden

217
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,278
tours were amazing thank you um so yeah

218
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,600
and then you built it up and sold it

219
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:53,000
which is pretty impressive yeah so about

220
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,639
2021 uh mind you we had some Partners in

221
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,320
the business that were with Paulie for

222
00:08:55,639 --> 00:09:00,319
one right he was kind of uh getting 74

223
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,959
75 I think he was kind of his time he

224
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,879
wanted to get out um Nate and myself

225
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:09,078
were I was like 26 I think Nate was like

226
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:12,399
31 at the time I age now um and you know

227
00:09:09,078 --> 00:09:14,599
as a group um we thought it would be the

228
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,320
right time around 2020 to start looking

229
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,759
at bringing on some outside investors um

230
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,120
for one to provide a liquidity event for

231
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,679
some of the partners that maybe wanted

232
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,200
to cash in their chips um and for two to

233
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:28,799
really accelerate the growth of our

234
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,240
business lines right so at the time we

235
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:32,719
had Growers house Growers Network canic

236
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,159
cribs and it was kind of like the

237
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,600
content and community that drove the

238
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:41,159
Commerce and it was uh symbiotic right

239
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,320
so around 2021 was uh the time that we

240
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:47,360
brought on two outside private Equity

241
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:49,519
groups um and yeah I mean honestly I I

242
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,759
go back to age because I'm I'm so

243
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:56,000
blessed to have learned these lessons

244
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:57,319
early on um and have gone through this I

245
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,360
mean some entrepreneurs go their whole

246
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,879
life going to a sale yeah you're way too

247
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,200
young to have done all this stuff it's

248
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:06,278
amazing it it was great um and I

249
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,399
wouldn't have wanted to change anything

250
00:10:06,278 --> 00:10:11,559
and and now um I kind of have you know

251
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:14,480
everything in front of me I have really

252
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:18,679
strong Partnerships all across the board

253
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:22,039
um and luckily uh my entire film crew

254
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:24,879
came with me um to grow world so we

255
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:27,120
actually created a new show um where we

256
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:28,879
get to travel around the world and and

257
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,839
show off the the different cannabis

258
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:31,399
communi

259
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,320
um that are kind of pushing that

260
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:35,278
envelope yeah and you went to one of my

261
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,040
favorite countries colia recently how

262
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:40,519
was that oh man um we're going to have

263
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:43,919
to have a couple podcasts to dive into

264
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:47,600
all of that um but we specifically went

265
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:51,599
to Bogata um we went to the city and

266
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:54,360
then just North like neon or uh tokana

267
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:59,278
area like five four 5 hours north of the

268
00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:01,519
city we filmed uh folio Med uh we filmed

269
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:03,240
marus which is an extraction lab um I

270
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,799
would say one of the top extraction labs

271
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:09,159
in the country um clever Leafs they have

272
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:11,679
this massive facility and then pla

273
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:13,439
Global um so we got a really good

274
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:16,559
spectrum of the different types of

275
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,399
Growers out in that market and I mean

276
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:20,759
one of the biggest things that um I

277
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,519
think we learned as an entire film crew

278
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:24,799
and and that we are kind of showing the

279
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:27,679
world is that Colombia doesn't have a

280
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:30,278
domestic market right like no

281
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:32,039
dispensaries n um like even just on the

282
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:34,360
drive over here I spotted like two or

283
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:37,799
three dispensaries right but in Colombia

284
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:40,200
it's 100% for export right and that was

285
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:42,719
fascinating to me because you walk

286
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,200
downtown and and everyone's smoking

287
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,000
everyone's having a good time there's

288
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,959
different like tolerance zones as they

289
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,559
call it there's even some kind of like

290
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:52,399
Spanish Social Club Vibes going on we

291
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,278
went to one of them to film lots of

292
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,519
passionate people there's people that

293
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:59,600
are super passionate you know I was at

294
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:02,320
MJ I spoke at MJ Biz in Colombia of few

295
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,000
years back and I've toured over there at

296
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,600
Earth's healing and some other places in

297
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,399
Cali yeah and had really good I had an

298
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,079
amazing experience when I was there just

299
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:14,480
a really welcome you know they really

300
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:16,359
welcome Californians and people from the

301
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,720
US they do but they are just super

302
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,919
passionate about the Cannabis they are

303
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,959
just you know it's amazing seeing I feel

304
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:27,240
like it a lot of it reminds me of the

305
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:29,518
early days of prop 215 that's right yeah

306
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:32,159
we we talked about that a lot actually I

307
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,078
kind of see ourselves uh a screen goes

308
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:36,078
up here we're almost like Time Travelers

309
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:37,599
yeah right so we're going down there and

310
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:39,159
and letting them know like hey this is

311
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,199
what the future is going to look like

312
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:45,838
but also flip yeah roses moved from

313
00:12:43,198 --> 00:12:48,399
California down to Colombia right and we

314
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,959
were in the Rose producing region of

315
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:54,078
Colombia and all the surrounding farm

316
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:55,638
specifically to one um called foled um

317
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:58,078
was one of the largest Rose growers in

318
00:12:55,639 --> 00:13:01,000
the world and they shared a lot of

319
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:02,759
employees they shared cultivation Styles

320
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,879
and that was a big takeaway for me James

321
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:07,278
was that potentially we're pretty

322
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:09,799
bullish on this but the future of

323
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:12,198
Colombian cannabis will be consumed

324
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:14,599
right here in the US yeah and all those

325
00:13:12,198 --> 00:13:16,078
Growers out there that I just spent the

326
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,600
last seven eight years filming through

327
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:21,120
caner cribs and deep roots with Autumn a

328
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:24,360
lot of them I think should be asking the

329
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,440
big question about what's next right

330
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,360
what's going to differentiate us and you

331
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,000
know we were talking about this earlier

332
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,959
um and and I've been CH with Sergio the

333
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,078
past couple days a lot about this um I

334
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:38,599
truly believe the future of the American

335
00:13:35,078 --> 00:13:39,958
Market genetics 100% that's why I'm here

336
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,519
that's why I do what I do because I

337
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:45,679
believe the same thing you know there's

338
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:47,440
so many different revenue streams within

339
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:48,799
the industry but genetics and even

340
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,440
within genetics there's different

341
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:52,758
revenue streams I mean there's licensing

342
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,320
you know there's Nursery there's the

343
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:59,480
nursery model there's the seeds U tissue

344
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,360
culture can be under the same category

345
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,320
but what it's going to come down to

346
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,519
that's going to separate one person from

347
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,560
the next is going to be genetics and the

348
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,440
quality of genetics that you have and

349
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:11,638
are you staying on top of the trends or

350
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,320
are you going to fall behind the trends

351
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:14,560
yeah so I'm I'm super excited about the

352
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,720
future I think there's a lot of people

353
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:19,039
that are very pessimistic but I think

354
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,560
we're in interesting times you know and

355
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:23,078
there's so many different directions the

356
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:25,078
market can go and we're in a very

357
00:14:23,078 --> 00:14:28,278
unstable market and I'm really looking

358
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:30,879
forward to once we start getting a grasp

359
00:14:28,278 --> 00:14:32,838
on the St Market where the direction of

360
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:36,799
the genetics are going to go yeah I'm

361
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:39,240
right there with you um after colia well

362
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:41,879
one last note on this through the grow

363
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,240
World platform we are allowing any

364
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:46,958
member qualified around the world to

365
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,440
sample the menu from these Colombian

366
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:52,198
facilities wow so like as of right now

367
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,839
you can go sign up for flour different

368
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:57,879
oils Etc and if you're in a qualified

369
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:59,800
country that can legally import and sell

370
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:01,278
you can test the menu I mean that's one

371
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:04,198
of the reasons why we created The Grow

372
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:06,360
World Tour was to show off our members

373
00:15:04,198 --> 00:15:08,719
facilities that's wild that's really

374
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,360
cool yeah and and where I was going with

375
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:14,240
this is um upcoming we have the

376
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,240
Sacramento tour so I flew in for this

377
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,000
podcast and the Sacramento tour coming

378
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,680
up in the next couple weeks we're going

379
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,278
to film The Best of the Best Growers um

380
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:25,958
and really this is our almost like a

381
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:29,120
Bittersweet farewell to the American

382
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:30,758
Market um from a filming standpoint

383
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,879
obviously a lot of our crew still lives

384
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:35,039
here um but we're really looking at

385
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:38,278
what's that Global story so we're going

386
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:39,639
to Spain we're going to Portugal um in

387
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:42,439
February and of course we're going to

388
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:44,000
film the iconic spannabis event

389
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,000

nice uh you know and everybody's in town

396
00:15:55,559 --> 00:16:00,239
for spannabis all I wouldn't say all but

397
00:15:58,318 --> 00:16:01,958
I would the majority of my friends come

398
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,360
in from all over the world to come hang

399
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:06,838
out you know for for a week or two I try

400
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,480
to do two weeks I love it we'll be out

401
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,480
there for three weeks it'll be my first

402
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,360
time it'll be over my birthday so we're

403
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,720
we're GNA have some fun oh it's a blast

404
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,560
it's it's one of the best events if not

405
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,079
the best event of the year and I mean I

406
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:21,599
heard Germany is now popping Mary Jane

407
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:23,958
you know you got to hit Mary Jane too

408
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,319
we're going there in June so we're doing

409
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:29,638
Vegas in December we're doing spannabis

410
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:32,360
in kind of March February and then we're

411
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:33,879
doing Germany in June with Mary Jane so

412
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,278
we're literally hitting the we're

413
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:38,759
filming the three biggest markets and

414
00:16:36,278 --> 00:16:40,078
trade shows in the world well and

415
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:42,079
they're all just going to keep growing I

416
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:44,078
missed Germany this year and I I'm sad

417
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:46,078
that I did but I I did it because I had

418
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:48,359
to focus on my facility and what I'm

419
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:51,318
doing here I think supersedes everything

420
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,519
else like this has to fall in line um

421
00:16:51,318 --> 00:16:55,679
you know the genetics is first and then

422
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,399
I love spannabis I was able to get seeds

423
00:16:55,679 --> 00:17:00,078
out there I was able to do an event with

424
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:01,318
Sergio nice did a connectent out there

425
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:03,439
we're going to do another one next year

426
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:06,438
I'm sure we live streamed that through

427
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,038
grow world yes it was really cool and

428
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:11,160
there was some really cool people that

429
00:17:08,038 --> 00:17:13,199
showed up to talk uh you know I just

430
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,679
can't speak highly enough about Sergio

431
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,318
and what he's done for The Connect

432
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:19,079
Community I mean all of us is being part

433
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:21,838
of the connect Community which I think

434
00:17:19,078 --> 00:17:25,918
is really good uh he's able to highlight

435
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:29,000
people in a way that you know you get to

436
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,720
see the good and the best you know with

437
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,400
in the lighting industry So within the

438
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,679
light and and then you can like you're

439
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,679
able to debate it on a a friendly level

440
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,360
I like how he's able to keep it you know

441
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,120
we have competition but it's not really

442
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:42,319
competition we're only in competition

443
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:43,839
with ourselves at the end of the day at

444
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:45,240
least that's how I look at it that's

445
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:47,359
right you know some of these guys will

446
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,960
argue that but I feel like you know when

447
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:51,719
you're talking market share they might

448
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,440
argue it but I feel like me I'm only in

449
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,079
competition with myself trying to make

450
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,840
better genetics uh everything I do

451
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:59,720
circles around genetics and it points

452
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:01,439
back to genetics I have a breeding book

453
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,839
really that's my resume right like you

454
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,798
read that book you want to know about me

455
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:07,720
go by my book that's who I am right and

456
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:09,720
then same thing we you know we do tissue

457
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,919
culture here but that that's a basically

458
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,360
so we can have clean genetics so we

459
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,679
offer tissue culture Services through my

460
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:19,719
partner Justin at apical biotech that's

461
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:21,000
a value added service for the genetics

462
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,200
right so like if you want us to bank

463
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,319
your genetics you want us to clean and

464
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,759
Bank your genetics will do that you want

465
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:27,240
me to breed with your genetics well we

466
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:29,279
need to clean them first because I want

467
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,798
everything Pest and pathogen free and

468
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:33,000
these things are so important moving

469
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:35,119
forward it's everything it's everything

470
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,880
you know and and being able to maintain

471
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:39,239
the quality of your genetics over time

472
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,240
that's so important and I think a lot of

473
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,960
people are missing that step a lot of

474
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:45,960
people are missing the step in the pheno

475
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,000
hunting process uh not doing it at a big

476
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,840
enough scale not testing it in enough

477
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,279
environments but then that's one of

478
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:53,038
those things like what are you breeding

479
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:54,678
for what what's the purpose are you a

480
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:56,440
Solutions based company or you just

481
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:58,280
breeding to breed to make money right

482
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,240
and that's what different the best guys

483
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:02,519
out there

484
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,400
uh do similar things as myself in the

485
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:07,359
sense that they're looking for specific

486
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,480
solutions to problems that we have in

487
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:12,279
the industry so and I see the problems

488
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:14,240
with Pest and pathogens and also

489
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:15,599
genetics moving forward we're we're

490
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,640
crossing a whole bunch of different

491
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:19,918
things we do about 300 outcrosses a year

492
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,559
and within those 300 outcrosses we

493
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,759
select a handful of those and offer them

494
00:19:21,558 --> 00:19:26,399
to the market but we're constantly

495
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:28,279
testing and testing and testing and then

496
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,519
also not just testing the plants but

497
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:32,000
testing those plants in different

498
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:33,960
environments testing them with different

499
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,279
nutrients uh and this is the stuff that

500
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,960
gets me excited about coming to work

501
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:38,399
every day if I wasn't able to do this I

502
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,759
would probably do something else you

503
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,919
know I have a background in culinary

504
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:45,359
arts I was a chef I've done other I work

505
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:46,640
for Charles Schwab in the city really

506
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:49,639
I've done a whole bunch of different

507
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,720
things in my life and this is the thing

508
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,759
that gets me the most excited you know

509
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,640
and cannabis I think we're on the

510
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:57,919
Forefront of cannabis you're on the

511
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,840
Forefront I'm on the Forefront all our

512
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,759
friends are on the forr of the future of

513
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:05,558
can beautiful thing it is and it's

514
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:10,158
really exciting um you know seeing guys

515
00:20:05,558 --> 00:20:12,839
like uh Kevin and Tim over at faven you

516
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,320
know and what they're doing and I look

517
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:16,678
at the R&amp;D that they're doing and it

518
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:18,279
gets me excited about doing R&amp;D you know

519
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:21,240
and it's like talking to those guys over

520
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:22,960
in sack it's like they're pushing the

521
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:26,400
the boundaries on what you can do with

522
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,400
R&amp;D and really like you know they think

523
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,640
of things similar to how I do is where

524
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,200
I'm not ever satisfied it's kind of a

525
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,320
you know some people think it's a shitty

526
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,319
thing that I'm never happy and I think

527
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:38,960
what I'm never happy I I always feel

528
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,678
like it could even my book I'm like I

529
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,120
did a good job on my book I know I did a

530
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:44,720
good job we put a lot of time and energy

531
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:46,199
but it could still be better and

532
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,759
everything if you look at it from that

533
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:51,558
lens where you don't settle for whatever

534
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:52,879
you have you look at ways you can

535
00:20:51,558 --> 00:20:55,119
improve it to make it better that's how

536
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,000
you become successful that's right and I

537
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:59,959
preach to my team more than they'd like

538
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,599
to hear Kaizen yeah the Japanese

539
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,519
philosophy of just constant

540
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:07,599
self-improvement 1% better whether it's

541
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:10,158
a genetic version of your book an event

542
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:12,199
for Sergio yeah something that we're an

543
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,400
episode we're filming just there's

544
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,960
always room for improvement and you're

545
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,759
exactly right I have found that at the

546
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,558
top it's collaboration yeah at the

547
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:26,119
bottom it's competition right right and

548
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:28,079
and I am extremely uh grateful that

549
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:29,639
we've made it we're we're at the top of

550
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:31,759
this Market market and we're able to

551
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,840
work with each other and um doesn't

552
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:36,240
matter if there's two Growers side by

553
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:38,240
side competing for the same market share

554
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,120
they're collaborating they're trading

555
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,720
genetics they're trading you know

556
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:44,839
cultivation methodologies new tech

557
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,480
they're jumping up on a panel at connect

558
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:49,439
and and sharing their findings that's

559
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,519
where we succeed it's when we work

560
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,558
together yeah and I see guys in Humble

561
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:55,319
doing it like Huck Huckleberry Hill

562
00:21:53,558 --> 00:21:57,759
Farms and

563
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:59,399
Ridgeline uh you know they could be comp

564
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:00,879
they could consider the s competition

565
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,038
but they don't they they collaborate

566
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,600
they work together they're creating

567
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:09,158
genetics together um that Community is

568
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:11,959
amazing they're they're pushing forward

569
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:14,320
you know on the genetics on the terroir

570
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:16,960
uh on the breeding side uh and doing it

571
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:19,480
in their environment up there and I'm a

572
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,000
big fan of the the whole Emerald

573
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,759
Triangle and what people are doing up

574
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,400
there and how I can Elevate them you

575
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:26,480
know it's like being able to collaborate

576
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,200
with them being being able to work with

577
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:32,759
them uh as a California

578
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:35,558
as someone who has respect for where

579
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:37,720
this plant came from I feel like there's

580
00:22:35,558 --> 00:22:40,359
a lot of credit that those guys should

581
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:43,278
be getting for what they did in the

582
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:46,158
Legacy Market uh evolving into what

583
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:48,119
they're doing in the the current market

584
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,278
absolutely and that's you know each

585
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:52,119
country we go to to film we we kind of

586
00:22:50,278 --> 00:22:55,200
have a couple takeaways to tell the

587
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:57,719
story and why we're here right now is to

588
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,080
tell the epicenter yeah where it all

589
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:02,079
started the culture the movement the

590
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:04,798
genetics the best weed still comes from

591
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:06,918
here it's right here the best genetics I

592
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:08,960
mean I would say genetics are created in

593
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:10,480
a lot of places that are good now but

594
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,200
the epicenter there's a huge

595
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,240
concentration especially this Bay Area

596
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,919
this part of the the center of

597
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,919
California because you know people call

598
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,000
us Northern California but we're still

599
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:23,720
kind of in the middle here but between

600
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,640
LA and and Seattle I mean the West Coast

601
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,960
yeah included all like West Coast Best

602
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,278
Coast for the whole world yeah and

603
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,600
people are looking at everything that we

604
00:23:29,278 --> 00:23:33,519
do and and wanting that sometimes they

605
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:35,439
don't even care what it is they just

606
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:36,960
want that they want you know you you see

607
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,919
that in Europe a lot they want the

608
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,079
California weed sometimes he's not even

609
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:42,679
grown in California but they want the

610
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:45,079
California weed well that's the thing I

611
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:47,880
mean in Colombia one of the largest

612
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:49,839
facilities we went to tour clever leaves

613
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:52,039
they threw out you know this great

614
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:54,639
spread of their menu of everything and

615
00:23:52,038 --> 00:23:57,000
the proudest genetics that they had were

616
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,720
from Cali and even one of their head

617
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,880
Growers had a James sticker I texted you

618
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:05,919
that photo on his phone that they just

619
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,760
picked up from spannabis at that time so

620
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:10,120
you're exactly right I mean we're at the

621
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:12,759
epicenter up here and the rest of the

622
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:14,759
world wants to grow out our menu yeah

623
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:16,759
right it's like we are the ones with the

624
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:18,919
Kobe beef and every restaurant in the

625
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:21,640
world wants to serve it and I think we

626
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:24,278
should embrace that but never forget how

627
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:26,440
to monetize it at the same time you know

628
00:24:24,278 --> 00:24:27,960
all those Legacy homies helping your

629
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,919
laurs yeah I mean I think it's so

630
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,679
important that we're constantly looking

631
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,559
for improvement because the market will

632
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,559
change are you going to be ready for it

633
00:24:33,558 --> 00:24:38,000
yeah you know are you going to be ready

634
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:40,079
for what's next um purple candy gas will

635
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,278
not last forever I promise you purple

636
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:45,918
candy gas will not last forever I like

637
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:47,200
candy and I like gas and I like these

638
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,640
these dessert strains and I think

639
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,440
they're going to be around I don't think

640
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,640
they're ever going to completely go away

641
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,679
but they're not always going to be on

642
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:56,080
top right the market fluct changing yeah

643
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:57,720
I mean and there's so many different

644
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:59,319
things that we can chase you know and

645
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,759
this is all like what are we talking

646
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:04,798
about extraction are we talking about

647
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:06,919
flour uh you know commercially produced

648
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:09,759
flour or Boutique flour I mean there's

649
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:12,520
so many different things uh and I breed

650
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:14,158
for all those and so we we try to go in

651
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:16,359
several different directions and we have

652
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,360
this huge library of genetics to work

653
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:19,639
with but it's kind of like a big

654
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:21,479
paintbrush right so paintbrush with all

655
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:24,120
these colors and now we can take all

656
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,798
those colors we can blend them together

657
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:27,678
uh and we're using software and data to

658
00:25:25,798 --> 00:25:28,918
do it which is pretty cool I love to

659
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,360
hear that yeah you were walking me

660
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:34,480
through the facility earlier and showing

661
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:37,599
me how you can every Harvest and and

662
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,599
every crop be able to see that Delta oh

663
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:41,558
and Chase those improvements I love to

664
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:43,480
see that well in data collection is so

665
00:25:41,558 --> 00:25:44,839
huge I think a lot of people ignore the

666
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,759
fact that they should be collecting a

667
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:49,759
lot of data we collect over 50 points of

668
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:52,079
data per cultivar wow and so and not

669
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:54,558
only that now we're sending genetics out

670
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:57,240
we're send sending tissue culture or

671
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:59,079
plants out uh in the form of clones out

672
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,240
to different regions and so we're

673
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:03,359
getting different data depending on the

674
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,798
climate you know on specific cultiv ours

675
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:07,639
and then we can start really developing

676
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:10,038
Trends and big a has been doing this for

677
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,120
a long time there's a lot of big

678
00:26:10,038 --> 00:26:12,519
companies that are doing this that

679
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:14,038
aren't even talking about it you know

680
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:15,359
it's like we're one of the little guys

681
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:17,879
I'm one of the little guys out there but

682
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:21,000
I feel like we're doing it at a really

683
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,760
high level and we try to do it at a

684
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,119
higher level every day so we constantly

685
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:27,200
are trying to improve what we're doing

686
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:29,558
and but but there's guys like fav and

687
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,200
lighting there's guys like terara

688
00:26:29,558 --> 00:26:34,278
International we look at our friends

689
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,759
over there with United nutrients and Kaa

690
00:26:34,278 --> 00:26:40,798
um you know I R&amp;D everything so I'm not

691
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:42,519
married to any one nutrient or any light

692
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:45,519
or any one thing because I'm constantly

693
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:48,398
trying to test we do AB testing against

694
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:50,038
everything and thanks to you guys you've

695
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:52,639
made it possible to take it to the next

696
00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:54,079
level because I've really because of the

697
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,640
connections that I have through girl

698
00:26:54,079 --> 00:27:00,000
world I've been able to get more stuff

699
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,759
to R&amp;D and really been able to explain

700
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,038
why I do it and get people on board

701
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:06,720
Horizon lifts they are the perfect

702
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:09,319
example I totally believe in their

703
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,360
product I I think David over there and

704
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:13,960
Rod they're great people they have an

705
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:15,719
amazing product it just needs to get out

706
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:18,200
there people need to start seeing what

707
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,079
what I'm doing with it uh I sell

708
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,720
genetics so when people see that James

709
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:24,158
is selling genetics and this is how you

710
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:27,200
optimize your ppfd you dial in your

711
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:29,720
levels your par using a Light Lift now

712
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,278
especially if you're HPS is great you

713
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:33,880
can also dial in your temperatures and

714
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:35,798
other things right with HPS is beautiful

715
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,640
I like HPS flower but that's kind of

716
00:27:35,798 --> 00:27:39,319
going away but I'm still going to

717
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:41,320
collect the data from it and I think

718
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:42,558
that's super important but really when

719
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:44,278
we're talking about the light lifting

720
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:47,079
where you can increase your ppfd

721
00:27:44,278 --> 00:27:50,679
lowering it down or you can basically

722
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:53,158
lower your lights down and and turn down

723
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:55,278
the percentage of intensity which isn't

724
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:57,200
always recommended but I found it to be

725
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:58,759
just fine right so there's some people

726
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,919
that they're hating on they're like oh

727
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:02,720
you're not going to get the Spectrum

728
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,960
right try it try it yeah I'm trying it

729
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,839
I'm trying it I'm getting really good

730
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,960
results that that's our motto right is

731
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:11,119
try before you buy and the entire grow

732
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,960
World platform which is free for

733
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:15,479
commercial Growers anywhere around the

734
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,880
world to join and less than five minutes

735
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,679
is to try before you buy right just like

736
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,919
how you started in your garage and now

737
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:25,679
you're running massive facilities or you

738
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:28,240
know craft facilities run products side

739
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,360
by side right what you just mentioned

740
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:34,798
you have four of Our Brands in your

741
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:38,000
facility today Horizon lift Kaa Kaa

742
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:39,599
United all grow okay you have a lot a

743
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,440
lot you have like seven or eight grow

744
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:43,079
world uh vendors in your in your

745
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,200
facility today we do and I I like

746
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:47,839
supporting grow world for one thing but

747
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,319
I also like the quality of the people

748
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:51,839
that you bring to the table and so even

749
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:54,558
beant stock which I probably won't use

750
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:56,678
in my facility here I'm having my

751
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:59,079
cultivation Partners try beanock and see

752
00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:01,038
if it works for them right so I'm part

753
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:02,720
of a bigger Network you know I don't do

754
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:04,519
cultivation we don't sell any flower

755
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,319
that's not part of my model at all but I

756
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:09,000
want to empower the cultivators I have

757
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:10,918
cultivation Partners uh that grow our

758
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,119
genetics out and I want to empower them

759
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:14,360
to get better

760
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:16,278
results um also you know I can't do all

761
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:18,639
the feno hunting myself I have to rely

762
00:29:16,278 --> 00:29:21,000
on other people it's so much bigger than

763
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,919
one person um I've always liked

764
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,759
Partnerships I I always will like

765
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:28,759
Partnerships I don't care how many times

766
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:31,640
I get burned eventually you learn uh oh

767
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:33,839
I've learned over time to trust but

768
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:35,960
verify and I think that's so huge good

769
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:38,480
motto trust but verify with everything

770
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:40,000
and partners is another one like I've

771
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,640
gone through Partners I've had bad

772
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,240
Partnerships I've had great Partnerships

773
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,840
I started out life actually with

774
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,200
cannabis with growing in my garage I

775
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:51,599
started out with the best partnership

776
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:53,399
ever it was like I you know and I grew

777
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:54,918
pop before I grew when I was a kid I

778
00:29:53,398 --> 00:29:56,798
grew in closets and stuff like that but

779
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:58,720
when I started going to the garage I

780
00:29:56,798 --> 00:30:01,839
partnered with one of my best friends

781
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,600
and it was what set me up for the future

782
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:06,759
and believing in Partnerships and they

783
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:08,918
could work because we had such a good

784
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:11,359
relationship um and you know there was

785
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:14,159
honesty there was trust he was able to

786
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:16,199
move the flower for a good price uh I

787
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,320
was able to put the work in and the time

788
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,798
in and it was like we balanced each

789
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:21,678
other out it's a good partnership right

790
00:30:19,798 --> 00:30:23,200
there yeah and I found that you don't

791
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,000
want a partner that's exactly like you

792
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,960
or someone that wants to be you right

793
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,079
because that's what happens sometimes

794
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,319
they either want to be you or you want

795
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:31,278
to be them or want to be the same and

796
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:33,200
and you want someone that's a balance to

797
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:34,480
that yeah and then it's a beautiful

798
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,759
thing right because then they're like

799
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,519
filling in the gaps that you couldn't

800
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:41,679
fill in and like my partner now with the

801
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:43,558
with the logo you know and also he has

802
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:44,960
the mindset to put me back on track

803
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:46,119
sometimes I get Focus like oh we should

804
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,000
be doing this because this will make

805
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:49,839
more money and he's like no we need to

806
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,960
stick to the plant the shiny object

807
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:53,678
syndrome yeah you know what I have a lot

808
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,720
of friends well I call it the Barracuda

809
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,159
syndrome right the shiny object in the

810
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,038
ocean they're always chasing that next

811
00:30:57,159 --> 00:31:01,240
shiny object before they finish one

812
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:02,879
they're on to the next one yeah and some

813
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,679
people can be successful with that I am

814
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,120
not one I need to have blinders on I

815
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:08,720
need you know and like I can have these

816
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:11,638
other things in the peripheral we can

817
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,639
have the book we have a nursery but all

818
00:31:11,638 --> 00:31:15,638
this stuff goes back to the genetics

819
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:17,079
right at the end of the day I'm a

820
00:31:15,638 --> 00:31:18,638
genetics company and I want to have

821
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:21,000
genetics that separate myself from

822
00:31:18,638 --> 00:31:23,319
everybody else I want better quality

823
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,638
genetics we're looking for stuff that

824
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:27,278
works in a good commercial environment

825
00:31:25,638 --> 00:31:29,959
so there has to be that commercial

826
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:31,798
application to the genetics right but

827
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:33,919
also stuff that checks all the boxes

828
00:31:31,798 --> 00:31:35,879
right and that can be different for

829
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:38,038
different environments right different

830
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,919
environments different climates I do

831
00:31:38,038 --> 00:31:41,480
autof flowers those are specifically for

832
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,200
outdoor there's not a lot of people that

833
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:45,319
I sell autoflow that they grow indoor

834
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,080
there's a handful or the guys online

835
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:49,439
that might buy them you know buy the 10

836
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:51,000
pack right those guys will grow indoors

837
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,480
right and and that's great and I love

838
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,599
that autoflow market but when I sell

839
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:58,278
50,000 seeds to somebody or 75,000 or

840
00:31:56,599 --> 00:32:01,119
100,000 seeds they are not putting them

841
00:31:58,278 --> 00:32:05,038
indoors this is going out in the fields

842
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:06,599
and so collecting data and learning okay

843
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:07,720
this doesn't work really well here you

844
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:10,558
know we need to breed something that

845
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:12,558
works better in places that get cold or

846
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:14,038
places that get extremely hot it's the

847
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:17,839
extremes that really kind of throw it

848
00:32:14,038 --> 00:32:20,440
off right and when you look at the

849
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:23,558
future let's say like of the James loud

850
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:27,080
genetics brand do you see yourself

851
00:32:23,558 --> 00:32:30,398
walking in similar steps of like a senta

852
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:33,439
or some Behemoth genetics company no I

853
00:32:30,398 --> 00:32:37,000
mean I think that there will be a day

854
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:40,278
where we partner with another company an

855
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,440
MSO or with a bigger company I mean we

856
00:32:40,278 --> 00:32:44,480
may sell Someday I'm I'm totally okay

857
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,399
with selling our you know because it's

858
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,558
my brand it has my name on it but it has

859
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:50,359
to be the right person that's going to

860
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:52,240
do right by the genetics it's something

861
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:54,079
I believe in you know this is my legacy

862
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,319
right all this stuff I'm 47 years old so

863
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:57,879
I'm a little bit older than you and I've

864
00:32:56,319 --> 00:33:00,079
really been thinking a lot about leg

865
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:02,000
Legacy and like you're going to get into

866
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:03,240
this once you hit 40 you'll be like

867
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,679
especially you because you've done so

868
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:08,159
much right because you've already done

869
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:10,038
so much as somebody who's 30 years old

870
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:12,039
that by the time you hit 40 you're way

871
00:33:10,038 --> 00:33:13,038
ahead of the people that are hitting 40

872
00:33:12,038 --> 00:33:14,398
with you you're going to be in the

873
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:16,839
mindset of somebody that's probably much

874
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:20,678
older but it's like what do I leave

875
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:23,359
behind for the world that has my stamp

876
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:25,399
on it you know so I'm looking at

877
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:28,398
Generations too like my breeding book

878
00:33:25,398 --> 00:33:30,398
and these things I hope that set the bar

879
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:32,918
for Generations ahead of me you know for

880
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:34,879
50 or 100 years because in 100 years no

881
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:37,038
one's going to really remember most of

882
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,760
our names like what do we do what do we

883
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:41,240
do here and that's okay only the the

884
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:42,638
Franklin's and the yeah but then the guy

885
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,038
well no but even the guys creating

886
00:33:42,638 --> 00:33:47,319
podcast now we have this platform right

887
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:50,319
we have these canic crib shows we have

888
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:52,439
the James lad podcast and maybe they

889
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:53,798
won't know me necessarily but maybe

890
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,679
there will be something in one of these

891
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:57,319
podcasts that resonates with people and

892
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,000
that will be remembered forever that's

893
00:33:57,319 --> 00:34:01,720
special you know and and we're part of

894
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,919
this greater thing yeah you know whether

895
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:06,798
it's can of cribs or whether it's grow

896
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,960
world or your new show we're part of

897
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:10,398
this thing that's so much bigger than

898
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:13,480
ourselves and that's the new form of

899
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:15,239
telling history it is right and so 100

900
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,719
years from now 500 years from I don't

901
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:19,199
know about 500 years from now because

902
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:21,480
who knows but definitely a 100 years

903
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:23,158
from now or 200 years from now there

904
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,719
will be people that will want to look

905
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:28,800
back and go what happened in this time

906
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:30,559
in world and we need you know we want to

907
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,359
we want to investigate why they were

908
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:34,199
thinking the way they were thinking and

909
00:34:32,358 --> 00:34:36,279
why it was so [ __ ] up it's part of it

910
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:38,719
you know because it in certain ways it's

911
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:40,639
pretty [ __ ] up right now and it'll be

912
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:43,039
a great way for somebody to go okay well

913
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:45,240
this dude spent 32 years in prison let's

914
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:48,358
let's pull up all the data on this guy

915
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:50,158
you know Uncle Rick uh he he's one of my

916
00:34:48,358 --> 00:34:52,279
good friends and he's he's super

917
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:55,240
important to the bigger story you know

918
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:56,720
he spent 32 calendar years in prison wow

919
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:58,519
over a plan they didn't even have

920
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:01,319
evidence real evidence it was all

921
00:34:58,519 --> 00:35:03,159
circumstantial MH and he spent 32 years

922
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:05,000
you know and I think 37 years total in

923
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:07,358
his life and then guys like Luke

924
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,440
scarmazzo why did he go to prison you

925
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:13,838
know he he had a dispensary he said f

926
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:15,280
the feds or whatever you know but like I

927
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:18,119
think these things are going to people

928
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:20,720
will be curious about these things for a

929
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:23,000
long time because things are going to

930
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:24,838
change and the things always Chang you

931
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,358
know I think things get better things

932
00:35:24,838 --> 00:35:28,599
get worse things get better things get

933
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:30,159
worse throughout history yeah you know

934
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:32,359
and then with environmental changes who

935
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:34,078
knows what's going to happen right yeah

936
00:35:32,358 --> 00:35:36,559
I mean I I look at things through the

937
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:38,920
lens at least with filming and podcast

938
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:41,400
of are you telling the past present or

939
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:44,358
future yeah and the entire caner crib

940
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:47,440
show was the present right it was a time

941
00:35:44,358 --> 00:35:49,480
capsule if someone just downloaded start

942
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,039
to finish all of those episodes and just

943
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:54,559
put it in a time capsule threw it in the

944
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:58,199
vault and a 100 years from now watch

945
00:35:54,559 --> 00:36:01,358
those videos that was a

946
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:06,318
really quick snapshot of an American

947
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:08,358
Grower's perspective from 2015 to 20125

948
00:36:06,318 --> 00:36:11,519
you know just like a a 10-year run right

949
00:36:08,358 --> 00:36:13,199
there right um so yeah I think and and

950
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:15,880
for the new grow world show we're really

951
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:19,000
telling the future um that's my goal is

952
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:20,760
to just get just kind of a a a

953
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,280
scratching of the surface of how they're

954
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:25,480
doing it today but really get into their

955
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,599
minds of where they're heading that way

956
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:30,079
we can start to make actual predic

957
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:32,559
of what these markets are going to look

958
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:35,560
like because I don't know about you

959
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:38,480
James but everyone's making projections

960
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:39,719
um of when is the US going to legalize

961
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,559
you know when is this going to happen

962
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:42,759
when is that going to happen um I I

963
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:44,679
actually want to throw some numbers at

964
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,760
the board I want to talk to people that

965
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:49,279
are actually doing it in these different

966
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:51,400
places um and work backwards into an

967
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,440
answer well let's dive into some of that

968
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:55,720
right now what do you think as far as

969
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,200
Federal illegalization how many more

970
00:36:55,719 --> 00:36:59,959
years do we have and I think that's a

971
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:02,399
specific question that we need to answer

972
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:05,838
a bunch of other questions yeah but uh I

973
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:08,039
mean backing into that um we we'll kick

974
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:09,719
things off with projections yeah um you

975
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:12,679
know everyone used to say five 10 years

976
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:15,519
5 to 10 years but um honestly I really

977
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:19,480
do think five years and and hear me out

978
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:22,159
with this um we are uh a couple months

979
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:26,039
away from an election in the United

980
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:28,000
States of America um I think I mean not

981
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:30,920
to you know get political here but I

982
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,480
think for the next four and a half years

983
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,680
it's safe to say there's not going to be

984
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,119
any type of

985
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:38,960
legalization um I think whoever's coming

986
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:41,400
in after that as the pendulum swings

987
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,240
right um I'm I'm pretty confident I

988
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:47,039
don't bet I'm not a gambler but I'm

989
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:50,159
pretty confident bet in that next term

990
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:52,318
um we we sure as hell better have more

991
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:54,799
progress than we're at right now yeah um

992
00:37:52,318 --> 00:37:57,119
I see sometimes you know we just talking

993
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,079
about burner uh cookies burner just

994
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:02,039
getting kicked off Instagram as of

995
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:04,800
yesterday I see us making some forward

996
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:07,639
progress over here but then other areas

997
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,519
we're getting kind of pushed back some

998
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:12,318
right um for just being who we are you

999
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:14,599
know being in this this game um so yeah

1000
00:38:12,318 --> 00:38:19,519
I I mean Federal predictions for the USA

1001
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:22,119
I'm thinking uh five years minimum um

1002
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:25,880
globally I mean we have Germany catching

1003
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:27,838
on fire right now I am so excited I hope

1004
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,880
we can sync up on calendars and can make

1005
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:32,318
it out there absolutely um I want to go

1006
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:35,160
film the top of the top in the German

1007
00:38:32,318 --> 00:38:37,719
Market we already have our farms uh more

1008
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:41,078
or less selected for Portugal um and a

1009
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:42,639
couple clubs um in Spain um and I I see

1010
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:45,000
Spain almost

1011
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:47,279
regressing right with some stuff going

1012
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,920
on out there um I see that market

1013
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:53,160
regressing I see Germany really taking

1014
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:55,400
over the European market um and I I

1015
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:58,440
think it's going to be another 10 years

1016
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:00,440
believe it or not um for Colum IIA to

1017
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:03,679
actually have a domestic market and

1018
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:04,838
start to take over more yeah and I think

1019
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:07,000
with

1020
00:39:04,838 --> 00:39:08,039
colia we have to look at what's going to

1021
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,838
happen with the countries around

1022
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:12,719
Colombia if they all go legal then that

1023
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:14,920
might be if Brazil goes legal right if

1024
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:16,399
Brazil goes wreck it's going to change

1025
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:18,880
the landscape for everyone in South

1026
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,639
America World well yeah but especially

1027
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,160
in South America it's like they're the

1028
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:25,719
biggest country in South America and if

1029
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:27,559
they go wreck uh everyone's going to

1030
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:29,078
want to fall suit including Mexico which

1031
00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:32,599
Mexico's kind of on the fence right now

1032
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:34,039
anyway he goes a little bit to the the

1033
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:35,800
you know a little to the left a little

1034
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:37,719
to the right a they make a little bit of

1035
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:40,359
forward progress and then they take a

1036
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:42,239
couple steps back yeah and but but then

1037
00:39:40,358 --> 00:39:44,440
the Caribbean is they're embracing

1143
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:33,078
super excited about that yeah uh hio is

1144
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,400
amazing guy too they really good person

1145
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:36,839
yeah everybody that

1146
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,599
works and that's one thing I respect the

1147
00:43:36,838 --> 00:43:41,078
most about Arian it's like they're a

1148
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:44,680
family like I've learned a lot about

1149
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:47,160
work culture from Arian and from from

1150
00:43:44,679 --> 00:43:51,879
greenhouse seeds and how they operate

1151
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:54,159
and not just their Inner Circle of guys

1152
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:57,240
but the people that work at the coffee

1153
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:58,399
shops they're like family I they're

1154
00:43:57,239 --> 00:44:01,000
family to me too I've been friends with

1155
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,400
them for so long wow um but just that

1156
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,679
work culture where you feel like you're

1157
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,480
a part of something bigger and when you

1158
00:44:04,679 --> 00:44:08,759
can make people feel like that you're

1159
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,000
going to keep them for a lot longer you

1160
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:12,760
know I feel like they feel like it's

1161
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,960
their home and I want people that work

1162
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:17,800
with me to feel like that too I mean and

1163
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:19,880
it's not easy to do and as you get

1164
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,760
bigger and bigger and bigger it becomes

1165
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,079
harder and harder to maintain that work

1166
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,119
culture when you're a small group of

1167
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:28,039
five people it's one thing but when you

1168
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:31,119
have 50 employees and for to feel like

1169
00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:32,960
family and to fight like family is okay

1170
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:35,680
too when you're that big you know or

1171
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:38,920
whatever size but like that goes along

1172
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:40,598
with it but there's a point where a lot

1173
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:43,240
of companies go in the you know they get

1174
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:44,640
so big it becomes Google or whatever and

1175
00:44:43,239 --> 00:44:46,719
then it's a whole different thing where

1176
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:49,480
it's like you don't know everybody it

1177
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:52,159
becomes corporate I saw it happen with

1178
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:54,000
Banas where they went slowly went

1179
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:57,199
corporate but they really like Tony

1180
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,000
McGee and Jeremy Marshall and my friends

1181
00:44:57,199 --> 00:45:02,598
Jimmy that worked there and my friend

1182
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:05,358
Ron um I have so much respect for them

1183
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:07,240
and you know also we're culture over

1184
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:11,318
there like how they did it and how they

1185
00:45:07,239 --> 00:45:13,519
kept it like they kept it real for so

1186
00:45:11,318 --> 00:45:15,558
long until they got sold to hinin and

1187
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:18,239
now they're more of a corporation right

1188
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:19,559
right but even still they're not like a

1189
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:21,000
regular Corporation but when I went

1190
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:22,440
there and they it was Google and they

1191
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,119
got guys riding skateboards down the

1192
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:26,559
hall everybody loved working there they

1193
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:29,800
used to have 420 parties really those

1194
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:31,880
guys are very can entric so as as a

1195
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:34,440
company you know they had high-fi hops

1196
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:37,240
they had a beer that had uh oh that's

1197
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:38,480
right y yeah really cool yeah so yeah

1198
00:45:37,239 --> 00:45:41,759
and and those guys have really pushed

1199
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:44,440
the limits but it's great when you see

1200
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,680
work culture like that at at scale

1201
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:49,519
whether it's Greenhouse what they're

1202
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:52,318
doing or whether Logan is um I aspired

1203
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:55,759
to that I mean when I was originally

1204
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:58,599
creating uh Cana cribs it was after

1205
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:00,240
Strain Hunters and marijuana Mania and

1206
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:03,200
growing exposed as well they were just

1207
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:07,000
starting at that time um but really like

1208
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:08,679
I watched Franco rest in peace and Aron

1209
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,039
and hio and that whole crew I watched

1210
00:46:08,679 --> 00:46:13,440
their episodes over and over and over

1211
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:15,440
again because just I was just like this

1212
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,679
is my favorite show in the world totally

1213
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,599
right but there wasn't really anything

1214
00:46:16,679 --> 00:46:22,399
on the US that was missing but that's

1215
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:25,640
what I aspired to be is is Strain

1216
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:28,240
Hunters yeah I mean no one's done it

1217
00:46:25,639 --> 00:46:30,078
quite the same since J Hunters not on

1218
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:31,679
that level and it's like there's been

1219
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:33,359
other good shows I mean you got your can

1220
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:36,199
of cribs which is its own thing for sure

1221
00:46:33,358 --> 00:46:38,159
which is you set the bar for that and it

1222
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:40,039
was like the new version of cribs but

1223
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:41,679
with all these Decked Out gr rooms that

1224
00:46:40,039 --> 00:46:43,358
had yeah you know and I think a lot of

1225
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:44,799
people have never seen they've been they

1226
00:46:43,358 --> 00:46:46,639
wouldn't have the opportunity to

1227
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,200
actually go into a grow room like that

1228
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:50,879
and that's what I love about and they

1229
00:46:48,199 --> 00:46:53,199
still don't right um actually we were

1230
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:56,480
sitting across a table similar to this

1231
00:46:53,199 --> 00:46:59,159
in Seattle at of canacon um eating one

1232
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:02,400
of the best Salon I ever had in my life

1233
00:46:59,159 --> 00:47:05,000
um sitting across from grah ferar yeah

1234
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:07,079
um at Glass House Farms right and and

1235
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:11,239
Kelly and and Ash and a couple other

1236
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:13,480
guys and uh they were explain to us oh

1237
00:47:11,239 --> 00:47:15,479
we have another investor tour these

1238
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:18,318
people want to come visit our farm it

1239
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:21,719
was like a a pain for them to just do

1240
00:47:18,318 --> 00:47:24,759
this tour over and over and over again

1241
00:47:21,719 --> 00:47:27,639
um and everything that comes with that

1242
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:29,720
um so that was part of the initial

1243
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:32,879
opportunity in filming our pilot episode

1244
00:47:29,719 --> 00:47:34,598
at the OG Glass House Farms um because

1245
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:37,800
we went back and filmed their newer

1246
00:47:34,599 --> 00:47:39,640
facility but the OG farm and carpentera

1247
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:42,039
uh we filmed that episode for them to

1248
00:47:39,639 --> 00:47:43,719
show to potential investors so they

1249
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:47,079
didn't have to keep opening their doors

1250
00:47:43,719 --> 00:47:48,799
every day yeah um so you mix that with a

1251
00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:51,640
little bit that was our foot in the door

1252
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:54,160
but you mix that with the inspiration of

1253
00:47:51,639 --> 00:47:55,879
Strain Hunters and burner had I think

1254
00:47:54,159 --> 00:47:57,358
like three episodes of marijuana Mania

1255
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:59,880
or maybe a couple

1256
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:02,400
at that time I was just like I [ __ ]

1257
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:05,440
love these shows and I want to have my

1258
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:07,639
own um and that's kind of how can cribs

1259
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,119
started well the production value is

1260
00:48:07,639 --> 00:48:11,199
really high with can of cribs you guys

1261
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:14,440

00:49:19,239 --> 00:49:23,838
to be said with working with the same

1290
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:26,199
person for a long time when you get to

1291
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:30,400
know that person they get to know you

1292
00:49:26,199 --> 00:49:31,719
you of it is and there has to be good

1293
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,720
understanding and good

1294
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:38,039
communication and uh yeah I mean I love

1295
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:40,679
it but you get to really create a body

1296
00:49:38,039 --> 00:49:43,000
of work which is like a baby you're

1297
00:49:40,679 --> 00:49:47,078
creating a body of work together where

1298
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,440
you can almost move in a rapid way

1299
00:49:47,079 --> 00:49:49,760
because you don't have to ask the other

1300
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:52,119
person what they're thinking you already

1301
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,799
know yeah right and and that's one of my

1302
00:49:52,119 --> 00:49:56,160
favorite Parts in working with Jason and

1303
00:49:53,798 --> 00:49:57,759
my crew is that you know when we start

1304
00:49:56,159 --> 00:50:01,519
filming a couple days here for the

1305
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:03,319
NorCal tour um other than our call sheet

1306
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:06,039
with the time I need to like wake up and

1307
00:50:03,318 --> 00:50:08,358
be on set they're they're doing they're

1308
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:10,838
running the show right I just show up

1309
00:50:08,358 --> 00:50:14,239
and talk with amazing people I have the

1310
00:50:10,838 --> 00:50:16,599
easiest part um but the crew um they are

1311
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:18,879
The Unsung her Heroes that you know

1312
00:50:16,599 --> 00:50:20,920
really bring this all to life absolutely

1313
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:23,440
so I I would not be here without them

1314
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:24,960
I'd say that for sure yeah I mean all

1315
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:27,480
this it just takes so much more than one

1316
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:29,358
person I can't do it all and blessed to

1317
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:31,719
have the team that I have on the growing

1318
00:50:29,358 --> 00:50:34,078
side on on the book The the book was a

1319
00:50:31,719 --> 00:50:36,439
team you know it's like I get all the

1320
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:37,920
credit for the book but if you look in

1321
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:39,798
there I mean even on the cover it has

1322
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:42,159
Reggie Gino's name he wrote the forward

1323
00:50:39,798 --> 00:50:43,838
he also helped edit the book challenged

1324
00:50:42,159 --> 00:50:46,318
me when I was writing to a lot of the

1325
00:50:43,838 --> 00:50:48,440
things I said to where I could be more

1326
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:50,679
specific about it he he really was able

1327
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:52,440
to tease some information out of me on

1328
00:50:50,679 --> 00:50:54,919
do you mean this or do you mean that and

1329
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:57,159
then we had my editor and we had

1330
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:58,838

like AB was my dream yeah that so Parts

1368
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,039
Unknown Anthony bour is one of my

1369
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:31,399
biggest Heroes him and Joe Rogan right

1370
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:33,159
so like I want to be the hybrid of both

1371
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,318
of them I want a cooking show I want to

1372
00:52:33,159 --> 00:52:36,480
do a little bit I've always wanted a

1373
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:38,838
cooking show but but Anthony Bourdain

1374
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:40,920
how he traveled the world and got to

1375
00:52:38,838 --> 00:52:43,039
experience food and shared the world

1376
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:44,639
from his lens yeah I want to do that

1377
00:52:43,039 --> 00:52:46,400
with what I do you know and that's

1378
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:48,519
partially like my my version of Joe

1379
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:51,400
Rogan is this show like I love Joe Rogan

1380
00:52:48,519 --> 00:52:54,318
how he he questions his guests he gets

1381
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:56,880
amazing diverse guests like yourself

1382
00:52:54,318 --> 00:52:58,239
that have their contribution to a much

1383
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,559
bigger thing which is the Cannabis

1384
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:02,519
industry for us right right and so it's

1385
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:03,960
just it's a lot of fun and I've just a

1386
00:53:02,519 --> 00:53:05,280
lot of times I smile like when I really

1387
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:08,599
start thinking about what I get to do

1388
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:10,240
for a living I you cannot smile this

1389
00:53:08,599 --> 00:53:12,720
isn't work this is our dream no it's a

1390
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:16,358
lifestyle right we're living a lifestyle

1391
00:53:12,719 --> 00:53:19,439
and I I'm so proud of all my friends

1392
00:53:16,358 --> 00:53:20,960
success and I'm happy to be here to be

1393
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,798
doing what I do it's just such a

1394
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,318
blessing it is a blessing you know I

1395
00:53:22,798 --> 00:53:25,679
think there's so many other things that

1396
00:53:24,318 --> 00:53:27,639
could have happened along the way that

1397
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:30,239
would have prevented from being here

1398
00:53:27,639 --> 00:53:33,719
today and it's like we've overcome all

1399
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:35,519
these obstacles to be here and we're so

1400
00:53:33,719 --> 00:53:36,919
fortunate to have been born at the time

1401
00:53:35,519 --> 00:53:40,000
where you're born and all these other

1402
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:43,838
things yeah it it it's so trippy to

1403
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:47,239
think uh back in the past of just one

1404
00:53:43,838 --> 00:53:50,000
one footstep to the left or the right or

1405
00:53:47,239 --> 00:53:52,318
one person or this or that just one

1406
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,559
little tweak and we wouldn't be here

1407
00:53:52,318 --> 00:53:57,558
today right um Butterfly Effect exactly

1408
00:53:55,559 --> 00:53:59,280
man and and people ask you know like oh

1409
00:53:57,559 --> 00:54:02,720
if you would go back and change this or

1410
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:06,319
that no not a damn thing I love where

1411
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:08,959
I'm at right now I am a combination of a

1412
00:54:06,318 --> 00:54:11,000
lot of bad decisions as well as good

1413
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:13,159
decisions um but you can't have one

1414
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,400
without the other yeah I mean I've done

1415
00:54:13,159 --> 00:54:18,118
some stupid [ __ ] in my life and I've

1416
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:20,960
I've made a lot of mistakes and I I

1417
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:23,480
think I've learned a lot from my

1418
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:26,440
mistakes you know mistakes from from

1419
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:28,119
childhood on I've made tons of mistakes

1420
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:30,159
I've learned from them that's my big

1421
00:54:28,119 --> 00:54:32,559
takeaway and I feel like it's made me

1422
00:54:30,159 --> 00:54:35,519
become a better person and it it's made

1423
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:36,920
me know myself a lot better yeah and so

1424
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:38,280
you know and it it just keeps getting

1425
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:40,000
better and you get more perspective as

1426
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,640
you get older that's the one takeaway

1427
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,679
that I you know in the last seven years

1428
00:54:41,639 --> 00:54:46,759
since I turned 40 the big takeaway was

1429
00:54:44,679 --> 00:54:49,879
like oh I just keep learning more or I

1430
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:51,400
learn how much I how I actually know way

1431
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:53,000
less than I thought I did about stuff

1432
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:55,960
because when in my early 20s I thought I

1433
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:59,358
knew everything I wasn't know-it-all and

1434
00:54:55,960 --> 00:55:01,880
I knew enough to be dangerous right in a

1435
00:54:59,358 --> 00:55:03,719
lot of ways and I was I think I'm barely

1436
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:06,400
SM what were you doing in your 20s so my

1437
00:55:03,719 --> 00:55:09,078
20s I you know I was growing weed

1438
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,599
selling weed uhuh but I also I always

1439
00:55:09,079 --> 00:55:13,318
was told that I needed to have another

1440
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:15,318
job like if you know I had a your paper

1441
00:55:13,318 --> 00:55:17,199
income Mentor I had to have a pay I had

1442
00:55:15,318 --> 00:55:19,838
to pay taxes right yeah so I wouldn't go

1443
00:55:17,199 --> 00:55:21,399
to prison for for tax evasion right if I

1444
00:55:19,838 --> 00:55:22,880
wanted to live a certain lifestyle you

1445
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,400
had to back that up with a paper job I

1446
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:27,318
wasn't one of those dudes who was all in

1447
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,639
on one thing and so I worked at Charles

America I worked in testing and uh so

1451
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:41,200

1453
00:55:41,199 --> 00:55:45,838
kinds of stuff for these companies I I

1454
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:50,240
went from that

1455
00:55:45,838 --> 00:55:52,000
to um getting laid off around 911 okay

1456
00:55:50,239 --> 00:55:53,519
uh but I I had the most amazing time

1457
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,798
working with computers I got flown all

1458
00:55:53,519 --> 00:55:59,679
around the United States during Y2K and

1459
00:55:55,798 --> 00:56:02,519
got to test and record systems uh and I

1460
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:04,118
learned a lot about data collection and

1461
00:56:02,519 --> 00:56:06,400
uh then I was a personal trainer learned

1462
00:56:04,119 --> 00:56:07,720
more about data collection you know and

1463
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:10,720
I'm getting back in shape now which is

1464
00:56:07,719 --> 00:56:12,919
great finally I love but I go in shape

1465
00:56:10,719 --> 00:56:15,959
but uh but yeah data collection is so

1466
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:18,559
key with everything in life right like I

1467
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:20,318
wish IID had a diary from the time I was

1468
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:22,160
a kid and filled that thing out

1469
00:56:20,318 --> 00:56:26,038
religiously because there's a lot of

1470
00:56:22,159 --> 00:56:30,558
important stuff um but after that uh I

1471
00:56:26,039 --> 00:56:33,920
was a chef culinary school um and then I

1472
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:35,519
was growing uh you know in the 90s I was

1473
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:37,358
growing I was growing the whole time

1474
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:41,159
pretty much I I always had

1475
00:56:37,358 --> 00:56:42,519
plants um different scales garages uh my

1476
00:56:41,159 --> 00:56:44,798
friends wanted to go into a big

1477
00:56:42,519 --> 00:56:47,519
warehouse and that's when we parted ways

1478
00:56:44,798 --> 00:56:49,119
I was like 50 livs is a little too much

1479
00:56:47,519 --> 00:56:51,559
was that the right decision in hindsight

1480
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:53,318
it was cuz he got busted yeah so he got

1481
00:56:51,559 --> 00:56:57,000
his his place got raided and all this

1482
00:56:53,318 --> 00:56:58,960
stuff so I never got raided for my grows

1483
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,280
uh I had eight lighters in the garage I

1484
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:04,720
think we had 10 lighters at one point

1485
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:08,839
but you know 10 years ago

1486
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:12,558
um I was growing and then in 2018 I had

1487
00:57:08,838 --> 00:57:14,480
several spots right small warehouses

1488
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:16,160
garages we had I had five different

1489
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:18,440
places I was growing in doing seed

1490
00:57:16,159 --> 00:57:20,719
production I did a little bit of flower

1491
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:23,720
cultivation um but even that was like

1492
00:57:20,719 --> 00:57:25,598
around 2018 it was like hit or miss you

1493
00:57:23,719 --> 00:57:27,838
know and so I was the chef I was the

1494
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:29,760
president of s Isco chefs Association

1495
00:57:27,838 --> 00:57:32,639
really so I worked at Michel and star

1496
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:37,039
restaurants I did all that I worked as a

1497
00:57:32,639 --> 00:57:38,679
line cook worked as an apprentice wow um

1498
00:57:37,039 --> 00:57:40,720
you know and I I apprenticed under some

1499
00:57:38,679 --> 00:57:43,679
really cool chefs and learned a lot

1500
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:46,519
about U stuff that I wanted to do and

1501
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:48,159
also stuff on what not to do you know

1502
00:57:46,519 --> 00:57:49,679
you watch other people and that

1503
00:57:48,159 --> 00:57:51,399
sometimes the takeaway is I don't want

1504
00:57:49,679 --> 00:57:54,038
to be an alcoholic I don't want to be a

1505
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:57,358
[ __ ] up U i' I've

1506
00:57:54,039 --> 00:58:00,440
seen people go both dire I've seen chefs

1507
00:57:57,358 --> 00:58:02,279
that are amazing and they're alcoholics

1508
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:04,400
and they they have like their they

1509
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:07,160
functional they functional extremely

1510

much and high- Performing alcoholics and

1512
00:58:10,798 --> 00:58:14,239
i' never wanted to be that I knew for

1513
00:58:12,798 --> 00:58:16,960
sure that that was one thing I never

1514
00:58:14,239 --> 00:58:19,558
wanted but I worked at country clubs I

1515
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:21,318
grew weed I really enjoyed life so I've

1516
00:58:19,559 --> 00:58:23,079
always been one of those guys who if I'm

1517
00:58:21,318 --> 00:58:24,358
not enjoying life I need to [ __ ]

1518
00:58:23,079 --> 00:58:26,798
figure out how to do something yeah

1519
00:58:24,358 --> 00:58:29,038
you're not doing it right no but I feel

1520
00:58:26,798 --> 00:58:30,798
like when you get to a certain point in

1521
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:32,359
your life if if things are falling into

1522
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:34,639
place you know you're on the right path

1523
00:58:32,358 --> 00:58:37,480
if they're not maybe you need to

1524
00:58:34,639 --> 00:58:40,199
reevaluate yeah yeah people talk about

1525
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:41,639
the stars aligning yeah right and and

1526
00:58:40,199 --> 00:58:44,038
you're exactly right when you're on the

1527
00:58:41,639 --> 00:58:47,239
right path you almost like don't have to

1528
00:58:44,039 --> 00:58:48,720
try just you're a magnet right for the

1529
00:58:47,239 --> 00:58:51,519
right things and the right people to

1530
00:58:48,719 --> 00:58:53,719
align totally well let's talk about

1531
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:57,440
genetics yeah and when you first started

1532
00:58:53,719 --> 00:59:00,318
smoking what were you smoking on oh man

1533
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:04,440
um let's take it back to Arlington

1534
00:59:00,318 --> 00:59:08,119
Washington nice um when I was

1535
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:11,880
probably what's like seventh eth grade

1536
00:59:08,119 --> 00:59:13,960
yeah around there um I don't remember

1537
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:17,559
probably I don't I don't even remember

1538
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:21,318
exactly what it was some Sour Diesel or

1539
00:59:17,559 --> 00:59:23,798
something um but I do remember uh you

1540
00:59:21,318 --> 00:59:26,119
know I had two older brothers right um

1541
00:59:23,798 --> 00:59:28,880
so I found one of their stashes started

1542
00:59:26,119 --> 00:59:31,440
getting curious you know what is this um

1543
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:33,200
started smoking with my best friends I

1544
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:35,639
remember uh

1545
00:59:33,199 --> 00:59:37,679
vividly one of the first times I smoked

1546
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:39,318
and smoked didn't get high at all I

1547
00:59:37,679 --> 00:59:43,038
think one of the first times I actually

1548
00:59:39,318 --> 00:59:45,719
did get high it was we were sitting it

1549
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:47,559
was me and my uh two best friends um we

1550
00:59:45,719 --> 00:59:50,919
were sitting on this

1551
00:59:47,559 --> 00:59:54,640
bridge um overlooking the still glish

1552
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:56,480
River in Arlington and uh we decided to

1553
00:59:54,639 --> 00:59:58,400
longboard through the streets this is

1554
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:00,400
like super late at night and it was just

1555
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,838
like one of the most magical experiences

1556
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:04,079
where you can't really like go back to

1557
01:00:01,838 --> 01:00:06,798
your normal life as a little kid after

1558
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:09,240
that um so maybe I started consuming too

1559
01:00:06,798 --> 01:00:12,599
young but it really did shape my life uh

1560
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:15,598
my dad's been a hippie my whole life um

1561
01:00:12,599 --> 01:00:18,240
so he really uh you know he traveled the

1562
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:20,838
world younger than myself and got to

1563
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:23,239
experience the hash of Morocco and down

1564
01:00:20,838 --> 01:00:24,679
in Colombia and all this so I kind of

1565
01:00:23,239 --> 01:00:26,519
grew up listening to those Tales a

1566
01:00:24,679 --> 01:00:29,519
little bit and and somewh falling in

1567

amazing yeah in three months of amazing

1579
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:59,240
weather yeah I grew up on the mountain

1580
01:00:56,039 --> 01:01:00,760
Mount Baker so I broke my first bone so

1581
01:00:59,239 --> 01:01:02,000
definitely love the winters up there but

1582
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:04,359
it's not for

1583
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:07,559
everyone it does get a little cold up

1584
01:01:04,358 --> 01:01:10,440
there I actually left uh my parents uh

1585
01:01:07,559 --> 01:01:13,599
moved me down to Tucson Arizona when I

1586
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:16,318
was about 15 so right around that time

1587
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:18,480
actually Washington was going uh legal

1588
01:01:16,318 --> 01:01:20,239
right so it's kind of funny I uh smoking

1589
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:21,719
was kind of looked down upon it was bad

1590
01:01:20,239 --> 01:01:23,358
I shouldn't have been doing it to the

1591
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:26,038
outside to the teachers and the parents

1592
01:01:23,358 --> 01:01:27,318
and stuff but at once I left it was was

1593
01:01:26,039 --> 01:01:29,680
kind of like well there's actually a

1594
01:01:27,318 --> 01:01:31,279
business here and then during you know

1595
01:01:29,679 --> 01:01:35,038
college and finishing out High School in

1596
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:36,798
Tucson it definitely became um accepted

1597
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:39,960
uh so it's just kind of interesting how

1598
01:01:36,798 --> 01:01:42,639
I was right there at that time yeah

1599
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:44,039
totally it's I I love this the scene in

1600
01:01:42,639 --> 01:01:45,358
Washington they've always been so

1601
01:01:44,039 --> 01:01:46,960
passionate about cannabis and then I bet

1602
01:01:45,358 --> 01:01:49,480
it was like such culture shock going

1603
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:51,318
into Arizona although that was a party

1604
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:53,400
town right so there was weed in Arizona

1605
01:01:51,318 --> 01:01:56,400
for sure especially on Arizona State it

1606
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:58,318
was different I so I was in TUC song

1607
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:00,039
um I went to high school for three years

1608
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:01,719
finished out down there and then I went

1609
01:02:00,039 --> 01:02:03,799
to the University of Arizona University

1610
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:05,759
Aron in Tucson but ASU as well I mean

1611
01:02:03,798 --> 01:02:07,838
everyone had the same weed and um it was

1612
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:09,599
different man party schools lots of

1613
01:02:07,838 --> 01:02:12,278
party schools I went to probably one of

1614
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:15,720
the most epic party schools in the world

1615
01:02:12,278 --> 01:02:18,719
I would say um during my freshman or

1616
01:02:15,719 --> 01:02:22,078
sophomore year I moved into this spot

1617
01:02:18,719 --> 01:02:24,639
that had the largest outdoor pool like I

1618
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:27,559
think it was in Arizona at the time wow

1619
01:02:24,639 --> 01:02:29,838
um so you could imagine um every single

1620
01:02:27,559 --> 01:02:31,480
person was at that pool partying um it

1621
01:02:29,838 --> 01:02:33,558
was ma it was like one of those massive

1622
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:35,639
Vegas pools but right right you're in

1623
01:02:33,559 --> 01:02:39,039
college and you're having massive House

1624
01:02:35,639 --> 01:02:41,358
parties um totally so that that was my

1625
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:44,400
my school background I I did study I

1626
01:02:41,358 --> 01:02:47,759
started some businesses but um yeah I

1627
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:50,200
did like to party a little bit nice yeah

1628
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:53,559
yeah it's hard not to it is man I mean

1629
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:55,038
it's like living in that environment

1630
01:02:53,559 --> 01:02:57,760
because I didn't do the dorm route I

1631
01:02:55,039 --> 01:03:00,520
just went into house and stuff yeah um

1632
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:02,599
and and again starting businesses and um

1633
01:03:00,519 --> 01:03:06,318
kind of in the night life and stuff um

1634

like I like smoking hookah I'm not a big

1658
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:05,599
tobacco guy right so like I don't like

1659
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:07,760
tobacco in the form of a cigarette I

1660
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:09,680
don't really smoke spliffs although I

1661
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:12,960
will hit a spliff or a blunt if there's

1662
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:14,759
nothing else but it's not my go-to right

1663
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:18,318
I'd rather eat nicotine gum than smoke

1664
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:19,760
that [ __ ] for the most part um but

1665
01:04:18,318 --> 01:04:21,759
there's another interesting story about

1666
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:25,278
nicotine gun we'll save that for later

1667
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:28,319
okay but yeah so I mean even the the

1668
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:30,719
blunt w just it's not my thing yeah but

1669
01:04:28,318 --> 01:04:32,480
the hookah and cigars I feel like those

1670
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:34,159
are kind of special and I reserve those

1671
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:36,639
for special occasions I'll still smoke

1672
01:04:34,159 --> 01:04:39,440

Rockwall cubes for plugs M but I was

1758
01:08:06,239 --> 01:08:10,519
anti- Rockwell for anything else and I

1759
01:08:09,358 --> 01:08:13,119
feel like it was because I was

and he's dialed it in to on a whole

1762
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:19,798
another level right and I feel like when

1763
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:21,120
we did some pheno hunting together pop

1764
01:08:19,798 --> 01:08:23,519
some stuff from seed and then went

1765
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:25,000
through phenotypes and he's really good

1766
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:26,600
at making the plant Express but the

1767
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:29,198
quality

1768
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:32,120
was Barone some of the best rock wool

1769
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:35,879
I've ever seen and for commercial

1770
01:08:32,119 --> 01:08:37,039
application it is the Lamborghini you

1771
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:39,319
know and it's like because you can dial

1772
01:08:37,039 --> 01:08:42,560
it in so much right and we both work

1773
01:08:39,319 --> 01:08:45,440
with grodan I'm a huge grodan fan now

1774
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:47,480
for specific uses you know I think we

1775
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:50,238
use grodan exclusively in the nursery

1776
01:08:47,479 --> 01:08:52,838
for our moms and for our clones you know

1777
01:08:50,238 --> 01:08:54,079
and I do growan with some of the feno

1778
01:08:52,838 --> 01:08:56,238
hunting but most of the feno hunting

1779
01:08:54,079 --> 01:08:58,278
that we're doing is with Coco but I have

1780
01:08:56,238 --> 01:09:00,759
no problem with people growing in

1781
01:08:58,279 --> 01:09:03,000
Rockwell I think that as far as if you

1782
01:09:00,759 --> 01:09:06,039
want something consistent it is the most

1783
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:08,079
consistent product um the guys of Gran

1784
01:09:06,039 --> 01:09:09,238
love that yeah but uh but yeah and I'm a

1785
01:09:08,079 --> 01:09:10,640
huge fan of the people that work at the

1786
01:09:09,238 --> 01:09:13,198
company you know it's another one it's

1787
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:14,600
like it's hard to not like something

1788
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:16,798
once you meet the people of the company

1789
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:18,679
it's like those people don't work there

1790
01:09:16,798 --> 01:09:20,719
for just a paycheck they work there

1791
01:09:18,679 --> 01:09:22,440
because they believe in the product you

1792
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:25,960
know like so many other people that we

1793
01:09:22,439 --> 01:09:29,759
work with and Miles bring it back to

1794
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:32,640
2017 um 2018 he was I remember this he

1795
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:35,560
was one of the OG testers of the gross

1796
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:38,199
sense model so he actually brought me to

1797
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:40,560
his facility um I probably still could

1798
01:09:38,198 --> 01:09:42,639
find a video of it um when he was just

1799
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:45,000
popping those in he was showing me how

1800
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:46,719
it all works on his phone and everything

1801
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,279
um you know who you know who the tester

1802
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:51,119
of the new grow sense model is Autumn me

1803
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:54,640
you oh [ __ ] we're working on the new

1804
01:09:51,119 --> 01:09:56,238
grense model full circle yeah so Gran

1805
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:58,800
sent me out the new sensors that just

1806
01:09:56,238 --> 01:10:00,718
came out you know it's like uh there

1807
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:02,840
wasn't a lot of Direction with them and

1808
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:05,480
I really like their sensors I really

1809
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:09,119
like the control that you have and the

1810
01:10:05,479 --> 01:10:11,879
accuracy um it's just a really well-made

1811
01:10:09,119 --> 01:10:15,198
and really well thought through product

1812
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:17,520
right um you know and I use agretech and

1813
01:10:15,198 --> 01:10:20,039
I use groan and I use the sensors for

1814
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:21,760
both and I'm always comparing um we have

1815
01:10:20,039 --> 01:10:23,760
a lot of redundancies in the facility so

1816
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:26,280
I'm constantly like okay well what did

1817
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:27,880
the humidity say from this this and this

1818
01:10:26,279 --> 01:10:30,198
okay well two of them are the same and

1819
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:31,760
one of them is different what's going on

1820
01:10:30,198 --> 01:10:33,479
why am I getting this result is it

1821
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:35,920
because the sensor is wrong is it the

1822
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:38,279
placement is it this this this or this

1823
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:39,600
there's a huge list that we go down and

1824
01:10:38,279 --> 01:10:41,119
we do that all over the place because

1825
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:43,920
we're trying to dial in the results that

1826
01:10:41,119 --> 01:10:46,158
we get yeah so well it's data driven

1827
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:48,840
gardening right dat that's what sets you

1828
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:50,920
apart it's the future future everybody

1829
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:52,520
should be doing it not everybody's doing

1830
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:53,760
it but everybody should be doing it I

1831
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:55,840
mean I'm not talking about home Growers

1832
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:57,920
necessarily you want to grow for fun you

1833
01:10:55,840 --> 01:11:01,000
your commercial at scale but you can

1834
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:02,480
still grow data driven at home too

1835
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,359
there's nothing wrong with that it's

1836
01:11:02,479 --> 01:11:06,119
just what level do you want to take it

1837
01:11:04,359 --> 01:11:07,679
how much time do you have to commit how

1838
01:11:06,119 --> 01:11:10,559
much money do you have to commit all

1839
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:11,760
those things you know play a huge role

1840
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:13,360
and then how much money do you have for

1841
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:15,640
R&amp;D because that's another one that like

1842
01:11:13,359 --> 01:11:18,079
it costs money but at the end of the day

1843
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:20,000
you learn a lot about not just the

1844
01:11:18,079 --> 01:11:22,519
products but about

1845
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,760
yourself so and and how do you like to

1846
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:25,880
grow because there's 10 different ways

1847
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:27,560
to skin a cat right

1848
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:30,039
but what's the best and most easiest way

1849
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:32,000
for you what's the most cost effective

1850
01:11:30,039 --> 01:11:33,039
that still gives you the same quality

1851
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,039
product and that's what I'm really

1852
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:36,800
looking forth the end I want the best

1853
01:11:35,039 --> 01:11:38,760
product possible for the least amount of

1854
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:40,840
money whether it's with lighting whether

1855
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:43,239
it's with nutrients whether across the

1856
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:45,039
board but really it has to be the best

1857
01:11:43,238 --> 01:11:48,238
product there's a lot of Growers out

1858
01:11:45,039 --> 01:11:50,000
there James still paying the green tax

1859
01:11:48,238 --> 01:11:52,839
yeah right and that's something that we

1860
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:55,479
talk about at grow World quite a bit is

1861
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:57,719
we do have 12 to 15 nutrient brands that

1862
01:11:55,479 --> 01:12:00,559
you can try yeah at all different price

1863
01:11:57,719 --> 01:12:02,039
points same with lights same with media

1864
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:05,600
I think we have a pretty impressive

1865
01:12:02,039 --> 01:12:08,639
roster of the top brands find the one

1866
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:10,840
that works the best for your facility at

1867
01:12:08,639 --> 01:12:14,039
a price point that works for you right

1868
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:16,360
and the brands that are out there today

1869
01:12:14,039 --> 01:12:18,399
that have you know kind of been around

1870
01:12:16,359 --> 01:12:20,479
for a while but have been charging those

1871
01:12:18,399 --> 01:12:23,319
higher rates I think the Market's going

1872
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:25,799
to force them to either lower your price

1873
01:12:23,319 --> 01:12:29,039
to what it should be or go out of

1874
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:31,520
business I I truly that and some of them

1875
01:12:29,039 --> 01:12:33,479
they have such a reputation and they've

1876
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:35,520
been doing it for so long that they have

1877
01:12:33,479 --> 01:12:37,519
the trust in people that will never

1878
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:39,760
switch they love it and there's nothing

1879
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:41,840
wrong with that I I'm charge whatever

1880
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:43,320
you can charge because you're you know

1881
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:45,199
you're only able to charge what you're

1882
01:12:43,319 --> 01:12:46,439
worth that's right right and so if

1883
01:12:45,198 --> 01:12:48,960
people are paying that that's what

1884
01:12:46,439 --> 01:12:52,279
you're worth right that's why people

1885
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:55,840
spend $1,800 on an ounce of NorCal Nemo

1886
01:12:52,279 --> 01:12:58,599
Skittles for one ounce $1,800

1887
01:12:55,840 --> 01:13:00,679
right but you're worth whatever someone

1888
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:02,079
will pay for you Market will bear

1889
01:13:00,679 --> 01:13:03,520
whatever whatever the market will bear

1890
01:13:02,079 --> 01:13:05,399
whatever people are willing to pay

1891
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:07,719
that's that's what that's what you can

1892
01:13:05,399 --> 01:13:09,599
charge you know and and you may need to

1893
01:13:07,719 --> 01:13:13,039
try to figure that out and maybe there's

1894
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:15,840
a happy medium to where you know you can

1895
01:13:13,039 --> 01:13:18,279
charge less and still make a good amount

1896
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:20,239
of money maybe you charge that because

1897
01:13:18,279 --> 01:13:22,158
your demand is so high that if you

1898
01:13:20,238 --> 01:13:23,678
charge less you're just going to blow

1899
01:13:22,158 --> 01:13:25,879
through it because you create only a

1900
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:27,760
small amount of product yeah so it's

1901
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:29,319
really interesting seeing what these

1902
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:30,800
people charge across the board and why

1903
01:13:29,319 --> 01:13:32,920
they charge it and I'm always trying to

1904
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:34,279
look like why do they charge so much for

1905
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:35,359
this light are they really thinking that

1906
01:13:34,279 --> 01:13:38,960
they're going to be able to sell this

1907
01:13:35,359 --> 01:13:40,799
for that much more and if they are

1908
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:42,880
selling it for that why are they selling

1909
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:44,119
it for that they they get better results

1910
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:46,480
right are you going to give me better

1911
01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:49,719
results if I pay $500 more for per

1912
01:13:46,479 --> 01:13:51,319
fixture right maybe it's worth testing

1913
01:13:49,719 --> 01:13:53,359
but that's the thing there's not I mean

1914
01:13:51,319 --> 01:13:56,000
that's why grow World exists is we are

1915
01:13:53,359 --> 01:13:58,119
platforming those results yeah right you

1916
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:01,520
are going to provide a grow Journal of

1917
01:13:58,119 --> 01:14:03,960
how that Kaya cocoe worked versus XYZ

1918
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:06,920
Solution that's our vision is help

1919
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:08,840
Growers learn help them become a better

1920
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:10,960
version of themselves because then they

1921
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:13,639
can go back to the manufacturers and say

1922
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:16,079
hey this performed better at a lower

1923
01:14:13,639 --> 01:14:18,000
cost that's why I'm switching well and

1924
01:14:16,079 --> 01:14:20,238
you will never find me talking trash

1925
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,198
about another brand no I do not trash

1926
01:14:20,238 --> 01:14:24,399
any of the companies that I test their

1927
01:14:22,198 --> 01:14:25,799
stuff if I don't like it that's that's

1928
01:14:24,399 --> 01:14:27,559
between me

1929
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:29,039
and maybe the company if they ask me

1930
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:32,679
right but it's not between me and the

1931
01:14:29,039 --> 01:14:34,279
public I don't need to downplay or pick

1932
01:14:32,679 --> 01:14:38,359
sides with stuff I just want to give

1933
01:14:34,279 --> 01:14:40,238
people honest feedback and I love that

1934
01:14:38,359 --> 01:14:42,799
about what we do where we can help

1935
01:14:40,238 --> 01:14:44,678
Growers by empowering them with stuff

1936
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:46,800
but if I have a product I don't like I'm

1937
01:14:44,679 --> 01:14:49,158
not going to tell people I like it

1938
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:50,960
that's the other thing you know yeah but

1939
01:14:49,158 --> 01:14:52,599
the beauty of grow world is you know you

1940
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:55,639
have all these grow World ambassadors

1941
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:57,960
like myself um you know and we're doing

1942
01:14:55,639 --> 01:14:59,440
real time testing on all this stuff

1943
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:02,039
you're able to collect data from all

1944
01:14:59,439 --> 01:15:03,638
these people MH you know and I think

1945
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:05,198
there and the other thing is is like

1946
01:15:03,639 --> 01:15:06,800
we're not in comp I'm not in competition

1947
01:15:05,198 --> 01:15:08,039
with a single other Ambassador and I

1948
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:09,600
don't think the other ambassadors feel

1949
01:15:08,039 --> 01:15:11,719
like we're in competition either it's

1950
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:13,639
all coll collaboration at the top

1951
01:15:11,719 --> 01:15:15,359
competition at the bottom totally and I

1952
01:15:13,639 --> 01:15:18,279
enjoy seeing the videos that these guys

1953
01:15:15,359 --> 01:15:19,920
are creating and also learning more

1954
01:15:18,279 --> 01:15:21,359
about what they're doing and you know I

1955
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:23,319
talk pretty regularly to some of the

1956
01:15:21,359 --> 01:15:25,559
other ambassadors and we're always

1957
01:15:23,319 --> 01:15:27,319
talking about how good products are or

1958
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:28,679
you know what things could be done to

1959
01:15:27,319 --> 01:15:31,599
improve the products that we already

1960
01:15:28,679 --> 01:15:34,399
like I mean I I love you know I'm doing

1961
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:37,039
this trial with Kaa we're doing the

1962
01:15:34,399 --> 01:15:40,039
Kaaya Coco we're doing the Char cor

1963
01:15:37,039 --> 01:15:42,960
we're doing the um

1964
01:15:40,039 --> 01:15:45,238
Cana by can yeah the Coco by can that's

1965
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:46,800
the original Char is all three on grow

1966
01:15:45,238 --> 01:15:49,559
world they're all three on grow world

1967
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:52,000
and I'm very used to the Char cor I do

1968
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:53,440
like the Char cor 100% that one I know

1969
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,158
exactly how it performs so that's the

1970
01:15:53,439 --> 01:15:58,079
bar for me and now can is the original

1971
01:15:56,158 --> 01:16:00,079
and then Ka and I'm using Ka right now I

1972
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:02,319
have a whole room as you saw I saw that

1973
01:16:00,079 --> 01:16:04,000
yeah and so I'm super excited because I

1974
01:16:02,319 --> 01:16:07,599
see how well the plants are performing

1975
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:09,000
with the Kaya so I'm like well we'll see

1976
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:10,719
and maybe I'll like all three for

1977
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:13,238
different reasons or maybe I'll get some

1978
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:15,719
more results for all three but I know

1979
01:16:13,238 --> 01:16:18,399
Char cor works really well and so I'm

1980
01:16:15,719 --> 01:16:20,840
super excited to see two other brands

1981
01:16:18,399 --> 01:16:24,119
that perform so far ka's performing

1982
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:25,480
equal to the charcoal so that's great to

1983
01:16:24,119 --> 01:16:27,760
hear yeah and and for these

1984
01:16:25,479 --> 01:16:30,638
manufacturers out there as well I think

1985
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:33,119
it's super important that they listen

1986
01:16:30,639 --> 01:16:35,400
yeah right that they should have a form

1987
01:16:33,119 --> 01:16:37,719
to be able to ask you how are the

1988
01:16:35,399 --> 01:16:39,479
results right um I went to Powerhouse a

1989
01:16:37,719 --> 01:16:41,639
couple days ago with Serge and Kevin

1990
01:16:39,479 --> 01:16:43,959
Crouch and those guys and literally

1991
01:16:41,639 --> 01:16:46,440
right when I walked in there's like this

1992
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:49,198
little uh fabric lining underneath the

1993
01:16:46,439 --> 01:16:51,319
Kaya compressed block right and they're

1994
01:16:49,198 --> 01:16:53,678
like hey what if we pull that out what

1995
01:16:51,319 --> 01:16:56,759
if instead we have some you know

1996
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:59,440
modification and we got on the phone

1997
01:16:56,760 --> 01:17:01,719
with Harish at kayak coka cor and he's

1998
01:16:59,439 --> 01:17:04,000
like already on the phone with India you

1999
01:17:01,719 --> 01:17:06,639
know making the changes he's already

2000
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:08,760
calculating how it would be manufactured

2001
01:17:06,639 --> 01:17:12,319
that's the feedback loop we need across

2002
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:14,000
the board lighting substrate nutrients

2003
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:15,359
well and direct contact with the

2004
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,719
consumers that are using the product

2005
01:17:15,359 --> 01:17:19,238
they want to give you feedback because

2006
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:21,600
it's like it's one thing people buy your

2007
01:17:19,238 --> 01:17:23,479
stuff and and they're uneducated but

2008
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:25,960
it's another thing when you have a real

2009
01:17:23,479 --> 01:17:28,158
grower the the real cultivator getting

2010
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:29,639
in and it's able to give you real honest

2011
01:17:28,158 --> 01:17:32,079
feedback on how you can make your

2012
01:17:29,639 --> 01:17:34,079
product better yeah or your marketing or

2013
01:17:32,079 --> 01:17:37,479
whatever it is like beanock they have

2014
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:39,639
killer packaging yeah killer packaging

2015
01:17:37,479 --> 01:17:43,000
right and so and their product we had

2016
01:17:39,639 --> 01:17:45,639
them on the podcast and we talked to uh

2017
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:47,960
Mother's Magnolia from Oregon they swear

2018
01:17:45,639 --> 01:17:49,719
by it I'm super excited to try their

2019
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:51,639
flower because you know they're are

2020
01:17:49,719 --> 01:17:55,600
really well-known Rand up in that Eugene

2021
01:17:51,639 --> 01:17:58,960
area yeah and so it's a beautiful thing

2022
01:17:55,600 --> 01:18:01,960
yeah I love to see Sergio starting to

2023
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:04,239
require at connect events if a brand

2024
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:06,198
wants to booth there like a substrate

2025
01:18:04,238 --> 01:18:08,678
like a Kaaya right they have to bring a

2026
01:18:06,198 --> 01:18:11,879
grower that uses their product and and

2027
01:18:08,679 --> 01:18:14,440
Booth right next to them um I I love it

2028
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:16,639
I mean that's really how it should be um

2029
01:18:14,439 --> 01:18:19,000
this most recent connect event I uh went

2030
01:18:16,639 --> 01:18:22,039
to a couple nights ago there was like 30

2031
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:25,359
boosts there right 15 Brands and 15 you

2032
01:18:22,039 --> 01:18:28,639
know flower brands that rock that gavita

2033
01:18:25,359 --> 01:18:31,039
light or those GH nudes or United Kay

2034
01:18:28,639 --> 01:18:34,079
Etc um that's how it should be there

2035
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:36,560
should be more transparency around that

2036
01:18:34,079 --> 01:18:39,119
relationship um and the consumer should

2037
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:41,480
extend all the way down to them as well

2038
01:18:39,119 --> 01:18:44,000
right we we go into a restaurant and

2039
01:18:41,479 --> 01:18:47,759
grass grass-fed meat is called out on

2040
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:49,960
the menu right right versus whatever GMO

2041
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:52,039
this or that um I think that would be

2042
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:54,840
great if even down to the dispensary

2043
01:18:52,039 --> 01:18:57,079
level we had some transparency around

2044
01:18:54,840 --> 01:19:00,440
well this was an organically grown

2045
01:18:57,079 --> 01:19:02,439
product versus synthetic or this or that

2046
01:19:00,439 --> 01:19:04,839
yeah um I think that would be a future

2047
01:19:02,439 --> 01:19:07,279
that would make us a better consumer

2048
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:10,440
yeah and I'm all for Organics and I'm

2049
01:19:07,279 --> 01:19:14,639
all for synthetics but I'm also for

2050
01:19:10,439 --> 01:19:17,198
transparency yeah right so I I do love

2051
01:19:14,639 --> 01:19:19,119
salts as just as much as I love organic

2052
01:19:17,198 --> 01:19:22,119
in a lot of ways I do love some organic

2053
01:19:19,119 --> 01:19:24,319
good organic flour flora and Flame can

2054
01:19:22,119 --> 01:19:26,679
of Organics in Washington but I also

2055
01:19:24,319 --> 01:19:29,439
love my my SF Canal weed and I also love

2056
01:19:26,679 --> 01:19:31,359
my house of cultivar weed and so there's

2057
01:19:29,439 --> 01:19:33,198
something for everybody and good

2058
01:19:31,359 --> 01:19:35,439
cultivators grow good cannabis that's

2059
01:19:33,198 --> 01:19:37,359
right at the end of the day I think

2060
01:19:35,439 --> 01:19:39,000
there's not just one way to do it and so

2061
01:19:37,359 --> 01:19:41,279
there's so much good cannabis out there

2062
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:43,840
if you know the right people but as far

2063
01:19:41,279 --> 01:19:46,719
as as a whole it's only a very small

2064
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:49,400
percentage of the industry right yeah

2065
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:52,198
and and going back to our future Market

2066
01:19:49,399 --> 01:19:55,799
you know 10 20 years from now it will be

2067
01:19:52,198 --> 01:19:59,359
California weed just grown in Berlin

2068
01:19:55,800 --> 01:20:01,159
yeah Melbourne Medan right um our weed

2069
01:19:59,359 --> 01:20:03,158
will be all around the world but it's

2070
01:20:01,158 --> 01:20:06,319
going to be grown with the products they

2071
01:20:03,158 --> 01:20:07,719
have yeah but I think that so so my

2072
01:20:06,319 --> 01:20:10,119
vision and we can talk about this more

2073
01:20:07,719 --> 01:20:12,920
on your podcast too but my vision for

2074
01:20:10,119 --> 01:20:16,000
the future is that we will have geoc

2075
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:18,840
climatized varieties growing outdoor or

2076
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:20,960
Greenhouse all over the world and that

2077
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:23,360
country will be known for this this and

2078
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:25,198
this and I want to be part of that right

2079
01:20:23,359 --> 01:20:27,319
that's what I want to be part of

2080
01:20:25,198 --> 01:20:29,119
bigger scale I want to be that guy who

2081
01:20:27,319 --> 01:20:31,439
was like I'm going to St Vincent to GI

2082
01:20:29,119 --> 01:20:34,399
them banana crosses right that I made

2083
01:20:31,439 --> 01:20:35,960
their economy revolved around bananas uh

2084
01:20:34,399 --> 01:20:37,799
I went there I had such a great time so

2085
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:39,439
I'm gifting the country the minister of

2086
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:42,320
Agriculture I'm gifting him in this

2087
01:20:39,439 --> 01:20:43,638
awesome box 20 banana crosses that I

2088
01:20:42,319 --> 01:20:46,599
made for the island to give to the

2089
01:20:43,639 --> 01:20:48,840
people wow and so I would love it if

2090
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:50,280
they could grow those in an outdoor

2091
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:52,360
setting and Export them all over the

2092
01:20:50,279 --> 01:20:54,039
world and so people could be like I got

2093
01:20:52,359 --> 01:20:56,198
that banana Stam from St Vincent and it

2094
01:20:54,039 --> 01:20:58,960
was amazing and even if they don't know

2095
01:20:56,198 --> 01:21:01,479
that it was from me I still did

2096
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:03,639
something that was like pass moving it

2097
01:21:01,479 --> 01:21:05,198
forward you know I think when we can

2098
01:21:03,639 --> 01:21:08,199
move the plant forward when we can

2099
01:21:05,198 --> 01:21:11,039
Empower people to do right by the plant

2100
01:21:08,198 --> 01:21:14,039
and you know it can provide them with a

2101
01:21:11,039 --> 01:21:15,119
lifestyle and them with money you know I

2102
01:21:14,039 --> 01:21:17,920
think that's what it's all about at the

2103
01:21:15,119 --> 01:21:20,800
end of the day it is it reminds me of my

2104
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:23,520
friend uh Cameron bravman um he's the

2105
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:25,400
host of deep root season one um preg

2106
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:27,320
Garrett pre- autumn

2107
01:21:25,399 --> 01:21:29,679
um he goes around the world and builds

2108
01:21:27,319 --> 01:21:32,559
world class facilities um he recently

2109
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:34,639
went to South Africa and he shared these

2110
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:37,039
photos with me and they literally from

2111
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:39,800
the facility that they built were able

2112
01:21:37,039 --> 01:21:43,238
to afford once it was under production a

2113
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:46,000
school a football or soccer field right

2114
01:21:43,238 --> 01:21:49,000
yeah um a market for the different you

2115
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:50,520
know uh Goods to be sold they invested

2116
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,920
right back into the community and that

2117
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:55,000
brings me back to Strain Hunters Aran

2118
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:56,679
totally literally what they do yeah yeah

2119
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,639
and he I mean when he was in the Congo

2120
01:21:56,679 --> 01:21:59,880
they

2121
01:21:57,639 --> 01:22:02,199
basically did a lot of good for the

2122
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:04,880
community he he helped change law too he

2123
01:22:02,198 --> 01:22:09,359
spent a lot of money trying to change

2124
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:11,880
the laws there um and you know a lot of

2125
01:22:09,359 --> 01:22:13,839
this stuff people don't even realize the

2126
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:16,560
amount of time and energy that goes into

2127
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:19,000
this stuff that sometimes you don't get

2128
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:21,039
credit for sometimes it changes but it's

2129
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:24,158
the effort yeah it's the effort that we

2130
01:22:21,039 --> 01:22:25,840
all put forth so and I think within life

2131
01:22:24,158 --> 01:22:28,399
there's a lot of things you can do you

2132
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:29,800
can you know you can live to make money

2133
01:22:28,399 --> 01:22:31,359
you can live to make the world a better

2134
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:34,079
place and sometimes it's a balance of

2135
01:22:31,359 --> 01:22:37,119
the two mhm that uh you know it makes

2136
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:41,039
your life complete yeah I I absolutely

2137
01:22:37,119 --> 01:22:44,719
agree with that I I see um there's this

2138
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:47,439
quote that in order for Bill Gates to be

2139
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:49,079
like the you know biggest philanthropist

2140
01:22:47,439 --> 01:22:51,638
in the world in his latter half of his

2141
01:22:49,079 --> 01:22:53,479
career he had to be a ruthless

2142
01:22:51,639 --> 01:22:54,880
businessman in his first part of his

2143
01:22:53,479 --> 01:22:57,238
career right I don't know if I

2144
01:22:54,880 --> 01:23:00,079
completely agree with that um but I get

2145
01:22:57,238 --> 01:23:02,158
it right in order to amass a great

2146
01:23:00,079 --> 01:23:04,439
wealth you can't do that from just being

2147
01:23:02,158 --> 01:23:07,719
a philanthropist but in order to have

2148
01:23:04,439 --> 01:23:10,359
the impact of billions and potentially

2149
01:23:07,719 --> 01:23:13,039
tens of billions of dollars given to

2150
01:23:10,359 --> 01:23:15,439
causes you care about um that part is

2151
01:23:13,039 --> 01:23:17,639
somewhat an aster next to Bill Gates but

2152
01:23:15,439 --> 01:23:20,158
um to be able to give back and make that

2153
01:23:17,639 --> 01:23:21,440
impact you have to find that wealth

2154
01:23:20,158 --> 01:23:23,638
somewhere and and you're going to have

2155
01:23:21,439 --> 01:23:25,399
to earn it yeah well and I think there's

2156
01:23:23,639 --> 01:23:28,560
ways to give back that don't cost as

2157
01:23:25,399 --> 01:23:31,119
much money sometimes it's the little

2158
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:32,719
things yeah right and sometimes it's

2159
01:23:31,119 --> 01:23:35,559
about awareness like we're giving back

2160
01:23:32,719 --> 01:23:37,319
in the form of awareness and education I

2161
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:39,880
love I love that I love the fact I love

2162
01:23:37,319 --> 01:23:42,519
giving back it makes me feel good right

2163
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:46,279
when I can make people more aware of

2164
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:48,199
something uh or Empower them to grow

2165
01:23:46,279 --> 01:23:50,000
better flower you know because I think

2166
01:23:48,198 --> 01:23:51,919
just talking about the pl we're doing

2167
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:53,719
good for the world you know because I

2168
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:55,600
think the stigma was so it was Cannabis

2169
01:23:53,719 --> 01:23:57,520
was so bad for the longest time and now

2170
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:59,880
we've kind of pushed that agenda and now

2171
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:03,080
we're normalizing it so now let's create

2172
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:06,600
a better product for people I love that

2173
01:24:03,079 --> 01:24:10,000
yeah so if you had one piece of advice

2174
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:12,440
for young entrepreneurs or people that

2175
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,760
are young with Entre entrepreneurial

2176
01:24:12,439 --> 01:24:16,000
mindset they're interested in the

2177
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:18,920
Cannabis space what would that one piece

2178
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:22,800
of advice be get a

2179
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:24,600
mentor find someone that have that has

2180
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:27,560
walked the path that you're looking to

2181
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:29,960
go down um that has accomplished

2182
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:31,760
something that you're looking to uh

2183
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:35,279
accomplish in your own

2184
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:38,119
career and be a pest email them call

2185
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:40,920
them show up at their work or whatever

2186
01:24:38,118 --> 01:24:42,799
respectfully um and ask them to to bring

2187
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:45,279
you under their wing um I almost don't

2188
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:47,440
believe in being self-made um at this

2189
01:24:45,279 --> 01:24:50,118
point I I really do believe the the

2190
01:24:47,439 --> 01:24:52,678
coaches and the teachers and the parents

2191
01:24:50,118 --> 01:24:54,079
as a kid but past that point you know

2192
01:24:52,679 --> 01:24:55,359
once you're done with that part of your

2193
01:24:54,079 --> 01:24:58,039
life

2194
01:24:55,359 --> 01:25:00,559
um find a good Mentor find someone to

2195
01:24:58,039 --> 01:25:02,359
kind of show you the road and um I have

2196
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:05,840
several mentors actually one's right

2197
01:25:02,359 --> 01:25:07,599

2206
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:28,079
month and his only agreement when we

2207
01:25:26,079 --> 01:25:30,719
first started five years ago is that I

2208
01:25:28,079 --> 01:25:33,600

2209

01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:39,679
should make that happen oh we're doing

2212
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:41,800
it this trip I get to meet him for the

2213
01:25:39,679 --> 01:25:43,480
first time nice you should interview him

2214
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:45,199
in fact I need to interview him as well

2215
01:25:43,479 --> 01:25:47,519
I am gonna interview him I'm doing a

2216
01:25:45,198 --> 01:25:50,279
grow World podcast with ATN because he

2217
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:53,119
doesn't do a lot of public speaking like

2218
01:25:50,279 --> 01:25:55,319
podcasts um and and that's my he speak

2219
01:25:53,118 --> 01:25:57,000
really well though he the plant too he's

2220
01:25:55,319 --> 01:26:00,799
another one that's really put moved it

2221
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:03,439
Forward extremely intellectual OG all of

2222
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:06,039
that um I'm absolutely blessed that he

2223
01:26:03,439 --> 01:26:08,879
said yes to Mentor me and um I've had

2224
01:26:06,039 --> 01:26:11,960
other mentors right and I think that's

2225
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:14,719
the fastest advice or sorry the fastest

2226
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:17,399
way for you to go from just figuring it

2227
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:19,000
out to okay now you're in and maybe your

2228
01:26:17,399 --> 01:26:21,638
Mentor can even connect you to some

2229
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:23,118
people and teach you some things I'm so

2230
01:26:21,639 --> 01:26:25,920
glad you said that because in the last

2231
01:26:23,118 --> 01:26:28,639
couple shows I've been talking about how

2232
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:30,880
I feel that culinary arts is very much

2233
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:32,760
like the Cannabis industry oh yeah and

2234
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:34,239
one of the best ways I mean I'm not a

2235
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:36,000
huge fan of culinary school although I

2236
01:26:34,238 --> 01:26:38,399
do like oer Dam and kind of what they

2237
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,800
bring to the table I am not a big fan of

2238
01:26:38,399 --> 01:26:41,799
culinary school I think the best way is

2239
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:44,719
to go get your hands dirty oh yeah work

2240
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:47,400
in a kitchen yeah and get a mentor

2241
01:26:44,719 --> 01:26:49,880
become an apprentice um work as a

2242
01:26:47,399 --> 01:26:51,599
dishwasher and learn your skills uh and

2243
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:53,760
work your way up and have somebody take

2244
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:55,199
you under their wing and cannabis too

2245
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:57,480
it's like if you have somebody that

2246
01:26:55,198 --> 01:26:59,839
believes in you if you're a hard worker

2247
01:26:57,479 --> 01:27:01,158
and you do Way Beyond what's expected

2248
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:03,199
you will find somebody that'll take you

2249
01:27:01,158 --> 01:27:05,319
under their way because those people

2250
01:27:03,198 --> 01:27:07,799
aren't easy to find and when you find

2251
01:27:05,319 --> 01:27:09,359
them you don't want to let go of them so

2252
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:10,119
you want to educate them and make them

2253
01:27:09,359 --> 01:27:12,920
even

2254
01:27:10,118 --> 01:27:14,319
better yeah I love that yeah it's great

2255
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:15,760
yeah and just your overall mindset of

2256
01:27:14,319 --> 01:27:18,158
learning I think we've talked a lot

2257
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:20,679
about that today yeah um but don't beat

2258
01:27:18,158 --> 01:27:22,960
yourself up you know just uh and don't

2259
01:27:20,679 --> 01:27:25,639
compare yourself to others just be 1%

2260
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:27,359
better than yourself yesterday right

2261
01:27:25,639 --> 01:27:29,039
that's why the Japanese they have much

2262
01:27:27,359 --> 01:27:31,439
smaller increments of Weights in their

2263
01:27:29,039 --> 01:27:33,039
gym than we have over here it's that

2264
01:27:31,439 --> 01:27:35,599
whole mentality it is gradual

2265
01:27:33,039 --> 01:27:38,519
Improvement yeah so you don't need to

2266
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:42,119
put on another 45 pound plate

2267
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:45,199
