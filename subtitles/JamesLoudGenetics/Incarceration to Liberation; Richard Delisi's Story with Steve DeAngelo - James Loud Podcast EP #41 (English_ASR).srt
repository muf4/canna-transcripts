rolled it into six joints and sold each

30
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:11,719
joint for a buck and did that a few

31
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:14,799
times and eventually started buying eles

32
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:17,840

00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:03,158
yeah it was fast it was it was so rapid

69
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:08,079
I was like I don't know if I was ready

70
00:03:03,158 --> 00:03:10,560
you know right but I am now I bet I bet

71
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,799
and you've been able to enjoy cannabis

72
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,560
quite a bit and you have your own

73
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:16,400
cannabis brand delicioso right we we

74
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,519
have our own brand in Florida we work

75
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,680
with true Leaf yeah uh we're in 130

76
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,599
stores in the State of Florida it's

77
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,680
really impressive yeah it's so

78
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:27,639
unbelievable that I'm actually s illegal

79
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,120
in the state they put me away for 98

80
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:33,318
years that's what's pretty wild about it

81
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,000
yeah and they don't have no beef about

82
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:37,318
it or any you know they don't

83
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,239
even I've been trying to get clemency

84
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:42,919
since I've been home or a p or something

85
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,000
well because it's state you can't get a

86
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:46,759
presidential the Pres the president

87
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,158
can't do it it's got to be it's got to

88
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:52,000
be Ronda Santos to do

89
00:03:49,158 --> 00:03:54,919
it or whoever replaces him or whoever

90
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,519
replaces him right and he's not big on

91
00:03:54,919 --> 00:04:00,158
cannabis no he's not big on him all not

92
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:03,158
big on cannabis in a good way I think uh

93
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:05,759
we could expect the santis to uh to

94
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:07,438
probably attack cannabis yeah and then

95
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:08,479
so Steve how did you guys first meet

96
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:10,759
because you guys have known each other

97
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:12,598
for a long time I think when I met you

98
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:15,039
you were talking about Richard and well

99
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:19,199
it was through Rick right it was was it

100
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:22,519
was um uh I think uh I was late to

101
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:26,560
Instagram so I think it was like

102
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:29,399
2012 or 2013 something like that that I

103
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,319
actually got an Instagram account up and

104
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:33,038
it was somewhere in those first you know

105
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:35,399
a year or two after I had an Instagram

106
00:04:33,038 --> 00:04:39,599
account that Rick reached out to me and

107
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:42,399
told me the story and it was uh even

108
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,479
before we started last prisoner project

109
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:47,799
that I think we started having that

110
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:50,360
conversation um you know for me it was

111
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,439
around 2017 that I really started

112
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,520
thinking about last prisoner project in

113
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:58,360
a serious way because we just passed

114
00:04:54,519 --> 00:05:00,198
adult use cannabis in California 2016

115
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,360
but not a single person got released

116
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:04,800
from prison as a result of of passing

117
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,879
that legislation MH and so I felt like

118
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,520
the next step was was actually doing

119
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:12,759
something and so you know from the

120
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:16,519
beginning uh Richard was on the list of

121
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:18,560
of prisoners that I cared about um

122
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:21,038
because I remember right like I'm 10

123
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:25,280
years behind Richard okay he was like

124
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:27,199
the big glamorous airplane flying boat

125
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,559
captain and weed Smuggler who is

126
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,680
bringing in these huge loads of amazing

127
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,839
weed and I was like this you know young

128
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,478
dealer who was you know moving 50 lb

129
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:38,439
lots and 100 lb lots and if I was lucky

130
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:40,439
I you know I could catch something on

131
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:42,800
offload from you know from a big

132
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:45,560
Smuggler but that was kind of like my

133
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,120
role model and who I wanted to be and I

134
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:50,759
remembered so well when the federal

135
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,519
government started going after all the

136
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:57,479
big Smugglers and laying down these Rico

137
00:05:53,519 --> 00:06:01,478
charges and these you know 20 30 40 50

138
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:03,639
98e sentences yeah and uh and it was

139
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:06,560
then that we really knew that like the

140
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:08,639
the war was on it was on and what year

141
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,319
was that roughly the time I remember

142
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,800
that beginning is when Ronald Reagan was

143
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:18,039
elected in 1980 he appointed George HW

144
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,400
Bush the uh drugs are of the South

145
00:06:18,038 --> 00:06:24,639
Florida task force and uh they were the

146
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:26,799
first people to put US military awax up

147
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,680
in the air to start patrolling the

148
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,319
Caribbean yeah and and so what they did

149
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,759
is they in that time there was a bunch

150
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:36,080
of really great Colombian weed that was

151
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,199
coming in just phenomenal weed it was

152
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:41,399
coming in in these great big boat loads

153
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:44,120
of it um you could like go 12 miles

154
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:46,318
outside of the the coastal waterway in

155
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,519
Florida and like a little cabin cruiser

156
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,960
and there would just be like six or

157
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:51,478
seven ships there that you could buy

158
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:55,439
weed off of it was it was really quite

159
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:57,719
incredible uh for a while um Bush went

160
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:00,199
in and targeted the big slow moving

161
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,560
wheat chips and then allow all of his

162
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:04,360
Cuban buddies who had you know operated

163
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,038
with them in the Bay of Pigs and other

get weighed at the spot and then it

240
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,959

criminal issues but you guys remember a

286
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,680
time and this is before my time where

287
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,120
you used to walk through and there was

288
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:13,278
no airport security well I'll tell you

289
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,278
interesting story about uh one of my

290
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:18,439
earliest arrests uh yes there was a time

291
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:21,039
when you could just get on an airplane

292
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:23,839
with weed or or cash and you know go

293
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:25,879
from point A to point B and I was uh

294
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:28,199
working out of New York um bringing

295
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:30,919
loads from New York down to DC and I was

296
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:33,000
working for one particular character who

297
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:35,958
has actually been in the news recently

298
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,039
but I'm not going to name his name um

299
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:42,159
who um desperately needed the $26,000

300
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:43,559
that I owed him like so desperately that

301
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:46,159
he couldn't wait for me to take the

302
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:48,078
train the next morning I had to fly

303
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:51,519
there on the last flight out from

304
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:53,719
Washington DC to New York MH and so I

305
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,399
stick the cash in a in a briefcase

306
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,959
because that's all you had to do right I

307
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:59,120
wrapped it up in like a little satin

308
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:01,399
sheet or something like that and it I

309
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,440
get to the airport and there's this

310
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:08,000
machine at the gate that I'd never seen

311
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:10,160
before it was a metal detector and they

312
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,120
had this sign up there they said this is

313
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:15,759
this new machine to protect Stu metal

314
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,519
detector and it's like if you you know

315
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:20,759
you uh are not any under obligation to

316
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:23,240
consent to a surge if you put your bag

317
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:25,000
in here and it and it alerts you can

318
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,959
either choose to take your bag and leave

319
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,679
the airport or we can search it and you

320
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:32,838
can board the plane so I stupidly

321
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:36,799
allowed the bag to go through the the

322
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:38,800
the detector it alerts um uh and they

323
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:41,799
did not give me the option of leaving

324
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:44,120
the airport uh with my bag uh they

325
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:46,439
arrested me and They seized all of the

326
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:50,078
cash and you know that was uh that My

327
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:52,759
First Federal conviction wow actually my

328
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:55,278
first and only Federal conviction yeah

329
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:57,440
and then we had Rick who uh was loading

330
00:13:55,278 --> 00:14:00,559
H how many pounds per load would you

331
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,800
guys take typically at the end yeah I me

332
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:04,838
in the in the beginning and then at the

333
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:07,879
end in the beginning um I guess the the

334
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:10,880
first load I did was

335
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:10,879
um

336
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,959
450 on in the SE plan yeah I said

337
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:18,959
something to my brother I said Hey

338
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:21,599
listen we we should definitely get our

339
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:23,719
own

340
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,560
transportation because we were having

341
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,480
problems with the we did like two or

342
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:30,000
three deals with the with the with the

343
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,839
SE planes mhm

344
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,320
and the guy

345
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:37,519
um he stepped he stepped to my

346
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,040
friend when we wereing around and he

347
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,000
said Hey listen I don't want you know I

348
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:44,759
don't want to work with these guys and

349
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,399
and uh I want to do something with just

350
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:49,240
me you know me and you and the guy says

351
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:52,078
oh no we can't do nothing with

352
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:55,198
you you can't ever even you can't even

353
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:57,479
ever work for thees again for trying to

354
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:59,159
go behind their back this this is my

355
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:02,519
Colombian buddy you know this guy was

356
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:05,240
like with me yeah and that was the end

357
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:07,399
of that and there was two or three

358
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,120
people to triy that you know you take

359
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:12,078
them from New York you bring them down

360
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,560
there you show them the whole deal and

361
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:15,319
then they go down there by themselves

362
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:17,278
they think they can they think they can

363
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,759
C they think they can repeat it right

364
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:21,600
because they got some cash but I don't

365
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:24,639
know if you know Colombian people are

366
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,800
very loyal yeah very very loyal once

367
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,839
they hook with somebody and they see

368
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:31,439
that you're a family type of person and

369
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:34,240
you're you're about making money and

370
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,000
making sure that everybody's safe

371
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,240
there's no way that they're leaving you

372
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,278
yeah it's interesting over the years

373
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:42,120
I've had my experiences with that too

374
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:43,759
but at the end I was bringing you know

375
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:48,399
like

376
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:50,159
22,000 we'd load on a dc6 wow DC4 yeah

377
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,839
pretty amazing yeah two you know like

378
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:55,078
two half tractor trailers before we we

379
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:59,759
load the trailers with uh you know half

380
00:15:55,078 --> 00:16:01,078
weed and half uh plants yeah the back

381
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,519
part of the trailer would be loaded with

382
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:05,479
plants front part of the trailer would

383
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:09,159
be loaded with weed about 10

384
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:15,199
tons actually like 10,000 pounds in the

385
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:17,000
front of both of them wow wild oh yeah I

386
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:20,278
mean they were just like you know these

387
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,278
incredible like modern-day pirate Heroes

388
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:25,399
man who were like making it through all

389
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:29,120
the radar beating the Coast Guard

390
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:31,198
beating the US Army yeah um uh and doing

391
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,600
these incredible incredible and the weed

392
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:35,919
was just you know it was extraordinary I

393
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,040
was I was buying probably some of the

394
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:42,519
weed that Richard smuggled into New York

395
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:45,120
and it was uh I paid $350 a pound for it

396
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:48,318
which was $200 a pound more than I was

397
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,440
paying for Mexican wheed at the time wow

398
00:16:48,318 --> 00:16:53,759
um and it was this just extraordinarily

399
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,680
light gold and when I say gold it was

400
00:16:53,759 --> 00:17:00,199
like the gold and the logo on your cap

401
00:16:56,679 --> 00:17:04,159
right um with these dark dark seeds in

402
00:17:00,198 --> 00:17:08,359
it and just a turpine profile this

403
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,959
piny joyous amazing tarpine profile it

404
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:12,279
was just some of the very best wheat

405
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:14,000
that I've ever ever smoked strong I mean

406
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:16,038
I haven't experienced true Colombian

407
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,359
gold ever my life I've smoked Colombian

408
00:17:16,038 --> 00:17:20,798
genetics smoke Santa Marty gold I've

409
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:24,399
seen some really amazing stuff down

410
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:27,439
there um and the effect is always really

411
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,759
strong yeah I've smoked the the genetics

412
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,960
to the claim that they're the real Sant

413
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:36,079
Marta gold but I smoked the real Sant

414
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:39,079
Marta gold and um maybe those genetics

415
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:40,879
are the same right but there was a

416
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:43,839
method of harvesting and a method of

417
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,760
curing that has unfortunately been lost

418
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:47,959
right the way they dried it and the way

419
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:49,798
they cured it exactly that was a very

420
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:54,400
important part of the deal with the gold

421
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:57,558
too on how you dried it and prepared it

422
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:00,480
yeah so that sadly has been has been

423
00:17:57,558 --> 00:18:03,000
lost uh um so it's going to take some

424
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,599
enterprising uh creative young people

425
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,720
I'm sure they're already working on it

426
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:09,079
and I've met some of them in Colombia

427
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,640
who are working to figure out how to

428
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:13,960
bring that that type of cannabis back

429
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:16,960
again so nice if it was done once it can

430
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:19,120
be done again um re what is it Reland

431
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,919
racing the world Reland racing the world

432
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:24,079
yeah geoc climatizing the world geoc

433
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,720
climatizing the world man I love that

434
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:28,839
concept of yours I think it's just so so

435
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,919
beautiful yeah I think we need to go

436
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:33,119
back to the roots you know where we came

437
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:35,000
from and add diversity back in I think

438
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:37,119
we shouldn't be afraid of diversity I

439
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,480
think especially with cannabis the

440
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:40,959
problem with uh what's going on now is

441
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,159
we're bottlenecking all these things

442
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,120
people like gelato it's very popular

443
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:47,679
everybody knows gelato but uh we get

444
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:49,279
these guys crossing a gelato with the

445
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,640
gelato and they're genetically they're

446
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:52,960
almost identical and so what you're

447
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:56,120
doing is actually taking away from the

448
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:59,400
genetics taking away from the Vigor and

449
00:18:56,119 --> 00:19:01,000
uh we need to incorporate and and not be

450
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,798
afraid to incorporate other things that

451
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,839
might not be popular for a little while

452
00:19:03,798 --> 00:19:08,879
and listen to the plant right so the the

453
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:10,959
plant is incredible because you can put

454
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,559
her anywhere in the world and within a

455
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,400
few Generations she will acclimatize

456
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:18,960
herself to that particular microclimate

457
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,080
and start producing more optimal

458
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,038
expressions of of of that genetic

459
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:26,319
underlying genetic material in in a way

460
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:28,319
that is much more rapid and and and

461
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:31,200
efficient than most other plants around

462
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:34,678
around the world so the the the plant

463
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:37,640
herself is calling upon us to plant her

464
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:40,000
in different places to see what happens

465
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,840
and to honor and respect uh each of

466
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,400
those varieties so you know one of the

467
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:48,158
things we always tried to do at

468
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:50,919
Harborside was to create an ongoing role

469
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:53,559
for the small grower and and

470
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:54,960
particularly for sungrown Growers and so

471
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:56,798
you know one of the things that's still

472
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,120
being worked on in California but I

473
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:01,319
think should be a feature of the

474
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:02,918
Cannabis industry globally is

475
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:05,240
Appalachians just like you have

476
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:06,640
Appalachians of origin for wine and for

477
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,480
some types of cheese and other

478
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,840
agricultural products we need that for

479
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,400
cannabis and appalachi of origin that

480
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:16,240
you know require the seeds to be

481
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,120
actually grown in the soil and

482
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,159
underneath the sun of that particular

483
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:23,239
microclimate yeah and it doesn't matter

484
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:25,120
what the genetics are you could take

485
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:29,120
something and grow it in one place you

486
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:30,359
can go sometimes as as little as 5 miles

487
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:33,439
and get a completely different

488
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:35,079
expression you can go a th000 miles and

489
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,038
you wouldn't even recognize it as the

490
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:39,158
same thing you that's and that's the

491
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:42,079
beauty of the plant and you know it it's

492
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:46,200
all these environmental variables add

493
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:48,599
to not only the story but the amazing

494
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:51,440
qualities you know and it's very you can

495
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:52,759
get these unique expressions and some

496
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,440
stuff is meant to be grown in the

497
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:57,759
highlands and some stuff is meant to be

498
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:59,400
grown Coastal and you know I I big on

499
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:00,759
explor exploring what should be grown

500
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,200
where and with all these different

501
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:05,359
genetic lines being able to go test out

502
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,360
in these places and see what does better

503
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:10,599
in what place and you know I think

504
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:13,079
that's the beauty of it too it seems

505
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:14,278
like the islands like the the Hawaiian

506
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:16,918
Islands

507
00:21:14,278 --> 00:21:18,440
yep they would rather the plants would

508
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:20,600
rather grow on the

509
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:24,278
ground than

510
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:26,519
inside in other words inside grows I

511
00:21:24,278 --> 00:21:28,400
didn't see one there I didn't see one

512
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:30,119
inside grow all the time I was there and

513
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,559
I've seen three different

514
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:34,599
grows yeah I mean let's be clear about

515
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:36,480
why we started growing weed indoors we

516
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:38,639
started growing weed indoors because the

517
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,880
government started sending helicopters

518
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,278
and found our outdoor fart was it it

519
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,919
wasn't because we thought we were going

520
00:21:42,278 --> 00:21:47,240
to grow much better weed in first in

521
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:50,440
fact that was contrary to the hippie

522
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:53,440
ethic of doing things as naturally as as

523
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:56,120
we possibly could and the actual real

524
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,400
reality is that you will never no matter

525
00:21:56,119 --> 00:22:00,479
what light is created be able to to get

526
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,200
the kind of fullness of turpine

527
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:06,000
expression that you can get under the

528
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,720
Sun from an artificial light it's just

529
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,278
not going to happen right right so I

530
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,558
think that uh that that that that we

531
00:22:11,278 --> 00:22:15,480
were right then right and and that

532
00:22:13,558 --> 00:22:17,519
moving forward this is why Appalachians

533
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:20,079
are so important right that once we

534
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:23,918
really do go through this process of

535
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:27,480
Reland racing and and and and Geo

536
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:29,919
climatizing geoc climatizing strains for

537
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:32,798
the IDE microclimates and then

538
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,559
protecting them with Appalachians y

539
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:36,879
that's going to be the most desirable

540
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:39,200
weed not some weed that was grown in a

541
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,960
grow room that you could grow that exact

542
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,159
same weed with that exact same

543
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,360
expression anywhere in the world no

544
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:46,799
optimizing those environments with you

545
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:48,479
optimizing the cannabis for those

546
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:51,400
environments and finding out what works

547
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,919
the best and you know and exploring

548
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:56,278
those you know those those uh those

549
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:58,440
paths with different genetics and really

550
00:22:56,278 --> 00:23:00,759
see what performs best in what region

551
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,679
and you know there there and there's

552
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:05,720
there's a lot of mystery there there's a

553
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:08,679
lot of mystery to be found and you know

554
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:10,159
it's it's amazing because all the

555
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:14,440
genetics we're working with came from

556
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:15,840
six things you know the six six regions

557
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,278
so basically everything that we have

558
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:19,879
that we're smoking today the modern

559
00:23:17,278 --> 00:23:23,240
cannabis pretty much came from these six

560
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:26,039
plants or six regions I I would imagine

561
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:28,240
that there are parts of this globe uh

562
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:29,798
that have um that have been very

563
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,919
difficult to get to because of civil

564
00:23:29,798 --> 00:23:35,200
conflict and other reasons where there

565
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:37,520
are still other basic building block

566
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,038
varieties of cannabis yet to be found

567
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:41,960
for sure infinite fun right Mother

568
00:23:40,038 --> 00:23:44,480
Nature was so wise and generous with

569
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:47,240
this plant there are so many different

570
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:50,240
possible combinations of cannaboids and

571
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,720
Turpin and flavonoids that it's just

572
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,120
this Treasure Chest that we're going to

573
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,558
be opening up and playing with both from

574
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:58,399
a spiritual point of view and a

575
00:23:55,558 --> 00:24:01,200
pharmaceutical point of view yeah for as

576
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:05,320
long as I can imagine into the future

577
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:08,159
talking about cannabis right tell me how

578
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:13,399
cannabis benefited your life it made me

579
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:16,720
feel wonderful yeah it paid my bills M

580
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:20,798
it's going to grow my my name delicioso

581
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:24,919
on on my uh incorporation I think is

582
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:26,599
just going to grow incredibly fast now

583
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:28,960
because I think people are

584
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:32,519
realizing that people that put the work

585
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:35,038
in before it was just you know you could

586
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:37,558
come with money and do it now right you

587
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:40,278
know we we set the groundwork and we we

588
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:43,038
we made sure that when we did it that it

589
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:46,720
was going to stay around we didn't we

590
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:47,720
didn't do it just for the moment we did

591
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,960
it

592
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:52,440
forever yeah and I'll be doing this till

593
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,960
I die you know this is my thing this is

594
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,960
what you were meant to do you know I was

595
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,919
meant to do this like you know cowboys

596
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:00,360
were meant to be Gunslingers and all

597
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,880
that stuff I I was meant to be a

598
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:06,000
Smuggler it was it was it was it was

599
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,120
part of my bloodline that my grandfather

600
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,200
was a

601
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:13,038
bootlegger my

602
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:15,480
father worked for my grandfather so if

603
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:18,679
you look down to generation to

604
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:20,120
generation someone in my father's family

605
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:22,798
was going to

606
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:25,038
be not

607
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:27,798
legitimate and that was that happened to

608
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:30,398
be me and I was I've been doing this

609
00:25:27,798 --> 00:25:34,079
since I was like I guess

610
00:25:30,398 --> 00:25:37,479
14 you know it had was 14 I was 14 years

611
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:40,119
old and and I was in the business big

612
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:43,079
time by the time I was 18 four years

613
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:46,079
later I was you know driving like brand

614
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:48,960
new cars and you know beautiful

615
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:52,839
Apartments yeah and no one knew where

616
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:54,759
were I was So Undercover they were like

617
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:56,558
how is this guy got two motorcycles you

618
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:59,519
know a Holly and a Triumph you know

619
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:02,079
brand new you know it was

620
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:05,759
crazy but it was it was like a it was

621
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:08,038
like just a smooth you know it was

622
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:09,519
like I could give someone a million

623
00:26:08,038 --> 00:26:10,919
dollars worth of weed and shake their

624
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:12,240
hand and say man I'll see you in two

625
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:17,120
weeks they didn't have to give me

626
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,120
anything just drop I drop off like

627
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:22,839
18,000 and 18,000 would be over a

628
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:24,519
million probably you know what I mean

629
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:27,678
but I would just shake the hand and that

630
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:30,000
was that today it's like you know you

631
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:33,200
can't do that no more it's not it's not

632
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,759
possible Right unless you're with with

633
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,640
people that you grew up with like you

634
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:40,398
said yesterday I'm with my friends that

635
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:42,200
I grew up with yeah the only people that

636
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:44,798
I could really trust is the people that

637
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:47,480
I grew up with and and some great people

638
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:50,558
like I met now like Steve and people

639
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:53,000
like you that I don't you know they know

640
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:55,798
they know that they know I ain't saying

641
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,759
anything MH if a cop grabs me and tells

642
00:26:55,798 --> 00:26:59,720
me yeah you know you're going to get get

643
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:01,640
80 years but I'm going to give you two

644
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:04,360
if you just tell me about the guy down

645
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:05,720
the street I tell him hey man you go

646
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:08,519
talk to the guy down the street you

647
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:10,399
don't talk to me about him right that's

648
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:13,158
the way everybody's get in trouble now

649
00:27:10,398 --> 00:27:15,000
it's they just give up people you know

650
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:18,039
they don't know what they're what

651
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,319
they're involved in you know I always

652
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:21,440
sat my guys down before we did a deal I

653
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:23,879
said you know I'm going to go do this

654
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,038
deal now you guys are going to make you

655
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,000
know you're going to all load the plane

656
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:30,000
you're all going to make 25 grand for

657
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,679
half out work or 50 grand for half hour

658
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,798
work but there's a consequence if you

659
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:37,278
get caught you're going to jail right

660
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:39,679
and you got to keep your Mount shut but

661
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:42,319
obviously a lot of people don't do that

662
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:46,240
especially people from South Florida

663
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:48,480
yeah well I was shocked I mean after

664
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,000
spending the first 30 years of my

665
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,960
cannabis career in the Legacy Market

666
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,960
where you

667
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:59,079
know routinely millions and millions of

668
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:01,278
dollars traded on a handshake and yeah

669
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:04,918
occasionally things went sideways people

670
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:07,398
went bad on you it it happened right but

671
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:09,600
usually it was rare that people went

672
00:28:07,398 --> 00:28:11,359
into a deal with you like that with the

673
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:12,918
intention of ripping you off it was

674
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:15,158
usually because something happened to

675
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:18,080
them and and there was a Cascade of

676
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:20,600
consequences right so I was really

677
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:22,960
shocked when I started sitting down and

678
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:25,319
doing mainstream business and actually

679
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,200
having written contracts right oh those

680
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:29,200
guys are the worst well see I thought

681
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,440
that the contract was actually this

682
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,080
attempt to come to a mutual agreement

683
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,919
where everybody would understand what

684
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:36,759
the terms were and it would be very

685
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:39,440
clear with each other so that you would

686
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:41,640
avoid conflict right then I learned that

687
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,200
there's this whole Cadre of mainstream

688
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:46,440
business that writes contracts

689
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,278
deliberately so that they can set you up

690
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,679
to be screwed a little bit later down

691
00:28:48,278 --> 00:28:53,079
the line and they use the most

692
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:55,399
obfuscating confusing unclear kind of

693
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:57,678
language as they possibly can and then

694
00:28:55,398 --> 00:29:00,359
rely on the courts to enforce some kind

695
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,960
of unfair deal right and I was just like

696
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:04,319
I was shocked that people would choose

697
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:06,319
to spend their lives that way it's like

698
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:08,240
when you could do business honestly with

699
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:09,879
people and shake their hands and find

700
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,159
good about it why are you going to spend

701
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:15,200
your time writing up all these [ __ ]

702
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:18,640
contracts designed to cheat people right

703
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:20,120
was just well and now nowadays you want

704
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,000
to work with people that you could do a

705
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:25,879
handshakes deal and you need a contract

706
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,558
it's like CU it's just it's there's a

707
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,960
lot of Bad actors out there and a lot

708
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:33,000
bad people you know and it's people that

709
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:35,640
are in it for the wrong reasons I think

710
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,200
when it was more dangerous and there was

711
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:40,840
more consequences on the legal side

712
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,120
there was a different crowd of people

713
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:45,678
you had to have some balls it wasn't

714
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:47,518
about how good is your lawyer it was

715
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:50,759
like okay we're going to commit to doing

716
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:52,440
something we're going to do it a and now

717
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:54,599
if you got money you could pay to play

718
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,200
it's a pay to play sort of thing and

719
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:58,000
people don't realize the importance of

720
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:00,440
quality that's another issue issue with

721
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,839
the industry today and I think you guys

722
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:05,798
both understand quality uh and stepen

723
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:08,199
harbor side had some amazing quality for

724
00:30:05,798 --> 00:30:09,720
those of you that have seen the harbor

725
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,360
side of today it's not the harbor side

726
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:15,000
that I grew up knowing the harbor side I

727
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:16,839
grew up knowing was the placees set the

728
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,079
standard for clones if you wanted good

729
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:22,439
clones Harbor Side had the best clones

730
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:24,759
they had the best quality dark heart

731
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:26,919
originally darkart had the best clones

732
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:28,919
you know and harbor side they they sold

733
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:31,320
darkart clones but you would take them

734
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:32,679
and they were Picture Perfect clones and

735
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:34,678
they had perfect roots and you guys

736
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:36,038
would reject tons of stuff but I

737
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:38,120
remember going to harbor side and it's

738
00:30:36,038 --> 00:30:39,679
like if you wanted flower they had all

739
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:41,518
different tiers of flower but the top

740
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:44,200
shelf back in the day you wanted some

741
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:47,558
chem 91 some sage and sour you wanted

742
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:49,440
some good topshelf flow it was available

743
00:30:47,558 --> 00:30:50,678
there and the stuff was better on

744
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,519
average than you could find in most

745
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:56,399
dispensaries in California today most uh

746
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:58,278
results flow out of intention right and

747
00:30:56,398 --> 00:31:01,239
Our intention was was to create a temple

748
00:30:58,278 --> 00:31:03,480
for cannabis and a community space for

749
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:05,720
people who loved cannabis and yeah you

750
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:08,360
know we found oursel in this very

751
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:10,038
fortunate place in California where it

752
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:12,038
was you know still a gray Market it

753
00:31:10,038 --> 00:31:14,398
wasn't fully legal by law it was

754
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:16,240
nonprofit so the big corporations didn't

755
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:18,638
want to come in and we had this

756
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:21,278
breathing room and we created this

757
00:31:18,638 --> 00:31:23,398
really amazing system right um there

758
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:26,119
nobody made intergenerational wealth or

759
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:30,518
not very many people right but everybody

760
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:33,038
in that system from 1996 until 2018 was

761
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:34,638
taking care of farmers could afford to

762
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:37,200
buy the land they were growing on and

763
00:31:34,638 --> 00:31:39,119
send their kids to school patients could

764
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,600
come into dispensaries and get the very

765
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:42,918
best weed in the world at really

766
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:45,599
affordable prices yeah people who worked

767
00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:47,399
in dispensaries had the best jobs that

768
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:50,398
that they'd ever had in their lives

769
00:31:47,398 --> 00:31:53,000
right um everybody was well taken care

770
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:55,199
of uh in that system I mean there was

771
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,638
counties in the Emerald Triangle that

772
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,639
their whole economy was based on cannab

773
00:31:57,638 --> 00:32:02,079
M you know the whole economy all of it

774
00:32:00,638 --> 00:32:07,000
everything you know if you lived up

775
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:09,720
there if you didn't participate your

776
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,398
spouse your neighbor the kids you went

777
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,759
to school with their parents did I mean

778
00:32:11,398 --> 00:32:14,918
it it you know was such a big deal and

779
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:16,558
now that's kind of changed

780
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:18,519
unfortunately because a lot of those

781
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:20,960
people were the ones that helped build

782
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:23,960
the industry as it is today you know

783
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,278
guys like Richard we got the cultivators

784
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:29,038
you know I think I've done my part you

785
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:31,679
know I've been around since the 90s and

786
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:33,319
very passionate about cannabis but you

787
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:37,639
know and it's it's a group effort from

788
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:39,079
so many people in so many directions and

789
00:32:37,638 --> 00:32:41,918
you know we were we were at dinner last

790
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:44,439
night talking about how tough times are

791
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:46,200
and how you know for for me it's all

792
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:48,000
about being grateful for where we're at

793
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:51,440
and what we have and if you start

794
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,159
getting too caught up on the bad part

795
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,440
you you forget how you know we're living

796
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:58,960
in a time that weed is marijuana is

797
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:01,038
legal we can yeah it's pretty much legal

798
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,600
federally whatever but you can go on the

799
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:04,679
joint you smoke a joint on the street

800
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:08,119
and they're not going to give you [ __ ]

801
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:10,559
for it too too often um you're not going

802
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:15,000
to get locked up over a joint that's for

803
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:17,759
sure what's this incredible uh in my

804
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:21,558
opinion spiritual Revolution that we're

805
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:24,240
undergoing now where literally hundreds

806
00:33:21,558 --> 00:33:26,200
of millions of people all around the

807
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,679
world have been called into

808
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:31,519
conversations with this plant yeah and

809
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:33,798
out of those conversations we have uh

810
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:36,319
learned the same lessons and out of

811
00:33:33,798 --> 00:33:38,119
those lessons we've built a common value

812
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:40,158
system right so wherever we are in the

813
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:42,719
world we value creativity over

814
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:45,200
Conformity we value individual Freedom

815
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,759
over submission to Authority we value

816
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,440
nature over industry we value peace over

817
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:52,679
War we value love over hate we believe

818
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,880
that every living creature and and every

819
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:57,240
inanimate object made by Nature has a

820
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,639
place and a purpose in this world and

821
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:02,000
that's who we are whatever language we

822
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:04,599
speak whatever race we are whatever

823
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,599
religion we follow around the world uh

824
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:12,519
plant people follow that same path and

825
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:14,960
so uh it's this incredible time um where

826
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:17,280
we now have the opportunity to introduce

827
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:20,000
ourselves to each other yeah and think

828
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,519
about it it's like we've all been called

829
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,280
we've all been called by the same plan

830
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:28,358
what she want us to

831
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:31,079
do yeah and if you listen the plan tell

832
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:34,679
you slel put you in the right direction

833
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:37,039
if you listen this is the reason that

834
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:40,119
governments and religions are so

835
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:42,279
terribly terrified of cannabis because

836
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:44,639
when we engage with that can that

837
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:47,639
conversation with cannabis it is a

838
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:51,000
direct conduit to Mother Nature it is a

839
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:53,639
direct conduit to the Divine and the

840
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,559
messages that we receive from Mother

841
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:58,960
Nature from the Divine carry a greater

842
00:34:56,559 --> 00:35:02,320
author Authority than any man-made

843
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:05,559
Authority will ever have and this is why

844
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:09,160
uh authoritarians have always been so

845
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:11,199
hostile towards cannbis yeah so you've

846
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:13,598
been in Hawaii lately we were talking

847
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:16,439
about Hawaiian weed a little

848
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:20,559
bit how how's it over in Hawaii do

849
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:23,079
Hawaii is like my son lives in Amsterdam

850
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:24,719
yeah so when he moved to Hawaii I said

851
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:29,839
to him

852
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:34,118
um well how'd he like it he said dad I

853
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:35,679
moved from the swamp to Paradise yeah

854
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:37,599
and you know I've been to Hawaii a few

855
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:39,838
times I spent some time there I lived

856
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:44,039

857
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:47,719
months um I never did any time in my and

858

Maui but this time you know he wanted to

859
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:52,598
make sure that I seen most of the the

860
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:55,639
great things that it offers the the

861
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:58,440

a certain amount of time to clean it CU

868
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:19,560
I had to come to California you know we

quite an experience aai this time it it

877
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:42,480
was a whole new deal for me when you

878
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,920
said you saw some Sour Diesel there that

879
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,920

880
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:51,879
good wow purple purple Sour Diesel the

881
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:55,159

00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:56,838
lifted the leaf up I said holy cow yeah

883
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:58,559
I said I want some of this right now I

884
00:36:56,838 --> 00:37:03,000
said well you know won't be ready for a

885
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:04,880
little while yeah but um I wound up

886
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,440
getting a few things from him before I

887
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,800

he's over there you know what happened

890
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:17,719
was I'm there right and I'm talking to

891
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:20,078
my friends and they're like hey Maui W

892
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:22,318
is so I said don't worry I'll bring

893
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:25,519
something back for you guys you know

894
00:37:22,318 --> 00:37:28,119
yeah so interesting enough I got Maui

895
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:29,639
wow when I was in my probably 16 years

896
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:31,720
old or something like that and we got

897
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:34,039
this Maui woi that came in and it was

898
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:36,480
velvety it was lime green and it was

899
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:39,079
velvety like spongy velvety but it was

900
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,079
part of the texture and this stuff was

901
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:44,280
amazing it was it definitely would lift

902
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:45,480
you up and the effect is what I remember

903
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,000
the most I don't really remember how it

904
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,159
tasted but I remember the way it looked

905
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,960
cuz it was like remember super sticky it

906
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:52,879
was it was super sticky yeah it was

907
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,838
super sticky I don't really remember the

908
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,599
smell though but I do remember the way

909
00:37:54,838 --> 00:37:58,519
it made me feel and it was super super

910
00:37:56,599 --> 00:38:01,240
super uplifting it was strong but

911
00:37:58,519 --> 00:38:05,559
uplifting yeah it was it's a happy weed

912
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:08,399
yeah the very first um what we called

913
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:11,358
then cmia the very first domestically

914
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:14,000
grown weed that was good as opposed to

915
00:38:11,358 --> 00:38:17,078
what we used to call groes or homegrown

916
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,519
which was really really badly grown weed

917
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:22,920
in the beginning um was in 1974 in New

918
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:25,199
York City when uh I bought a pound of

919
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:28,599
Mali W for

920
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:31,279
$1,200 and and again it was like this

921
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:34,440
incredible sticker shock right because

922
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:37,560
like I was used to paying 300 or 350 for

923
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:40,000
the Colombians is like $1,200 for a

924
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:42,279
pound of wheat it's like I don't care

925
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,519
how good this wheat is I'm not paying

926
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:47,440
$1,200 a pound for it and then the pound

927
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:51,000
was put in front of me and of course I

928
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:52,400
did end up buying it yeah yeah New York

929
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,079
has always been Infamous for the

930
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,079
expensive Town prices well and it's

931
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:58,839
playing a role in in what's happening in

932
00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:01,480
New York right now and the the

933
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:03,039
difficulty of uh of getting a workable

934
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:05,039
legal system in New York right because

935
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:07,358
New York has always been the place where

936
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:08,679
if you had a load of really good weed

937
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:10,039
you take it to New York because you're

938
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:12,799
going to get top dollar and you're going

939
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:14,960
to turn it fastest oh God you always

940
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,720
good in New York there's no place that

941
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,480
you could move weed like you like you

942
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:22,439
could in in New York so consequently New

943
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:24,199
Yorkers got used to having the best weed

944
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:26,240
in the world and because it was a

945
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:29,199
competitive environment they ended up

946
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:31,519
paying you know high prices but not

947
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:35,118
ridiculous prices for it became very

948
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:37,358
particular consumers and and that whole

949
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:40,640
network that was developed to serve

950
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:43,078
those consumers um is now the Legacy

951
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:47,078
Market in New York and you've got a

952
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:49,280
bunch of um msos who really don't know

953
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:51,480
anything about cannabis who are now

954
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,519
trying to compete with that network with

955
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:56,199
weed that they're growing in New York

956
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:58,880
right and uh it's not going too well for

957
00:39:56,199 --> 00:40:01,279
them so far well most of your weed was

958
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,079
moved in New York right I some in Miami

959
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,720
some other plac but New York was the I

960
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:08,839
didn't sell any any weed in

961
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:10,879
Florida none in Florida none all in New

962
00:40:08,838 --> 00:40:15,159
York it either went to New York or

963
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:18,000
Chicago yeah wow and I used to sell the

964
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:21,440
whole load for 250 a

965
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:24,440
pound you know if you took 18,000 you

966
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,880
pay 250 if you if you're a kid that grew

967
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:29,440
up with me yeah which the he used to

968
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:33,280
take the big load he grew up with me but

969
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:36,400
if say like like my next door neighbor

970
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:39,200
wanted 250 I'd give him I'd give him 250

971
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:41,318
pounds for $250 a pound just because you

972
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:43,000
know right or one of my friends that

973
00:40:41,318 --> 00:40:46,759
might have been a fireman or a cop in

974
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:49,800
New York I'd give them 250 a pound you

975
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:52,599
know yeah well then so your price was

976
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:54,200
what 100 and then you're you're doubling

977
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:57,519

978
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:59,759
2.5x or what was your cost May 30 bucks

979
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:02,679
a pound or something oh not even for it

980

was like it was like yeah $8 a pound or

981
00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:07,279
something when you know cuz yeah we had

982
00:41:05,358 --> 00:41:09,279
to just figure we had to figure the guy

983
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,440
you know the planter the guy that's

984
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:14,280
watching it sure that's how we figured

985
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:18,159
it we didn't we just figured well it's

986
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:22,040
going to cost to grow this

987
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:25,239
field it's going to cost us 20 grand

988
00:41:22,039 --> 00:41:28,599
yeah all right that

989
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:31,959
fields 30,000 pound

990
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:33,280
field I mean it's deep and long you know

991
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:37,318
I

992
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:38,960
mean yes so when when you break it down

993
00:41:37,318 --> 00:41:41,480
if you're getting

994
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,000
30,000 and you're only paying 20 grand

995
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:44,760
what do you actually paying for each

996
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,800
pound you know what I mean if you break

997
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:50,359
it down all the way it's like it was

998
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:52,240
peanuts sure it was like Pennies on a

999
00:41:50,358 --> 00:41:54,960
dollar like type of thing you know you

1000
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:56,759
pay more money to to bribe the people

1001
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,039
they need to bribe to get the load out

1002
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,599
of the then you paid for the week

1003
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:03,480
sometimes it used to cost me 30 grand

1004
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:05,400
just to get out to the desert well you

1005
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:08,240
I'd be driving along and there'd be

1006
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:11,039
there'd be an army stop I jump out of

1007
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:14,199
the truck with a shoe box for 500

00:44:12,039 --> 00:44:17,000
an airplane and send down there book

1054
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:20,880
presses yeah book presses wow I would I

1055
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,318
would do like they were this long yep

1056
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,000
you know there the regular Colombian

1057
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:30,079
Bells were like that and about that high

1058
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:32,760
right but they were that long about that

1059
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:36,920
high I guess about yeah about that high

1060
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:40,040
that was 20 PBS H

1061
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:41,760
pressed and then I wrapped them i'

1062
00:44:40,039 --> 00:44:44,159
wrapped them differently you know they'd

1063
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,720
be wrapped in brown paper with little

1064
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:47,838
plastic around them and it'd be stacked

1065
00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:52,799
into the bur up bags yeah and it would

1066
00:44:47,838 --> 00:44:55,480
be like perfectly you know the Bap size

1067
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,440
yeah in Mexico we used to we had build

1068
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:59,240
boxes is right of the size that we

1069
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:02,039
wanted the Bales to be and then we'd use

1070
00:44:59,239 --> 00:45:04,639
Auto Jacks and put the Jacks in and then

1071
00:45:02,039 --> 00:45:07,358
um use hydraulic jacks to press the the

1072
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:09,719
weed wild into it and then and then do

1073
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:12,558
the and then do the wrapping and the

1074
00:45:09,719 --> 00:45:14,199
price of the weed but that that or at

1075
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:16,800
least you know I would take the same

1076
00:45:14,199 --> 00:45:20,039
weed and I would press it in three

1077
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:21,519
different levels of pressing and they

1078
00:45:20,039 --> 00:45:23,440
would end up selling it at three

1079
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:25,440
different prices so like the pillow

1080
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:27,400
press was just like barely compressed

1081
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,159
the buds were still really really nice

1082
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:32,119
but took up a lot of space in the

1083
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:33,799
vehicle so the price was higher and then

1084
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:36,640
you could like compress it down and get

1085
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:38,480
it to like half of that size right um or

1086
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:40,199
you could just smash the [ __ ] out of it

1087
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,838
and get it down that was that was the

1088
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:45,838
problem with the Jamaican whenever you

1089
00:45:42,838 --> 00:45:48,119
got your Mak it was never pressed it was

1090
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:51,558
loose in the Bell you know it was Bell

1091
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:52,400
stuffed with by hand wow so a bell like

1092
00:45:51,559 --> 00:45:56,480
this

1093
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:58,838
big was like 40 45 PBS

1094
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:01,039
H ha off

1095
00:45:58,838 --> 00:46:04,639
yeah but the quality of the Jamaican

1096
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:06,119
stuff was really good or no really so J

1097
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:08,679
so if you had to rate the different

1098
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:11,160
regions how would you rate the the top

1099
00:46:08,679 --> 00:46:14,199
Colombian being the top Tai would be the

1100
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:18,239
top Tai would be the top then Colombian

1101
00:46:14,199 --> 00:46:20,480
okay then depending on the era Jamaican

1102
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:22,078
or Mexican in the beginning there was a

1103
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,240
time when there was good Jamaican that

1104
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:27,280
was better than most of the Mexican but

1105
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:29,199
over time the Mexican got much better at

1106
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:32,079
at growing good weed while the Jamaicans

1107
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:35,399
kind of stagnated well Jamaicans have

1108
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:38,359
improved they have improved but but but

1109
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:40,240
still um most people I know who go to

1110
00:46:38,358 --> 00:46:42,400
Jamaica bring their own weed with them

1111
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:45,078
the the oriental people in Jamaica are

1112
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:48,160
the ones that got the weed up in you

1113
00:46:45,079 --> 00:46:51,920
know they got the quality to weed up H

1114
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:53,799
mostly Chinese people growing it there's

1115
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,960
there's the thing the cool thing about

1116
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:57,920
Jamaica is it's it's you know usually

1117
00:46:55,960 --> 00:47:00,519
thought of is just this black nation

1118
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:02,559
right but it actually you know has all

1119
00:47:00,519 --> 00:47:05,440
different kinds of cultural strains from

1120
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:08,040
all over the place and uh and and most

1121
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:11,200
of them have dabbled in in cannabis here

1122
00:47:08,039 --> 00:47:13,119
and there in one way or or another so

1123
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:16,199
yeah I mean that the all around the

1124
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:18,280
world the quality of cannabis is is

1125
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:21,519
increasing right because the knowledge

1126
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:23,760
is more freely available now and I mean

1127
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:26,079
there are you know there's lots of

1128
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,000
Jamaican farmers who would you know love

1129
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:30,079
to be visited by some good American

1130
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,199
Growers and and and and have some

1131
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:35,800
lessons and put them to to good use this

1132
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:38,598
is a really interesting time globally

1133
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:40,200
let me jump back to the cppy yeah let's

1134
00:47:38,599 --> 00:47:41,640
talk about the cppy a little bit yeah

1135
00:47:40,199 --> 00:47:44,799
yeah so what's your experience with the

1136
00:47:41,639 --> 00:47:46,358
crippy so I I and I I I don't even know

1137
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:49,720
if it's the same thing we're talking

1138
00:47:46,358 --> 00:47:52,558
about right but in Colombia right there

1139
00:47:49,719 --> 00:47:53,838
is a region in Colombia where most of

1140
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:55,760
where there's a huge amount of

1141
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:58,358
commercial weed production that's still

1142
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:00,880
still going on right uh there's a

1143
00:47:58,358 --> 00:48:04,119
village called Toria which is one of the

1144
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:08,318
the centers of that production and and

1145
00:48:04,119 --> 00:48:12,200
creepy basically is Dutch uh hybrid

1146
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:14,639
indicas right that were brought into a

1147
00:48:12,199 --> 00:48:17,838
jungle environment right where they

1148
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:21,000
never would have naturally adapted right

1149
00:48:17,838 --> 00:48:24,679
um and they are and it's a 1212

1150
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:27,119
environment right so first the the the

1151
00:48:24,679 --> 00:48:29,118
the in order to get the buds to flower

1152
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:31,960
they're vegged under light and then you

1153
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:35,240
turn off the light to get them to start

1154
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:39,519
get them to start flowering but um but

1155
00:48:35,239 --> 00:48:41,439
they lose about half of half to 2/3 uh

1156
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:44,079
to Bud rot before they're able to

1157
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:46,400
harvest it and in order to cure it

1158
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:49,359
because the the the conditions in the

1159
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:51,720
jungle there are so humid in order to

1160
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:54,199
cure it they put it in these ovens these

1161
00:48:51,719 --> 00:48:56,558
gas fired ovens and actually basically

1162
00:48:54,199 --> 00:49:00,439
cook the wheed oh man and then this weed

1163
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:03,839
is shipped to Paraguay Uruguay Brazil

1164
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:06,760
and other markets in in Latin America so

1165
00:49:03,838 --> 00:49:09,798
amongst my Colombian connoisseur

1166
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:12,440
cannabis friends cppy is a is a

1167
00:49:09,798 --> 00:49:15,759
derogatory term not a complimentary term

1168
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:17,880
wow it's interesting yeah and I think

1169
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:20,240
you know they say fire now or whatever

1170
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:23,640
