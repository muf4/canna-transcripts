events are fantastic I really like the

12
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:31,039
concept I think it's thanks man a modern

13
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:32,598
and fresh version of what other people

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,559
have tried to do in the past and I think

15
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:36,199
it works really well with the community

16
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:37,799
especially in the state we're in it gets

17
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,520
everybody together once a month and I

18
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:41,038
love it thank you I mean that's that's

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,840
the goal we just want to have a safe

20
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,879
place for networking and leveling each

21
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,760
other up education is something that we

22
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:49,198
all want to try to find good information

23
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:50,839
from and sources is hard to come by so

24
00:00:49,198 --> 00:00:52,679
I'm I mean that's that's the cool thing

25
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,280
that the people that participate in

26
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:56,640
these panel discussions on whatever

27
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,399
topic uh whatever topic it might be

28
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,079
they're giving us a lot of Great Value

29
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,359
so just continue to grow that that

30
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,920
educational bank is really giving us a a

31
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:06,079
proper platform to really start leveling

32
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,439
each other up and the food is good and

33
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,399

00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,240
you've always had good food so yeah

36
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:13,640
we've had uh a bunch of different

37
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,920
flavors and know we've had we just had

38
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,920
schwarma the other day we had we've had

39
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,640
artisanal Pizza we've had Smash Burgers

40
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,239
so yeah I mean it we definitely have a

41
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,040
good variety yeah there's something to

42
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:25,239
look forward to every month yes so let's

43
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,320
dive into a little bit about your

44
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:30,039
history tell me about the first time you

45
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:31,599
started smoking sure yeah so I was know

46
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,200
I was in Middle School um it was

47
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:35,239
actually kind of funny the first time

48
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,920
that I thought I smoked um one of the

49
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:39,560
homies actually brought oregano to the

50
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,439
party and uh yeah that let's just say

51
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,759
that was not a fun first time experience

52
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:46,758
but um yeah he he definitely didn't make

53
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,680
it back into the circle for those uh in

54
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:52,438
the future but um I actually started

55
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,439
smoking um one of the homies dads had a

56
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:56,398
club card and so he was always coming to

57
00:01:54,438 --> 00:01:57,919
the Oakland shops and you know he he

58
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,560
always had a good stash of like Northern

59
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,920
Lights and Tangi so like real Citrus

60
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,000
forward tur profiles so from the early

61
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,960
on days like I was I was getting some

62
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,598
great flavors and so that's really kind

63
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,280
of what got me into it was you know

64
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,598
Finding uh that we had a consistent

65
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,360
source and you know being an athlete in

66
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:17,039
middle school you know that kind of led

67
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,680
into high school being you know the

68
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,039
athlete plug so you know wanted to smoke

69
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,680
for free so it was a great way to get a

70
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:26,280
zip and you know continue to hold back

71
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,319
that eth and just enjoy it totally yeah

72
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,400
and

73
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:31,318
so back back then what were your

74
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,599
favorite genetics what were the favorite

75
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:35,119
yeah I got to stick you know nl5 was

76
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:36,719
probably the one that really resonates

77
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,239
with me you know that's it's just so

78
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:41,199
nostalgic and you know back then you

79
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,319
know the the other homies plugged like

80
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:45,399
we just had a bunch of you know really

81
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:46,560
nice sticky weed coming through and you

82
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,280
know we don't really know what the

83
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,120
genetics were we just knew that it was s

84
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,519
you know super sticky and it was The

85
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,200
Chronic it was either it was either

86
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,319
chronic or it wasn't yeah we had green

87
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:57,878
and brown yeah and there was you know

88
00:02:55,318 --> 00:03:00,598
yeah The Chronic was definitely yeah

89
00:02:57,878 --> 00:03:02,560

95
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:15,519
of uh it's an affluent area you know so

96

98
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,759
Blue Blue Ribbon School Districts and uh

99
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:22,079
you know shout out to my parents because

100
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:24,199
you know they both came from Mexico

101
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,840
first generation immigrant so we really

102
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:27,878
didn't have much growing up you know so

103
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,799
we were living in San Jose and you know

104
00:03:27,878 --> 00:03:31,359
my dad was a garbage man you know so

105
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:32,760
came to this country with nothing and

106
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,760
started from the bottom attic garbage

107
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:37,079
company and eventually got promoted to

108
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:39,359
be a supervisor so he was able to get us

109
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,120
out of San Jose and moved into Danville

110
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,920
in 1989 yeah Danville is awesome yeah I

111
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,640
can't speak highly enough about Danville

112
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:50,079
uh you know in the you know I grew up 15

113
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:53,359
miles away yeah so 10 10 miles away uh

114
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,680
North and the flower was good the flower

115
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,760

116
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,239
like ' 91 sure but all the flour back

117
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,039
then there was good flour obviously

118
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,039
there was bad fler too but right you

119
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:04,479
know really really some amazing stuff

120
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:06,158
and we had you know being in the Bay

121
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,078
Area we had the widest variety of

122
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:09,840
genetics we did you know you saw the

123
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:11,560
white widows come through you know you

124
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,360
saw the train wrecks like all of the you

125
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,238
know DJ Schwarz blueberry all the

126
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,639
schools all the Cal I mean a lot of the

127
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,159
stuff was created in California but we

128
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:21,079
had a lot of the European stuff too you

129
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,080
know we had the skunks we had real skunk

130
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:25,600
we never called it roadkill skunk that I

131
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:28,478
remember but we had cat piss and that's

132
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,800
a big topic of debate you know but our

133
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:33,719
the Bay Area cat piss was the the real

134
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,439
deal I never I I I don't recall ever

135
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,199
getting a chance to try the capis back

136
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,079
that back in that area but you're right

137
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,360
you know there's there's a lot of uh

138
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:42,800
debate around well is it just some sort

139
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,080
of a profile that happened when it was

140
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,280
sitting in the trunk and you know

141
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:49,359
something happened along the way well I

142
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:51,559
think it's a an aroma yeah so it's hard

143
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,800
to call a genetic cat piss and say I was

144
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,478
the one that created cat piss because I

145
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,840
feel like sometimes flower you know in

146
00:04:55,478 --> 00:04:59,758
breeding you come across stuff that

147
00:04:56,839 --> 00:05:02,000
smells ammonia and people relate the

148
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,639
smell of ammonia to urine right and so

149
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
then we get cat piss and so I've heard

150
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:06,720
about people talking about catpiss back

151
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,360
in the 70s we're doing a little

152
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,039
documentary this year uh on cat piss so

153
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,879
I'm super excited about that I feel like

154
00:05:12,038 --> 00:05:17,240
there's a lot of origin stories people

155
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:19,000
have some great stories to tell um and

156
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,120
verified stories that are verified from

157
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,478
other people as well and yeah I just

158
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,639
reconnected with some of my friends that

159
00:05:23,478 --> 00:05:27,639
uh knew a lot more about the origins of

160
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:28,960
the ciss that we had and so I believe

161
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:30,160
there's different cat pisses I don't

162
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:33,159
think there's

163
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,439
just one one ring to rule them all right

164
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,919
you know so but there's a lot of schmeel

165
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:42,560
out there so yeah it's really

166
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:45,038
interesting so Bay Area High School what

167
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,160
did you play in high school sports yeah

168
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:48,800
I was wrestling in football so you know

169
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,680
one season ended the other one started

170
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,520
so yeah um but it was cool you know I

171
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,280
was Captain of both my teams and you

172
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,839
know that that really instilled a lot of

173
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:57,758
leadership qualities in me at an early

174
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,959
age so I think that was one of the

175
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,520
things that I really enjoyed was people

176
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:03,918
and just really being able to inspire

177
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:05,719
and motivate has has transitioned into

178
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:07,279
my professional career path along all

179
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,400
the different industries that I've

180
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:13,279
worked in from culinary to mortgages to

181
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:15,198
uh commercial Trucking to hospitality

182
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:17,679
and now you know all the way in in

183
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,000
Canabis and and genetics and you know

184
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,840
all of these different things have kind

185
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,199
of led up to some some skill sets that I

186
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:24,719
never would have required if I hadn't

187
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:26,000
tasted a lot of different things so so a

188
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,199
lot of people watching the show know I'm

189
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,639
a chef or the ones that don't know they

190
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:32,520
do and uh you have some culinary history

191
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,478
so let's dive into that real quick yeah

192
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:35,598
so I mean right out of high school I I

193
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,839
knew that I wanted to go into the

194
00:06:35,598 --> 00:06:39,839
culinary program here at DVC and in

195
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:41,638
conquered um that was a thing like

196
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:43,359
growing up in a Mexican household we

197
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:45,079
were always cooking so I was always

198
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,598
helping my parents prep I was always

199
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:48,279
helping like understand what's going on

200
00:06:46,598 --> 00:06:50,439
in the kitchen because I love to eat

201
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:51,719
yeah so that was really inspiring and

202
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:54,120
you know back then there was no Food

203
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,759
Network it was emerald agosi and Yan can

204
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,160
cook right so I wanted to be that next

205
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,598
Emerald Agassi you know just really

206
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,960
having fun whipping up cool flavors and

207
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:03,199
that was a thing like we didn't you know

208
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:05,279
we didn't have much growing up so my mom

209
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,199
was always encouraging us to get

210
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:08,519
creative right open up we don't have

211
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,560
anything to eat we'll open up the fridge

212
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:12,519
and she'll whip up this badass meal so

213
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,240
that was always like okay how can we

214
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:17,120
start to mesh different flavor profiles

215
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,840
so right out of the gate like I didn't

216
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,240
it's not like I was a bad student I just

217
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:22,638
wasn't inspired by school and I think

218
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,439
that was you know part of the reason why

219
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,918
I wanted to jump right into culinary was

220
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:28,439
because I I had this aspiration to have

221
00:07:26,918 --> 00:07:30,918
my own cooking show and just you know

222
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:34,160
really get em embedded into the industry

223
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:35,598
yeah so let's fast forward um I did the

224
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,879
program for about a year and a half I

225
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:39,000
helped somebody open a restaurant that

226
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:41,360
was actually a graduate from the program

227
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,240
and I saw firsthand how opening a

228
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,800
restaurant was and that is not what I

229
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,120
wanted to get into or that wasn't the

230
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,000
life that I wanted I'm I have a lot of

231
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,000
respect for restaurant tours and you

232
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,918
know when you're 19 20 years old and

233
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,158
living that kind of a that kind of a

234
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:57,079
lifestyle it was it was a lot so it

235
00:07:55,158 --> 00:07:58,800
really it opened my eyes to what I

236
00:07:57,079 --> 00:08:00,359
didn't want to do but I learned all

237
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,520
these awesome skill sets along the way

238
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,800
with knife skills and how that you know

239
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:06,318
this the size of a brunoa cut will be

240
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,038
able to actually elaborate on your

241
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,520
pallet as opposed to a Julien or these

242
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:13,399
different type of cuts of of vegetables

243
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,598
so or how important it is to cut your

244
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:18,918
vegetables all the same size 100%

245
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:21,360
uniformity uniformity is huge uh but I

246
00:08:18,918 --> 00:08:24,079
feel like the people in the restaurant

247
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,639
industry can very easily translate into

248
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:28,318
agriculture or cannabis big time uh and

249
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,199
vice versa they're both industries of

250
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,720
passion right they should be driven by

251
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:33,038
Passion otherwise you'll just you're not

252
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,639
going to be able to make it and I feel

253
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:37,879
like the culinary arts it's a young

254
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:39,439
man's career uh you know especially

255
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:41,320
working long hours you work on the line

256
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,000
you can you can do that for a while I

257
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,399
don't think you can do that forever yeah

258
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
some people can I have some friends that

259
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,440
are chefs that have been chefs forever

260
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,799
and they you know they love it and uh

261
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,080
it's a lifestyle too just like is it's a

262
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:54,159
lifestyle exactly you have to be

263
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,920
passionate for what you're doing every

264
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,319
single day and just being happy so I

265
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:58,919
realized that I was unhappy at certain

266
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,600
parts of that career path and then you

267
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:02,159
know it opened my eyes to what again

268
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,360
just tasting things that I know that I

269
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:06,958
don't want to go back to um however I

270
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:09,680
did walk away from that with you know um

271
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,958
a food safety certification like San you

272
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:13,000
know that's where clean behaviors and

273
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:14,838
clean practices have really applied into

274
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,399
the nursery space you know and I think

275
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:19,600
that was really it was a cultural set

276
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:21,600
you know and understanding like there is

277
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,920
uh there's definitely practices within a

278
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,759
nursery environment where you don't want

279
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:26,360
to cross contaminate you know that the

280
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:27,759
vroid is crazy you know pathogenic

281
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,200
pressure is a reality in what we have to

282
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:31,240
deal with today in commercial

283
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,959
cultivation so just you know going

284
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,200
through a room and defoliating going

285
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:36,239
plant to plant whatever was on your

286
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,320
hands just you just contaminated that

287
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,919
next Plant right so it's you know we've

288
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,399
already talked about Vector transmission

289
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:43,519
and you know making sure that you clean

290
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:45,200
your tools properly like ISO does not

291
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,480
clean and sterilize your tools it

292
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,480
stabilizes stabilizes the viroid right

293
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:52,839
so RNA versus DNA you got to properly

294
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:55,200
sanitize that 2% Veron 15 20% bleach 30

295
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:56,959
to 60 seconds scrub and agitate like

296
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,759
there's a whole system so when you're

297
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:00,119
operating at scale like what are these

298
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:02,000
practices is that you're that you're

299
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,159
implementing with your team right so do

300
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,159
you have a set of shears per table do

301
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,639
you have uh you know handwashing

302
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:09,199
stations do you require a team to change

303
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:10,958
gloves before they defoliate from table

304
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,920
to table just things that you know you

305
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,719
should really be cognizant of because

306
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:16,958
it's all about the mother stock right

307
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,879
yeah well and it's all about culture we

308
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:22,518
culture and people you know Sops are a

309
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:24,439
piece of paper you got to get people to

310
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:28,078
actually follow those people the pieces

311
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:29,360
of paper to actually you know Implement

312
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:30,599
everything that you're talking about

313
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,759
trying to get them to do that's the only

314
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,879
way to really do it and you know it's

315
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:35,240
funny because the kitchen is a great

316
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:36,838
place they don't have Sops in the

317
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,879
kitchen they do but they don't call them

318
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:41,480
Sops necessarily we've been using these

319
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,919
things for years exactly so at DVC I

320
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,159
used to judge some of the cooking

321
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:48,759
competitions I was the president of the

322
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:51,759
San Francisco Chef's association in 2008

323
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:54,120
that's cool and so with yeah so I I did

324
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:56,039
a lot of that stuff and we judge over a

325
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,560
DVC and then they had like the

326
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:59,559
gingerbread houses and I'm I'm a big

327
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:01,719
gingerbread house guy

328
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:03,638
um I've made some huge you know six foot

329
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,200
tall gingerbread houses and stuff like

330
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:08,079
that so yeah I mean the culinary

331
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,759
industry was great because again I I I

332
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:12,039
learned a different appreciation for

333
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,799
flavor profiling with food and wine and

334
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:15,838
again that kind of like led into my

335
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:17,359
passion for genetics and how combining

336
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,959
combination of flavors and you know

337
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,159
Finding unique uh combinations like yeah

338
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:24,239
that that was a very instrumental part

339
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:26,360
of my Foundation nice but um but you

340
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,200
know that moved into mortgages right so

341
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,399
we had a we had a mortgage broker that

342
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,680
was always coming into the restaurant

343
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:32,240
every day and you know we chopped it up

344
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:33,958
while I was making his his sandwich or

345
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,240
his Panini or whatever it was going on

346
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:37,319
and he's like yo you should probably you

347
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,039

you want extra you want pesto sauce on

351
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:45,679
this today you know it's just kind of

352
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,120
you know right it was one of those

353
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:48,559
things where I didn't realize like what

354
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,159
was mortgages I didn't understand what

355
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:52,599
he was talking about so um I went by

356
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:54,639
he's like yo I want you to hop on the

357
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,839
phones from you know 5:00 p.m. to 7:00

358
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:59,600
p.m. just cold call like what am I

359
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:01,360
saying and so it was just asking people

360
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,240
if they're looking to refinance and that

361
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,519
was like the Mind map of okay yes well

362
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,560
what are you refinancing for I want I

363
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:10,519
want to lower rate okay well that's the

364
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:12,078
next set of questions and then maybe the

365
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:14,480
other question was well I want to uh

366
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:17,759
debt consolidate okay well next set of

367
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,680
questions I didn't realize that you know

368
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:21,838
solution selling was a thing until I

369
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:23,399
went through and understood how you can

370
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,360
offer Solutions without selling

371
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:27,278
something right so this whole value

372
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,240
proposition based selling or you know

373
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:31,278
consultative approach was something that

374
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,959
I really appreciated because what I

375
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:35,439
learned in cold calling was some will

376
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:37,879
some won't so what next but you're still

377
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,440
saving money with a solution yeah and so

378
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:41,639
that's how you evolved into a Solutions

379
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,800
based company I'm a firm believer of

380
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:45,480
being Solutions based I think you don't

381
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:47,319
need to sell a product if you come up

382
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,879
with a solution you're not you know you

383
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:52,120
showcase what you're doing and what you

384
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:55,679
do best and let your product speak for

385
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:57,839
itself right exactly and that's you know

386
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:00,278
that was a a great learning experience

387
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,839
so you know from mortgages I went into

388
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:03,480
the commercial truck industry you know

389
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,240
after the crash there you know obviously

390
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,839
there was a lot of change happening and

391
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,519
you know I was um I fortunately was able

392
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,720
to sell my house at the time and walk

393
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,919
away without going upside down so you

394
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,480
know I was in a very um I was in a

395
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:17,120
blessed situation again you know my

396
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,240
parents are foundational I've had so

397
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,679
much support from them along the way uh

398
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,759
you know when they retired in like you

399
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:25,120
know mid 2000s right around there uh you

400
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:26,600
know they they pulled some cash out of

401
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,839
the house we lived in in Danville they

402
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,120
moved up to plumis Lake so I assumed

403
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:31,839
their mortgage right cuz I I was

404
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,120
generating income as a loan officer so I

405
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,199
qualified to take on that responsibility

406
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,639
so I was like you know 22 years old with

407
00:13:36,198 --> 00:13:41,919
a mortgage in Danville and so I was I I

408
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:44,519
learned a lot at that stage and so and

409
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:47,519
that $850,000 house is probably worth

410
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:48,720
about 2.5 million right easily yeah so

411
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,919
you know and that was the scary part

412
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,240
it's like oh man you know the market

413
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:54,399
like I was about to go upside down

414
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,440
unfortunately somebody gave us you know

415
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,360
that break even point so we accepted it

416
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,600
walked away started from nothing at that

417
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,959
point so you know I moved up to Northern

418
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,278
California or I'm sorry to Sacramento

419
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,719
and uh you know my brother was an

420
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:07,439
executive with a company called

421
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,120
International uh truck and engine

422
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,160
Corporation and so he was like yo

423
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,600
There's an opportunity up there you

424
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:13,198
should check it out um you'd be

425
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,720
basically be like an assistant to the

426
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:16,719
you know the regional director so I'm

427
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,278
like sure what does that even mean right

428
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,160
so again I I didn't I didn't go to

429
00:14:18,278 --> 00:14:21,799
college I didn't do I didn't get my

430
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,719
degree in anything it was more about

431
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:26,000
finding opportunities that came my way

432
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,600
based on who I was and just you know

433
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,679
putting off Good Vibes and ultimately

434
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,159
that led me to this particular role

435
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:34,239
which was really like an engineering

436
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:36,039
role and so I learned how um specking

437
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,560
out commercial trucks with the chassis

438
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:38,719
and the bodies and the engine and the

439
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:40,479
transmission and all these different

440
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,199
things that go into specific requirement

441
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,759
to um you know applications right the

442
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:47,758
state of California and V Safeway like

443
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,440
that was like our two major accounts so

444
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:51,360
being able to understand how these RFP

445
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,680
processes come through and we have to

446
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,320
spec out a specific model of a truck

447
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:58,120
that was some pretty intense engineering

448
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,278
stuff but I'm like I get this so it was

449
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,919
all computer base right so I I was a

450
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:04,399
gamer I was a kid growing up in the 90s

451
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:06,439
you know Sega Genesis was something that

452
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,278
you know I invested a lot of time into

453
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,360
Nintendo and you know what was your

454
00:15:08,278 --> 00:15:12,240
favorite game on Sega Genesis oh Sonic I

455
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,759
was oh yeah but then you know as I got a

456
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,720
little bit older I went into like Mortal

457
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:19,039
Kombat right so you know that was the

458
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,240
that was the cool thing like I picked up

459
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,399
some skill sets along the way and you

460
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,399

461
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,120
me here to work at a a dealership

462
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,839
offering Solutions at scale was another

463
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,120
skill set that I just you know I really

464
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,519
started Rec iing that I really enjoyed

465
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,360
nice how did you Branch off into the

466
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,278

472
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,879
recommendation from one of my brother's

473
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,519

00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:22,600
was like 24 at that time and so coming

491
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,120
into you know the role all the other

492
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,680
sales reps in that company were probably

493
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,959
average you know 30 to 40 years old and

494
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:30,359
you know that that allowed to kind of

495
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:32,159
shine and show what I did with my

496
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,959
organizational skill sets using

497
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:35,759
technology I think that was one thing

498
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:39,159
that really wasn't being emphasized to

499
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,959
be efficient in the field so that led to

500
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:42,958
me getting promoted very quickly to a

501
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:45,719
district manager and as I was on a ride

502
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:46,758
along in Northern California um you know

503
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,600
we're kind of cruising down the street

504
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:51,480
on the 80 and you know I see a billboard

505
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,879
for dispensary oh that's so cool you

506
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,800
know they're they're advertising butt up

507
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:56,480
on the billboard and my rep's like you

508
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:58,039
know I probably shouldn't tell you this

509
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,039
but you know my husband's in the

510
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:00,799
industry

511
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:02,838
and I was like that's awesome tell me

512
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:05,240
more and so that conversation led to an

513
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:07,279
introduction that introduction led to me

514
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,679
investing into that organization um so

515
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:12,119
we had to prop 215 Nursery up in uh you

516
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,519
know West Sacramento and you know let's

517
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:15,678
just say that the um you know there was

518
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:17,959
a plan to get into the 64 space um you

519
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,880
know that was 2016 so that's when I

520
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:21,798
first got like introduced to the

521
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,039
industry at that point oh because I

522
00:17:21,798 --> 00:17:24,679
wasn't I wasn't fliping packs or

523
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:26,959
anything in the past I was more of you

524
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:28,960
know I was I was selling to to smoke for

525
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,480
free right so that was never really my

526
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,679
world not trying to claim I was that's

527
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,279
just that wasn't me but when I saw the

528
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,919
genetics aspect of what they were doing

529
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:39,240
I'm like cool you got a nursery that's

530
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:41,360
awesome and of course at the time like

531
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,759
the only uh visibility I saw to Nursery

532
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:45,079
were like those YouTube videos that

533
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:46,599
Kevin jodry put up from Wonderland you

534
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:47,839
know and that was that was pretty badass

535
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:49,639
you know for Kevin to like walk us

536
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:51,599
through and showcase what they were

537
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,559
doing there so shout out Kevin like you

538
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:55,639
truly inspired me man um yeah he got the

539
00:17:53,558 --> 00:17:57,519
Skittles cut spread out all over from

540
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:00,280
Wonderland Nursery that's it yeah big

541
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:02,079
shout out to Kevin big shout out to Kev

542
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:03,839
and um so yeah that was my first

543
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:05,599
introduction into the space um let's

544
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:08,319
just say that that project didn't go

545
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:09,959
where it was supposed to and you know I

546
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:11,558
saw I I learned a lot from that

547
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:16,120
experience it was a very costly

548
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:17,519
experience so I utilized that and said

549
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:18,839
you know what I want to do this I want

550
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:20,038
to do this the right way and here's

551
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:22,720
here's the vision I want to have an

552
00:18:20,038 --> 00:18:24,960
indoor clean Nursery with verified

553
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,519
trusted Cuts right and working with the

554
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,200
Breeders and really making sure that

555
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:28,879
they that the attribution piece was

556
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,919
there

557
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,520
yeah and so you know um shot had

558
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,759
basically just started looking around to

559
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:36,879
see if there's any opportunities out

560
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:39,240
there for a you know for a c a building

561
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,320
with a cup there was nothing like there

562
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,558
is today like you can you can just

563
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:44,639
Google uh you know a building with a c a

564
00:18:43,558 --> 00:18:46,759
conditional use permit so you can

565
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,720
actually cultivate and sayate nothing

566
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:51,558
like that existed so this was pre 20108

567
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,279
yeah this was this was like end of

568
00:18:51,558 --> 00:18:56,798
middle of 2017 right around there yeah

569
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:59,918
so this is like medical about to go

570
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:02,918
wreck we know it's going wreck but it

571
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:07,038
was still I mean it's changed a lot

572
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:08,919
right in six years a lot exactly so you

573
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:10,640
know we had an opportunity from you know

574
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:12,320
somebody we knew knew another person

575
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,360
that had a building that was offering a

576
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:16,678
lease on a suite within a building with

577
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:18,158
the cup so you know we checked it out

578
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:21,080
and you know we ended up going through

579
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:22,400
with that but um I kind of skipped over

580
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:24,399
like the whole aspect of you know we

581
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,880
didn't have any investors I believed in

582
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,720
what we wanted to do so I sold my house

583
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,240
I was living in W the creek and so I

584
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,000
sold my house and you know basically

585
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,319
funded the buildout you know and I and I

586
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,759
started cultivated with four other

587
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:37,519
partners and we each brought our own

588
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,759
unique Skillets you know to build out

589
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:42,079
the facility to operate the facility and

590
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:44,079
that was really cool you know like we we

591
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:46,119
learned everything from the ground up so

592
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:48,119
from you know from the buildout phase

593
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:51,158
like that was that was a unique

594
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:52,879
experience uh you know there did it take

595
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:54,120
you twice as long and was it twice as

596
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,760
expensive as you originally thought

597
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:57,918
let's just say we paid the Cannabis tax

598
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:59,359
yes my performa invoice right I didn't

599
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,720
even know the hell of performa was so

600
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:03,038
like I taught myself all these things

601
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,079
along the way and so building out a a

602
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:06,440
you know a performa to understand what

603
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:09,319
budgeting was and I'm like okay well

604
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:11,038
I've got this much Capital to deploy in

605
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:13,558
that project and you know of course it

606
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:14,798
was like 50% less than what I had and so

607
00:20:13,558 --> 00:20:17,240
by the time that the project was

608
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:19,639
actually done I had invested everything

609
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,798
that I had so I liquidated my 401k I

610
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,520
sold my house so I even sold my car

611
00:20:21,798 --> 00:20:26,158
because we were to that point of like

612
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:28,639
you know the buildout was so dragged on

613
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:31,840
and you know this was the part of like

614
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:34,960
you know going through the Sacramento um

615
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:36,519
Building Division like bless their heart

616
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,759
because they want to know they want to

617
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:40,079
understand what it is that we're trying

618
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:41,640
to do and you know it was it was there

619
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:43,798
was a massive delay in like the

620
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,360
communication so um they've gotten a lot

621
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:47,079
better you know understanding what we

622
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:49,599
what we do as operators and stuff but

623
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:51,439
still it was the buildout process was

624
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:52,839
going way too long and we were paying

625
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,640
rent the entire time so I was just

626
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:57,119
hemorrhaging funds it's a tough County

627
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,679
to do work in you know I mean I think

628
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:01,439
they've changed a lot in the last six

629
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:04,000
years but it's definitely to break into

630
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,600
that area is tough right uh the power

631
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,440
company there is no joke it's much

632
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:09,759
different than other parts in California

633
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,120
yeah lot of fun lot of fun man so you

634
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:13,640
know we we fortunately were able to get

635
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:16,599
you know get all the sign offs and

636
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:20,840
everything so I remember Christmas Eve

637
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:22,119
on January I'm sorry December of 2019

638
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:23,798
you know we had we had gotten our

639
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:26,439
inspection finalized we already had

640
00:21:23,798 --> 00:21:28,400
plants in so you know I I want to give a

641
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,558
shout out to uh to Dan at no last

642
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,519
because you know I saw this this post

643
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:34,639
from Kevin jod that he was at the

644
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:36,639
emerald cup with node and tissue culture

645
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,240
I'm like what the hell is tissue culture

646
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,400
um you know that's really where the the

647
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,880
idea of having this trusted healthy

648
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:46,120
clean Nursery with verified Cuts was was

649
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,840
formed so I just hit Dan up on on a DM

650
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:49,798
and he responded I'm like oh [ __ ] like

651
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:51,240
this is this is happening so we just we

652
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:53,200
really developed a relationship from

653
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,919
there and just explained to him like

654
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,720
look man we want to we we don't want to

655
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:00,038
get into the TC side we just want to be

656
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,600
a propagation Nursery a trusted start

657
00:22:00,038 --> 00:22:03,000
for people you know and just doing it

658
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:04,759
the right way and just you know

659
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,480
emphasizing relationships and we're not

660
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:08,158
just a transactional company like we're

661
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,120
part of your business we're an extension

662
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,640
of your farm so it worked great you know

663
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:15,359
we you know we brought in all of our

664
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,000
genetics from t uh from TC so gen zero

665
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:18,558
and we were selling first gen Cuts you

666
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,038
know that was that's how cultivated was

667
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:24,759
born so you know the the real special

668
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:26,599
part was like we did this all ourselves

669
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:28,599
like me and my partners and my mom and

670
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:29,959
dad like my mom and dad were so

671
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:32,079
supportive like they didn't want to get

672
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,360
paid they were there helping out they

673
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:34,720
were you know my dad was there on

674
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:36,839
Christmas Eve cutting clones their very

675
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,000
first batch of clones on Christmas Eve

676
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:40,519
and I I I will never forget that moment

677
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,558
and I was like this is happening you

678
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:45,798
know I've gone all in you know they

679
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:47,440
didn't they didn't like harass me or

680
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:48,879
anything like what are you doing like

681
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,360
going and doing something you've never

682
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,559
done you just literally liquidated your

683
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:54,199
entire life savings into something that

684
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:56,639
you're you know you've never done before

685
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,798
so um it was cool they're just hella

686
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,120
supportive and ultimately like they were

687
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:01,599
the ones that were sitting on that prop

688
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:03,558
table cutting you know propping

689
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:06,558
thousands of clones so from the very

690
00:23:03,558 --> 00:23:08,798
GetGo like my parents were were in there

691
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:09,918
they were grinding with us and you know

692
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:12,000
there came to a point to where we're

693
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,640
like we were really getting scale and so

694
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,519
we had to hire employees and that's I'm

695
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,919
like guys you have to get paid like

696
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:19,359
legally you need to get paid here so you

697
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,159
know it was it was cool so my parents

698
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:22,719
were our first employees of cultivated

699
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:25,320
genetics that's where the Familia came

700
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,960
in the play really cool yeah man and you

701
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:29,000
know they've been super foundational in

702
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,240
everything that I've done so I couldn't

703
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,759
be more grateful are they still working

704
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,759
with you um no no my my my parents are

705
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:35,960
retired you know they've they put in

706
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:37,599
their time and you know fortunately

707
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:40,519
cultivated is on a on a good pathway

708
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:43,079
right now and really stabilized nice

709
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:45,278
yeah so tell me about some of the Gen

710
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:46,678
you guys have that you're excited about

711
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:49,278
James I would love to say that we had a

712
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:50,759
more diverse profile of a library but

713
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:52,159
got to give the market what they want

714
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:54,919
that's candies you know from a

715
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:57,919
commercial perspective like purple candy

716
00:23:54,919 --> 00:23:59,559
gas you got it yeah so you know we've

717
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,919
we've had a very diverse Library like

718
00:23:59,558 --> 00:24:04,240
really cool flavors from compound from

719
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,759
Midwest best from Full Moon genetics

720
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,359
like we've got some great genetics that

721
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:10,480
we've ran through but you know as I've

722
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:12,678
been connected with you know the the

723
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,519
commercial cultivators in the bulk space

724
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:15,840
and a lot of the wholesale buyers I've

725
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:18,319
got to I've got to see a lot of the

726
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:20,000
demand and what the requests are yeah

727
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:22,918
we're not fighting it it's it's just

728
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,079
it's commercial right now bulk candy

729
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:27,919
that's it so when I was in colonary

730
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:30,918
school I was told uh the best marget

731
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,799
marketing strategy is give the baby what

732
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:36,120
the baby wants correct right and so the

733
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:38,558
baby being all of our customers yeah and

734
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:40,239
whatever they want you know they want

735
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:41,839
purple candy gas right now that's it it

736
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,640
won't be like that forever I don't

737
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:46,038
believe that I think gas is coming back

738
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:48,399
I think Sour's coming back I think

739
00:24:46,038 --> 00:24:51,558
interesting genetics beyond the purple

740
00:24:48,398 --> 00:24:53,038
candy gas are making a comeback the piff

741
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:55,119
you know we're going to get some hazes

742
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:57,119
coming back and I think sure this stuff

743
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:58,798
takes time and you know there's es and

744
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:00,719
flows

745
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:02,158
and uh you know we're just in the purple

746
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,759
candy gas phase and we've been through

747
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,799
other phases before and this too shall

748
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:08,079
pass of course and you know we're we're

749
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:09,398
leaning into it you know we've been

750
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:11,639
working with the good greens candy

751
00:25:09,398 --> 00:25:13,879
collection uh shout out Joan Phil from

752
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,278
good greens like you know we're we're

753
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,120
we're taking candy and just giving it a

754
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:18,640
Twist you know so we're finding a lot of

755
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:20,199
great great Keepers coming out of there

756
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,399
with very low intersect traits by the

757
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,440
way because when you start going through

758
00:25:21,398 --> 00:25:25,959
the population of you know a lot of

759
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:29,558
gelados and just you know just crossed

760
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:30,679
within like intersect are a challenge so

761
00:25:29,558 --> 00:25:31,678
fortunately we've had these things

762
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:33,399
tested with a bunch of different

763
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,080
cultivators in our community and we're

764
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:36,278
seeing some really good results we've

765
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:39,398
got some great selections we're actually

766
00:25:36,278 --> 00:25:41,359
harvesting on Monday um on uh up up at

767
00:25:39,398 --> 00:25:42,918
Kush Alley we're down in Kush alley so

768
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:44,398
really uh really happy to see what we

769
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:47,080
can where we're going to get coming out

770
00:25:44,398 --> 00:25:49,038
here and get those new flavors out there

771
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:50,519
yeah so stress testing is a big

772
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:52,359
important thing that I don't think a lot

773
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:53,918
of people are doing enough of although

774
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:56,719
that's changing I think there's

775
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:58,159
awareness now at least for sure um and

776
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,600
just cuz one of the parent has it

777
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:03,278
doesn't mean it'll get passed on and

778
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:05,439
expressed heavily right but you need to

779
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:06,798
stress test it and find out I think

780
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,200
those are the type of things especially

781
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:10,079
for commercial viability if you're a

782
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,640
home grower it's not as big of a deal

783
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:14,439
you go buy some 10 pack of seeds and a

784
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,080
couple of them have intersec traes and

785
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:18,360
you find something that you really like

786
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:20,119
that's amazing uh you know I think

787
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:23,719
there's some really good cultivars as

788
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:24,959
far as taste and appeal but on a

789
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,399
commercial scale it's a little bit

790
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,798
different right so like when somebody

791
00:26:26,398 --> 00:26:31,798
has aund lights of one thing or even 10

792
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:33,398
lights right MH you don't want a seed

793
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:35,000
you don't want a bunch of seeds of

794
00:26:33,398 --> 00:26:36,439
course one seed is not a big deal a

795
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,720
bunch of seeds is an issue stress

796
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:40,840
testing is massive right commercial

797
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,798
viability and really understanding you

798
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:43,359
know we have a bunch of different

799
00:26:41,798 --> 00:26:44,960
cultivators in the network that want to

800
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:46,918
help test with us that want to be a part

801
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,399
of the part of the journey you know and

802
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:49,919
I think people saw that with the glitter

803
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:52,199
bomb project that we did you know

804
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,600
releasing glitter bomb in a fast was

805
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,558
pretty cool we had Caesar on the show

806
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:57,759
yeah man shout out to Caesar like we we

807
00:26:55,558 --> 00:26:59,158
we saw how this project can work where

808
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:00,759
you know you get something really cool

809
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:03,278
and special out to the group people we

810
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:04,960
all grow it we showcase you know the the

811
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:06,359
genetic potential of this thing but

812
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,120
again kind of coming back to the whole

813
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:09,719
stress testing there's specific

814
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:11,359
facilities that have their challenges so

815
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,960
I want to make sure that they get their

816
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:14,599
rounds with it too because that's going

817
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,600
to give us uh certain environmental

818
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:19,759
condition challenges certain uh

819
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:22,119
inconsistencies with um with a lot of

820
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:23,480
different factors so stress testing is

821
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:25,639
massive man and that's that's just

822
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:27,278
that's what comes back to us and really

823
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,559
what goes into the TC lab what's going

824
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:30,359
to go through Mir stem because that's

825
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:33,000
costly right you got to invest into that

826
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:35,839
stuff yeah the miror stem I it's it's

827
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,558
super important to uh get it down to the

828
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:40,079
callus and then replicate and clean it

829
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:42,480
and then be able to replicate from that

830
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:43,879
and I think the cleaning part is

831
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,079
challenging and there's not a lot of

832
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,360
people that can do it shout out to

833
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:48,639
apical biotech Justin over there and

834
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:50,719
Matt those guys are doing the Lord's

835
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,360
work in so many ways yes you know

836
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,679
they're our business partners and your

837
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:57,599
business partner as well and yeah really

838
00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:59,960
good stuff and I I think the people

839
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:01,879
don't fully have a you know grasp on

840
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,679
what tissue culture is necessarily they

841
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:06,600
you know but but what they're doing is

842
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:08,120
something special you know and it's a

843
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:09,119
little bit different than doing Nole

844
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:12,639
it's a little bit different than the

845
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:14,319
stuff you can do at home um and you know

846
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,679
but that's the future and also pathogen

847
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:18,639
indexing is so important right so like

848
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:20,480
we get into pathogen indexing and being

849
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,240
able to verify that your stuff is clean

850
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,599
and being able to show your customers

851
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:27,839
that it's clean right um all that stuff

852
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:30,000
is huge it's it's massive and and I'm

853
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:32,558
glad you touched on the difference of

854
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,519
what Nole versus marem is I mean not a

855
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:35,879
lot of people can do meristem and I

856
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:37,399
think that's the reality people think

857
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,080
that they're getting their genetics

858
00:28:37,398 --> 00:28:40,639
clean fully cleaned and restored when

859
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:42,558
they're just getting Nally propagated

860
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,399
which there's a there's a use for noal

861
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:46,158
there's benefit to it absolutely but

862
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:48,719
it's not getting down to the to the

863
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,440
cleanest form of that marem right so

864
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,759
that that I mean that's the that's the

865
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:54,159
kicker right there so being able to find

866
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:55,398
the winners that we want to be able to

867
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:56,760
commercialize and really put out to

868
00:28:55,398 --> 00:28:59,158
skill because again the commercial

869
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:01,960
validation process takes time this is

870
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:05,760
not just an F1 release this takes years

871
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:08,399
to actually do variety testing and

872
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:11,038
phenotypic studies it takes a year

873
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:13,759
minimum to properly do it and to get

874
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:15,879
your selections and to prove them and

875
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:17,158
you know I think a lot of people they

876
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,200
find something good and then they

877
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:21,080
release it

878
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:23,558
and you know and that's okay too but I

879
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:25,879
think the the real process takes a lot

880
00:29:23,558 --> 00:29:29,359
longer and it's a marathon and not a

881
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:30,799
Sprint so no doubt but you know I I I I

882
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:33,119
hope that the professional maturity of

883
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:35,158
the industry does gravitate towards more

884
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:36,599
gas and you know all these great flavors

885
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:38,159
that we want to bring back in unique

886
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:39,879
complexity because right now it's just

887
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,159
candy you know and understanding that

888
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,679
that's it's it's we're not fighting it

889
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,760
we're just we're we're making sure that

890
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,759
the cultivators that we work with are

891
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:49,480
positioned for the best possible outcome

892
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:51,200
with the highest tickets so really

893
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,399
emphasizing quality you know and I think

894
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,880
that's what we were kind of talking off

895
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:57,000
the mic was we have tools like shout out

896
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,960
to aoya that has this tool that we can

897
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,720
measure

898
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,159
and you know substrate water content and

899
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,480
EC and making sure that we're in a

900
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:05,760
parameter of an irrigation strategy for

901
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:07,079
a small Bud trait like a candy yeah

902
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:09,278
right so we want to make sure we can hit

903
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:11,599
these hit these optimal yields with

904
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:13,759
quality emphasis so being able to deploy

905
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:15,798
genetics that have uh irrigation

906
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:17,079
strategies is important that's why I I

907
00:30:15,798 --> 00:30:18,240
handle all the sales at cultivated

908
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:20,359
because I want to make sure people are

909
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,839
getting what they uh you know what they

910
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:23,639
should be geared for so if you're if

911
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:24,879
you're calling me up and saying hey what

912
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,519
do you got on the menu I'm going to ask

913
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,720
you one question are you are you just in

914
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:30,640
the bulk Market CU if you are you're I'm

915
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,798
going to I'm only going to offer you

916
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,440
white run or Lemon Cherry gelato or soon

917
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:37,599
to come g33 and you know just being able

918
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,000
to just have that on the menu and be

919
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:40,639
able to say this is how you can irrigate

920
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,359
it to you know get your 80 grams of

921
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,120
square foot with quality behind it we

922
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:45,759
got buyers asking where's the stuff at

923
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:47,398
who's got the fire you know now it's a

924
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:49,720
battle of quality and there's price

925
00:30:47,398 --> 00:30:51,398
points for everything so well I think

926
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:54,079
more breeders need to start sneaking in

927
00:30:51,398 --> 00:30:56,518
stuff and Crossing them with the candy

928
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:58,158
um you know not tricking people but at

929
00:30:56,519 --> 00:30:59,960
the same time reintroducing those

930
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:02,120
flavors in something that's approachable

931
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,519
no doubt um that's what I'm looking

932
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:05,239
forward to and I think people are

933
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:07,000
starting to do it I think we're getting

934
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:09,240
a lot of interesting Expressions coming

935
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,038
out and that gets candy along with some

936
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,440
other

937
00:31:10,038 --> 00:31:14,879
Funk um that's not just GMO not that

938
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,798
there's anything wrong with that donning

939
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,840
burger GMO I think those are great I

940
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:20,359
think they have their place for sure

941
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:22,638
they do yeah but but you're right about

942
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:24,158
the uniqueness of of flavor profiling

943
00:31:22,638 --> 00:31:25,599
and I think we also touched on that

944
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,559
earlier was like yo there's so many

945
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:29,240
different flavors sub subjective

946
00:31:27,558 --> 00:31:30,319
profiles but we can really hone in on

947
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,440
certain things when we're hunting

948
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:34,439
through the progy I need that unique

949
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,360
Twist on the candy and I think that's

950
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,639
that's again that's where the good

951
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:39,759
greens candy collection has that new age

952
00:31:37,638 --> 00:31:41,359
Twist of candies so you know we're

953
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:42,960
excited to be hunting through this stuff

954
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:45,479
and I know that seed release is coming

955
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:48,159
in the near future but um you know I'm

956
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:49,480
just I'm excited for the future of of

957
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,840
the genetic breeding projects that are

958
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,639
all going on I mean you've got a lot of

959
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:54,918
great work too I would love to get a

960
00:31:52,638 --> 00:31:56,479
pheno or two from the you know from your

961
00:31:54,919 --> 00:31:58,278
bank that we can put in and and let the

962
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,240
market enjoy CU you got a lot of great Z

963
00:31:58,278 --> 00:32:02,798
crosses that are productive that are

964
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,638
mold resistant that have Vigor that fit

965
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:05,679
the 9we window you know like there's

966
00:32:04,638 --> 00:32:07,199
there's a lot of stuff that I would love

967
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,480
to bring in from you yeah we're working

968
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,840
on some stuff that's way less than nine

969
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,120
weeks which I think has a lot of

970
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:16,000
Commercial

971
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:18,079
Appeal um but yeah I think right now you

972
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,798
just got to fit that specific profile

973
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:22,638
it's got to be candy color is in demand

974
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:24,319
like it doesn't have color it's so funny

975
00:32:22,638 --> 00:32:27,519
because I feel like that being a

976
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:29,519
qualifier is just you know we want all

977
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:31,798
these things and it's it's almost

978
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,960
counterintuitive sure so especially if

979
00:32:31,798 --> 00:32:36,638
you like Flavor I don't know it's just

980
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,880
one of those things yeah man it's again

981
00:32:36,638 --> 00:32:39,479
this kind of goes back to the commercial

982
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:42,080
validation aspect if it doesn't fit

983
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:43,798
within at at most that ninee window I

984
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:45,199
mean you're trying to get that those

985
00:32:43,798 --> 00:32:47,440
five and a half turns a year right I

986
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,440
mean if it doesn't fit within that

987
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,240
window then you know an INF arrogation

988
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,038
strategy is just such a hard thing to

989
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:55,038
accomplish within your facility and you

990
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:57,038
can't manage without measurement so if

991
00:32:55,038 --> 00:32:59,599
you're not on any substrate monitoring

992
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:01,720
or sensors sensor Tech implementation

993
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:04,119
good luck so I got an interesting

994
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:07,278
question the other day about when do you

995
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:09,239
start counting days of flow and uh I've

996
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:10,679
always counted from the day you flip the

997
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,880
lights that's that's the first day of

998
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:15,320
flower when you go photo period 122 some

999
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,960
people they start counting from the

1000
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:19,638
first day you see actual flowers on the

1001
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,480
butts and I thought that was really

1002
00:33:19,638 --> 00:33:23,439
interesting because there's this big

1003
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,038
confusion and either way could be right

1004
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,558
if as long as you're doing it

1005
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:28,960
consistently that way I mean exact

1006
00:33:27,558 --> 00:33:30,678
consistency is key however you're

1007
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,079
tracking or managing whatever time frame

1008
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:35,278
it is I'm just looking at from you go 12

1009
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:37,839
from when you go 122 to full maturation

1010
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:40,720
at Harvest so whether you're going you

1011
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:41,759
know s to 10 days on on your on your

1012
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,679
stretch period and you're going

1013
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:45,319
generatively and you're flipping back to

1014
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,559
you know to bulking at like week three

1015
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:48,079
or maybe even if you're dealing with

1016
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:50,240
candies you're you're shortening up that

1017
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:53,000
window and flipping to bulking at day 14

1018
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:55,399
trying to finish a day 53 yeah right yes

1019
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,440
cuz I feel like Skittles that's like 50

1020
00:33:55,398 --> 00:34:01,678
day 53 to day 56 if you go to day

1021
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:04,480
63 it's it's okay and it's it's got some

1022
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,960
interesting flavor but it's not as candy

1023
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,919
as if you pull it somewhere between day

1024
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,039
53 and day 56 and if you let it go long

1025
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,119
a little bit longer you're going to have

1026
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:13,239
more of an over ripened you know tur

1027
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,679
profile right and that's ABS that's

1028
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:15,918
that's good criteria to let the

1029
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:17,358
cultivator know it's like yo if you're

1030
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,480
growing this these are the things that

1031
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:20,000
you need to look out for if you're going

1032
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,159
to be washing this maybe you need to

1033
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
pull it a little bit earlier right so

1034
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,398
some of those some of those genetic

1035
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,119
profiling tips is what we're emphasizing

1036
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:30,799
you know that's just having a manageable

1037
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:32,480
Erp and data database to manage these

1038
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,159
recipes and to be able to deploy them at

1039
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,960
scale that's you know that's why it's

1040
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,760
great having these systems in place

1041
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,000
right it's really all about data points

1042
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,760
with everything in life whether you're

1043
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,559
cooking you know the The Culinary World

1044
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,639
totally translates to cannabis in the

1045
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:46,759
sense of developing a pallet right right

1046
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:48,280
and I have my book coming out and

1047
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:50,079
there's a Hu there's a whole chapter on

1048
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:52,119
developing a pallet but it's just

1049
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,960
collecting a bunch of data points and

1050
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:55,119
the more data points you start to

1051
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,960
understand it better the more times

1052
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:59,760
you've experienced it you understand

1053
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,960
what you like what you don't like uh you

1054
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:05,040
know it's like rose I love the rose

1055
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:07,000
turps right like rose is amazing but

1056
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:10,279
there's it's not just one thing we have

1057
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,599
rose petals we have rose water we have

1058
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:14,560
you know there's so many different roses

1059
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:16,720
like literally there's fresh Rose off

1060
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:20,039
the stem there there's more floral side

1061
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:21,639
to it um you know and there's there's

1062
00:35:20,039 --> 00:35:22,838
five different or six different roses

1063
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:24,559
that I can think of right off the top of

1064
00:35:22,838 --> 00:35:27,119
my head that's it and starting with your

1065
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:28,480
core base of fruit floral Fuel and Earth

1066
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,320
right like where do you Branch off from

1067
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,320
there and finding unique within those

1068
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,400
criteria points so no that's that's

1069
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:37,079
really I want to come back to your book

1070
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,400
man like I know we've been talking about

1071
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:40,720

1072
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,320

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,719
world that you're hearing about new

1103
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:46,318
things right uh you know Trends work

1104
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:48,279
differently in different places you know

1105
00:36:46,318 --> 00:36:49,639
I feel like a lot of people follow suit

1106
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:53,000
from what's going on in the Bay Area but

1107
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:54,598
that's not the case always anymore I

1108
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,318
feel like people are starting to do

1109
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:58,680
stuff all over the world that can impact

1110
00:36:56,318 --> 00:37:00,318
what we do here in the states no doubt

1111
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:02,799
and you just touched on something that

1112
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:04,039
made me like really excited about the

1113
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,039
topics that I've seen a lot of people

1114
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:08,318
come out to yeah you know this past

1115
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:11,079
Tuesday um up in Sacramento you know at

1116
00:37:08,318 --> 00:37:12,679
indors and Hydra we had over 250 PE 250

1117
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:14,720
people show up for the aroya office

1118
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:16,838
hours live CRA discussion on crop

1119
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:18,519
steering you know and that was you know

1120
00:37:16,838 --> 00:37:19,799
it was a Tuesday night like this is the

1121
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:21,358
biggest turnout we've ever had in

1122
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,760
Sacramento and you know we've been doing

1123
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:25,400
these events for a few years now so I'm

1124
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,880
just super grateful for the the people

1125
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,838
that have put their hands in to help

1126
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,358
make this production occur it's just

1127
00:37:28,838 --> 00:37:32,358
it's small team like we're really

1128
00:37:30,358 --> 00:37:34,039
starting to build this thing out and you

1129
00:37:32,358 --> 00:37:36,119
know to find topics like this that we

1130
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:38,559
can take across you know take across the

1131
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:39,960
globe whether it's Barcelona or Thailand

1132
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:41,799
or Colombia or wherever it is that we

1133
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:43,318
want to do more events that's the goal

1134
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,318
is to help unify everybody with

1135
00:37:43,318 --> 00:37:47,079
education and be able to provide this

1136
00:37:45,318 --> 00:37:48,519
network and you know just

1137
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:50,318
cross-pollinating that's the biggest

1138
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:52,039
thing is I want to get more perspective

1139
00:37:50,318 --> 00:37:54,358
and bring awareness so that we can just

1140
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:55,599
grow better grow better tree that's it

1141
00:37:54,358 --> 00:37:57,400
the king of

1142
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:00,000
cross-pollination there you go there you

1143
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:01,639
go no I think that's great man I think

1144
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,599
it's an interesting time to be alive

1145
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:05,879
it's an interesting time to be in this

1146
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:08,280
industry you know I think times are

1147
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,720
tough for some people times are not

1148
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,000
tough for other people but it's really

1149
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:14,480
an interesting place we in an in between

1150
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,079
time um you know I guess we're always in

1151
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,400
an in between time because we're ever

1152
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:20,280
evolving and with technology now we're

1153
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:24,639
growing exponentially things are

1154
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:27,440
changing uh Ai and probability and these

1155
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:30,159
AI models for the future breeding or

1156
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:32,280
it's just really wild the potential that

1157
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:35,118
AI has to be able to contribute right

1158
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:37,480
trait libraries and markers you know

1159
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:39,440
everything and and you know not not to

1160
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:41,119
go too far off track but like we we

1161
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,318
understand that Gene editing is here

1162
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,640
like there there's certain levels of

1163
00:38:43,318 --> 00:38:46,400
understanding and professional maturity

1164
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:47,719
again with that space specifically

1165
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,280
because we already know what happened in

1166
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:51,439
the past so we have to understand that

1167
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,599
there's definitely layers to what's

1168
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,358
happening you can do this stuff

1169
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:56,559
responsibly and being able to find

1170
00:38:54,358 --> 00:38:57,799
Pathways to improve the plant make it as

1171
00:38:56,559 --> 00:39:00,559
healthy as possible so that you don't

1172
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:02,440
have to worry about you know PM or all

1173
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:04,719
these other things that driven breeding

1174
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,280
is just amazing the especially powdery

1175
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:08,078
mildew resistance for sure I mean how

1176
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:10,480
many of us have had issues with powdery

1177
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:12,560
mildew if you're a person anywhere in

1178
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,838
the world that's grown that that's

1179
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:16,480
that's humid that is humidity you're

1180
00:39:14,838 --> 00:39:19,039
going to have PM issues at least one

1181
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,199
point with one cultivar in your life you

1182
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:22,679
know genetics that are you know Brad in

1183
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:24,279
Thailand are going to probably you're

1184
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:27,199
going to find a much more resistant

1185
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:29,119
cultivar of PM that it's hunted in

1186
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:30,960
right so this 100% humidity Factor like

1187
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:32,400
yeah that's that's a big deal you know

1188
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,280
carpent Tria just right here in Southern

1189
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,519
California coastline you've got 100%

1190
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,640
humidity for like four or five months

1191
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:40,440
out of the year it's crazy it's a great

1192
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:42,838
place to identify varieties that don't

1193
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:44,480
have issues with ottery mild or Bettis

1194
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:46,159
and this goes back to commercial testing

1195
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,119
right validation and verification of

1196
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:49,440
these genetics before this get released

1197
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:51,079
we have to understand if something is

1198
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,760
susceptible I'm not going to recommend

1199
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:54,400
that to a you know a company out in

1200
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:56,480
Thailand right I think that's just one

1201
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,318
of those things that it comes back to

1202
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:01,679
being responsible in the curation phase

1203
00:39:59,318 --> 00:40:02,920
right the actual the the phenotyping

1204
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:04,598
just making sure that you're capturing

1205
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:07,039
all these data points and this comes

1206
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:08,599
back to data right managing lots of data

1207
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:10,159
points you cannot manage without

1208
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:11,800
measurement and being able to track and

1209
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:13,440
manage all this stuff which is you know

1210
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,839
a big reason why cultivate IQ is in

1211
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,960
development right now yeah you know

1212
00:40:14,838 --> 00:40:19,039
we've we've got this this this Solution

1213
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,920
that's being built from by cultivators

1214
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:22,800
for cultivators they start tapping in

1215
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:26,519
all these different variables from feno

1216
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:28,560
hunting to uh you know POS retail supply

1217
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:30,358
chain all these different solutions

1218
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:33,639
right and so you know shout out to Mo

1219
00:40:30,358 --> 00:40:36,799
corid like he's developed a lot of a lot

1220
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:38,318
of data within a A system that we're

1221
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,000
actually using for for projects that

1222
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:41,519
we're Consulting with on other

1223
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,719
operations that are using this

1224
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:45,119
information to keep track of stuff to

1225
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:46,679
make sure that we're managing it with

1226
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,880
measurements to make adjustments

1227
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:51,000
accordingly yeah but really what's cool

1228
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,440
about that James is like I've seen so

1229
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,480
many operators have a a disconnect in

1230
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,240
communication from the cultivation team

1231
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:59,679
to the owners or the financial people

1232
00:40:57,239 --> 00:41:00,959
holding the bills like it's very

1233
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:03,279
difficult for a lot of these operators

1234
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,960
to have that discussion of why why we're

1235
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,680
not hitting better yields why we're not

1236
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,039
having a higher ticket on our packs well

1237
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:10,519
sometimes it's not as easy to

1238
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:11,960
communicate that environmental

1239
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:13,480
challenges lead to you know

1240
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,920
transpiration challenges which is why

1241
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,039
we're getting lower yields or our

1242
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,599
quality is not as good because we're

1243
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:19,599
having these massive VPD swings and we

1244
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:21,800
have PM or all this all these things

1245
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:24,039
happen when the person writing the check

1246
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:25,720
for the bills and doesn't want to make

1247
00:41:24,039 --> 00:41:27,239
the investment on these these you know

1248
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:28,759
improvements the facility or maybe

1249
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:31,118
different tools or maybe you're not

1250
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:33,720
using sensors to to monitor your your

1251
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,920
dryb backs you know all these factors

1252
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:37,039
that's where you're able to bridge the

1253
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,119
gap communication so truly emphasizing

1254
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:40,318
on this tool that's really going to

1255
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:41,838
centralize the communication gap and the

1256
00:41:40,318 --> 00:41:43,159
barrier is is what we're excited about

1257
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:45,679
because it's working we're already using

1258
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:47,199
this at at multiple facilities so you

1259
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:48,519
know as as we continue to work and

1260
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:50,279
develop on this thing it's going to be

1261
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:51,838
more userfriendly and you know

1262
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:56,040
ultimately just bring that solution to

1263
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:58,199
table yeah really cool thank you yeah I

1264
00:41:56,039 --> 00:42:00,039
just the the future is looking bright in

1265
00:41:58,199 --> 00:42:02,519
a lot of ways you know I think some

1266
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:04,519
people see the Grim side I try to be a

1267
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:07,800
Optimist all

1268
00:42:04,519 --> 00:42:10,318
around but yeah technology is gonna have

1269
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:12,200
its benefit for sure it will well if we

1270
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:14,960
collect enough data it's just that's

1271
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:16,439
just a given right no doubt and you know

1272
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,039
that's the thing he just you have to

1273
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,880
have the right team in place right

1274
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:22,400
having people that are committed to data

1275
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:23,960
collecting and you know making it making

1276
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,720
it easy to collect data like that's the

1277
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:27,720
functionality like there's plenty of

1278
00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:30,759
there's of great software Solutions out

1279
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:32,439
there and you know really really

1280
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:34,760
understanding why you're doing something

1281
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:36,800
in and why you're having that that soft

1282
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,800
cost dedicated towards data capturing

1283
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,119
there's got to be a reason behind it so

1284
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,640
you know well and and it it grows

1285
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:44,960
exponentially the value grows

1286
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:47,199
exponentially so the first year of

1287
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,400
collecting data you might not get that

1288
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:51,519
much value but if you look over a period

1289
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,240
of five years and you can go back where

1290
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:55,679
you've grown something out multiple

1291
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:58,078
times uh in multiple places you can

1292
00:42:55,679 --> 00:43:00,799
really start start identifying the the

1293
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:02,200
value of it production value at scale

1294
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,400
absolutely and just understanding what

1295
00:43:02,199 --> 00:43:06,358
you maybe should or shouldn't be growing

1296
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,519
also developing breeding lines right so

1297
00:43:06,358 --> 00:43:11,279
developing breeding lines that it takes

1298
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:12,719
data to really do it it certainly does

1299
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,839
and you know I built my own Erp for

1300
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:17,639
cultivated I I've explored a number of

1301
00:43:14,838 --> 00:43:18,719
different outof the-box services and

1302
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:20,000
nothing really got down to the

1303
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:22,279
intricacies of what I was trying to

1304
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,760
track and manage right I know every

1305
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,880
single clone comes off of every single

1306
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,359
plant I know every data point that you

1307
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:30,039
can imagine I've tracked and managed

1308
00:43:28,358 --> 00:43:31,078
because I built it you know I understood

1309
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:33,599
that there was a certain level of

1310
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:35,599
criteria that it wasn't an outof the-box

1311
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,559
solution so I really had to find a way

1312
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:39,079
to make sure that I can build that while

1313
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:41,640
we're building up this you know this

1314
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:43,599
massive database of of genetic uh you

1315
00:43:41,639 --> 00:43:45,719
know genetic Library information so that

1316
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:47,400
we know that if this is coming back into

1317
00:43:45,719 --> 00:43:49,078
rotation we can know how many clones

1318
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,519
it's going to produce you know all this

1319
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:51,839
different stuff what is the pathogenic

1320
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:53,838
pressure when's the viral load actually

1321
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:55,719
start to express what does it actually

1322
00:43:53,838 --> 00:43:56,880
cost to produce a clone totally yeah

1323
00:43:55,719 --> 00:43:58,399
totally

1324
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,280
and so you know just making sure all the

1325
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,760
plant stock like we test our moms once a

1326
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:04,599
month you know there's there's there's

1327
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:07,640
multiple types of testing leaf with root

1328
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:08,838
Leaf only root only combination of two

1329
00:44:07,639 --> 00:44:11,598
like there's maintenance testing and

1330
00:44:08,838 --> 00:44:14,400
there's like uh intake testing right so

1331
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:16,200
making sure that you do have a full data

1332
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,720
point on like that that plant so are you

1333
00:44:16,199 --> 00:44:19,439
guys doing in-house testing or do you

1334
00:44:17,719 --> 00:44:20,838
send out for third party we send out for

1335
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,079
third party and we I've worked with a

1336
00:44:20,838 --> 00:44:25,239
number of labs a lot of amazing Labs

1337
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:26,800
that you know um I think deserve some

1338
00:44:25,239 --> 00:44:29,598
credit like you know Jeremy Warren over

1339
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:32,318
at the darkart nursery lab out in Davis

1340
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:34,800
he's done some fantastic work Al andl

1341
00:44:32,318 --> 00:44:36,759
crop Solutions out in baville an Alisa's

1342
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,960
you know fantastic wonderful resource in

1343
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:42,040
my FL DNA you know they've really found

1344
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:44,440
their Pathway to uh to bring rapid

1345
00:44:42,039 --> 00:44:46,838
analytics at a cost-effective

1346
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:48,519
solution and so yeah I'm I'm I love

1347
00:44:46,838 --> 00:44:49,799
working with multiple Labs But

1348
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:52,119
ultimately just holding ourselves

1349
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:54,400
accountable I want to know when there's

1350
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:56,240
a potential pathogenic pressure hit so

1351
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,200
and again going back to data we know how

1352
00:44:56,239 --> 00:44:59,879
to track and batch track to make sure

1353
00:44:58,199 --> 00:45:02,000
that we do have the proper protocols in

1354
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:03,960
place to eradicate and make sure that we

1355
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,400
can go back and track what's going on

1356
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:07,599
right yeah that's really cool yeah yeah

1357
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,318
I mean that's the future that's the

1358
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:13,200
future that the the nursery models

1359
00:45:09,318 --> 00:45:16,119
changed so much over the last 10 years

1360
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:18,679
you know it's really wild and and the

1361
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:20,280
availability of testing now is like you

1362
00:45:18,679 --> 00:45:22,039
know you anybody can get their stuff

1363
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:23,800
tested technically don't doubt I mean

1364
00:45:22,039 --> 00:45:26,440
you can you just get a vile take your

1365
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:27,839
whole your Leaf punches and you get you

1366
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:29,960
get your results back in a couple of

1367
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:31,159
days if not sooner if you're like you

1368
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,000
know really on the horn and be like hey

1369
00:45:31,159 --> 00:45:34,399
guys this is an emergency you know can

1370
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,280
you please see if there's an opportunity

1371
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,119
to maybe expedite this you know you can

1372
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:42,079
mail that back and forth and you're good

1373
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:45,280
to go yeah really cool so where do you

1374
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:47,440
see the industry in five

1375
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,839
years currently right now I think we're

1376
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,880
in a very interesting point of

1377
00:45:48,838 --> 00:45:54,519
compression so I think there's a lot of

1378
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:56,358
alignment that is going to occur and I

1379
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:58,960
think that the future obviously with

1380
00:45:56,358 --> 00:46:00,358
legalization happening on the Forefront

1381
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,000
you know there's just there's so much

1382
00:46:00,358 --> 00:46:05,440
potential to have organized groups that

1383
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,079
are in the Craft Market or that are at

1384
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,000
the full scale Market because we know

1385
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:09,519
what's going to happen there you know

1386
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,719
you are going to I would love to see the

1387
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:13,318
Craft brewery model you know I I would

1388
00:46:11,719 --> 00:46:15,719
aspire to see something very cool like

1389
00:46:13,318 --> 00:46:17,639
that um but you know there's just so

1390
00:46:15,719 --> 00:46:18,919
much opportunity here that's happening

1391
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:20,440
but ultimately it comes back to

1392
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:22,480
professionalism how many people are

1393
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:24,159
going to make it through that are not

1394
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,440
professionally mature in this industry

1395
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:28,920
and this comes back to good people and

1396
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:30,920
good practice IES so being driven by the

1397
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:32,760
by the p&amp;l is very difficult to do when

1398
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:34,680
you're you know when you have moral

1399
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:36,480
ethics and I think a big part of this is

1400
00:46:34,679 --> 00:46:38,159
around like who do you work with who do

1401
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,519
you surround yourself with why do you

1402
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:41,078
want to continue on this pathway like

1403
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:43,318
why are you really here do you truly

1404
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:44,519
have passion for this plan and I think

1405
00:46:43,318 --> 00:46:45,960
that's a big part of where we're heading

1406
00:46:44,519 --> 00:46:48,000
in this future is we're going to start

1407
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:50,039
to see some people drop off that are in

1408
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,318
this for the wrong reasons yeah you know

1409
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:54,480
like I I may not have grown up on the

1410
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:56,639
hill and and you know dedicated my life

1411
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,358
to it back then but I'm here now and

1412
00:46:56,639 --> 00:46:59,960
I've I've I've gone all in all my chips

1413
00:46:58,358 --> 00:47:01,318
are in the center yeah and so I'm here

1414
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:03,119
to help and I think that's really what I

1415
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:04,480
enjoy about the industry of where we're

1416
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:06,358
heading is again like growing the

1417
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,960
connect Community has has given me so

1418
00:47:06,358 --> 00:47:10,318
much fulfillment and being able to

1419
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:11,760
educate people bringing on Experts to

1420
00:47:10,318 --> 00:47:14,279
talk about what their experience has

1421
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,640
been so that's that's the future I want

1422
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:19,359
to see is more collaboration competition

1423
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:20,960
over collaboration over competition and

1424
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:23,480
you know growing together is really the

1425
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:25,119
emphasis well and you got to look the

1426
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:27,480
ones that are left you know I've already

1427
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:29,000
seen a lot lot of people fall off the

1428
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:30,880
people that are left are are really

1429
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,679
passionate people for the most part

1430
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,200
right and it is it's we're we're

1431
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:36,199
collaborating with each other we need to

1432
00:47:34,199 --> 00:47:39,279
collaborate with each other and we need

1433
00:47:36,199 --> 00:47:40,759
to work together I think that is the

1434
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,480
best way if you want to build a small

1435
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,920
business that is the best way is through

1436
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,240
collaboration we're not in competition

1437
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,480
with each other a lot of people see this

1438
00:47:45,239 --> 00:47:48,279
competition side of it but that's not

1439
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,838
what it is we need to work together so

1440
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:52,640
we can improve the quality of what we're

1441
00:47:50,838 --> 00:47:55,159
doing and we can build the people up

1442
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:56,400
around us that are doing similar things

1443
00:47:55,159 --> 00:47:58,318
James you know what the one thing that I

1444
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:00,280
learned about this whole thing or about

1445
00:47:58,318 --> 00:48:01,838
myself throughout this entire journey is

1446
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:03,079
what I'm not good at and what I don't

1447
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:05,358
want to spend time on because it makes

1448
00:48:03,079 --> 00:48:06,599
me unhappy or whatever it might be so I

1449
00:48:05,358 --> 00:48:08,358
surround myself with people that

1450
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:09,400
complement my skill sets yeah and I

1451
00:48:08,358 --> 00:48:11,279
think that's really important when you

1452
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,639
start to look at the future and where

1453
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,920
you're starting your business or maybe

1454
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:15,960
aligning and merging with another

1455
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,639
business partner picking your partners

1456
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:19,358
is very difficult and I don't think you

1457
00:48:17,639 --> 00:48:21,199
really understand what it's going to

1458
00:48:19,358 --> 00:48:23,558
mean when you until you you know really

1459
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:24,439
start getting into a partnership and

1460
00:48:23,559 --> 00:48:27,000
understanding that everybody has their

1461
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:29,480
own skill sets where your skill sets may

1462
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,920
be limited is perspective of your

1463
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:34,800
partners and so whether it's going

1464
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:36,599
through and really aligning myself with

1465
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,880
people that supplement these other you

1466
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:40,599
know aspects of what I'm not good at you

1467
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,960
I'm not a good software developer even

1468
00:48:40,599 --> 00:48:43,880
though I you know taught myself how to

1469
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:45,240
use Ai and do all my marketing and you

1470
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:47,640
know all this stuff that doesn't mean

1471
00:48:45,239 --> 00:48:49,838
that I can code right so being able to

1472
00:48:47,639 --> 00:48:52,558
put you know this this this Erp together

1473
00:48:49,838 --> 00:48:54,239
like shout out Mo you know mo really did

1474
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:56,200
create a very special platform that

1475
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:58,479
we're really working and emphasizing on

1476
00:48:56,199 --> 00:49:00,358
that is the best part of in my opinion

1477
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,798
that is the best part of the legal

1478
00:49:00,358 --> 00:49:05,078
Market is that we can become specialists

1479
00:49:02,798 --> 00:49:06,358
in whatever we're really good at and

1480
00:49:05,079 --> 00:49:08,160
before you kind of had to do everything

1481
00:49:06,358 --> 00:49:10,239
you had to be an you know if you're a

1482
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:12,719
grower uh you had to do everything you

1483
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:16,679
had to be the electrician I mean we did

1484
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:18,639
extract we did cultivation and now you

1485
00:49:16,679 --> 00:49:20,159
can be a specialist you can move forward

1486
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:21,598
as a specialist if you're really good

1487
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:23,279
you will never have a problem getting

1488
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:25,160
work for sure you know you will always

1489
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,079
have a job if you're really good at what

1490
00:49:25,159 --> 00:49:28,039
you do

1491
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:30,280
and so if you can become a specialist

1492
00:49:28,039 --> 00:49:32,679
the best whether it's an extract artist

1493
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:33,839
or an electrician or you're going to be

1494
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:36,279
a cultivator or you're going to be a

1495
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:37,960
breeder if you are the best at that if

1496
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,798
you were in the very top percentile you

1497
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:42,679
are going to be successful and that's

1498
00:49:39,798 --> 00:49:45,440
the beauty of where we're at now and I

1499
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:47,838
mean some people you know you get mixed

1500
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:50,280
opinions on everything but I feel like

1501
00:49:47,838 --> 00:49:52,000
in my opinion that is one of the best

1502
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:53,880
things from recreational is we can

1503
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,280
really become Specialists we can really

1504
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:56,960
work on improving the plant couldn't

1505
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:59,000
agree with more man and you don't have

1506
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,920
to have a cultivation facility to be in

1507
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,239
the industry look at these curators

1508
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:04,519
these taste makers these people that

1509
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:05,919
have such refined pallets yeah you know

1510
00:50:04,519 --> 00:50:08,079
like that there's there's a lot of room

1511
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,960
for opportunity in the space and really

1512
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:11,480
focusing on what makes you happy yeah if

1513
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:13,400
you're good at sales you can do sales

1514
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:16,039
you know right the Brokers can evolve

1515
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:17,519
into being brokers in in the regulated

1516
00:50:16,039 --> 00:50:19,599
market too and I mean I think there's

1517
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:20,679
potential for growth as long as you're

1518
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,280
passionate and you love what you're

1519
00:50:20,679 --> 00:50:24,078
doing and you become a specialist you

1520
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:26,400
become really good at that you are going

1521
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:28,798
to be successful consistency

1522
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,200
consistency well and and it doesn't it

1523
00:50:28,798 --> 00:50:32,280
doesn't mean that you had to have

1524
00:50:30,199 --> 00:50:34,519
god-given talent you can just get up

1525
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:37,119
every day and work hard and be

1526
00:50:34,519 --> 00:50:39,719
successful so that's the thing is like

1527
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:41,280
sometimes it's about falling down seven

1528
00:50:39,719 --> 00:50:43,480
and getting up that eighth time to be

1529
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:45,240
successful having gratitude for the gift

1530
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:47,000
of work you know that was something that

1531
00:50:45,239 --> 00:50:48,719
was instilled in me at a very young age

1532
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,519
you know my mom and dad were

1533
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:53,439
entrepreneurs and my dad you know coming

1534
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:55,519
you know into this world into the United

1535
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:57,480
States with you know with nothing no

1536
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:59,119
education you know it's it was

1537
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:01,400
incredible to see like how work ethic

1538
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:03,079
was instilled at us at a very early age

1539
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:04,680
and just just being grateful for what we

1540
00:51:03,079 --> 00:51:06,640
have like not a lot of people have

1541
00:51:04,679 --> 00:51:08,759
opportunity to work so no and if you're

1542
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:10,598
willing to grind you're going to be okay

1543
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:13,319
you know and it's

1544
00:51:10,599 --> 00:51:15,000
like you gota you got to look past all

1545
00:51:13,318 --> 00:51:17,719
the [ __ ] and figure out what to

1546
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:20,239
focus on I mean I think being spread out

1547
00:51:17,719 --> 00:51:23,519
and have having too many focuses can be

1548
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:25,519
uh negative too like it's GNA day and

1549
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:27,400
age disallow you to follow through on

1550
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:28,798
your on your commitments totally and

1551
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,599
that's James that's what I'm seeing a

1552
00:51:28,798 --> 00:51:32,559
lot of right yeah it's unfortunate to

1553
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:35,440
see how many people are casting their

1554
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:37,280
their net as wide as possible and not

1555
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:40,039
following through in their commitments

1556
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,280
yeah you know just keep it narrow

1557
00:51:40,039 --> 00:51:43,039
understand what makes you happy right

1558
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,559
getting up in what drives you if you

1559
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:46,199
have so many projects going on that

1560
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:47,760
you're just you don't know what to focus

1561
00:51:46,199 --> 00:51:49,598
on yeah you should probably step back

1562
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:51,000
and audit what the hell you're doing you

1563
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:52,280
really want to find what makes you happy

1564
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,639
and What Makes You tick and make sure

1565
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:55,359
that you're on that right path yeah

1566
00:51:53,639 --> 00:51:57,759
there's like the Japanese principle of

1567
00:51:55,358 --> 00:51:59,239
keay which is like what you're good at

1568
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,880
and what you're passionate about and how

1569
00:51:59,239 --> 00:52:02,919
that crosses over and it's about finding

1570
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:05,079
that perfect balance and life is about

1571
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,960
balance you know and life is about hard

1572
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:08,160
work

1573
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:11,039
and you know when they said life was

1574
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:12,920
easy they lied to you life is not easy

1575
00:52:11,039 --> 00:52:14,759
there's you know I think there's times

1576
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:16,318
where life can be easy and some people

1577
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:18,280
they want to strive for like but I get

1578
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:20,639
more gratification from the struggle

1579
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:23,359
sure so you know and it's it's really

1580
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:24,558
interesting you start as we get older we

1581
00:52:23,358 --> 00:52:26,000
start learning about different

1582
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:28,400
philosophies and different principles

1583
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,159
and we start developing our own ideas of

1584
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:33,160
what happiness is and what success is I

1585
00:52:31,159 --> 00:52:35,199
think when I was younger when I was 18 I

1586
00:52:33,159 --> 00:52:36,358
thought success was a lot different than

1587
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:38,639
how I see it

1588
00:52:36,358 --> 00:52:40,920
now success is being happy with the

1589
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:44,199
people you love and care about I truly

1590
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:46,760
think like you know momentto Mor death

1591
00:52:44,199 --> 00:52:49,358
is inevitable right so just having this

1592
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:51,400
like weird psychological understanding

1593
00:52:49,358 --> 00:52:53,519
that death is coming but appreciate what

1594
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:56,280
you have and just be grateful for where

1595
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:58,798
you're at because seiz the moment yeah I

1596
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:01,319
me I mean dude how how many hours a day

1597
00:52:58,798 --> 00:53:04,318
are we on this thing just glued to our

1598
00:53:01,318 --> 00:53:06,318
attention right present it's the best

1599
00:53:04,318 --> 00:53:07,558
and worst present that we ever have but

1600
00:53:06,318 --> 00:53:08,920
just spending this time together and I

1601
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:11,760
haven't looked at my phone this entire

1602
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:13,480
time it's like I I really engage and I

1603
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:15,119
really like that that connection that we

1604
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:16,960
have because people that come around

1605
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:18,760
your life you either get Good Vibes or

1606
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,760

1607
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:22,680
connect and so you know that's that's

1608
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:24,200
what good Business Partnership like to

1610
00:53:24,199 --> 00:53:27,480
connection you're able to valid certain

1611
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:28,798
things you're able to tell me if

1612
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:30,838
something's completely off I'm going to

1613
00:53:28,798 --> 00:53:33,000
be candid about that you know there's a

1614
00:53:30,838 --> 00:53:34,719
term called kind cander that I truly

1615
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,318
believe in I'm gonna tell you you [ __ ]

1616
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:37,798
up because I care about you and I don't

1617
00:53:36,318 --> 00:53:39,159
want you to make that same mistake

1618
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:41,239
absolutely and tell me the same thing

1619
00:53:39,159 --> 00:53:43,719
you know yeah that's what you expect out

1620
00:53:41,239 --> 00:53:45,358
of your real friends you know honesty

1621
00:53:43,719 --> 00:53:47,279
you know it comes down to integrity and

1622
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:49,119
honesty and those are like the the most

1623
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,440
important things in business of course

1624
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:52,358
and there's no blueprint to what we're

1625
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:53,639
doing here you know that's that's that's

1626
00:53:52,358 --> 00:53:55,558
the biggest part around like

1627
00:53:53,639 --> 00:53:57,159
collaboration and you know just being

1628
00:53:55,559 --> 00:53:58,880
able to truly lead into our strengths

1629
00:53:57,159 --> 00:54:00,159
and it's like Yo dude I've I've gone

1630
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,680
down this pathway like you should

1631
00:54:00,159 --> 00:54:03,719
probably take a look at this perspective

1632
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:05,000
because here's the mistakes that I made

1633
00:54:03,719 --> 00:54:07,199
and there's certain people that just

1634
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,400
don't want to see that or hear it and

1635
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:09,719
unfortunately like that's why you got to

1636
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,519
start auditing your inner circle of

1637
00:54:09,719 --> 00:54:13,239
really who you're spending time with and

1638
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:15,480
how how much time you're dedicating to

1639
00:54:13,239 --> 00:54:17,879
that there's a ton of time vampires out

1640
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:20,480
there oh yeah Time Bandits we call them

1641
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:23,559
Time Bandits yeah so it's it's funny but

1642
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:26,559
they they they say that you

1643
00:54:23,559 --> 00:54:28,000
are um a reflection of your five closest

1644
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:29,960
friends so if you really want to look at

1645
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,639
yourself sure look at your five closest

1646
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:34,159
friends and that's pretty much who you

1647
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:36,039
are you're an average of the five

1648
00:54:34,159 --> 00:54:37,679
closest friends that you have or five

1649
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:39,400
business people that you associate with

1650
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:42,000
the most and I I totally think that's

1651
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:44,358
true yeah man you're you're impacted by

1652
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,400
perspective and that's uh you know that

1653
00:54:44,358 --> 00:54:47,880
there's only so much time in the day so

1654
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,318
yeah and I'm so blessed I have I have a

1655
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:51,480
lot of good people in my life I have a

1656
00:54:49,318 --> 00:54:53,440
lot of good influence a lot of good

1657
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:54,798
friends people that really give a [ __ ]

1658
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,039
right and at the end of the day that's

1659
00:54:54,798 --> 00:54:57,400
what accounts you know it's like that's

1660
00:54:56,039 --> 00:54:58,960
what keeps me going even through the

1661
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:00,240
tough days cuz there's tough days of

1662
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,400
course there's always going to be tough

1663
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:02,519
days and there's always going to be good

1664
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:05,400
days and they're just going to keep

1665
00:55:02,519 --> 00:55:06,960
going through you know till we're gone

1666
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,760
yeah no that's that's a really good

1667
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,119
point James and I I I really enjoy

1668
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,280
seeing like all these brands that you

1669
00:55:10,119 --> 00:55:12,798
have up on your wall here man like

1670
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,480
you've got a great Network you've

1671
00:55:12,798 --> 00:55:16,838
clearly done a lot with a lot of good

1672
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:18,599
people and that's that's something like

1673
00:55:16,838 --> 00:55:20,000
as we start to build and you know grow

1674
00:55:18,599 --> 00:55:22,480
together like that's what we can do to

1675
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,719
continue evolving and what's Innovation

1676
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:26,920
like what you showed me earlier on on on

1677
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:28,000
your you know on your pheno hunting

1678
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:29,760
project that you've got going on with

1679
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,480
the software like that's dope you know

1680
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:33,039
like I instantly started thinking like

1681
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:34,400
how do we work together on that side to

1682
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:37,480
Incorporated with what we're got going

1683
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:39,798
on over here IQ you that's what I'm

1684
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:41,440
saying man like there's good business to

1685
00:55:39,798 --> 00:55:43,239
be had there's a ton of opportunity so

1686
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:45,960
fast forward into the future right now

1687
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:47,719
is the time to look at you know good

1688
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:49,920
actors and Bad actors and abolutely

1689
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:51,719
auditing that process and they stand out

1690
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,318
and somehow the Bad actors every once in

1691
00:55:51,719 --> 00:55:54,719
a while get back into the mix and then

1692
00:55:53,318 --> 00:55:58,279
they you know they last for a little

1693
00:55:54,719 --> 00:56:01,038
while but you know times are tough sure

1694
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:02,640
um but the beauty of this podcast is

1695
00:56:01,039 --> 00:56:04,720
that we're recording oral history of the

1696
00:56:02,639 --> 00:56:07,199
Cannabis industry right of what's going

1697
00:56:04,719 --> 00:56:09,439
on and you know I've had some guys

1698
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:11,719
Richard delisi who did 32 years in

1699
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:15,720
prison who's one of my good friends and

1700
00:56:11,719 --> 00:56:17,959
we we uh just did a interview with Luke

1701
00:56:15,719 --> 00:56:19,558
scarmazzo who did 14 years you know to

1702
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:21,440
get us to the kind of point we're at but

1703
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:24,240
like this

1704
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:26,720
podcast I imagine that 50 years from now

1705
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:28,078
or 75 100 years from now maybe even 200

1706
00:56:26,719 --> 00:56:30,159
years from now people are going to want

1707
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:31,960
to know how the heck did it get to this

1708
00:56:30,159 --> 00:56:34,118
point and what were they doing that was

1709
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:35,519
so crazy back then you know and we're

1710
00:56:34,119 --> 00:56:37,519
able to touch on that and kind of share

1711
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:39,480
our stories and it's it's amazing having

1712
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:42,199
people like yourself on this podcast

1713
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:43,679
that can kind of share their stories and

1714
00:56:42,199 --> 00:56:46,480
you know who knows maybe we'll do

1715
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:48,078
another podcast in a year or two years

1716
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:50,559
and the industry will be completely

1717
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:52,119
different couldn't agree more man it's

1718
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:53,798
uh you know this is the origin story of

1719
00:56:52,119 --> 00:56:55,519
where we're at in the industry you know

1720
00:56:53,798 --> 00:56:57,679
we're we we've all clearly there's a

1721
00:56:55,519 --> 00:56:59,599
bunch of people that have paved the way

1722
00:56:57,679 --> 00:57:00,919
and given their lives for people like

1723
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:02,440
myself to come into this as an

1724
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:04,760
opportunity and like really understand

1725
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:06,400
like this is what I want to do and bring

1726
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:08,720
value in a certain way that you know

1727
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:10,280
that I felt that I could y you know

1728
00:57:08,719 --> 00:57:12,879
there's a lot of gratitude for that and

1729
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:14,720
and shout out to everybody that is still

1730
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,079
fighting the good fight and you know I

1731
00:57:14,719 --> 00:57:17,959
really hope that we can get everybody

1732
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:19,519
out of out of out of prison for

1733
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:21,318
marijuana related crimes like this is

1734
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:23,519
just absolutely there's it doesn't make

1735
00:57:21,318 --> 00:57:26,199
sense does make sense that we're able to

1736
00:57:23,519 --> 00:57:27,838
be here and contribute and pay taxes on

1737
00:57:26,199 --> 00:57:30,318
all this stuff and there's people in

1738
00:57:27,838 --> 00:57:32,558
prison for doing what we're doing now

1739
00:57:30,318 --> 00:57:34,639
legally non nonviolent cannabis crimes

1740
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:36,359
like come on like get these people out

1741
00:57:34,639 --> 00:57:38,199
please they are getting them out but

1742
00:57:36,358 --> 00:57:40,519
it's taking a lot longer than it should

1743
00:57:38,199 --> 00:57:42,000
unfortunately so again I'm grateful that

1744
00:57:40,519 --> 00:57:43,599
we're here you know and I think there's

1745
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,480
just a lot of opportunity collaborating

1746
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:47,680
with good people moving forward and you

1747
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:50,079
know if uh you know if I can just say

1748
00:57:47,679 --> 00:57:51,118
anything to um to the community and

1749
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:55,119
people that want to get into the

1750
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:57,519
industry it's just be humble get in

1751
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:58,760
experience things for yourself because

1752
00:57:57,519 --> 00:58:00,000
understanding where what you don't want

1753
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:01,680
to do is something that you're never

1754
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,599
going to experience until you try it

1755
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:05,519
because especially in cultivation

1756
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:07,440
cultivation is hard work yeah it's a lot

1757
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:09,480
of lot of

1758
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,880
cleaning think a lot and that's how it

1759
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:12,280
goes in life there's a lot of things

1760
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:13,519
it's trial and error you might think you

1761
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,960
really want to do it until you do it and

1762
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:17,199
then you're like hell no I don't want to

1763
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:19,798
do that and this is this is where you

1764
00:58:17,199 --> 00:58:21,159
know leaders uh building good teams it's

1765
00:58:19,798 --> 00:58:23,119
like you got to stay present with the

1766
00:58:21,159 --> 00:58:24,879
people that you work with you know and

1767
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:26,920
having these quarterly collaborations I

1768
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:28,880
hate the term review like I don't do

1769
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:30,920
reviews I I want to make sure that we

1770
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,318
can block out time every quarter so

1771
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:33,760
James I can hear you I want to

1772
00:58:32,318 --> 00:58:35,358
understand what challenges you're having

1773
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,160
I want to understand what makes you

1774
00:58:35,358 --> 00:58:39,038
unhappy because ultimately when you

1775
00:58:37,159 --> 00:58:40,879
start working in an environment that

1776
00:58:39,039 --> 00:58:42,559
makes you happy and you're dedicated to

1777
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,680
come in every day like there's Farms

1778
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:47,440
that we've worked with that you can see

1779
00:58:44,679 --> 00:58:48,639
the transition of like I want Pride I

1780
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,480
want to have pride in the flower that

1781
00:58:48,639 --> 00:58:50,400
we're growing because I want to take

1782
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:51,920
that flower out and I want to be

1783
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,079
representing that that's that's the

1784
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:54,880
flower that we I want to show it to all

1785
00:58:53,079 --> 00:58:56,720
my friends and show them that I was part

1786
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:58,280
of this absolutely and that's the beauty

1787
00:58:56,719 --> 00:58:59,798
of it cuz it's you know it's an

1788
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:01,359
experience too so we're sharing an

1789
00:58:59,798 --> 00:59:02,480
experience with the people around us and

1790
00:59:01,358 --> 00:59:03,838
that's the beauty of what're I mean

1791
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,039
that's part of the reason you and I are

1792
00:59:03,838 --> 00:59:06,759
both here is because we're able to share

1793
00:59:05,039 --> 00:59:08,520
this experience with people around us no

1794
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:10,799
doubt and you know a big part of that

1795
00:59:08,519 --> 00:59:11,880
comes back to you know leaders and

1796
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:13,960
understanding if you're a good leader or

1797
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:16,640
you have opportunity to grow as a leader

1798
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:18,079
and being able to put somebody in a role

1799
00:59:16,639 --> 00:59:20,519
and understanding what their succession

1800
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:22,839
plan looks like well once you got it all

1801
00:59:20,519 --> 00:59:24,239
figured out you got a problem if you

1802
00:59:22,838 --> 00:59:25,679
think you've got it all figured out and

1803
00:59:24,239 --> 00:59:27,038
you got to be able to re-evaluate

1804
00:59:25,679 --> 00:59:28,879
everything and be able to look at it

1805
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:32,240
from an outside perspective a lot of

1806
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:33,920
times be true to thy own self you know

1807
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:37,000
and I think that's a big part of like

1808
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:39,240
continuing to grow and you know just

1809
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,719
what are the iterations of yourself and

1810
00:59:39,239 --> 00:59:42,318
how do you want to continue progressing

1811
00:59:40,719 --> 00:59:44,199
and that's like again why building a

1812
00:59:42,318 --> 00:59:45,119
strong team starts with communication I

1813
00:59:44,199 --> 00:59:46,798
want to understand what makes you

1814
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:48,318
unhappy maybe you're in the wrong role

1815
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:49,798
maybe this just is not the right career

1816
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:51,038
path for you which is totally fine too

1817
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:53,239
or maybe you need to go into retail

1818
00:59:51,039 --> 00:59:55,000
maybe you go need to go into extraction

1819
00:59:53,239 --> 00:59:56,439
whatever it might be totally have no

1820
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,559
problem firing people by the way because

1821
00:59:56,440 --> 01:00:00,639
I feel and I learned this in being a

1822
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:01,960
chef yes was that you know at first it

1823
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:03,400
was tough for me to fire people but I

1824
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:06,159
think it's important

1825
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:07,838
to fire people and let people go if they

1826
01:00:06,159 --> 01:00:09,639
don't fit because they belong somewhere

1827
01:00:07,838 --> 01:00:11,838
else and you're holding them back by not

1828
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:14,000
letting them go you're holding them back

1829
01:00:11,838 --> 01:00:16,440
from whatever their Destiny is couldn't

1830
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,920
agree more and taking accountability you

1831
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:20,679
know me as your leader that brought you

1832
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:22,200
into this I think I I I may not have

1833
01:00:20,679 --> 01:00:24,038
given you enough time to really develop

1834
01:00:22,199 --> 01:00:25,519
your skill set that I initially saw

1835
01:00:24,039 --> 01:00:27,880
during the application process during

1836
01:00:25,519 --> 01:00:28,798
that onboarding time so you know just

1837
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:30,599
understanding what people's strengths

1838
01:00:28,798 --> 01:00:32,679
are and you don't know unless you make

1839
01:00:30,599 --> 01:00:34,039
time so these quarterly collaborations

1840
01:00:32,679 --> 01:00:36,078
what do you want to do how far out do

1841
01:00:34,039 --> 01:00:37,680
you want to get into this you know at at

1842
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:39,680
the nursery you know you're limited to

1843
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:41,318
what you can get into right there's only

1844
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:43,639
so many departments that we have in

1845
01:00:41,318 --> 01:00:45,159
propagation but as you start to develop

1846
01:00:43,639 --> 01:00:46,960
well now that I've seen the nursery side

1847
01:00:45,159 --> 01:00:48,639
maybe I want to get into flower so guess

1848
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:50,480
what I got a network of bunch of

1849
01:00:48,639 --> 01:00:51,759
cultivators so hey I got I got this

1850
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,920
person that really wants to get into

1851
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:55,480
flow I'm the first person to make that

1852
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:57,599
that recommendation

1853
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:59,079
if somebody's uny I'm the first write

1854
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:00,838
that letter ofation to get into

1855
01:00:59,079 --> 01:01:02,720
somewhere else because I know I know

1856
01:01:00,838 --> 01:01:04,480
what I hired them for you know that's

1857
01:01:02,719 --> 01:01:07,000
the part of around leadership that

1858
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:09,079
people are just overlooking like listen

1859
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:11,199
just talk to your team we they're you

1860
01:01:09,079 --> 01:01:13,039
know you're here with us this is when

1861
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:14,960
that's kind of why You Know My Name the

1862
01:01:13,039 --> 01:01:16,680
custodian kind of came out I'm not

1863
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:18,199
afraid to clean [ __ ] up I I work

1864
01:01:16,679 --> 01:01:19,519
underneath everybody to make sure people

1865
01:01:18,199 --> 01:01:22,239
are successful and happy doing what

1866
01:01:19,519 --> 01:01:26,079
they're doing nice that's what it's all

1867
01:01:22,239 --> 01:01:29,479
about yeah um so if you had one piece of

1868
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:31,640
advice for yourself that was just

1869
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:33,159
starting out in the industry that you

1870
01:01:31,639 --> 01:01:36,279
could go back and talk to yourself what

1871
01:01:33,159 --> 01:01:37,759
would that be you know I I don't I don't

1872
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:39,559
have any regrets about anything that

1873
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:42,280
I've done I think everything happens for

1874
01:01:39,559 --> 01:01:44,640
a reason I think advice to myself I'm

1875
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:46,920
just just be more be more open-minded I

1876
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:49,078
guess you know because truly I I've done

1877
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:51,240
a lot that I'm proud of and I've done a

1878
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:52,798
lot of iteration and self-growth because

1879
01:01:51,239 --> 01:01:54,759
this is not easy there's no blueprint

1880
01:01:52,798 --> 01:01:56,559
like I've you know I've taught my myself

1881
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:58,480
a lot throughout this industry and

1882
01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:00,359
really understanding how certain things

1883
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:02,559
that I needed to do to build a business

1884
01:02:00,358 --> 01:02:03,639
and you know I've I've got a great

1885
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:05,240
network of people that have helped me

1886
01:02:03,639 --> 01:02:08,159
along the way you know I think that's

1887
01:02:05,239 --> 01:02:10,000
the biggest thing is just my uh this is

1888
01:02:08,159 --> 01:02:11,960
kind of funny because like my dad you

1889
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,440
know coming from Mexico he he's always

1890
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:15,599
like don't trust anybody every time I'm

1891
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:17,240
leaving he's like don't trust anybody

1892
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:19,838
like like pops what are you talking

1893
01:02:17,239 --> 01:02:22,000
about man like and obviously he had his

1894
01:02:19,838 --> 01:02:23,159
own experiences but I always took that

1895
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,480
with the grain of salt because it's like

1896
01:02:23,159 --> 01:02:27,118
yo be cautious but I also did the

1897
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:29,358
opposite I'm like you have my trust

1898
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:31,480
until you show me I can't trust you to a

1899
01:02:29,358 --> 01:02:33,798
degree right so I think that was that

1900
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:35,240
was the one thing that you know working

1901
01:02:33,798 --> 01:02:36,920
in genetics and being able to work with

1902
01:02:35,239 --> 01:02:39,439
a ton of cultivators that were you know

1903
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:41,480
calling us to to buy Cuts it's like I

1904
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:43,440
got to work with the ton of great people

1905
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:44,480
and I also got the exposure of a lot of

1906
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:46,519
people that took advantage of my

1907
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:47,920
kindness and so you know not to the

1908
01:02:46,519 --> 01:02:49,960
degree of like you know we're closing

1909
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:51,798
the business down but just just just

1910
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:53,119
knowing that there is people that are

1911
01:02:51,798 --> 01:02:54,798
trying to take advantage because their

1912
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:56,119
backs up against the wall and I think

1913
01:02:54,798 --> 01:02:57,798
you mentioned this earlier like people

1914
01:02:56,119 --> 01:02:59,200
do some shitty stuff yeah when their

1915
01:02:57,798 --> 01:03:00,119
back is up against the wall and I think

1916
01:02:59,199 --> 01:03:01,759
that's just something we have to be

1917
01:03:00,119 --> 01:03:04,318
cautious with

1918
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:06,440
right yeah well if somebody is trying to

1919
01:03:04,318 --> 01:03:08,480
get a hold of you where can they find

1920
