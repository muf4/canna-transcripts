24
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:00,000
Oakland my whole life on and off we were

25
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,159
talking earlier about how you had a grow

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,799
right down the street from where I had

27
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:05,798
to grow when I was in Oakland uh you

28
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:07,719
know and those those big basements yeah

29
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:10,920
when I you know this is a while back and

30
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:14,158
we had a 50 lighter it it was almost 50

31
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,640
lights in a basement I had 12 in a in a

32
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,640
in the like supposed to be the second

33
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,239
living room wow and I you know I

34
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,118
camouflaged it off and uh every was like

35
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:24,798
this seems larger from the outside I was

36
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:27,000
like oh yeah I we were pulling so much

37
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,640
power the the line was buzzing coming in

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,280
the house no one ever complained well

39
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,959
and I you know I hate to admit ad it but

40
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,159
there was also a time when you could get

41
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:35,798
pg&amp; to recognize you as a lowincome

42
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,880
person right because you didn't have a

43
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:39,600
job sure so you just qualified as low

44
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:41,319
income and so they would subsidize the I

45
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,798
was like don't they see that I have a

46
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:47,039
$1,200 power bill and they're

47
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:50,118
subsidizing it so around 2 14 they

48
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,960
started giving uh breakes for people

49
00:01:50,118 --> 00:01:54,399
that bought electric cars and so

50
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:56,078
literally that year all of my friends

51
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,640
bought electric cars they bought Nissan

52
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:00,758
leaves right uh that were you know they

53
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,920
they basically you got 50 % off of your

54
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:05,718
power bill and so use the plug you still

55
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,399
you just just rewired that plug well one

56
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:08,799
of my friends he bought three of them

57
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:10,520
for three different houses and put them

58
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,120
in different people's names and then

59
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,239
power bill in their names and was using

60
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,840
that but no names we don't want PG come

61
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,400
and trying to get their money back right

62
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,640
yeah totally even though they they seem

63
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,920
to uh take advantage of the customer

64
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,238
these days yeah man the power bills are

65
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:25,559
a lot higher than they used to be that's

66
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:28,599
for sure for sure everything's gone up

67
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,878
though groceries yeah that's another

68
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:31,840
podcast though right yeah yeah

69
00:02:29,878 --> 00:02:33,518
absolutely for sure the only thing that

70
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,719
hasn't gone up is our our favorite

71
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,239
commodity right well no I think the the

72
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:39,080
price on the streets is the same the

73
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:40,599
price in the dispensaries is the same

74
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,680
The Growers are making a heck of a lot

75
00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:46,238
less they are so they are the inputs

76
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,040
have gone up yeah the inputs like

77
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,080
electric well I mean if we're looking at

78
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:51,679
electricity and then we're looking at I

79
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,840
mean everything Warehouse if you

80
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,560
warehous if you own Cana or you own

81
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,400
whatever it is you're paying more to

82
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,759
keep the lights on you're paying more to

83
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,319
pay your employees you're paying more

84
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:06,519
for those ingredients whatever you need

85
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:07,878
every and then and then and then of

86
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,039
course you know with the way the state

87
00:03:07,878 --> 00:03:12,439
treats it like the best analogy we were

88
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:14,719
talking about my friend who runs uh High

89
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:16,280
Fidelity shout out Chris Garcia but

90
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:18,239
basically it's like they'll charge you

91
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,479
for the baln the lettuce the bread the

92
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,878
cheese and then they tax the sandwich as

93
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:25,439
well yeah and you're like so every

94
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:28,598
aspect you know the bread maker gets

95
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:30,280
taxed the the bakery gets taxed the you

96
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:32,318
know the cheese maker gets taxed and

97
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,759
then of course then it's the sandwich

98
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:37,359
maker gets taxed well my favorite saying

99
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:38,759
is Uncle Sam is your silent partner so

100
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,200
that's don't own your property you're

101
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:43,120
just renting it from them with their ta

102
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:44,679
property taxes right so yeah yeah it's

103
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,640
pretty wild yeah yeah yeah I hope sooner

104
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:50,319
or later that uh you know that it it

105
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:53,158
becomes some more more not considered

106
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:56,318
like uh cigarettes or alcohol but more

107
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:58,519
like cinnamon or turmeric you know what

108
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:00,438
I mean yeah I mean I think it you know

109
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:04,360
we're just starting to normalize it

110
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:06,158
right now as as something that you know

111
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,720
as far as like that's probably safer

112
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:11,280
than alcohol or tobacco of you know of

113
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:13,158
course yeah but I think for the longest

114
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,079
time it was like oh man the devil's

115
00:04:13,158 --> 00:04:16,879
lettuce is bad stuff well you got it we

116
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:19,519
all know the story right of DuPont and

117
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:22,240
uh and Herz right the P the paper and

118
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,560
plastic people who demonized it with uh

119
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,918
Reef for madness watch it watch re from

120
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,120
Ms and that's a awesome it blow your

121
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:30,120
mind it'll blow your mind especially if

122
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,439
you smoke and then you're like wait how

123
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,759
did they get there what is going on here

124
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:36,639
yeah it's it's mindblowing how we went

125
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:39,080
from that and then it took us so long I

126
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,519
mean alcohol prohibition was very short

127
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:44,478
in relative to how how cannabis

128
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:46,240
prohibition has taken so long and there

129
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:48,319
was you know there was generations of

130
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,160
people that believed that it was bad and

131
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:54,159
now your your mom your mom's generic not

132
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,120
your mom but you know my my mom's always

133
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,520
like so what about this and I was like

134
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,079
oh here's a salve you know for your

135
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:00,478
arthritis or whatever she like you know

they get it they have no problem you

138
00:05:02,038 --> 00:05:06,319
remember when you they they didn't know

139
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,720
what you did for a living well yeah I

140
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:09,000
mean some people had that luxury of

141
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,919
having those parents but my parents the

142
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,120

00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:35,198
while my parents still traveled and then

153
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:38,038

00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:04,960
Austin Austin San Marcus Austin's all

166
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,439
right oh it's a cool town but like yeah

167
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:11,879
for sure trying to figure out in 92 93

168
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:13,800
on how to grow indoors without buying

169
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:16,240
more air conditioning or growing

170
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,720
outdoors and once it hits about 100 90

171
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,759
something degrees of plant goes I'm not

172
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,400
growing anymore right you you're you're

173
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,520
wasting your time and money so then I

174
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:27,399
moved to San Francisco and uh Game

175
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:30,000
Changer yeah yeah and then you know you

176
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:31,959
you do two jobs to rent the other in the

177
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,839
flat you know what I mean sure and then

178
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:35,799
as soon as that that room pays off then

179
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:37,439
you tell the other roommates they can go

180
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,120
cuz you're going to rent out their room

181
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,680
nice you know and then no one the

182
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,800
landlord's like I don't you're not you

183
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,840
know you're not doing all the other

184
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,560
drugs that are in the Streets of San

185
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:46,879
Francisco sure so and then you're a good

186
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,519
landlord I mean a good tenant you know

187
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:51,879
to the landlord and so then I grew there

188
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:54,519
and then uh I did acquire a small uh

189
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:56,240
issue living in San Francisco you know I

190
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:57,799
did seem to party a little too much I

191
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,960
don't want to get too one day my kids

192
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,120
might watch this so I don't want to know

193
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:05,359
go too de too de yeah yeah I can tell

194
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:07,478
off off camera but so I had to get uh

195
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,800
get my life in order I moved to LA and

196
00:07:07,478 --> 00:07:10,878
that's when I just put my head down and

197
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,038
I was like I'm not doing anything else

198
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:15,080
for me La is like I think of as a Party

199
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:17,878
City and I think San Francisco is more

200
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:20,478
like Zer but you can party anywhere all

201
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:22,319
I needed was uh no assistance I needed

202
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:25,719
to get away from the people I knew and

203
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,598
so I moved to Pasadena and uh and uh got

204
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,840
a duplex and then lived in the living

205
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:30,439
room and then went to the landlord and

206
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:32,519
said I need another another duplex and

207
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:35,639
they didn't ask you know yeah so I had a

208
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:37,478
couple duplexes and then uh then I I met

209
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:40,400
a woman got her pregnant and then she

210
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:43,839
became my wife still to this day and uh

211
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:45,719
I had to uh I had to I had to change get

212
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:47,959
it was it's stressful you know yeah it's

213
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,879
stressful being in the black market and

214
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:52,959
uh well the the it's a lot different

215
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,439
than it is today you know it's like in

216
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:57,399
California it's it's a misdemeanor now

217
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:59,800
back then you know back then and then

218
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:01,560
you can say you have hemp yeah you know

219
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,439
totally yeah well I mean it all falls

220
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,759
under T not all of it but a lot of it

221
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:08,800
falls under thca which is is hemp I mean

222
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:10,439
we have the DCC and then we have you

223
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,439
know that that's the big oversight and

224
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:16,158
then we have hemp licenses and you know

225
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:18,680
it's funny because like I mean that that

226
00:08:16,158 --> 00:08:20,519
stuff is all as far as we're talking

227
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,598
hemp license not for flow not in

228
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:25,158
California they don't they don't that

229
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:28,240
that one doesn't work here D States

230
00:08:25,158 --> 00:08:29,879
Oregon Kentucky Tennessee Tennessee and

231
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,439
Texas are the two that I know and

232
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:34,639
they're all CBD

233
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:36,440
dispensaries but they're selling flour

234
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:39,199
they're selling flour that you can smoke

235
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,440
and it will make you feel different I

236
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,039
don't want to blow anybody's cover but

237
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:46,040
the new game is is false

238
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:47,439
coas yeah I'm sure I wouldn't be

239
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:48,719
surprised yeah and I'm just like whoa

240
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,519
whoa you guys are [ __ ] messing with

241
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:55,040
Federal uh State documents yeah I guess

242
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:57,200
criminal yeah yeah I mean but even still

243
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,719
I think if you know what you're doing

244
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,640
and you're growing the right cultivars

245
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,320
and most of them are the right cultiv

246
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:04,240
you can Harvest early and it will show

247
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,160
up as thca it's not going to be Delta 9

248
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,360
THC right you know and if you're not

249
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:11,559
heating it up you're not going to get

250
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,200
Delta 9 THC If the product doesn't start

251
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:15,239
so as long as you're not heating it up

252
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,440
you're going to have a product that's

253
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:20,919
thca uh maybe some CBD some other canabo

254
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:25,079
but you're not going to have you know

255
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:27,439
the the bad one right the right it's so

256
00:09:25,078 --> 00:09:29,958
funny because you know it's we live in

257
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,440
an interesting time we do it's exting

258
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:32,919
cuz the whole world the whole United

259
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,399
States should be like that where you can

260
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:36,319
go to any store and buy it as long as

261
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,958
you're an adult right you know I feel

262
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,680
like I mean I I still believe in the

263
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:41,679
whole adult thing you know even though

264
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:43,078
when I was a kid I got cigarettes when I

265
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:45,719
was you know I got other people to buy

266
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:47,719
my cigarettes high school was Al alol

267
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,680
cigarettes you know and yeah yeah no but

268
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,320
I I do think that uh I think adult you

269
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:53,639
know this is my libertarian point of

270
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,920
view I don't know if I get too any you

271
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:56,879
know but I think adults should be able

272
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:58,958
to do whatever they want to do yeah long

273
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:01,439
as they don't hurt anybody else exactly

274
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:04,199
if only you know what I mean you can

275
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,079
hurt yourself it better yeah I mean but

276
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,920
even still I mean hurting yourself to a

277
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:12,120
degree right like there's some stuff I I

278
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:14,879
don't think meth should be legal 100%

279
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,639
And I think that that that uh

280
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:18,559
fortunately for

281
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:23,240
us

282
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:27,039
the uh Fentanyl and other hard

283
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:29,320
narcotics has so overshadowed us that we

284
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:32,639
can kind of get a little room to breathe

285
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,680
you know what I mean so look at Oregon

286
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,559
yeah they had it everything was legal

287
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:39,039
you know they're going back they're

288
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:40,479
going back on it and which is which is

289
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,439
you got to try it out you got to figure

290
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,959
out somebody has to try it out how do we

291
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,279
know if it's going to be good or bad

292
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:47,838
unless we try it out and it worked in

293
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:50,278
Portugal so yeah places like Portugal it

294
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,800
it works you know and I think but it's

295
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:53,000
not cookie cutter all over every

296
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:54,078
situation is different that's the

297
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,639
libertarian to me I don't like the

298
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:57,479
federal government I like the state and

299
00:10:55,639 --> 00:11:00,278
local governments going no I mean if you

300
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,959
live in Nebraska you be able to smoke H

301
00:11:00,278 --> 00:11:03,838
but if you live in downtown New York you

302
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:05,799
should probably shouldn't you know

303
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,360
there's just it all depends right so

304
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:10,319
because each City each Town each state

305
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,440
is different yeah and I mean I think

306
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,839
there's a lot of things you know like

307
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,399
that California could have done

308
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,920
different

309
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:19,078
and but every state every state we look

310
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:20,919
at Oregon they gave out too many

311
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:23,278
licenses right right I feel like

312
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:24,958
Washington Oklahoma oh they've had their

313
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:26,919
own set of problems Oklahoma is a

314
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,679
nightmare right like there you know and

315
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:30,278
I California did it pretty good but we

316
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:32,319
still have our own issues the taxation

317
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:33,759
is the worst part and they've kind of is

318
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,278
it over 100%

319
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,519
now on the final product I think it's

320
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:41,838
over 100% it's rough isn't that crazy

321
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:43,320
but but uh yeah I mean just from like if

322
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,399
we if we look at it I think they just

323
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,360
rolled back some of the taxes too good

324
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:51,600
in June June 1st June 1st June 5th

325
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,200
something like that so I think also 40%

326
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,879
of the revenue going to the police to

327
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,480
the law enforcement is probably a

328
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:59,600
mistake as well considering I don't

329
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,560
think that makes sense no not for in I

330
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:05,120
mean not for enforcement in my opinion

331
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:07,159
yeah yeah I feel the same way so so yeah

332
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,919
we're in a strange time but and you know

333
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:10,838
this is this is the it's like building a

334
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:12,439
small business though you gota there's a

335
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:14,120
lot of trial and eror that goes on and

336
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,760
if stabilization it's not going to be

337
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,679
stable for a while we're gonna we're

338
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:19,360
going to go through this period of

339
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:20,799
uncertainty for quite a while and then

340
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,360
it's going to stabilize and we're going

341
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:23,719
to figure it out I mean look at the

342
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,919
genetics are all over the place right

343
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,440
now too it's like a lot of the stuff is

344
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:28,958
the same people don't even understand

345
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,720
what's different they think they have

346
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:32,000
this but really they have this there's a

347
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,959
lot of the we were talking about that

348
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,240
earlier the name game right right the

349
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:38,359
the yeah the the hustle we call it cut

350
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,799
fishing also that happens a lot so

351
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,919
they're like oh yeah here's the rs11 but

352
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:46,399
really it's Lemon Cherry

353
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:49,078
gelato talk to some of these uh man

354
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,078
these LP manufacturers and how they will

355
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:53,599
cu the metric will allow you to change

356
00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:56,039
the name of course so if you're if your

357
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,480
wedding cake isn't selling all of a

358
00:12:56,039 --> 00:13:00,240
sudden you can have something completely

359
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,320
different and it's the same product and

360
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,720
and no one you know there's no

361
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,879
verification well there's no

362
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,680
verification and that's the biggest

363
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:08,078
thing is like how do you verify it now

364
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:09,919
my flora DNA out of Sacramento they're

365
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:12,000
doing some amazing stuff I mean the

366
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:14,120
fingerprinting technology that we have

367
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,839
now we can identify stuff that's exactly

368
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,839
the same right right based on markers

369
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:20,560
that's it's just like there's what 30

370
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,120
something odd purples and it's all just

371
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:24,078
basically in my opinion from what I've

372
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:27,000
seen in the last 35 years of we

373
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:29,519
cultivating it's just a some Granddaddy

374
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,440
Purple now you you you know more than me

375
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,078
about this but but I you know oh I see a

376
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,199
lot of I mean you can breed that trait

377
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:38,919
into pretty much anything over time uh

378
00:13:37,198 --> 00:13:40,799
but yeah and I like Granddaddy Purple we

379
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:42,719
had Jimmy from Myers Creek talk about

380
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:44,838
how he brought it to the market you know

381
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,040
awesome amazing story a great story yeah

382
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:48,560
it's a great story and I'm not you know

383
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:50,679
I was actually giving that you know

384
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:53,399
props I'm like dude it's yeah it's from

385
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:56,159
them you know I like GDP but but GDP and

386
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:59,519
then you know cookies came along and

387
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:01,519
gelato and sunset sherbet really you

388
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,879
know it blew up and now purple is a

389
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,278
qualifier for good cannabis which is so

390
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:08,439
silly that's not that's not that's not

391
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:10,679
true right it's not true it's not true

392
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,079
but people people are a I can just give

393
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:13,559
you I can just drop the temperatures and

394
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:16,599
make the phosphorus deficient and boom

395
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:17,799
there's your purple sure so anybody else

396
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,879
wants to make a purple strain out there

397
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:22,879
just get your water temps to about 58

398
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:24,519
degrees or lower and boom you cuz cuz

399
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:26,240
temp drop your nighttime temps drop your

400
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:29,240
nighttime temps there's a temperature is

401
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,680
just as important as pH it for nutrient

402
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,919
take yeah people don't realize that you

403
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:33,799
know once you get your pH but then if

404
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:35,240
your temps are off you know too high it

405
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:36,198
just won't even take anything right

406
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,240
right you're basically cooking it you're

407
00:14:36,198 --> 00:14:40,479
killing it and if it's too low then it

408
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,039
won't it won't interface with all the

409
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,159
macro and micronutrients that are in

410
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:45,319
there so you you you'll have

411
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:47,120
deficiencies which then depending on

412
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,519
what time you harvest in the plant you

413
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,120
know yeah so you can go a little longer

414
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,039
with the plant I get more purple too

415
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,759
right right well just the same with

416
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:55,879
Golden Goat you know Golden Goat the

417
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:59,120
reason is cuz it's 110 day strain and

418
00:14:55,879 --> 00:15:01,919
it's basically turning gold yeah like

419
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,959
aaal gold so that's you know a lot of

420
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:04,278
people like oh I'm like that's not

421
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:06,039
Golden Goat it's like you didn't let it

422
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:08,198
go long enough right like I don't have

423
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:09,799
110 days in flower you're like well

that you know I I can spot that in a

454
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:18,519
grow room too there's certain there are

455
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:20,599
certain things that I've grown over my

456
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:22,919
life where I'm like just by looking at

457
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,959
it I'll tell you that's Bubba Kush right

458

that's just one of those ones I know the

459
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:29,758
the bud structure the the top how the

460
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:31,278
top grows it's very unique

461
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,720
um same thing with sour diesel when I've

462
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:35,039
I've grown a bunch of sour in my life

463
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,759
and same with confidential I can still I

464
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:38,719
see confidential in my head right now

465
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:40,240
I'm like oh because it's so it has a

466
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,240
little bit thicker hairs too the

467
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,278
confidenti has these yarn hairs a little

468
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,278
bit I mean not to like the Durban that I

469
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:49,159
grew back in the day had yarn where it

470
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:52,039
covered up the crystals yeah it look

471
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:53,600
like like a hippie chick but the LA

472
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:55,838
Confidential would they would start out

473
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,639
as bigger hairs but then the the the uh

474
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,480
bra would start to swell up and when the

475
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:01,839
bra swelled up they would make the hairs

476
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,759
a lot smaller yeah yeah yeah so but yeah

477
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:06,360
LA Confidential that's that's one of my

478
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,838
yeah Classics yeah yeah I'm uh I was

479
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:10,240
talking to you about this before uh you

480
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:13,038
know I'm really into the you know I

481
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:16,038
guess it's the uh older person in me but

482
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:18,480
uh train wreck yeah the uh headband yeah

483
00:17:16,038 --> 00:17:20,759
headband like so that's a the headband

484
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,078
is another one that depending on who you

485
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:25,400
ask you can get 10 different opinions on

486
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:26,798
what real headband is and the names cuz

487
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,400
some people like uh you know humbled

488
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:29,759

489
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,038
Headband like I've seen both of those

490
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:32,400

491
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:34,960
headband there's all these different

492
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,798
headbands I mean I yeah I mean the 707

493
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,400
versus there was an OG Kush Headband

494
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:41,359
that's the one there yeah that was the

495
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:44,679
one that I liked yeah I mean that I got

496
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:48,479
from yeah n is the this guy null he's

497
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:50,160
from nectar's okay nectar's Collective

498
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,000
and he was part of the holy water crew

499
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,640
back in the day I know yeah yeah yeah NL

500
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,038
is the one that brought that headband up

501
00:17:53,640 --> 00:18:00,440
and I you know IC Collective had it and

502
00:17:56,038 --> 00:18:03,158
dude that thing is amazing uh 2013 cup

503
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,960
loud seeds I was part of loud seeds and

504
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:08,720
we won the first place with IC

505
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:12,600
Collective with that and yeah that was

506
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:14,120
the cut from null amazing yeah yeah yeah

507
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:16,240
and then uh you know it's been fun to

508
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:20,319
see like uh you know how what four years

509
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,919
ago cap in his Mac one was the The Rage

510
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:24,359
yeah it's funny how that was the some

511
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:27,159
people still think of it and love it and

512
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:29,240
I'm I'm not the hugest fan of the flower

513
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:31,039
I think it's very interesting a breeding

514
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,240
book and in my breeding book I there's a

515
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:36,240
case study on on it because it's

516
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:39,400
extremely special right as as far as

517
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,880
genetically it is extremely it's Unique

518
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,798
it's extremely special I think it was an

519
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,200
accident right it's a partial tripl

520
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:46,079
sometimes there an accident I don't want

521
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,480
to insult no no I I think he

522
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:51,158
intentionally bred that he worked on it

523
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,279
he he did and I think the he did some

524
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:56,360
real selection on it too because if you

525
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:59,038
if you work with any of the the

526
00:18:56,359 --> 00:19:01,119
lineage uh it comes out hazy if you look

527
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:03,919
at the other like there we had a Mac 69

528
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:07,479
it's not that ha the Mac one not

529
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:09,320
but so Mac 69 that I got for first class

530
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,240
genetics who's one of my good friends my

531
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:15,079
buddy Ray he gave me this this other Mac

532
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,839
which was the Mac 69 and that was hazy

533
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:18,678
very hazy I'm excited you could see how

534
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:20,038
they were related yes you could totally

535
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:21,880
see how they were related but it was

536
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:24,200
like whoa this is haze and this is like

537
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,320
totally missing the haze yeah right do

538
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,440
you think the haze craze is going to

539
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:29,399
come back like I I remember it's already

540
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,279
back in certain circles for sure okay

541
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:34,200
okay good good good yeah so I would say

542
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:36,000
the equatorial sativa whatever that that

543
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,000
category is definitely slowly making the

544
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,759
comeback it's big over in Europe I got

that's that's what I was back to my

572
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:39,319
point is that that's the kind of stuff

573

were talking about Romulan I really like

575
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:44,919
Romulan back in the day I think there

576
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,919
was and Romulan right aren't they aren't

577
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:50,360
they a generation so similar yeah

578
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,919
similar years and so that but that white

579
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:53,879
white widow there was different

580
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,038
expressions of it we only had we we got

581
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,919
this stuff called The White Widow that

582
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:58,599
wasn't anything like the European White

583
00:20:56,919 --> 00:21:00,120
Widow but it would make you sweat like

584
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:02,399
like crazy we called it the sweat the

585
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:04,038
sweat we got it from Richmond and these

586
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,679
these guys grew it it was expensive it

587
00:21:04,038 --> 00:21:08,879
was like 4,000 a pound or something like

588
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:11,120
that here Richmond here yeah yeah these

589
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,799
guys used to grow killer but Richmond

590
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:15,558
still the scary neighborhood that it um

591
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:17,278
there's areas in richm that are still

592
00:21:15,558 --> 00:21:19,759
bad yeah of course sure of course of

593
00:21:17,278 --> 00:21:21,038
course Romulan and white widow oh man

594
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:23,440
what about you what's your desert island

595
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:25,278
strain I think it's Shoreline I think

596
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,240
that's so f is it okay so now there's

597
00:21:25,278 --> 00:21:29,119
this is another great topic for

598
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,200
discussion so I work with

599
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:34,678
I am the I am one of the few the Texas

600
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,679
Shoreline or the not me like like no

601
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:40,360
that that I know the devil the uh what's

602
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:42,240
his name yeah that guy so he had he only

603
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:45,439
got half of it those are my boys yeah

604
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:48,599
but so they they bred that with uh

605
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:52,240
lavender okay okay so they it with no no

606
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:56,558
it was some's lavender so I

607
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:59,278
believe that the real Shoreline I can

608
00:21:56,558 --> 00:22:01,200
get that I had it I read with it yeah I

609
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:03,240
it's really good but I would say that

610
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,038
that's from the skunk family it is it's

611
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:08,278
skunk number something yeah yeah it's

612
00:22:06,038 --> 00:22:10,879
skunk yeah yeah it's from a it's from a

613
00:22:08,278 --> 00:22:14,558
bag at a uh

614
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:16,559
1980 1988 1989 dead show at the

615
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:18,798
Shoreline Amphitheater the guys my boys

616
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:19,759
got a bag and they had one seat in it

617
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:22,038
yeah and then they started in their

618
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:25,480
closet and then another person uh Paul

619
00:22:22,038 --> 00:22:27,519
Hansen got rest his soul uh he blew up

620
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:30,599
with it and then Houston which is a huge

621
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:33,119
consumer Market made it uh commercially

622
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:35,918
viable yeah then so then I got a hold of

623
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:39,798
it because I knew I knew those guys and

624
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:41,799
yeah and uh yeah Shoreline yeah I I made

625
00:22:39,798 --> 00:22:45,038
some crosses with the shoreline in fact

626
00:22:41,798 --> 00:22:46,359
uh we call one of them bies ah yeah you

627
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:48,720
know and if you're from Texas you know

628
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:50,719
what bu is you get the inside joke right

629
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,839
yeah I like it I like it a lot I love

630
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,558
that Shoreline cut and it's strong it's

631
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:55,959
got this unique nose I did some work

632
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:57,399
with the Fort Collins cough too that's

633
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,000
another one that I really like yeah yeah

634
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,360
yeah but it's a

635
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,720
you know and I costed it with the banana

636
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:04,519
skitt the fours cough has still got uh

637
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,600
you know still got people making money

638
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:07,879
off of it up there I think so and it's

639
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:09,599
it's hard to get not a lot of people

640
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,360
want to grow it it's a big tall plant if

641
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:13,639
you grow It Outdoors it just wants to

642
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:15,599
grow straight up yeah I think the one I

643
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,038
had in my backyard was 11 feet tall or

644
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:18,719
something like that so have you grown

645
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:20,798
train wreck Outdoors before because I've

646
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,480
only grown it indoors no so train wreck

647
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:24,119
is one of those ones I a lot of my

648
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,440
friends grew train W yeah that's what I

649
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:27,199
that's that was my first Money Maker it

650
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,919
always looks funny it never never looks

651
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:34,278
like the happiest plant no and

652
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:35,520
the and I think the Adam done said

653
00:23:34,278 --> 00:23:38,519
basically it was called train wreck

654
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:40,038
because it turns your grow room into a

655
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:41,278
train wreck that doesn't surprise me at

656
00:23:40,038 --> 00:23:43,158
all you know instead of like there's no

657
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:45,599
like you know a train hit something or

658
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:48,039
some story it hits you like a train W no

659
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:49,918
cuz it's a it's a daytimer it's a work I

660
00:23:48,038 --> 00:23:52,119
call it work weed yeah you know but it's

661
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,400
strong too it's strong that's why I

662
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:55,278
always thought it was called train wreck

663
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,919
because you feel like a train wreck but

664
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:58,278
you can tap bang out some emails or some

665
00:23:56,919 --> 00:24:00,480
reports on that you know you know what I

666
00:23:58,278 --> 00:24:02,440
mean yeah yeah so yeah train wreck but

667
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,120
yes I think Shoreline is uh is my go-to

668
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,960
the older version I think you know the

669
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:09,439
problem too you can talk on this is

670
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,640
the the genetic drift this so shine

671
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,960
Shoreline never had uh not too many

672
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:16,320
people put it back to seed right so

673
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:18,600
you're taking you know a cutting of a

674
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:20,278
cutting of a cutting and 20 something

675
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:22,439
years later it's different than you

676
00:24:20,278 --> 00:24:25,798
remember it from back in the day if you

677
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:27,600
happen to ever acquire the first couple

678
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:30,158
cuts right which don't exist because

679
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:32,038
either they've turned to to trash or you

680
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,200
know or mold or yeah we have this little

681
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:35,679
thing called tissue culture which I I'm

682
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,960
so excited about now yeah we'll talk

683
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,679
about that after the show but yeah

684
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,919
getting that through tissue culture and

685
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:42,640
then a lot of those things I think you

686
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:44,600
know I was thinking Sour Diesel had a

687
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,320
lot of that going on and I thought you

688
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:47,398
know these because I've I've seen Sour

689
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:50,000
Diesel

690
00:24:47,398 --> 00:24:51,479
from 10 15 different people over the

691
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,319
last year people were like oh this is

692
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,200
some Sour this is some Sour a lot of

693
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:57,240
people have given me Sour Diesel samples

694
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,960
like oh bro here you go I know you're

695
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:01,278
looking for the sour and they give it to

696
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,038
me and it's like it reminds me more of

697
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:05,519
chem 991 than it does of Sour Diesel

698
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:09,038
it's got that burnt tire but it doesn't

699
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:10,798
have that like strong do you think what

700
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:13,640
is the relationship between Kim dog and

701
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:15,879
Sour Diesel Sour Diesel I me is a

702
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:18,640
predecessor I believe it's a it's a bag

703
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,960
seed of chem 91 now we can argue this

704
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,480
because everyone has their

705
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:24,759
different I think my the people watching

706
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,038
the show will argue this and they'll be

707
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:28,398
send in type it right now huh I I went

708
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:30,720
and I tried to source as much

709
00:25:28,398 --> 00:25:32,558
information as I could as possible and

710
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,600
we believe is there any relation to

711
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:36,158
Hell's Angels on either one of those I

712
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:38,519
don't think so CU that's the story I

713
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,520
heard Hell's Angels yeah and the cross

714
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:43,519
between that and some dead heads yeah

715
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:46,679
which back in the 60s was they were yeah

716
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:48,278
weel well I mean maybe from the you know

717
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:50,038
I mean I there's the whole chem dog

718
00:25:48,278 --> 00:25:51,960
story we don't need to go into that

719
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:54,519

something uh which I was you know yeah

754
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,519

755
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,640
step up so uh the guy who worked at the

756
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:23,879
store that I finally worked at uh I said

757
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,919
have you ever tried Cana and I was like

758
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,720
No And it was you know relatively new to

759
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,679
the market I think you got here in 99

760
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,679
yeah it's in Holland for 30 years

761
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,200
forever as long as I can remember yeah

762
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,480
yeah so and that's pretty much you know

763
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,319
the staple of Europe that in uh Believe

766
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,278
as I can remember we've had Cana it's

767
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:47,599
you know yeah yeah like I said it's 30

768

it is as old as GH yeah just not in the

769
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:51,480
United States right so so I was using

770
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,519
that and of course that changed that

771
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:57,519
changed my I became a better grower yeah

772
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:59,480
and so then uh I moved to Texas back to

773
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:02,919
Texas because I couldn't afford to live

774
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:05,038
in California with a wife and a kid so I

775
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:06,600
bought a some duplexes there and I was

776
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:09,398
about to do the same thing and I just

777
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:11,038
told myself it's not going to work out

778
00:28:09,398 --> 00:28:13,639
so I started a trucking company you know

779
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:16,919
with all my my uh Investments and uh

780
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:19,159
then 2007 and8 happened and the

781
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:20,679
construction World died yeah so I was

782
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:23,799
like I need to go back to makeing money

783
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:26,038
so the the bubble burst yeah the housing

784
00:28:23,798 --> 00:28:28,158
market just crashed crashed no one was

785
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:30,200
buying materials I I had so many friends

786
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:33,320
that lost their houses because of their

787
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:34,480
the loans the mortgages yeah basically

788
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:36,759
that was the year where well that was

789
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,558
also the that was also when everybody

790
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:41,278
went to they had gotten the loan six

791
00:28:39,558 --> 00:28:43,359
months to a year before and they were

792
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:45,759
adjustable rates so the first six months

793
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:47,639
yeah you're at but then they jacked up

794
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:49,119
the adjustable rates where you couldn't

795
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:51,080
afford it you couldn't afford the

796
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:53,719
monthly if you didn't refinance out of

797
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:54,879
that loan then you just default yeah you

798
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,600
know but you got to live there for eight

799
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,600
months or a year yeah but so uh that

800
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:02,119
happened sold my trucks parked one of my

801
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:05,519
trucks sold one of my trucks and then I

802
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:07,759
bought a rental house uh and or turned

803
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:11,079
the rental house back into a grow and

804
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:13,759

808
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:23,640
2011 I started subcontracting you know

809
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:25,759
contract work and then in 2012 I got a

810
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,399
full-time job cool yeah so I've been

811
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:31,798
with them for 12 years nice yeah yeah

812
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:33,719
and it's it's been great so yeah yeah

813
00:29:31,798 --> 00:29:35,440
yeah it's a good company I feel like you

814
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,038
know I work for a Dutch company you know

815
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,399
so it's not a typical they have

816
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:40,879
different you know health insurance and

817
00:29:39,398 --> 00:29:44,719
there's less oversight with the company

818
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:47,039
over there yes yes yes and so uh yeah

819
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,839
I've been dude and it's I think it's

820
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:50,240
sort of like you know we're talking

821
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:53,678
about our friends at Royal gold working

822
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,440
for a quality company yeah is half their

823
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,798
job they telling you you know what I

824
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,038
mean when you're just like oh what do

825
00:29:57,798 --> 00:30:01,599
you know when you feel like you're part

826
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:03,398
of the family too you know I was I sat

827
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:06,278
with my guys down today and we had this

828
00:30:03,398 --> 00:30:08,158
conversation and I said it's I I hope

829
00:30:06,278 --> 00:30:09,640
it's always like this but I don't think

830
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,799
it's as we grow it's going to be

831
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:13,679
different right now we have a tight team

832
00:30:11,798 --> 00:30:15,839
and I have the best guys working with

833
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:18,640
like literally I have the best guys yeah

834
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:20,359
we're a tight team everybody's you know

835
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,399
on board and everybody's happy all the

836
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:24,719
time and when you get a big company

837
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:27,678
together as you grow it's not always

838
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:30,200
like that second you have 20 employees

839
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:32,880
it's different right you can try to make

840
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:35,519
it it it takes a lot of work right and

841
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,240
it's a different culture well then once

842
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:39,399
your priorities change and everybody's

843
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:42,159
like well let's make some more money

844
00:30:39,398 --> 00:30:44,359
right no longer is this just my passion

845
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:47,159
but now I want it to be a

846
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:50,240
financial uh productive Endeavor yeah

847
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:53,640
then you have to sort of start with the

848
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,359
handbooks and the protocol right and you

849
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,278
know the streamlining and you know we

850
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:59,558
use Sops for everything but like we've

851
00:30:57,278 --> 00:31:02,079
tried to incorporate the the culture

852
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:04,678
early on you know it's like but also I

853
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:06,278
want my guys to feel appreciated because

854
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:07,798
I've worked for big corporations I

855
00:31:06,278 --> 00:31:11,278
worked for small companies I've been a

856
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:12,918
business owner before yeah and you know

857
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:15,038
I my parents were business owners so I

858
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:16,759
got to see firsthand you know where what

859
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:18,119
it was like with 50 employees and I've

860
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:20,240
worked for companies that had thousands

861
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:23,678
of employees I work for Charles Schwab

862
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:25,159
back in the day okay so yeah I've done a

863
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:27,919
little bit of everything and and you

864
00:31:25,159 --> 00:31:29,679
know I think it's great to have

865
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,799
employees that want to come to work

866
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:34,559
they're excited to come to work they get

867
00:31:31,798 --> 00:31:37,278
treated well they get respect D the

868
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:41,079
productivity and the product quality and

869
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:43,679
your ease of management yep is is

870
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:45,119
facilitated on how happy the employee is

871
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,360
to be there and how much they want to

872
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:48,278
come back the next day well they're a

873
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:51,319
representation of you so if you train

874
00:31:48,278 --> 00:31:53,000
them correctly right right then they're

875
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:54,960
going to represent you in the best way

876
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,079
possible exactly how you would want it

877
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:01,120
done you don't you know and there's a

878
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:04,038
line where it's like um where you're

879
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:06,359
over managing or micromanaging and that

880
00:32:04,038 --> 00:32:07,759
that's bad but it's also if you train

881
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:08,959
them from the beginning and you train

882
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,440
them the right way and you're able to

883
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,120
spend I'm able to spend a lot of time

884
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:16,120
with people right you know it's it's the

885
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:17,439
uh professional the read this about I

886
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:19,879
don't know if it was Nick Sabin or it

887
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:23,159
was another college coach but real co uh

888
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:26,320
maybe MC Brown college coaches

889
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:28,120
don't they don't pick Place yeah they

890
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:29,480
don't design they may have a system or

891
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:31,879
whatever but most of them are just

892
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:34,839
culture yeah just the culture of the

893
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:37,440
program yeah and then they they instill

894
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:38,839
every day whatever aspect of a culture

895
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,278
of a program they want I think that's

896
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:43,398
too true for positive businesses yeah

897
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:45,720
you want to have this this culture and

898
00:32:43,398 --> 00:32:48,158
then you let the people you you've

899
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,600
hired do the management and the jobs you

900
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,639
know what I mean once in a while you

901
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:55,319
know more more than anything you're just

902
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:57,240
solving inter inter problems you know

903
00:32:55,319 --> 00:33:00,278
what I mean right and if you have

904
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:01,960
systems in place the employees fall back

905
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:03,679
on their systems and that's how they do

906
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,600
their job it's based on the system so

907
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,480
it's like I have to do this this this

908
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:09,918
and this and this today and this is what

909
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:11,159
I have to do for this week and you know

910
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:12,919
if you can help them with time

911
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:14,519
management like this is what's required

912
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:16,720
this is what we need done and a lot of

913
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:19,399
times it's just reverse engineering the

914
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,319
problem right so like or the solution

915
00:33:19,398 --> 00:33:22,759
you know so exactly it's all reverse

916
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:24,278
engineering we look at the end product

917
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:26,440
we want this amazing clone how do we get

918
00:33:24,278 --> 00:33:28,359
an amazing clone well we have these

919
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:31,480
steps that it takes and we have this

920
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:33,398
window to sell them or we need amazing

921
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:35,319
seeds right and they we want the most

922
00:33:33,398 --> 00:33:36,798
beautiful looking seeds and how do we

923
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:38,079
get the most beautiful seeds and the

924
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:40,480
most amazing seeds that are going to

925
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:43,678
germinate for everybody that not only

926
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:46,120
look great but they grow well they have

927
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:48,519
minimal interx traits right all these

928
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:50,398
things you know and it goes back into

929
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:52,599
you can dive back into the pheno hunting

930
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:54,879
aspect of it and testing are you

931
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:56,839
thoroughly testing stuff right you know

932
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,840
and are you testing it and then also are

933
00:33:56,839 --> 00:34:00,839
you testing it before you sell it right

934
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:02,398
cuz that that's that was a trend I hope

935
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:04,199
it's changing that I saw about three

936
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:06,599
ammo cups ago was where these guys were

937
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,918
like I like there's no way you even you

938
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:10,559
even grew this feno like where did how

939
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:12,480
do you get how you selling these oh yeah

940
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:14,078
people would just get stuff make seeds

941
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,159
and then sell the seeds and not test it

942
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:18,599
and never grow the plant never grow that

943
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:21,200
pheno or that we make you know we make

944
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:23,240
over 300 outcrosses a year and we

945
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:25,158
release a very small portion right right

946
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:27,878
cuz it's they're not all win it can't be

947
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:29,320
all winners no we don't and even Beyond

948
00:34:27,878 --> 00:34:31,358
that we don't have time to go through

949
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:33,480
everything if I do release stuff that

950
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:35,719
has interex traes it's because it's

951
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:37,199
special and if you pop a 10 pack of

952
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:38,719
seeds you're going to find special stuff

953
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:40,598
in there and I try to let people know

954
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:43,878
online so if you look on the website and

955
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:46,240
you go to that specific uh cross it'll

956
00:34:43,878 --> 00:34:48,440
say that this has potential for inter

957
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,598
Tendencies right and and as long as

958
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,000
you're disclaiming it as long as you're

959
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,079
disclaiming it and people are still

960
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,079
really interested because a lot of

961
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,560
people are like I gotta have this I got

962
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:58,760
to have a cross with this in it yeah you

963
00:34:56,559 --> 00:35:00,159
know and you know slowly but surely

964
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:02,920
we'll move away from that stuff we're

965
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:04,480
about to do uh clone sales as well right

966
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,960
which is exciting we talked about that

967
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,400
it's exciting to be able to do clone

968
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,880
sales I think uh domestically and to be

969
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,639
able to get clones that you're on your

970
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,920
doorstep that are from tissue culture

971
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:19,078
that are yeah you know certified clean

972
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,480
Pest and P authentic verified we do

973
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:22,280
fingerprinting on everything that we're

974
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,159
going to be shipping out so like you'll

975
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:27,160
be able to test well you'll be able to

976
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:28,960
see our test results you'll be able to

977
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:30,719
look at everything that's went through

978
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,720
is a hopl and viroid clean because

979
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:34,719
that's a really big topic right now man

980
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:36,559
have you talked about that yet we have

981
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:40,358
you know and one like the

982
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:42,078
boogeyman it is and the thing is like

983
00:35:40,358 --> 00:35:43,679
it's about aw the first thing is

984
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:46,119
awareness right you need to know you

985
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:48,960
need to be aware what is it how how how

986
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:50,519
do you transmit itally transmitt what

987
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,599
does it look like what are the symptoms

988
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:55,039
first of all because there's also a lot

989
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:56,440
of symptoms that are not hopl and that

990
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:59,119
are other things so you need to know a

991
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:01,720
lot of signs of different things but

992
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:03,480
also what are the signs of hop lant uh

993
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:05,879
how do I treat it do I just get rid of

994
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,480
the plant do I do I tissue culture is

995
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,960
that that important that I need to clean

996
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,400
it yes you know because there's a lot of

997
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,240
genetics out there is it really worth

998
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:16,119
cleaning that thing or or are you okay

999
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:18,118
with losing 10 to 30% of your yield

1000
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:20,440
right I mean well and it varies because

1001
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:22,119
it can lay dormant yeah and then all of

1002
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:25,119
a sudden you have some stress and you

1003
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:28,519
lose anywhere between one plant a whole

1004
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:31,318
row y half of your crop yep you know and

1005
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:33,039
and you just never know and the think

1006
00:36:31,318 --> 00:36:34,719
people had the blindfolds on for a long

1007
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:37,279
time and didn't want to believe it no no

1008
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:39,199
i' I've seen denial I've seen denial

1009
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:42,760
it's it's sad you're like dude you you

1010
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:44,159
got H rers like no no it's just I like

1011
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,440
okay well you're buying clones from

1012
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:47,719
other people you're bringing those in

1013
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:50,880
and are they really testing for it no

1014
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:52,679
now let's say you use do your own clones

1015
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,039
and you know but like you've used clones

1016
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:56,199
from other places then you're using the

1017
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:57,759
same drippers that were in plants that

1018
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:59,078
were infected what do you think is to

1019
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,359
happen you're going to infect your plant

1020
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:04,720
of course right and so there's so many

1021
00:37:02,358 --> 00:37:06,559
different ways to get infected we use

1022
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:09,039
clean tools on everything so even our

1023
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:11,920
tissue culture plants between the plants

1024
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:14,480
we still use clean tools with with every

1025
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,639
plant right so we'll use on the same

1026
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,559
it's worth it's worth it just to have

1027
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:20,559
just peace of mind a case a case of this

1028
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:23,078
instead of you know well and it's like

1029
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:24,880
if one plant is infected we can pull it

1030
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:26,519
yeah but we don't get infected plants

1031
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,160
because everything's from tissue culture

1032
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:31,318
right so but we still take precautions

1033
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:33,159
what if for some reason something you

1034
00:37:31,318 --> 00:37:35,880
know it tested negative and then all of

1035
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:38,239
a sudden it's now positive because it's

1036
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:40,400
that bad it's honestly that bad to where

1037
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:44,679
you can have a negative test and it's a

1038
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:48,039
false negative or the viral load is so

1039
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:49,318
it just hasn't had chance to all and you

1040
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:51,199
know I mean we're talking about there's

1041
00:37:49,318 --> 00:37:53,880
people that are treating it there's

1042
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:56,078
there's uh chemicals that you can put on

1043
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:59,240
the plant and I think those are mostly

1044
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:02,200
Band-Aid fixes right right they sound

1045
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:04,118
good in theory but they also need

1046
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:05,559
specific application right I mean you

1047
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:07,760
can't you know our our industry's always

1048
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:09,519
had that you know the super Mite yeah

1049
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,400
how we we we

1050
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:17,000
Californians created are the worst and

1051
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:19,639
the the the laxidasical half ass uh

1052
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,039
procedures uh that people used well and

1053
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:23,000
it used to be like we're just going to

1054
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:26,199
spray this this and this on it we got

1055
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,960
the trifecta yes it's the Avid the Judo

1056
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:31,039
and the I don't remember the other one

1057
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:33,480
was I always forget but uh forbid I say

1058
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:34,759
forbid yeah it was Avid Judo and forbid

1059
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,000
back in the day it was like oh the

1060
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:39,280
trifecta you just rotate through them

1061
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,679
but I mean who sprays that stuff Nobody

1062
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,839
Does that anymore and if you do there's

1063
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:43,358
something wrong with you you don't need

1064
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:45,119
to do that that's why I usually don't

1065
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:46,440
consume other people's cannabis yeah I

1066
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:49,160
mean seriously unless I know because

1067
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,720
you're like what the yeah and I mean I

1068
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:53,480
think that's one of the beauties of

1069
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:56,439
testing what I really like that's the

1070
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:58,559
good side of the regulated market yes

1071
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:00,400
you know that is absolutely the

1072
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:01,559
essential side right where it holds

1073
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,960
people accountable for that kind of

1074
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:04,838
stuff I've talked about this with a

1075
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:08,000
couple other nutrient companies but back

1076
00:39:04,838 --> 00:39:09,759
in the day with the nutrient companies

1077
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,159
most of them if you followed the recipe

1078
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,920
that was on the bottle you would have a

1079
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:16,598
subpar product right there wasn't a lot

1080
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,200
of R&amp;D going done on on their side

1081
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:20,079
because it was illegal for one thing

1082
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:20,919
right there's a lot of reasons that's

1083
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:23,240
that was one of the things that

1084
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:25,159
separated us from from most people over

1085
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:28,039
there is that yeah you know we did we

1086
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:30,318
did uh specific

1087
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:32,519
nutrient application studies for

1088
00:39:30,318 --> 00:39:34,800
specific plants you know there is no

1089
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:37,880
such thing as a really as a as a crop

1090
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:39,000
specific nutrient that that is a lot of

1091
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:41,318
people like to believe that you know

1092
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,318
what I mean but there is a crop specific

1093
00:39:41,318 --> 00:39:45,880
application right so you know yeah I

1094
00:39:44,318 --> 00:39:47,559
mean there's specific recipes that work

1095
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:50,280
and pH ranges that work with different

1096
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:52,000
plants right and uh cow mag you know

1097
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:54,040
that's always the big one that's the big

1098
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,960
one yeah I love a friend of mine's uh

1099
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:58,838
did the uh Satur night life skit he goes

1100
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,920
I grow we like like everybody else one

1101
00:39:58,838 --> 00:40:01,559
pant leg at a time but you're going to

1102
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,480
want more cow mag you're going to

1103
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:03,719
definitely going to want more C mag

1104
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,559
you're going to want more calag it's

1105
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:09,118
almost for sure yeah yeah that's an

1106
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:12,039
important one and I mean I think

1107
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:15,400
uh across the board though there's lots

1108
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:18,239
of decent nutrients available there's

1109
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:20,000
lots of really good decent decent right

1110
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:21,519
there's a difference between I've always

1111
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,599
preached this because people go hey that

1112
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:24,239
works and them all there's a difference

1113
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:25,760
between something that works so that's

1114
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:27,439
the opposite you know there's there's

1115
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,000
failure and then the next thing after

1116
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,480
failure is Success the only definition

1117
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:34,199
for me of success is not failing yeah

1118
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:37,079
but then way down the line on a graph is

1119
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:39,039
production is quality production M so

1120
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:40,640
you know there there is there are a few

1121
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:43,639
out there that don't get you all the way

1122
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:45,799
to a quality production unless you heav

1123
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:47,559
heavily manipulate the application and

1124
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,599
in that point you're sort of just not

1125
00:40:47,559 --> 00:40:52,078
even really using as an intended you

1126
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:54,760
know what I'm saying yeah so and there

1127
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:57,480
is no other crop that

1128
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:59,599
is consumed and combusted at the same

1129
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,639
time tobacco would probably be be the

1130
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:03,079
you know and it's still not the same not

1131
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:04,920
even close so but everybody's like oh I

1132
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:06,280
just grow this like like like big

1133
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,480
everybody's worried about Big Egg coming

1134
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:09,960
in which is it is already here it's

1135
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,599
already here it's already but but at the

1136
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:15,480
same time you don't smoke cotton yeah

1137
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:15,480
you don't smoke corn not

1138
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,599
yet you know so I always think that

1139
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:21,440
that's the difference you know what I'm

1140
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,838
saying when big big big egg comes in you

1141
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,960
know it's just sort of like the the

1142
00:41:22,838 --> 00:41:26,000
difference between uh Hot House tomatoes

1143
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,119
that you see in the grocery store and

1144
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,599
heirloom tomatoes that you grow at your

1145
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:33,039
own house yeah we know that there is

1146
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:36,160
there is almost it's almost not too one

1147
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:37,800
is not a tomato right an airlo tomato

1148
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:39,559
that doesn't look you know that funky

1149
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:41,560
that you grew in your garden that from

1150
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:45,078
Heirloom Seeds is a

1151
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:47,039
tomato well there's more varieties of

1152
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:49,318
cannabis than any other Agricultural

1153
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:51,679
Product out there there's way more

1154
00:41:49,318 --> 00:41:53,159
variety and availability of different

1155
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:55,519
varieties than anything else you look at

1156
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:57,279
Tomatoes how many types of tomatoes even

1157
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:58,838
if we talk about heirloom tomatoes that

1158
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:01,119
available to the general public in

1159
00:41:58,838 --> 00:42:02,719
grocery stores there's a very limited

1160
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,318
amount there's only four there's only

1161
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:05,799
four at the most in every grocery store

1162
00:42:04,318 --> 00:42:07,559
yeah and we talk about bananas there's

1163
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,119
one right there's one you might get a

1164
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:11,199
plantain or one of those miniature

1165
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:13,599
bananas right right and then pineapples

1166
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:17,879
I was just GNA just GNA say there's like

1167
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:20,000
four well there's four what what I just

1168
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:23,280
recently realized is the varietal

1169
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,679
strands of sugar cane oh wow yeah and

1170
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,400
and their characteristics which is

1171
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:29,838
exciting so I like sugarcane I think

1172
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:31,559
it's it's really amazing I love rum so

1173
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:33,838
yeah yeah I like

1174
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:35,680
sugar that's the uh that was back to

1175
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:39,519
original topic about you know uh

1176
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:41,078
prohibition and stuff and our parents uh

1177
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:42,759
and the generations before you know

1178
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:43,880
looking down on that but you're like but

1179
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,960
they would make you sweet tea or

1180
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:47,800
Kool-Aid yeah you know until this day

1181
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:49,599
sugar doesn't you know doesn't get the

1182
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,280
bad name it deserves the cancer causing

1183
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:53,720
dude it's the worst sugar is the single

1184
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:55,480
worse yes that is worse than alcohol it

1185
00:42:53,719 --> 00:42:59,199
is worse than tobacco it's more

1186
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:00,559
addictive than heroin yes sugar is D and

1187
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:04,480
what it does to your body and how your

1188
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:06,960
body body you diabetic it kill you it'll

1189
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,838
cause cancer it feeds cancer cancer

1190
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,400
cells that's why you got a cal plunge

1191
00:43:08,838 --> 00:43:13,480
it's extremely important Cal plunging

1192
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:17,358
builds Brown fat cells Brown fat cells

1193
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:20,318
need uh glucose they require glucose to

1194
00:43:17,358 --> 00:43:21,799
maintain and so if you do coal plunging

1195
00:43:20,318 --> 00:43:23,880
you build up that brown fat cells the

1196
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,200
glucose or even just a cold shower the

1197
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,680
brown fat competes with your cancer

1198
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:29,000
cells right exactly cold showers were

1199
00:43:26,679 --> 00:43:30,960
good too just really that cold PL will

1200
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,280
get you that the brown Fates you sit in

1201
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,920
there 2 minutes 5 minutes 10 minutes 30

1202
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,119
minutes I can't do more than about two

1203
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:39,240
and a half it depends on how cold it is

1204
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:41,200
I just I go five minutes has been my

1205
00:43:39,239 --> 00:43:43,358
go-to okay right I like the five minute

1206
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:45,279
threshold but I feel like the I get the

1207
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:47,279
most benefit because it takes me two

1208
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,640
minutes just to relax fully like where

1209
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,800
I'm breathing and I got my breathing

1210
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:52,598
down and then I can get three minutes of

1211
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,318
breathing in to where I'm fully relaxed

1212
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:56,680
and I get out and I feel just amazing

1213
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:59,318
it's awesome so and and I also do the

1214
00:43:56,679 --> 00:44:02,759
SAA so I go oh yeah you know I do that

1215
00:43:59,318 --> 00:44:06,920
four times a week yeah love I love the

1216
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:09,800
uh post-workout cannabis SAA combo yeah

1217
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:11,800
that's yeah sometimes when I smoke if I

1218
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:14,119
smoke too much and then I try to go in

1219
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:15,920
it's 10 times hotter than your brain is

1220
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:18,519
your brain is like what are you doing

1221
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:20,440
well and then I sweat like crazy I mean

1222
00:44:18,519 --> 00:44:22,239
I like the sweating part but man

1223
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:25,440
sometimes I just overheat yeah I became

1224
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:27,159
a fan of foam insulation and I

1225
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,880
definitely think Grow rooms could use it

1226
00:44:27,159 --> 00:44:31,639
I've been big promoter I built a house

1227
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:33,119
in Texas you know Austin a couple years

1228
00:44:31,639 --> 00:44:35,118
ago and the guy introduced it to me it

1229
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,720
was pretty much new then and the only

1230
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:38,200
thing that we are concerned with is off

1231
00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:40,558
gasing you know it's a chemical process

1232
00:44:38,199 --> 00:44:43,799
sort of like rosin or or anything like

1233
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:47,079
that so but uh it basically turns your

1234
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:48,720
house or room into a Yeti cooler oh wow

1235
00:44:47,079 --> 00:44:50,359
so I've been trying to promote that I

1236
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:52,078
like Yeti Coolers right well they work

1237
00:44:50,358 --> 00:44:54,358
really well I also like rockwool did you

1238
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:57,200
know the same rock wool that's in the

1239
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:59,920
Grow rooms are installation it's in

1240
00:44:57,199 --> 00:45:03,039
listen as a as a person who makes media

1241
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:05,039
yeah Coco is our is our go-to we're one

1242
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:06,960
of the first you know because was the

1243
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:08,318
first yeah right you were one of the

1244
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,800
first people with Coco out there right

1245
00:45:08,318 --> 00:45:13,440
right we were one of the first to

1246
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:15,480
realize that uh one you have to have uh

1247
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,200
you have to Quality Source the Coco you

1248
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,960
can't just go to Sri Lanka or India

1249
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:19,759
which a lot of people do and that's fine

1250
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,358
sure but you're going to have

1251
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:23,119
inconsistencies so you're going to want

1252
00:45:21,358 --> 00:45:24,880
to do your own cocoa just like you do

1253
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:28,240
your own nutrients or your own tra or

1254
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:31,200
your own Coco farm right so we we worked

1255
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:32,558
on that and we also realized that you

1256
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:34,039
know Coco has been around as a meeting I

1257
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:35,640
think it hit a World's Fair in 18

1258
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:37,719
something it was like introduced in 18

1259
00:45:35,639 --> 00:45:39,239
like one of the F you know over aund

1260
00:45:37,719 --> 00:45:42,039
something years has been known as a

1261
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:43,439
reusable media right but it has these

1262
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:44,800
unique properties that nobody really

1263
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:48,079
quite understood that we put a lot of

1264
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:51,119
research into which is one it's it's cow

1265
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:52,880
mag deficient so it needs to be buffered

1266
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:56,720
for sure right so your nutrient either

1267
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,720
either you need to pre-buffering

1268
00:45:57,199 --> 00:46:02,679
to the nutrient mix to get a higher you

1269
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:04,318
know uh or you need to use hard water

1270
00:46:02,679 --> 00:46:06,159
right that's what we relied on when we

1271
00:46:04,318 --> 00:46:09,119
first came into the States was people

1272
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:10,558
were going to use like LA or or Arizona

1273
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,400
or they're not using RO water they're

1274
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:15,079
using hard water hard water so we sort

1275
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:17,079
of which has cow mag in it sure mostly

1276
00:46:15,079 --> 00:46:20,400
you know some right so so we we

1277
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:23,039
supplemented with that but uh it's also

1278
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:25,200
it's basically like banana peel it's

1279
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:27,279
it's got potassium in it and and as it

1280
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:29,598
degrades and breaks down as you grow it

1281
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:31,240
starts to kick out potassium yeah so you

1282
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:33,640
don't need a high a high

1283
00:46:31,239 --> 00:46:35,118
potassium uh By the time it's flowering

1284
00:46:33,639 --> 00:46:36,358
it's all depends on the media size you

1285
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:38,280
know whether you're using a one gallon

1286
00:46:36,358 --> 00:46:39,838
five gallon or anything larger I don't

1287
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:41,519
know I think that's gone away now right

1288
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:43,679
are we are we done using the 10 gallons

1289
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:45,838
in

1290
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:48,480
production I don't know I mean I think

1291
00:46:45,838 --> 00:46:52,519
at scale yes yes it's scale yes right

1292
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:54,880
Seven's too much for the house no but if

1293
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:57,000
if you want to outside it's a different

1294
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,440
story I'm still talking about indoor

1295
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,440
production cultivation no I don't think

1296
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,440
if we're talking about production I

1297
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,400
think 10 gallons G been gone for a long

1298
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:06,480
time right my aunt and uncle used to

1299
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:08,559
grow living soil 10 gallon pots used to

1300
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,800
crush it yeah and they would have four

1301
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:12,800
10 gallon pots per light so they'd have

1302
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:17,318
less plants they would veg for longer

1303
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:19,079
they top two getting amazing yields you

1304
00:47:17,318 --> 00:47:20,679
know they they were getting amazing

1305
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:21,960
yields yeah you're doing a two-month veg

1306
00:47:20,679 --> 00:47:25,000
on those and you're topping them and

1307
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:28,720
you're really yeah scrogging them yeah

1308
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:30,358
um but I for for commercial I can't

1309
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:31,959
imagine you know unless you're doing

1310
00:47:30,358 --> 00:47:34,119
living soil and you were reusing them

1311
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:37,599
but then you just do a bed right oh dude

1312
00:47:34,119 --> 00:47:40,880
raise beds Y in if you can manage the

1313
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:43,000
maintenance and uh you know the protocol

1314
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:45,200
on a raised

1315
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,838
bed you know now we're talking headier

1316
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:49,960
stuff than production stuff right I I

1317
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:51,400
saw this in the grape world in the wine

1318
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:53,760
you know wine grape world and I

1319
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:56,119
definitely believe it the competition

1320
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:58,359
for nutrients in a raised bed gives you

1321
00:47:56,119 --> 00:48:00,880
a smaller yield but a higher quality

1322
00:47:58,358 --> 00:48:03,000
product yeah depending on the genetics

1323
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,160
obviously Flora flame in Oakland I don't

1324
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
know if you have time to go check them

1325
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:10,399
out and yeah they they're organic living

1326
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,880
soil low till yeah uh you know at scale

1327
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,318
they're doing amazing stuff and they're

1328
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:15,920
in Oakland go figer you know yeah yeah I

1329
00:48:14,318 --> 00:48:17,679
and I I love that I love that that's one

1330
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:20,119
of the guys I I taught me a little bit

1331
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:23,879
in San Francisco he had a he had a spot

1332
00:48:20,119 --> 00:48:26,400
right off cap yeah in the hood and uh he

1333
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:27,960
bought the house you know in the mid

1334
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,559
late 80s but he had this grow in there

1335
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:31,280
and he was just doing raised beds the

1336
00:48:29,559 --> 00:48:33,599
living soil raised beds technique and it

1337
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:35,000
was some of the best fire I'd ever seen

1338
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:38,800
and I was like he's like yeah but it's a

1339
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:40,280
[ __ ] to clean maintain you know but uh

1340
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,400
you know I think I think and more and

1341
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:45,599
more I see I was first I saw the Dutch

1342
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:47,318
method which is one day veg two- day veg

1343
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:48,920
right and you're you're sea of green and

1344
00:48:47,318 --> 00:48:51,519
you're going like yeah because it's

1345
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:53,079
based off the Tulip uh we're just doing

1346
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:54,440
floriculture yeah that's all we're doing

1347
00:48:53,079 --> 00:48:56,400
is we're growing flowers and there is a

1348
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:58,599
whole industry that's been around for

1349
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:01,000
decades uh excuse me centuries yeah and

1350
00:48:58,599 --> 00:49:02,480
the Dutch are the kings of FL Flor

1351
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,039
culture absolutely so I saw this this

1352
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:07,960
method back early on and I was like oh

1353
00:49:05,039 --> 00:49:12,239
so you I would put 49 in a

1354
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:14,400
4x4 you know uh try to get half gal pots

1355
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:16,078
you and Ed rosenal dude every

1356
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,000
everybody's like you know I get more and

1357
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:21,079
I was like no no no no not only do I get

1358
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,119
more per 4x4 I use less light yeah and I

1359
00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:25,318
get more cut more rounds down in a year

1360
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:26,440
right and everybody's like you know no

1361
00:49:25,318 --> 00:49:29,358
because I I knew a lot of guys who were

1362
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:31,159
doing four on a 4x4 yeah you know that's

1363
00:49:29,358 --> 00:49:32,639
closer to what you you know you you were

1364
00:49:31,159 --> 00:49:34,318
discussing yeah and I was like you're

1365
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:36,558
just you're listen you're putting a lot

1366
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:38,159
of time and money because everything is

1367
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:40,000
everything in this world's based off

1368
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:42,000
time yeah everything's basic basically

1369
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,039
based off the 30-day mortgage payment

1370
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:48,199
the 30-day rent the 30-day electric bill

1371
00:49:44,039 --> 00:49:49,880
the 30-day the two 15-day pay periods

1372
00:49:48,199 --> 00:49:52,039
right so that's how you should dictate

1373
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:54,720
everything is by time and the less time

1374
00:49:52,039 --> 00:49:56,199
you can more out of less time yeah the

1375
00:49:54,719 --> 00:49:58,399
more productive you're going to be

1376
00:49:56,199 --> 00:49:59,639
moreit you make it the end of the year Y

1377
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,079
and the more you're going to be able to

1378
00:49:59,639 --> 00:50:03,199
facilitate other things right so but now

1379
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:04,680
and now more and more I'm seeing

1380
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:07,439
everybody go to the one gallons and I'm

1381
00:50:04,679 --> 00:50:10,239
just like finally like great job one

1382
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:12,480
gallons you know 16 plants per I mean we

1383
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:14,919
do nine right some people you know we're

1384
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:17,039
doing crop steering so everybody's got

1385
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:19,920
their own way right but the less veg

1386
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:21,960
time you do in a smaller pot the more

1387
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:24,798
plant matter you're waste you're not

1388
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:28,280
wasting because if you take a third do

1389
00:50:24,798 --> 00:50:29,559
you if you do your one one month veg

1390
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:32,040
okay and then you flower and then you

1391
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:34,798
harvest and then you take all the root

1392
00:50:32,039 --> 00:50:36,798
yeah and all the stem and all the fan

1393
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:38,400
leaves that you can't get more money out

1394
00:50:36,798 --> 00:50:40,400
of right I mean sometimes you can get a

1395
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,639
little bit of a fan Leaf 4% or something

1396
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,680
right so those turs you can sell turps

1397
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:46,199
off your roots right I don't know who

1398
00:50:44,679 --> 00:50:49,118
buy them but there there's turps in

1399
00:50:46,199 --> 00:50:51,519
those roots I know uh I just buy Chinese

1400
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:54,280
turps it's a joke right I do love the

1401
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:55,679
smell of uh turps in the roof there's

1402
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:58,440
something special about that if you guys

1403
00:50:55,679 --> 00:51:00,358
don't know smell your roots next time

1404
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:03,200
especially if you always do a good stem

1405
00:51:00,358 --> 00:51:06,519
stroke man I am the I am the king of the

1406
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:08,759
the stem stroke yeah dude y that's

1407
00:51:06,519 --> 00:51:11,838
that's the IND the oil the indicator

1408
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:13,559
yeah certain well certain plants just

1409
00:51:11,838 --> 00:51:15,159
Express differently too you know what I

1410
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:16,839
mean and like it's that's their jam some

1411
00:51:15,159 --> 00:51:19,399
of them are like God damn this thing's a

1412
00:51:16,838 --> 00:51:21,000
baby so uh but you know getting getting

1413
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:23,079
away from that you you take all that

1414
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:25,559
product that you can't turn around that

1415
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:27,720
you have to destroy in Most states right

1416
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:30,040
and you weigh that and then you also

1417
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:32,239
take your you add in your another time

1418
00:51:30,039 --> 00:51:33,558
factor is the trim time right now you

1419
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:36,318
know most people are throwing a green

1420
00:51:33,559 --> 00:51:38,440
Bros or or a twister you know they

1421
00:51:36,318 --> 00:51:41,920
better not be but they are they

1422
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:44,599
shouldn't be hand trimming okay dry

1423
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:46,318
triming what dry my my opinion I used to

1424
00:51:44,599 --> 00:51:48,079
trim back in the day wet but I do

1425
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:49,679
believe in dry trim right I do believe

1426
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:51,960
in hanging humble taught me that if

1427
00:51:49,679 --> 00:51:54,598
anything humble and coalo taught me cut

1428
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:56,318
the cut cut it down into big big sizes

1429
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:58,680
let it your hands off let it hang hang

1430
00:51:56,318 --> 00:52:00,838
in the in the barn yep and and you know

1431
00:51:58,679 --> 00:52:03,399
get that two three week drive because

1432
00:52:00,838 --> 00:52:05,199
the moisture the I saw guys I think 14

1433
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:07,318
days is the perfect drive but it depends

1434
00:52:05,199 --> 00:52:09,719
on what how close to the coast you are y

1435
00:52:07,318 --> 00:52:12,119
it also I mean I think style control the

1436
00:52:09,719 --> 00:52:15,719
room 100% for

1437
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:17,640
sure but don't do it uh aggressively

1438
00:52:15,719 --> 00:52:19,719
there was some guys who were dehiding

1439
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:20,879
and I was like you're a cheat just dude

1440
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:22,879
no one you know why no one's buying your

1441
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:25,318
stuff CU you got dehumid in your [ __ ]

1442
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,838
dry room okay right so but you know you

1443
00:52:25,318 --> 00:52:28,838
want to you want to you want that cure

1444
00:52:26,838 --> 00:52:30,558
process to happen you know yeah you know

1445
00:52:28,838 --> 00:52:32,480
and so then that's why I still am

1446
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:34,599
against Colorado weed because it's 10%

1447
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:36,798
humidity and unless you so rough it's

1448
00:52:34,599 --> 00:52:37,960
terms powder Washington's the opposite

1449
00:52:36,798 --> 00:52:39,960
where it's too humid then we got

1450
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:41,400
Colorado that's too dry but anymore you

1451
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:43,639
can have a controlled environment if you

1452
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:45,000
can afford it right I think it depends

1453
00:52:43,639 --> 00:52:46,440
on how how important it is to you you

1454
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,079
know it's s like a cigar I think you

1455
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:50,358
need a humidifier and you need a

1456
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:51,359
dehumidifier yes I think air

1457
00:52:50,358 --> 00:52:53,358
conditioners have a little bit of

1458
00:52:51,358 --> 00:52:54,558
dehumid in them so you can you can cheat

1459
00:52:53,358 --> 00:52:56,000
a little bit there a little bit but you

1460
00:52:54,559 --> 00:53:00,079
still need you want to be able to

1461
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:03,280
control prely through the whole CLE you

1462
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:06,359
know and then some people go 50% the

1463
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:07,559
first day and then bump it towards 63 or

1464
00:53:06,358 --> 00:53:08,838
whatever you want to do you know there's

1465
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:11,839
so many different ways I saw heads that

1466
00:53:08,838 --> 00:53:13,639
were Ivy dripping uh big big plants oh

1467
00:53:11,838 --> 00:53:15,000
wow yeah they would stick they would

1468
00:53:13,639 --> 00:53:17,960
have water dripping it so that they'd

1469
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:20,079
get like a 21 like you know there's the

1470
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:22,798
up on the hill there's some crazy [ __ ]

1471
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:24,680
going on you know you know you know

1472
00:53:22,798 --> 00:53:26,960
they're they're probably doing drugs

1473
00:53:24,679 --> 00:53:30,078
could be you know or you know or drugs

1474
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:32,559
to their plants dude one of my yes well

1475
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:35,000
that was one of the one is is period

1476
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:37,440
blood somebody one of the go yeah I got

1477
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,838
I I take my girls period I like dude

1478
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,200
what a [ __ ] hippie dude I don't want

1479
00:53:38,838 --> 00:53:44,159
to smoke that no smoke that and then one

1480
00:53:42,199 --> 00:53:48,358
mind blower

1481
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:50,159
was growing to the moon cycle indoors

1482
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:52,519
and at first I scoffed and then I

1483
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:55,639
realized gravity is everywhere yeah even

1484
00:53:52,519 --> 00:53:57,159
in the room and the pull of the moon and

1485
00:53:55,639 --> 00:53:58,759
and anything that it affects you know

1486
00:53:57,159 --> 00:54:02,159
people like you're crazy that's crazy I

1487
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:04,400
was like no no I mean harvesting by the

1488
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:06,358
cultivating by the cycles of the Moon

1489
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:08,000
germinating seeds all that stuff I think

1490
00:54:06,358 --> 00:54:10,318
there's a lot of Truth to that yes and

1491
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:13,440
so not that uh it's a GameChanger but it

1492
00:54:10,318 --> 00:54:15,318
is uh a factor right that you could

1493
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:17,318
consider you know and it it all depends

1494
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:19,039
on how much you want to put in into that

1495
00:54:17,318 --> 00:54:20,519
but right I think that nobody should be

1496
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:21,639
in something back to the original point

1497
00:54:20,519 --> 00:54:25,440
no one should be in something larger

1498
00:54:21,639 --> 00:54:29,039
than a two gallon container if you're

1499
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:30,280
indoors on a production level yeah back

1500
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:34,480
in the day I used to buy those Dutch

1501
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:36,559
pots oh yeah five gallon the square ones

1502
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,639
on the bottom or the Dutch leech trays

1503
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:43,000
yeah and you put a 6in slab in that

1504
00:54:38,639 --> 00:54:48,078
Dutch leech tray and then you put 4 to5

1505
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:50,079
DM the 4 iners yeah the DM 10s MH I

1506
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:52,000
think that's right yeah yeah and that's

1507
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:55,599
the jam I still think that's the jam

1508
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,119
yeah you you veg that uh you know for a

1509
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:59,720
couple days and then you put those in

1510
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:02,440
the Dutch you you cut the little in the

1511
00:54:59,719 --> 00:55:05,159
slabs right and then uh you know and you

1512
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:06,838
do that and uh two three days after that

1513
00:55:05,159 --> 00:55:08,719
you flower and because you're only want

1514
00:55:06,838 --> 00:55:10,480
one flower per plant you know what I

1515
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:14,000
mean you you're trying to get one butt

1516
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:17,119
right and then your trim time is

1517
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:19,358
like you know instead of on the green

1518
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:21,519
Bros or the yeah in the Twister where

1519
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:24,880
you're just like oh you just killed it

1520
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:26,838
yeah so I I I understand commercial

1521
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:28,760
people y especially with a trimmer is

1522
00:55:26,838 --> 00:55:31,920
now I mean it used to

1523
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:34,520
be 200 bucks a pound up on the hill but

1524
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:36,079
Christ now that that's half your profit

1525
00:55:34,519 --> 00:55:37,838
right some trimmers can do better than

1526
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:39,400
others you know yeah I don't like any of

1527
00:55:37,838 --> 00:55:41,000
the trimming machines I I think it ruins

1528
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:42,400
weed I think it knocks off tricomes

1529
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,760
there's nothing you can do about it I

1530
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,760
like panel brush I like finger trimming

1531
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:48,520
I like

1532
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:50,480
scissors uh this is how I used to trim

1533
00:55:48,519 --> 00:55:52,480
yes that that technique though you can

1534
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:54,318
tell that's the tech right there for

1535
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:56,559
sure like soon as you get about two

1536
00:55:54,318 --> 00:55:58,400
plants in two two buds in you got all

1537
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:00,559
that resin and some of my best my

1538
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:02,599
favorite product to smoke scissor and

1539
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:04,720
finger hash of course you can't go wrong

1540
00:56:02,599 --> 00:56:06,640
with I know I think it's holistic I

1541
00:56:04,719 --> 00:56:08,838
don't think there's any proof to that's

1542
00:56:06,639 --> 00:56:10,358
but it's like it's like live rosin it's

1543
00:56:08,838 --> 00:56:13,920
like the first you're capturing those

1544
00:56:10,358 --> 00:56:15,519
live turps yeah it is live Ros yeah but

1545
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:17,838
it's live live finger was the first

1546
00:56:15,519 --> 00:56:19,599
first version right of oh I mean and

1547
00:56:17,838 --> 00:56:21,519
those turps were amazing and you put

1548
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:23,480
those in your joint and it'd be like on

1549
00:56:21,519 --> 00:56:25,920
your bowl you put that on your bowl yeah

1550
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:28,000
to match the weed yeah I mean that was

1551
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:30,358
those were days you that's sort of like

1552
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,599
Veno Verde you know what Veno Verde is

1553
00:56:30,358 --> 00:56:34,920
green wine it is the wine you drink to

1554
00:56:32,599 --> 00:56:36,200
when you make wine so in the spring yeah

1555
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:38,440
they take a certain amount of young

1556
00:56:36,199 --> 00:56:40,358
grapes yeah and then they harvest them

1557
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:43,000
and they process them you know let them

1558
00:56:40,358 --> 00:56:45,199
sit and it's only at about four 5%

1559
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,798
alcohol sure because you're just but

1560
00:56:45,199 --> 00:56:49,279
it's the wine you drink while you're

1561
00:56:46,798 --> 00:56:51,159
making wi blood light of right but

1562
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,798
that's sort of like how scissor hash is

1563
00:56:51,159 --> 00:56:55,719
you know that's the hashy smoke while

1564
00:56:52,798 --> 00:56:56,759
you make hash I love it yeah so yeah

1565
00:56:55,719 --> 00:56:59,358
it's interesting

1566
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:01,640
um but trimming I mean I used to all my

1567
00:56:59,358 --> 00:57:03,078
personal I used to keep in mason jars

1568
00:57:01,639 --> 00:57:05,038
like my personal I didn't even really

1569
00:57:03,079 --> 00:57:07,798
trim the the Sugar Leaf off it I'd put

1570
00:57:05,039 --> 00:57:10,839
it in mason jars when I smoke it I would

1571
00:57:07,798 --> 00:57:12,719
trim it and smoke it I I still think

1572
00:57:10,838 --> 00:57:14,679
that's the best way to do it now

1573
00:57:12,719 --> 00:57:16,038
commercially yeah you know you're going

1574
00:57:14,679 --> 00:57:18,480
to get a consumer who's not going to

1575
00:57:16,039 --> 00:57:19,960
want to pay for that right all my Sour

1576
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:21,798
Diesel I used to have like that so like

1577
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:23,720
when I gave jars to my friends like yeah

1578
00:57:21,798 --> 00:57:26,358
Leo from aish the first time I met him I

1579
00:57:23,719 --> 00:57:28,679
gave him a jar of sour it was freaking

1580
00:57:26,358 --> 00:57:31,960
you know it still had all the sugar and

1581
00:57:28,679 --> 00:57:33,598
that is a a lot of the time I'm all

1582
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:35,440
that's still a consumable product I mean

1583
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:37,200
it's sort of like you know I can't think

1584
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:39,159
of any other kind of product like that

1585
00:57:37,199 --> 00:57:41,118
it's like the crust on bread or you know

1586
00:57:39,159 --> 00:57:43,598
what I mean like it's not the best part

1587
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:45,920
but it's no and the thing is is like I

1588
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:47,599
think the the leaf the Sugar Leaf and

1589
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,920
some of those leaves protect all the

1590
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:51,798
other parts of the bud right to a degree

1591
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:53,200
and if if you put and I was getting buds

1592
00:57:51,798 --> 00:57:55,000
where they were like big buds and I put

1593
00:57:53,199 --> 00:57:56,960
in the Mason jar and it's like one bud

1594
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,000
or two buds in there they weren't

1595
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:00,519
getting smashed you'd have this big

1596
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,920
beautiful Bud that had all these this

1597
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:04,280
great shape to it and all this stuff

1598
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:06,079
that was untouched right and we didn't

1599
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:07,440
peel off the banana and you've got a

1600
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:09,039
perfectly good banana right exactly we

1601
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,960
never really touched the tops I didn't

1602
00:58:09,039 --> 00:58:12,559
want fingers on my my buds ever you

1603
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,880
touch the stems whatever you smell it

1604
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:15,760
you can smell it but don't be pinching

1605
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:18,599
my people walk through the room don't

1606
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:20,240
pinch my butts do you know so uh now

1607
00:58:18,599 --> 00:58:21,359
it's not a big deal but well I got

1608
00:58:20,239 --> 00:58:22,558
introduced to this technique you know

1609
00:58:21,358 --> 00:58:23,960
I've seen a lot of people do a lot of

1610
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:25,160
crazy [ __ ] and half of the time I go

1611
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,400
you're just a c and the other half time

1612
00:58:25,159 --> 00:58:29,960
I go you're you got to be a [ __ ]

1613
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:31,318
genius like I don't I I'm you know and

1614
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:33,798
what is that saying you know every every

1615
00:58:31,318 --> 00:58:37,159
genius just called it you know a lunatic

1616
00:58:33,798 --> 00:58:40,759
until everybody goes oh he's a genius uh

1617
00:58:37,159 --> 00:58:44,279
shout out to Tyson Redbeard at root

1618
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:47,280
Celler yeah he uh he's somewhat of a

1619
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:49,519
recluse and the way he tested Bud was

1620
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,039
he'd grab your bud right out of the bag

1621
00:58:49,519 --> 00:58:52,280
or out of the jar yeah take a little

1622
00:58:51,039 --> 00:58:56,839
butt and he

1623
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:58,599
go walk into it I like just an [ __ ]

1624
00:58:56,838 --> 00:59:01,480
right you're just [ __ ] destroying Bud

1625
00:58:58,599 --> 00:59:03,559
right and then I realize no he's kidding

1626
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:05,280
the like there's a part of me like still

1627
00:59:03,559 --> 00:59:06,440
wants to go just being an [ __ ] right

1628
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:08,280
you're just [ __ ] with people and the

1629
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:09,480
other part of me goes I think you're

1630
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:11,200
really getting something out of that I

1631
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:12,599
think there's a little of both right a

1632
00:59:11,199 --> 00:59:14,798
little bit of both you know and anybody

1633
00:59:12,599 --> 00:59:17,160
who knows Tyson out there zest it's like

1634
00:59:14,798 --> 00:59:19,199
the lemon zest of your weed he's zesting

1635
00:59:17,159 --> 00:59:21,239
your butt yeah

1636
00:59:19,199 --> 00:59:22,399
exact you know but I think he was also

1637
00:59:21,239 --> 00:59:25,558
just trying to see how you'd be like

1638
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:27,920
dude you know back in the day that was

1639
00:59:25,559 --> 00:59:31,240
money now you're just like fine yeah you

1640
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:32,559
know yeah that's so with can you guys

1641
00:59:31,239 --> 00:59:35,279
make all kinds of different products you

1642
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:38,240
make stuff for hydro like uh water deep

1643
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:40,519
water culture you have uh organic you

1644
00:59:38,239 --> 00:59:43,879
have you have everything so we were one

1645
00:59:40,519 --> 00:59:47,559
of the first nutrient companies to

1646
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:51,280
figure out that different Medias require

1647
00:59:47,559 --> 00:59:54,880
different um micro and macro and

1648
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:56,039
processes yeah right so we've got your

1649
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,838
basically the first one that we have

1650
00:59:56,039 --> 01:00:00,760
ever came up with before we were really

1651
00:59:57,838 --> 01:00:02,558
a manufacturer when the when the owner

1652
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:04,160
uh was just making it for himself which

1653
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:06,119
a lot of Dutch guys did that's the same

1654
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:08,279
thing as Vander Swan uh of House and

1655
01:00:06,119 --> 01:00:09,960
Garden the old man was growing flowers

1656
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:13,000
and they were BR you know they were both

1657
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:15,440
growing you know that's uh the same uh

1658
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,920
several people in Holland were

1659
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:19,480
legitimate flower Growers yeah and then

1660
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:21,119
illegitimate flower Growers on the side

1661
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:23,480
as well yeah and then they would make

1662
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:26,039
their own nutrients sure and then you

1663
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:27,960
know finally one day the father or the

1664
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:29,480
son or the uncle would be like the

1665
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,559
brother would be like well we can sell

1666
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:31,559
these nutrients and so they would get

1667
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:33,640
into that game and that's basically what

1668
01:00:31,559 --> 01:00:36,760
happen with both house and G and Canada

1669
01:00:33,639 --> 01:00:38,879
no relation but just both so uh the

1670
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:40,799
first was our substra we called it h

1671
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:43,559
they called it Hydro over there but it's

1672
01:00:40,798 --> 01:00:45,759
a run to I say run to drain the the

1673
01:00:43,559 --> 01:00:47,200
traditional is run to waste drain to

1674
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,599
waste or run to waste run to waste but

1675
01:00:47,199 --> 01:00:50,159
no one in America likes that cuz they're

1676
01:00:48,599 --> 01:00:52,760
like the waste of wasting you're like

1677
01:00:50,159 --> 01:00:54,759
yeah it has to run off and then you

1678
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:56,839
don't use that anymore yeah it goes away

1679
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:58,039
yeah it's called runoff so that was uh

1680
01:00:56,838 --> 01:00:59,838
what we call our substra that was our

1681
01:00:58,039 --> 01:01:02,240
Flagship original and then he was like

1682
01:00:59,838 --> 01:01:03,440
well people are recirculating you don't

1683
01:01:02,239 --> 01:01:05,239
you don't have this you can't use the

1684
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:07,679
same nutrient right you need to have a

1685
01:01:05,239 --> 01:01:09,038
you know a pH buffer stabilizer you need

1686
01:01:07,679 --> 01:01:11,358
to have the nutrient somewhat time

1687
01:01:09,039 --> 01:01:15,039
relased because the first and drain or

1688
01:01:11,358 --> 01:01:17,880
right so dwc flood and drain uh dwc I'd

1689
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:20,359
stay tell anybody to stay away from dwc

1690
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:22,640
really I know a couple people that crush

1691
01:01:20,358 --> 01:01:24,480
crush it crush it with here's the

1692
01:01:22,639 --> 01:01:26,639
problem here's the problem as soon as

1693
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:29,599
you get introduced to the s

1694
01:01:26,639 --> 01:01:33,400
it'll fall apart yeah water Can Only

1695
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:35,440
Hold 60% oxygen yeah right in order for

1696
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:38,160
a plant not to have issues it has to be

1697
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:41,318
in at least 18% oxygen so you are on the

1698
01:01:38,159 --> 01:01:43,159
threshold of [ __ ] up and temperature

1699
01:01:41,318 --> 01:01:45,639
uncontrolled that's why most need to

1700
01:01:43,159 --> 01:01:47,318
either be in a cool basement yeah or the

1701
01:01:45,639 --> 01:01:49,719
current culture works because they've

1702
01:01:47,318 --> 01:01:51,278
got full horsepower chillers right so

1703
01:01:49,719 --> 01:01:52,278
that they can keep the temperature down

1704
01:01:51,278 --> 01:01:53,920
especially with the movement of the

1705
01:01:52,278 --> 01:01:56,000
water heing up warm water is also the

1706
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:57,639
issue we talked about that earlier so

1707
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,880
that's the aqua series is for

1708
01:01:57,639 --> 01:02:03,159
recirculating deep water culture uh nft

1709
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:05,440
n which is gone by the wayside right

1710
01:02:03,159 --> 01:02:06,679
have you ever seen an N table not really

1711
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:10,480
it's been a long time yeah deep water

1712
01:02:06,679 --> 01:02:13,519
culture nft uh drain way uh flood and

1713
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:16,199
drain and then uh we realize soil is

1714
01:02:13,519 --> 01:02:19,358
different a Charged soil is going to be

1715
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:22,439
different so uh uh because there should

1716
01:02:19,358 --> 01:02:25,000
be something in the soil like if you use

1717
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:26,920
our substra on you can use it on rock

1718
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:29,920
wool that's the Run drain you can use it

1719
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:32,440
on rock wall you can use it on uh any of

1720
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:33,798
the uh Pete Moss mixes you know I think

1721
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:35,240
Kings mix is close to that doesn't have

1722
01:02:33,798 --> 01:02:38,079
a charge too much of a charge in it

1723
01:02:35,239 --> 01:02:40,519
right right so and or any of the Kings

1724
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:42,480
mix is amazing I D It's amazing yeah

1725
01:02:40,519 --> 01:02:44,639
vital Kings mix those are the ones I

1726
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:46,358
can't and I'm so I was so surprised that

1727
01:02:44,639 --> 01:02:47,879
that wasn't that it took him a minute to

1728
01:02:46,358 --> 01:02:49,278
come out with that product but you know

1729
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:51,680
well that was organic for the longest

1730
01:02:49,278 --> 01:02:54,318
time and then they took it away it's

1731
01:02:51,679 --> 01:02:55,598
still in I don't care I in my mind I

1732
01:02:54,318 --> 01:02:58,000
really you know I think I also think

1733
01:02:55,599 --> 01:03:00,720
that they were dealing with 707 uh the

1734
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:02,199
707 bag from Roots yeah cuz but and it's

1735
01:03:00,719 --> 01:03:04,959
a way fall out from that yeah it's a

1736
01:03:02,199 --> 01:03:07,000
superior product by the way uh and if

1737
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:09,760
you're outdoors and you do a short crop

1738
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:11,278
you just use a bag that was you know so

1739
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:13,520
uh we use that you can use the substra

1740
01:03:11,278 --> 01:03:16,719
in that you use the aqua and the

1741
01:03:13,519 --> 01:03:21,358
recirculating uh cocoa and Coco uh if

1742
01:03:16,719 --> 01:03:23,759
you use our cocoa nutrient the liquid uh

1743
01:03:21,358 --> 01:03:25,838
I would prefer you use my cocoa bag but

1744
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:27,520
if you don't you because there are other

1745
01:03:25,838 --> 01:03:29,679
uh Royal gold mix of Coco out there I

1746
01:03:27,519 --> 01:03:31,480
think tuer I think the tuer is superior

1747
01:03:29,679 --> 01:03:33,960
to their Coco I think it also in sales

1748
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:36,880
is superior it has a charge in it though

1749
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:39,000
yeah but you know uh but uh you want to

1750
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:40,720
stay away from perite you're basically

1751
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,719
you know people always

1752
01:03:40,719 --> 01:03:45,199
like why you put dude and it's

1753
01:03:42,719 --> 01:03:46,598
destructive it's not res it's not Reus

1754
01:03:45,199 --> 01:03:48,480
it's not you know I always used to use

1755
01:03:46,599 --> 01:03:50,798
perite back in the day I know but it's

1756
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:52,920
stay away from perite yeah say just

1757
01:03:50,798 --> 01:03:54,639
whatever you use vermiculate and perate

1758
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:56,720
back in the day I was taught you know I

1759
01:03:54,639 --> 01:03:58,318
went to cowp San Louis for a while and I

1760
01:03:56,719 --> 01:04:00,399
was taught by the botanist and the

1761
01:03:58,318 --> 01:04:02,000
ornamental hlist there how to cut how to

1762
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:04,000
do cuttings right there's no s plus

1763
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,679
there's no such thing as a clone there's

1764
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,119
a

1765
01:04:04,679 --> 01:04:09,480
cutting in the a world in the a world

1766
01:04:08,119 --> 01:04:12,000
they call cuting they're like that's not

1767
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:13,798
a clone it's just a cutting you know but

1768
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,318
things are interchangeable strain is

1769
01:04:13,798 --> 01:04:20,199
almost on the same wave exactly thank

1770
01:04:16,318 --> 01:04:25,798
you so the original cutting

1771
01:04:20,199 --> 01:04:29,679
and high producing agmx was 75% perite

1772
01:04:25,798 --> 01:04:32,000
25% vermiculite constant drip because it

1773
01:04:29,679 --> 01:04:34,838
basically just goes you know yeah goes

1774
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,199
away yeah and so uh and then we have the

1775
01:04:34,838 --> 01:04:37,719
cocoa for the cocoa I'd stay away from

1776
01:04:36,199 --> 01:04:40,159
perlite and cocoa because the properties

1777
01:04:37,719 --> 01:04:41,278
of the cocoa are what we researched our

1778
01:04:40,159 --> 01:04:42,639
cocoa nutrient to be and the more

1779
01:04:41,278 --> 01:04:44,400
perlite you put in there the less Coco

1780
01:04:42,639 --> 01:04:46,038
you have and so the more likelihood our

1781
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:49,160
nutrient isn't going to be optimized not

1782
01:04:46,039 --> 01:04:50,720
that it doesn't work totally okay and uh

1783
01:04:49,159 --> 01:04:53,759
we have an organic but that's going to

1784
01:04:50,719 --> 01:04:56,959
be pre-charged or and then soil soil so

1785
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:59,799
soil cocoa soil for pre charge bag

1786
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:02,559
something like the roots or the basement

1787
01:04:59,798 --> 01:05:04,960
uh basement mix from those guys or or

1788
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:07,720
meno mix right right I think the meno

1789
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:10,838
mix has got better is better for our our

1790
01:05:07,719 --> 01:05:14,399
our soil so that's the uh what we call

1791
01:05:10,838 --> 01:05:19,078
um Tera uh Coco for

1792
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:22,480
Cocoa uh Aqua for Reser and uh substra

1793
01:05:19,079 --> 01:05:24,798
for run to drain yeah and then we've got

1794
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:26,358
we only have one additive the rest uh we

1795
01:05:24,798 --> 01:05:28,679
call uh

1796
01:05:26,358 --> 01:05:30,838
either uh supplements or not really

1797
01:05:28,679 --> 01:05:33,118
supplement but something that just helps

1798
01:05:30,838 --> 01:05:34,920
but it's not needed you know y uh and

1799
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:36,960
the only additive that we suggest is a

1800
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:38,960
PK because PK is a time sensitive

1801
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:42,159
nutrient oh we got something special

1802
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:44,039
here oh yeah I want to talk about yes so

1803
01:05:42,159 --> 01:05:45,879
let's talk about this product I think

1804
01:05:44,039 --> 01:05:48,799
this is amazing we're traling this right

1805
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:52,000
now and I think this is special

1806
01:05:48,798 --> 01:05:54,239
underrated and the problem not the

1807
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,079
problem here here's the deal is we most

1808
01:05:54,239 --> 01:06:00,118
cultivators

1809
01:05:56,079 --> 01:06:02,720
home or uh commercial just take quarter

1810
01:06:00,119 --> 01:06:04,640
strength that was the original GH mix

1811
01:06:02,719 --> 01:06:06,679
right quarter strength of each right and

1812
01:06:04,639 --> 01:06:11,000
that's your baby formula yeah the

1813
01:06:06,679 --> 01:06:14,719
research that we did uh was that the

1814
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:18,400
micronutrient ratio in quarter strength

1815
01:06:14,719 --> 01:06:21,000
full nutrient doesn't have the same that

1816
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:24,000
the plant needs so this product is

1817
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:26,920
specifically for seedlings right popping

1818
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:30,119
seeds and the first two weeks of a

1819
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:33,880
rooted uh cutting yeah and that's

1820
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:36,599
because that plant needs for it to

1821
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:38,480
become a mature plant it is going to

1822
01:06:36,599 --> 01:06:41,440
require different

1823
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:43,159
micronutrients and so that ratio is way

1824
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:44,440
different this is very underrated the

1825
01:06:43,159 --> 01:06:46,358
problem I have with this is most people

1826
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:47,720
don't think it's worth it because

1827
01:06:46,358 --> 01:06:49,598
they're lazy and they don't want to buy

1828
01:06:47,719 --> 01:06:52,480
another bottle right but if you're in

1829
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:55,160
the seed game or in the cutting game

1830
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:57,519
this is a GameChanger that's what we do

1831
01:06:55,159 --> 01:07:00,639
so so yeah I'm excited to test all this

1832
01:06:57,519 --> 01:07:03,239
stuff out I mean yeah this with our

1833
01:07:00,639 --> 01:07:05,440
generous I I got some bottles of this

1834
01:07:03,239 --> 01:07:06,879
stuff I I can't wait to get your

1835
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:10,240
feedback on this because I'm excited

1836
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:11,920
because most people just don't they

1837
01:07:10,239 --> 01:07:13,879
they're trying to save money right and

1838
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:15,240
they're trying to save uh protocols

1839
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:16,640
right you know you I gotta add one more

1840
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:18,598
step in you got to add another nutrient

1841
01:07:16,639 --> 01:07:21,358
and another like yeah but you're going

1842
01:07:18,599 --> 01:07:22,838
to get you know yeah but I think also a

1843
01:07:21,358 --> 01:07:24,519
lot of people don't collect data so

1844
01:07:22,838 --> 01:07:26,239
they're like well it's not that big of a

1845
01:07:24,519 --> 01:07:29,079
deal but it's like okay okay so if you

1846
01:07:26,239 --> 01:07:31,199
can have your clones to Market sooner

1847
01:07:29,079 --> 01:07:33,240
your cuting you can have those to to

1848
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:35,318
Market sooner so instead of it taking

1849
01:07:33,239 --> 01:07:37,038
two weeks back to our time thing yeah

1850
01:07:35,318 --> 01:07:39,519
exactly back to the time thing now if we

1851
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:42,640
can save three days on that or two days

1852
01:07:39,519 --> 01:07:43,960
or even one day over the per imagine if

1853
01:07:42,639 --> 01:07:46,118
you didn't get in charge rent for the

1854
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:49,000
first three days yeah you only had to

1855
01:07:46,119 --> 01:07:50,920
pay 27 days worth of rent you know

1856
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:53,119
that's the now I like to use or mortgage

1857
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:55,240
or or you know well and and talking

1858
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:56,838
about if you're using seeds like let's

1859
01:07:55,239 --> 01:07:59,000
let's say you're growing from seeds at

1860
01:07:56,838 --> 01:08:01,239
scale you I mean and you get a higher

1861
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:03,239
ratio of seeds that not only germinate

1862
01:08:01,239 --> 01:08:05,798
but that thrive once they're germinated

1863
01:08:03,239 --> 01:08:07,239
I think that's what I'm excited about

1864
01:08:05,798 --> 01:08:08,838
that's what I'm excited about now we

1865
01:08:07,239 --> 01:08:10,598
collect the data so we'll be able to go

1866
01:08:08,838 --> 01:08:12,318
side by side I'm really excited about

1867
01:08:10,599 --> 01:08:14,318
that I'm because you are absolutely

1868
01:08:12,318 --> 01:08:16,039
correct it is amazing to me how many

1869
01:08:14,318 --> 01:08:17,759
people out there they know what the root

1870
01:08:16,039 --> 01:08:19,198
temperature of the room is yeah they

1871
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:21,039
know what the nutrient mix is they know

1872
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:23,639
what their dosatrons at or whatever they

1873
01:08:21,039 --> 01:08:25,079
know all that but they're like but what

1874
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:26,480
did you did you look into this did you

1875
01:08:25,079 --> 01:08:29,600
look into

1876
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:30,838
no no I I know it already yeah how do

1877
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:32,679
you know it well how does this compare

1878
01:08:30,838 --> 01:08:34,880
to this or how does this compare to that

1879
01:08:32,679 --> 01:08:37,798
and we have to have that mindset now

1880
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:39,880
it's not like it used to be it can't be

1881
01:08:37,798 --> 01:08:41,759
we just do it because we do it right

1882
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:43,400
like there's nothing that goes on in our

1883
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:45,719
facility we don't just do it because we

1884
01:08:43,399 --> 01:08:47,879
do it we want to do it in the best way

1885
01:08:45,719 --> 01:08:49,279
most efficient way possible and also we

1886
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:50,838
want to be able to give feedback to our

1887
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:52,080
customers on how to get the best results

1888
01:08:50,838 --> 01:08:55,238
whether it's with seeds whether it's

1889
01:08:52,079 --> 01:08:57,119
with you know cuting clones uh whatever

1890
01:08:55,238 --> 01:08:58,639
it is to get the best product for them

1891
01:08:57,119 --> 01:09:01,119
so they can be successful because it's a

1892
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:02,719
tough time in the industry so the more

1893
01:09:01,119 --> 01:09:04,479
time everywhere like the more you

1894
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:06,319
Empower me the more I Empower my

1895
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:08,399
customer the more they get better

1896
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:09,920
results and so that they can hopefully

1897
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:12,479
make more money and continue to buy

1898
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:14,359
seeds or continue to buy clones right

1899
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:16,919
I've always said that I you know the the

1900
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:19,480
the more I make my the more I make my

1901
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:20,920
customer make more money the more they

1902
01:09:19,479 --> 01:09:24,198
will have a likelihood of buying things

1903
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:26,640
for me right so uh you can foler this

1904
01:09:24,198 --> 01:09:29,278
just like our ronic uh you know

1905
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:31,000
everything I have has to for its

1906
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:33,480
application to work no matter what

1907
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:36,719
liquid I'm selling you has to have Roots

1908
01:09:33,479 --> 01:09:39,838
yeah all right but there is there is uh

1909
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:42,000
there is uptake in Le in foler it's not

1910
01:09:39,838 --> 01:09:44,439
of the same ratio and so a lot of people

1911
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,679
who do cuting and do not have Roots at

1912
01:09:44,439 --> 01:09:48,719
The Cutting you can foler certain things

1913
01:09:46,679 --> 01:09:50,359
like arizo or this but the minute you

1914
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:52,719
see Roots you want to start feeding the

1915
01:09:50,359 --> 01:09:55,560
roots it's awesome so yeah dude this

1916
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:57,239
this product is inexpensive uh easy to

1917
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:58,679
use you only use it for the problem I

1918
01:09:57,238 --> 01:10:00,519
think also too is most people are like I

1919
01:09:58,679 --> 01:10:01,880
only use it for two weeks like that's at

1920
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:03,560
the longest like you know because then

1921
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:05,400
you're going to want to start putting in

1922
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:07,239
a mature uh nutrient solution yeah

1923
01:10:05,399 --> 01:10:09,879
higher higher ratios Y and with

1924
01:10:07,238 --> 01:10:11,119
different micro and macro uh ratios M

1925
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:12,800
that's the other thing too is I I don't

1926
01:10:11,119 --> 01:10:16,000
know if the world knows quite knows why

1927
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:17,920
the people you know I think luckily due

1928
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,719
to people like you and me and other

1929
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:21,440
educated people out there there's a

1930
01:10:19,719 --> 01:10:23,719
reason there's three numbers on a bottle

1931
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:24,919
yeah because it's the ratio MH right

1932
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:27,359
it's not I like of people it needs more

1933
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:31,480
nitrogen well you know anybody out there

1934
01:10:27,359 --> 01:10:33,799
Google uh nutrient wheel every nutrient

1935
01:10:31,479 --> 01:10:35,439
has at least one other nutrient effects

1936
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:37,039
so if you add more nut more nitrogen you

1937
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:38,519
may affect the calag uptake if you had

1938
01:10:37,039 --> 01:10:40,119
more phosphorus you're definitely

1939
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:42,800
messing with the PK and iron uptake and

1940
01:10:40,119 --> 01:10:44,519
as you know so I I suggest anybody go

1941
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:46,279
out there and Google nutrient wheel get

1942
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:47,640
that image and see yeah just for their

1943
01:10:46,279 --> 01:10:49,920
own piece of Mind knowing that you can't

1944
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:52,360
just add one because there is no even if

1945
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:54,560
it says 5 Z yeah there's other things in

1946
01:10:52,359 --> 01:10:56,238
there besides nitrogen yeah and the

1947
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:58,880
other two numbers phosphor and potassium

1948
01:10:56,238 --> 01:11:00,000
aren't 100% like one's at 35 because

1949
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:03,719
it's potach and the other is at

1950
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:05,880
phosphorous Rock which is 65% right so

1951
01:11:03,719 --> 01:11:07,840
yeah people have to I I just like to

1952
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:10,199
educate people on that you know and I

1953
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:11,719
think it's confusing well a lot of stuff

1954
01:11:10,198 --> 01:11:14,759
is counterintuitive and people don't

1955
01:11:11,719 --> 01:11:16,079
want to ask and no and and that's why

1956
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:18,280
there's things called soil science

1957
01:11:16,079 --> 01:11:21,519
degrees and botney degrees and or

1958
01:11:18,279 --> 01:11:23,559
there's also you know we have Google you

1959
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:25,840
know there's Google and YouTube I mean

1960
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:28,280
you can learn a lot on YouTube YouTube

1961
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:30,920
for sure go ask your AI program you know

1962
01:11:28,279 --> 01:11:33,279
it's like there's you know now stop stop

1963
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:36,279
stop you might not get the right

1964
01:11:33,279 --> 01:11:38,000
information okay bat in B out remember

1965
01:11:36,279 --> 01:11:40,359
yeah yeah but I think there's all kinds

1966
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,679
of places we can get information besides

1967
01:11:40,359 --> 01:11:43,399
like the show the show and and other

1968
01:11:42,679 --> 01:11:46,840
this

1969
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:49,399
show I I is is just so awesome that we

1970
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:52,119
can do this I really appreciate people

1971
01:11:49,399 --> 01:11:57,439
like you doing this so that there is the

1972
01:11:52,119 --> 01:12:00,519
ability to get data collected years of

1973
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:04,319
experience information

1974
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:05,800
without you know going to school or

1975
01:12:04,319 --> 01:12:07,119
trusting you know we used to I worked at

1976
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:08,480
a retail store and one of our shirts

1977
01:12:07,119 --> 01:12:09,800
that I wanted to make was on the front

1978
01:12:08,479 --> 01:12:11,799
it says your buddy and on the back is

1979
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:13,880
full of [ __ ] yeah you know how many

1980
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:16,960
times Well my buddy my friend you're

1981
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:17,719
like why are you asking me right he

1982
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:19,279
doesn't even know what the [ __ ] he's

1983
01:12:17,719 --> 01:12:20,840
talking about you know what I mean so

1984
01:12:19,279 --> 01:12:22,559
yeah and shows like this which is tried

1985
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:24,480
and true tested you know you're you're

1986
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:26,840
spending the rest of your day trying to

1987
01:12:24,479 --> 01:12:28,559
figure out what the you know the

1988
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:30,800
protocols and the procedures and the is

1989
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:32,480
it a half a m is it four Mills is it

1990
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:34,320
once a day is it every other day is it

1991
01:12:32,479 --> 01:12:36,479
twice a day is it every week is it you

1992
01:12:34,319 --> 01:12:39,599
know is it at night is it during the day

1993
01:12:36,479 --> 01:12:42,919
you know do I use under canopy lights

1994
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:45,079
too you know to whater one of my

1995
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:48,600
inventions that uh you can go ahead and

1996
01:12:45,079 --> 01:12:53,319
have was the tent made out of

1997
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:58,960
t5s really I was going to have a t the T

1998
01:12:53,319 --> 01:13:00,840
all three all surface was just a t5s

1999
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:03,480
yeah yeah dude under canop be light for

2000
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:05,679
sure or I wanted to do like I always

2001
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:07,678
wanted to do myar on the floor yeah but

2002
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:10,359
it just gets dirty totally you know what

2003
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:12,920
I mean so yeah under canopy light for

2004
01:13:10,359 --> 01:13:14,960
sure yeah you know and uh this sounds

2005
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:19,639
like something for Burning Man

2006
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:22,119
too for sure uh you know the T5 room

2007
01:13:19,639 --> 01:13:24,880
exactly make it all red light right

2008
01:13:22,119 --> 01:13:26,679
that's that's the jam Right Far red yeah

2009
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:28,560
uh I think I think the other thing that

2010
01:13:26,679 --> 01:13:32,279
I want our industry to discover is what

2011
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:35,679
this scientific C uh indoor cultivation

2012
01:13:32,279 --> 01:13:36,960
needs more UV yeah it just does out

2013
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:39,920
that's why sungrown is some of the best

2014
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:42,279
weed it it has the disadvantage of

2015
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:45,279
environmental impacts like wind rain

2016
01:13:42,279 --> 01:13:47,119
animals other you know uh not so much

2017
01:13:45,279 --> 01:13:50,000
sun well there's more variables there's

2018
01:13:47,119 --> 01:13:53,158
there's less you don't control control

2019
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:55,399
right and so but that sun yeah well

2020
01:13:53,158 --> 01:13:57,319
that's my God first of all you know and

2021
01:13:55,399 --> 01:14:00,319
the power of that sun and it's one of

2022
01:13:57,319 --> 01:14:03,238
its aspects is UV the future is mixed

2023
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:05,119
light yeah for sure uh PL lighting is

2024
01:14:03,238 --> 01:14:07,399
coming out with that I've always said

2025
01:14:05,119 --> 01:14:09,000
that I don't want to knock any uh and I

2026
01:14:07,399 --> 01:14:13,039
know I get a lot of push back from this

2027
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:15,520
on LEDs but LEDs have a lot less UV than

2028
01:14:13,039 --> 01:14:18,719
any of your double-ended or your Mogul

2029
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:20,960
based HIDs and so we've lost a lot on

2030
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:25,679
that and I think that you need to

2031
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:27,158
supplement UV when you use LEDs so

2032
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:30,639
there's still a lot of things that we're

2033
01:14:27,158 --> 01:14:32,158
learning about light light spectrum you

2034
01:14:30,639 --> 01:14:34,400
know we have Spectrum tuning now which

2035
01:14:32,158 --> 01:14:37,799
is really cool yeah but uh you know we

2036
01:14:34,399 --> 01:14:40,759
had uh Grandmaster LED Thomas from

2037
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:43,639
Grandmaster LED on the show and he's

2038
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:45,920
talking about his bug Light that helps

2039
01:14:43,639 --> 01:14:49,039
eradicate thrips and mites dude you

2040
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:51,079
using UVC it it it works it's really

2041
01:14:49,039 --> 01:14:52,399
cool it works and it and it's but it's

2042
01:14:51,079 --> 01:14:53,920
just the beginning it's just the

2043
01:14:52,399 --> 01:14:55,719
beginning we're just scratching the

2044
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:58,000
surface of all this cool stuff right I

2045
01:14:55,719 --> 01:15:00,000
think every year there's innovation made

2046
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,600
in certain places we've been kind of

2047
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,359
stagnant on some of the stuff well I

2048
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:06,400
mean we fighting the uh on the LED

2049
01:15:04,359 --> 01:15:08,198
situation the culture and people like us

2050
01:15:06,399 --> 01:15:10,759
who have been doing it for a long time

2051
01:15:08,198 --> 01:15:14,638
with the I get off my lawn old man thing

2052
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:18,360
is there was four to eight generations

2053
01:15:14,639 --> 01:15:21,119
of LED uh LEDs that were gimmicks oh

2054
01:15:18,359 --> 01:15:22,439
yeah I mean I talked about for long it

2055
01:15:21,119 --> 01:15:26,639
started with the blur Poes and I said

2056
01:15:22,439 --> 01:15:30,359
I'd never use LEDs UFO yeah I mean these

2057
01:15:26,639 --> 01:15:32,119
are examples of why I so open-minded now

2058
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:34,719
because I've seen I've been in the

2059
01:15:32,119 --> 01:15:36,158
industry long enough to where I was

2060
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:37,679
there when femin seeds were first

2061
01:15:36,158 --> 01:15:39,479
sitting the market and we were like no

2062
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:41,600
dude they're gonna ruin the genan pool

2063
01:15:39,479 --> 01:15:43,198
autoflow then it was autoflow and it was

2064
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:45,880
like they're going to ruin the Jean Pool

2065
01:15:43,198 --> 01:15:49,359
and now I breed out of flow and then it

2066
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:50,920
was the LEDs and I was like no now I'm

2067
01:15:49,359 --> 01:15:52,599
like well let's see what happens you

2068
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:54,399
know I'm I would rather just instead of

2069
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:55,800
saying no that's not going to work I

2070
01:15:54,399 --> 01:15:57,559
want to see the future that once they

2071
01:15:55,800 --> 01:16:00,199
have it dialed in right with everything

2072
01:15:57,560 --> 01:16:02,639
and and it's it's never like I mean

2073
01:16:00,198 --> 01:16:03,960
listen uh it's unfortunate but a lot of

2074
01:16:02,639 --> 01:16:07,440
the stuff comes from other Industries

2075
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:10,719
you know we knew about uh metal uh metal

2076
01:16:07,439 --> 01:16:13,799
Hy uh the uh high pressure sodium metal

2077
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:16,079
halides and way before they were ever a

2078
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:18,000
consumable product in the in the in the

2079
01:16:16,079 --> 01:16:20,920
you know indoor cultivation and I was

2080
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,439
like what I want one like they're

2081
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:24,719
they're still one of the best Mogul

2082
01:16:22,439 --> 01:16:26,719
bases right or plasma lights they still

2083
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:28,840
have haven't seen a you know plasma

2084
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:30,560
lights you know and plasma lights have

2085
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:32,600
been around forever and they have you

2086
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:34,000
know Wonderful applications that you

2087
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:35,400
know of course A lot of these things

2088
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,399
create heat and everybody's trying to

2089
01:16:35,399 --> 01:16:39,559
that's the that's the L LED stick but

2090
01:16:37,399 --> 01:16:42,399
then I realize that their de their you

2091
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:43,600
know their dpd was way off because they

2092
01:16:42,399 --> 01:16:46,439
didn't quite get it that you actually

2093
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:48,320
need that heat yeah and that moisture

2094
01:16:46,439 --> 01:16:50,439
from the plant or you know so now you've

2095
01:16:48,319 --> 01:16:51,559
got to mulate that when you use LEDs and

2096
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:53,399
that's not a negative that's just

2097
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:54,600
knowing and not knowing right you know

2098
01:16:53,399 --> 01:16:55,799
so you've got to because you're like

2099
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:58,440
well at least you have the opportunity

2100
01:16:55,800 --> 01:17:00,600
to control the situation and and and be

2101
01:16:58,439 --> 01:17:02,158
in charge of the inputs right yeah cuz

2102
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:03,880
for the longest time the first LEDs

2103
01:17:02,158 --> 01:17:05,399
people were like and not and not you're

2104
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:07,199
like oh you're missing a factor You're

2105
01:17:05,399 --> 01:17:10,279
missing two or three factors yeah one is

2106
01:17:07,198 --> 01:17:11,319
heat one is moisture yeah and you know

2107
01:17:10,279 --> 01:17:13,679
you're going to have to somewhat

2108
01:17:11,319 --> 01:17:15,158
supplement how those you don't have to

2109
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:17,000
add heat you probably have to add

2110
01:17:15,158 --> 01:17:20,079
moisture and take out moisture at

2111
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:23,639
certain times sure but you know and so

2112
01:17:20,079 --> 01:17:26,198
yeah our our us the open mind thing is

2113
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:29,279
is definitely you know just it's like

2114
01:17:26,198 --> 01:17:30,479
uh it comes with age too it does when

2115
01:17:29,279 --> 01:17:32,000
you're in your 20s you think you know

2116
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:34,399
everything and then by the time you get

2117
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,880
to your 40s I don't know a goddamn thing

2118
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:39,879
I don't know you realize that you don't

2119
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:41,400
know [ __ ] yeah and if you still think

2120
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:43,600
you know [ __ ] you got something wrong

2121
01:17:41,399 --> 01:17:44,879
you know because you've learned that

2122
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:47,079
you're not as smart as you thought you

2123
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:49,319
were in in every aspect right you might

2124
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:51,319
be focused and and expert in one thing

2125
01:17:49,319 --> 01:17:53,039
yeah but there's a gazillion things that

2126
01:17:51,319 --> 01:17:54,639
you could focus on and become an expert

2127
01:17:53,039 --> 01:17:56,880
so you can't be an expert in everything

2128
01:17:54,639 --> 01:17:57,800
yeah and and and I also think that uh

2129
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:01,159
you know I

2130
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:02,960
think the uh I grow the best weed is got

2131
01:18:01,158 --> 01:18:05,119
to be one of the worst things I've heard

2132
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:06,920
well so so this is an ego thing and it's

2133
01:18:05,119 --> 01:18:08,800
also a pride thing right you you take

2134
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:12,679
pride in it and and the thing is it'll

2135
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:15,639
blind you arrogantly yeah I mean this is

2136
01:18:12,679 --> 01:18:17,880
like ego will blind you because you've

2137
01:18:15,639 --> 01:18:20,840
grown this thing and you've been part of

2138
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:22,679
its life through its whole lifespan

2139
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:24,840
right from the time it was a clone or it

2140
01:18:22,679 --> 01:18:27,039
was a seed and you've grown with this

2141
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:29,520
thing and it's they were babies right

2142
01:18:27,039 --> 01:18:32,760
yeah and then you harvest it and you you

2143
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:34,960
have it and in your mind you're you and

2144
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:36,079
obviously some people are are much

2145
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,520
different than other I think the guys

2146
01:18:36,079 --> 01:18:38,840
that are the biggest critics usually

2147
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:40,960
have the best weed they never think

2148
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:44,000
their weed is good enough right uh you

2149
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:45,880
know sfk my buddy that grows for sfk he

2150
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,600
he's always trying to grow better weed

2151
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:49,359
and he still thinks he doesn't have it

2152
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:51,520
down even when it's the best he's like

2153
01:18:49,359 --> 01:18:54,279
oh no he knows when it's good but he's

2154
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:56,440
it's like he's one of those guys that

2155
01:18:54,279 --> 01:18:57,800
every time he has a harvest he's like

2156
01:18:56,439 --> 01:19:00,158
what could I do better next time it's

2157
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:01,480
not like I nailed it and I nail it every

2158
01:19:00,158 --> 01:19:02,839
time and some of these guys are like

2159
01:19:01,479 --> 01:19:04,839
dude my wheat is the best and they'll

2160
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:06,560
come up to me and they're like dude the

2161
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:09,079
best Harvest ever man you got to smoke

2162
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:11,120
it mine is the best or or my other

2163
01:19:09,079 --> 01:19:12,679
friends Pizza this is the pizza thing

2164
01:19:11,119 --> 01:19:13,800
that we have they oh everybody thinks

2165
01:19:12,679 --> 01:19:15,480
they make the best pizza we're gonna

2166
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:17,400
have a contest between my friends yeah

2167
01:19:15,479 --> 01:19:20,519
yeah but uh cannabis

2168
01:19:17,399 --> 01:19:22,319
guys but yeah I mean ego is a ego is a

2169
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:23,920
you know there's harsh reality that goes

2170
01:19:22,319 --> 01:19:25,279
along with that too it's like can you

2171
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:26,760
sell the product cu because if it's so

2172
01:19:25,279 --> 01:19:29,399
good then why aren't you selling it

2173
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:32,719
right right and I think that right it

2174
01:19:29,399 --> 01:19:34,638
comes down to being able to do a lot of

2175
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:36,198
AB testing and finding out what works

2176
01:19:34,639 --> 01:19:40,239
best for you and for your room and

2177
01:19:36,198 --> 01:19:42,879
really being able to uh distill all the

2178
01:19:40,238 --> 01:19:45,359
stuff that you're doing down into Data

2179
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:46,960
that you can analyze right I think that

2180
01:19:45,359 --> 01:19:48,479
has a lot to do with it I mean that's

2181
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:50,719
why these nutrient companies are so

2182
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:52,319
successful with testing out their

2183
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:54,279
recipes now because they can because

2184
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:55,799
it's legal and they have no problem

2185
01:19:54,279 --> 01:19:58,198
testing on cannabis I mean some of them

2186
01:19:55,800 --> 01:20:00,360
did it before anyway yeah but now you

2187
01:19:58,198 --> 01:20:02,719
can do it legally pretty much and you

2188
01:20:00,359 --> 01:20:04,359
can do it with your clients and you know

2189
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:06,079
I mean a lot of these guys have

2190
01:20:04,359 --> 01:20:08,719
chromatography that they're using for

2191
01:20:06,079 --> 01:20:10,559
stuff you know and it's like pretty

2192
01:20:08,719 --> 01:20:12,279
amazing pretty we're in an amazing place

2193
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:14,520
you guys are doing amazing stuff oh yeah

2194
01:20:12,279 --> 01:20:16,279
thank you thank you I I I think I also

2195
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:18,880
this is uh one of

2196
01:20:16,279 --> 01:20:22,719
the platforms that I want to talk to

2197
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:25,800
Growers about is that uh price per

2198
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:28,760
gallon of nutrient yeah no one

2199
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:30,360
cares and you shouldn't either MH

2200
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:32,000
because cuz that's that that has been

2201
01:20:30,359 --> 01:20:34,639
the last two three years and we we all

2202
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:38,479
know that came from there's some crazy

2203
01:20:34,639 --> 01:20:42,159
expensive stuff there is there is and is

2204
01:20:38,479 --> 01:20:44,638
it better does it give you the same

2205
01:20:42,158 --> 01:20:46,679
percentage like if so if it cost you 20%

2206
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:48,319
more are you getting 20% more yield

2207
01:20:46,679 --> 01:20:50,079
right right and then you know and people

2208
01:20:48,319 --> 01:20:51,399
would point to me and say well you're

2209
01:20:50,079 --> 01:20:52,399
the most expensive nutrient on there I

2210
01:20:51,399 --> 01:20:54,879
was like I'm not the most expensive

2211
01:20:52,399 --> 01:20:58,399
nutrient in fact in fact if you run Coco

2212
01:20:54,880 --> 01:21:00,719
in a bag of cocoa and you buy one of my

2213
01:20:58,399 --> 01:21:03,960
$4.95 lers of

2214
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:07,920
PK I probably will cost you 50 bucks a

2215
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:09,760
4x4 yeah people like no no I'm like then

2216
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:11,800
do the math do the math yeah you know

2217
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:13,920
now now do I sell boost that's uh

2218
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:15,560
somewhere around 100 bucks a liter at at

2219
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:19,560
full retail

2220
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:21,520
yes but it does it increase uh

2221
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:23,400
concentration production yeah are you

2222
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:24,400
getting banged for the buck right so at

2223
01:21:23,399 --> 01:21:27,279
the end of the day it's all about bang

2224
01:21:24,399 --> 01:21:28,559
for but but you know things like uh I

2225
01:21:27,279 --> 01:21:29,719
always stay away from mentioning another

2226
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:32,159
product but there were products out

2227
01:21:29,719 --> 01:21:34,359
there made by uh manufacturers one that

2228
01:21:32,158 --> 01:21:35,839
changed the game that had 13 bottles

2229
01:21:34,359 --> 01:21:37,559
when it first came out and it did change

2230
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:40,239
the game it did change the game and but

2231
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:44,239
some of its uh stuff I was like that's

2232
01:21:40,238 --> 01:21:47,000
just [ __ ] like sake oil there's a lot

2233
01:21:44,238 --> 01:21:49,439
of a stin oil there's a lot of nutrients

2234
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:52,000
out there there's no reason no and then

2235
01:21:49,439 --> 01:21:55,119
there was dark energy well and listen

2236
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:57,319
and you dark energy and was the other

2237
01:21:55,119 --> 01:21:59,279
one they had they worked were they worth

2238
01:21:57,319 --> 01:22:02,039
the price liquid Karma and dark energy I

2239
01:21:59,279 --> 01:22:05,719
love those things so so for me Dark

2240
01:22:02,039 --> 01:22:07,039
Energy was 100% worth it they still so

2241
01:22:05,719 --> 01:22:09,520
they banned it in California so

2242
01:22:07,039 --> 01:22:12,840
basically seelp is now banned because

2243
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:15,400
it's a a natural pgr so pgrs are banned

2244
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:17,800
so because it's a pgr even though it's

2245
01:22:15,399 --> 01:22:20,479
seelp it is banned in

2246
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:23,760
California go figure but dark energy for

2247
01:22:20,479 --> 01:22:27,638
me 25 years ago maybe even a little bit

2248
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:29,480
longer made by American hydroponics in

2249
01:22:27,639 --> 01:22:30,880
it was such a game changer for me though

2250
01:22:29,479 --> 01:22:32,839
it was like I didn't know what I was

2251
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:34,800
doing before that's how I felt like when

2252
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:38,520
we harvested and it was done and we

2253
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:40,079
smoked it it was like what were we doing

2254
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:42,280
this is where it's at right right and

2255
01:22:40,079 --> 01:22:44,319
it's you have those aha moments

2256
01:22:42,279 --> 01:22:46,000
throughout your life it's like you

2257
01:22:44,319 --> 01:22:47,880
figure it out you know and then that was

2258
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,560
like whoa this is what really good we

2259
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:51,359
when you're growing this is but really

2260
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:53,480
this is the this is the next I've got to

2261
01:22:51,359 --> 01:22:54,839
the next level and then that's when as

2262
01:22:53,479 --> 01:22:57,919
someone we were talking about ear who

2263
01:22:54,840 --> 01:23:00,159
recognizes that you don't or puts that

2264
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:01,840
on yourself that I may not be growing

2265
01:23:00,158 --> 01:23:04,439
the best weed because there is no such

2266
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:06,319
thing as the best weed right right it it

2267
01:23:04,439 --> 01:23:07,799
can always be a little better and once

2268
01:23:06,319 --> 01:23:09,799
in a while you'll see that from like the

2269
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:11,520
worst grower you're like you're like

2270
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:13,639
what the [ __ ] did you do and he's like I

2271
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:16,159
don't know yeah well even from Harvest

2272
01:23:13,639 --> 01:23:18,159
to harvest so there's if you look at

2273
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:20,039
flower there's 70 days in the life of a

2274
01:23:18,158 --> 01:23:22,000
plant if you equate it to like a human

2275
01:23:20,039 --> 01:23:23,399
that's like a year for every day that

2276
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,439
plant is alive is like a year in a

2277
01:23:23,399 --> 01:23:27,399
human's life right and so there's so

2278
01:23:25,439 --> 01:23:31,678
many little micro variables that can go

2279
01:23:27,399 --> 01:23:34,079
on within that room within the dayto day

2280
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:36,239
hour the night the the temps the

2281
01:23:34,079 --> 01:23:39,439
humidity all those things that you can

2282
01:23:36,238 --> 01:23:42,000
control to a degree indoors but at the

2283
01:23:39,439 --> 01:23:44,158
same time from one Harvest to the next

2284
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:46,760
that's why it's hard to create constant

2285
01:23:44,158 --> 01:23:49,319
you know chovar that are consistently

2286
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:50,719
expressing the same chemical profile

2287
01:23:49,319 --> 01:23:53,279
it's a lot harder than people think

2288
01:23:50,719 --> 01:23:55,600
watering alone yeah you you just can't

2289
01:23:53,279 --> 01:23:57,719
like the situ situation may be different

2290
01:23:55,600 --> 01:24:00,440
that that morning and then the retention

2291
01:23:57,719 --> 01:24:02,679
of the media may be different well if

2292
01:24:00,439 --> 01:24:04,359
you're using hard water the water

2293
01:24:02,679 --> 01:24:06,600
changes throughout the year so there's

2294
01:24:04,359 --> 01:24:08,839
nothing consistent about hard water

2295
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:10,079
water coming from you know if you're if

2296
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:12,560
you're in the city and you're using

2297
01:24:10,079 --> 01:24:15,000
water you're not distilling it or you

2298
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:17,880
know if if you're not using R right

2299
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:21,198
reverse mimosis removing removing get it

2300
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:22,520
down like you know Z to five yeah you

2301
01:24:21,198 --> 01:24:24,599
know at least you

2302
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:27,679
know but you know I mean there's

2303
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:29,800
benefits to ro but it's very wasteful um

2304
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:32,679
I you know and like we have a RO system

2305
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:35,039
for the misters got yeah yeah so you

2306
01:24:32,679 --> 01:24:37,920
don't get clogs and right yeah yeah

2307
01:24:35,039 --> 01:24:40,840
exactly yeah but if your water is at

2308
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:42,158
160 which is like Colorado is less than

2309
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:44,119
that you know all that snow melt that

2310
01:24:42,158 --> 01:24:48,198
they get and even in Denver you know but

2311
01:24:44,118 --> 01:24:50,359
if your water is 160 or less I would

2312
01:24:48,198 --> 01:24:52,519
have to see some hard data on why you're

2313
01:24:50,359 --> 01:24:56,639
going to take the extra 160 out you know

2314
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:59,000
unless it's got a spe specific uh heavy

2315
01:24:56,639 --> 01:25:01,239
metal in it like it ran through some

2316
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:03,000
weird lead pipes and it's pathogens if

2317
01:25:01,238 --> 01:25:05,359
you want to prevent pathogens and you

2318
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:06,479
know you you're susceptible there's

2319
01:25:05,359 --> 01:25:09,319
stuff that gets brought in through the

2320
01:25:06,479 --> 01:25:11,799
water for sure right but uh you know I

2321
01:25:09,319 --> 01:25:13,960
mean clean room practices and but a lot

2322
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:16,159
of times all you need is a decorin nator

2323
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:19,158
yeah you know and which I would suggest

2324
01:25:16,158 --> 01:25:20,519
everybody who's getting water from a

2325
01:25:19,158 --> 01:25:23,039
city a

2326
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:25,159
municipal uh Source yeah should

2327
01:25:23,039 --> 01:25:27,079
definitely at least get a small boy or a

2328
01:25:25,158 --> 01:25:29,439
large boy or any other product made that

2329
01:25:27,079 --> 01:25:31,000
dechlorinates it cuz chlorine especially

2330
01:25:29,439 --> 01:25:32,599
if you're doing the living you know I

2331
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,479
don't I don't soil science one it will

2332
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:36,320
change your EC though for sure it will

2333
01:25:34,479 --> 01:25:38,000
change your EC as it's pulling stuff out

2334
01:25:36,319 --> 01:25:40,039
as it's cleaning the it yeah and you

2335
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:42,359
won't get chlorine which is good I mean

2336
01:25:40,039 --> 01:25:44,238
but at least let your water sit 24 hours

2337
01:25:42,359 --> 01:25:45,439
if you're not doing that you know the

2338
01:25:44,238 --> 01:25:47,319
problem what I have with that and I

2339
01:25:45,439 --> 01:25:50,158
agree with that is that most water

2340
01:25:47,319 --> 01:25:52,679
treatment places now use several

2341
01:25:50,158 --> 01:25:55,679
versions of you know chloramine

2342
01:25:52,679 --> 01:25:57,199
chloramide not just

2343
01:25:55,679 --> 01:26:00,719
yeah and those

2344
01:25:57,198 --> 01:26:03,839
don't intentionally don't just dissipate

2345
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:06,279
through through uh just you know sitting

2346
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:08,800
there yeah so you they don't evaporate

2347
01:26:06,279 --> 01:26:10,519
like like Corine does so you you you

2348
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:13,039
know I would always and especially if

2349
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:15,199
you're in soil you know the thing we're

2350
01:26:13,039 --> 01:26:18,198
a synthetic company we do make an

2351
01:26:15,198 --> 01:26:20,279
organic bio you can't get it in

2352
01:26:18,198 --> 01:26:21,678
California uh it's unfortunate but you

2353
01:26:20,279 --> 01:26:23,439
know in the rest of the states most of

2354
01:26:21,679 --> 01:26:24,760
them I think all all the others you can

2355
01:26:23,439 --> 01:26:28,000
get uh the

2356
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:30,719
bio but if you're using anything in soil

2357
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:33,600
you're definitely want to get cuz you're

2358
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:35,880
and if you're using any sort of sugar to

2359
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:38,079
feed uh any of the cultures that are in

2360
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:40,359
there you know your traderma and your

2361
01:26:38,079 --> 01:26:43,039
all the bacilus right the chlorine kills

2362
01:26:40,359 --> 01:26:45,639
that on purpose so that's why You' want

2363
01:26:43,039 --> 01:26:46,519
to if you're in a soil mix you you you

2364
01:26:45,639 --> 01:26:50,159
you know and you want to reap the

2365
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:53,159
benefits of having a Charged soil yeah

2366
01:26:50,158 --> 01:26:54,399
and organic happy soil yeah yeah yeah

2367
01:26:53,158 --> 01:26:56,960
you don't want to put poison in there

2368
01:26:54,399 --> 01:27:00,679
yeah just like I suggest a lot of people

2369
01:26:56,960 --> 01:27:03,279
in the in the hydro game like to use uh

2370
01:27:00,679 --> 01:27:06,000
H2O2 in a routine maintenance and I

2371
01:27:03,279 --> 01:27:08,198
think that's like treating a cold with

2372
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:11,198
chemotherapy if you if you can keep a

2373
01:27:08,198 --> 01:27:14,559
clean system without constantly adding

2374
01:27:11,198 --> 01:27:16,879
H2O2 because H2O2 is is H2O2 is H

2375
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:18,400
chlorine dioxide right it's no it's uh

2376
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:19,400
hydrogen peroxide it's hydrogen yeah

2377
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:20,920
okay yeah yeah yeah which basically

2378
01:27:19,399 --> 01:27:24,319
kills any organic material it comes in

2379
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:27,359
contact with because the radical yeah

2380
01:27:24,319 --> 01:27:29,960
you're right yeah so but if you you know

2381
01:27:27,359 --> 01:27:32,920
it's it's excessive it's hcl2 is

2382
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:36,399
chlorine dioxide right right so which

2383
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:39,639
which iside is good for certain certain

2384
01:27:36,399 --> 01:27:41,238
application right CLE cleaning um clean

2385
01:27:39,639 --> 01:27:46,079
all your trays with with chlorine

2386
01:27:41,238 --> 01:27:47,759
chloride a bleach right and do all your

2387
01:27:46,079 --> 01:27:49,960
if you're G to you know if you're I used

2388
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:51,679
to clean hydren yeah and I would do that

2389
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:53,679
with h and you don't need a lot of H2O2

2390
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:55,679
that's the thing is you don't need a lot

2391
01:27:53,679 --> 01:27:57,158
but it's only cleaning for maintenance

2392
01:27:55,679 --> 01:27:59,239
same thing with chlorine dioxide like

2393
01:27:57,158 --> 01:28:02,799
CO2 we only use that to clean the lines

2394
01:27:59,238 --> 01:28:04,919
dri it it'll go absolutely right but you

2395
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:07,039
you you know it's pretty destructive if

2396
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:08,319
you use it as a routine a routine thing

2397
01:28:07,039 --> 01:28:09,800
no you don't use it for anything else

2398
01:28:08,319 --> 01:28:12,799
you know so but it's great for eating

2399
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:14,079
all that stuff that's in yes you know so

2400
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:16,119
that's another benefit of ours is we

2401
01:28:14,079 --> 01:28:18,519
have a low salt index you know I just a

2402
01:28:16,118 --> 01:28:21,158
couple more plugs on Cana is we have a

2403
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:23,159
low one of the lowest salt indexes yeah

2404
01:28:21,158 --> 01:28:24,559
uh oh and that's huge for using driers

2405
01:28:23,158 --> 01:28:26,238
right you it's like I think think a lot

2406
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:27,800
of pro and using Organics you don't want

2407
01:28:26,238 --> 01:28:29,158
to use drippers obviously because they

2408
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:30,760
clog I think that's the problem with a

2409
01:28:29,158 --> 01:28:32,759
lot of salts that people are using a lot

2410
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:35,520
of salts have a lot of problems because

2411
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:37,719
of that you know Fallout d da and I'm

2412
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:40,000
not I don't like to bash because salts

2413
01:28:37,719 --> 01:28:41,600
have their place but you're you're going

2414
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:43,520
to run into issues but they will build

2415
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:46,119
up they will build up in your L and then

2416
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:48,320
that that that influences your your your

2417
01:28:46,118 --> 01:28:50,559
pennies per people go you know I can get

2418
01:28:48,319 --> 01:28:52,439
it for four 4 cents a gallon I'm like

2419
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:54,360
did you include labor did you include

2420
01:28:52,439 --> 01:28:55,279
the stock tank did you include the space

2421
01:28:54,359 --> 01:28:57,079
that you could have been using for

2422
01:28:55,279 --> 01:28:58,960
something else did you include your

2423
01:28:57,079 --> 01:29:00,399
dripper maintenance did you include all

2424
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:02,079
the other factors and they're like I

2425
01:29:00,399 --> 01:29:03,399
like can I see your spreadsheet on 4

2426
01:29:02,079 --> 01:29:05,479
cents a gallon because if it's really 4

2427
01:29:03,399 --> 01:29:07,279
cents a gallon I'd [ __ ] like to see

2428
01:29:05,479 --> 01:29:08,399
that because I'd like to sell that yeah

2429
01:29:07,279 --> 01:29:10,279
and people are like no I didn't do a

2430
01:29:08,399 --> 01:29:12,158
spreadsheet so you're just doing the

2431
01:29:10,279 --> 01:29:14,559
simple math of a 100 gallons and how

2432
01:29:12,158 --> 01:29:16,118
much it cost to make you 100 gallons and

2433
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:17,960
you didn't include any other [ __ ]

2434
01:29:16,118 --> 01:29:21,479
external factors that are involved in

2435
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:23,840
that you're like then then no right and

2436
01:29:21,479 --> 01:29:26,919
and no one cares you don't put that on a

2437
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:29,000
back this is [ __ ] you know uh runs

2438
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:31,520
made with [ __ ] three cents a gall and

2439
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:34,238
[ __ ] they wouldn't buy it no right you

2440
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:35,440
know so people just don't care no but

2441
01:29:34,238 --> 01:29:37,638
what they do care about is the quality

2442
01:29:35,439 --> 01:29:39,759
of the end product and The Branding

2443
01:29:37,639 --> 01:29:41,679
Unfortunately The Branding kind of I was

2444
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:44,199
just at my friend's dispensary and we

2445
01:29:41,679 --> 01:29:45,800
were talking and this is an age old I

2446
01:29:44,198 --> 01:29:49,118
feel somewhat

2447
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:52,840
sympathetic for and sad for the brand

2448
01:29:49,118 --> 01:29:55,198
new generation of consumers who care how

2449
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:58,039
shiny the myar back bag is they get

2450
01:29:55,198 --> 01:30:01,479
duped into buying inferior products by

2451
01:29:58,039 --> 01:30:03,319
high-end marketing right all the time

2452
01:30:01,479 --> 01:30:06,678

2453
01:30:03,319 --> 01:30:08,599
Hill Farms dude that guy Johnny yeah

2454

2459
01:30:16,279 --> 01:30:20,238
doing it the right way I feel like with

2460
01:30:18,039 --> 01:30:23,719
with good ethics right right and they

2461
01:30:20,238 --> 01:30:25,959

who's uh yeah doing it so so if you had

2467
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:43,880
one piece of advice for your younger

2468
01:30:41,279 --> 01:30:45,920
self that was just getting into the

2469
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:50,679
industry what would that one piece of

2470
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:52,840
advice be I Pro I locked out by being uh

2471
01:30:50,679 --> 01:30:56,800
osmosis information and adjacent

2472
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:59,560
information but I would suggest to

2473
01:30:56,800 --> 01:31:04,000
anybody who wants to get into this to

2474
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:07,080
take a few courses at a college in one

2475
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:10,560
in soil science and the other is in a

2476
01:31:07,079 --> 01:31:12,118
botney maybe organic chemistry those

2477
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:16,480
that

2478
01:31:12,118 --> 01:31:18,880
knowledge uh will separate you from all

2479
01:31:16,479 --> 01:31:22,198
the other cultivators yeah just that

2480
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:24,719
couple semesters well maybe maybe three

2481
01:31:22,198 --> 01:31:27,399
you know soil science 101 yeah B

2482
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:28,560
whatever botney classes is and biochim

2483
01:31:27,399 --> 01:31:31,399
like and you got to put yourself you got

2484
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:34,000
to that's the hard part is you're like

2485
01:31:31,399 --> 01:31:36,279
and I locked out and the other advice

2486
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:37,560
that I would give to anybody is I forgot

2487
01:31:36,279 --> 01:31:40,079
I always forget the name because it was

2488
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:43,280
such a jarring experience but those

2489
01:31:40,079 --> 01:31:44,519
two-day seminars in management God

2490
01:31:43,279 --> 01:31:46,399
what's the company called there's a

2491
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:48,679
there's a guy it's named after him and

2492
01:31:46,399 --> 01:31:49,759
but he sends people around and uh I

2493
01:31:48,679 --> 01:31:52,560
can't remember what it is but Tony

2494
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:55,280
Robbins yeah is it Tony Robbins is it no

2495
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:58,840
it's somebody else but

2496
01:31:55,279 --> 01:32:02,000
basically learn how to man if you want

2497
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:03,679
to you can't be dude having a couple

2498
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,479
duplexes or a couple bedrooms or

2499
01:32:03,679 --> 01:32:07,079
basement okay but the minute you get

2500
01:32:05,479 --> 01:32:09,439
into your position or any other position

2501
01:32:07,079 --> 01:32:12,439
yeah you got to learn management skills

2502
01:32:09,439 --> 01:32:13,839
and and and sometimes you don't like

2503
01:32:12,439 --> 01:32:15,079
what the management skill taught you

2504
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:17,279
like you got to like you got to fire

2505
01:32:15,079 --> 01:32:19,559
your junky friend right you know what I

2506
01:32:17,279 --> 01:32:20,920
mean yeah it's it's tough hiring friends

2507
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:22,679
man that's one of the toughest things

2508
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:24,279
ever is hiring friends working with I

2509
01:32:22,679 --> 01:32:27,239
love working with my friends get me

2510
01:32:24,279 --> 01:32:29,639
wrong but hiring friends is it's tough

2511
01:32:27,238 --> 01:32:32,399
um classes I think classes that I would

2512
01:32:29,639 --> 01:32:35,480
I you can take classes I love the work

2513
01:32:32,399 --> 01:32:36,879
culture and also you know being a chef

2514
01:32:35,479 --> 01:32:38,000
you were also a chef we didn't really

2515
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:40,440
talk about that on the show but you were

2516
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:42,479
a chef in San Francisco I was a chef in

2517
01:32:40,439 --> 01:32:44,359
San Francisco you that and that's you

2518
01:32:42,479 --> 01:32:46,718
want to talk about a pressure situation

2519
01:32:44,359 --> 01:32:49,039
yeah those were uh you know I can't even

2520
01:32:46,719 --> 01:32:50,198
watch my wife is watching the bear and

2521
01:32:49,039 --> 01:32:51,279
halfway through I'm like I'm going to go

2522
01:32:50,198 --> 01:32:53,158
I'm going to go outside so funny most

2523
01:32:51,279 --> 01:32:56,158
chefs I know don't want go outside this

2524
01:32:53,158 --> 01:32:58,000
is this isst PTSD yeah I I worked as a

2525
01:32:56,158 --> 01:33:00,679
line cook over there and I worked on the

2526
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:02,039
grill you know some restaurants and and

2527
01:33:00,679 --> 01:33:04,000
you know that that's a high pressure

2528
01:33:02,039 --> 01:33:07,399
thing but the one thing I really love

2529
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:10,359
about the restaurants is basically it's

2530
01:33:07,399 --> 01:33:12,079
a mentorship program right like you you

2531
01:33:10,359 --> 01:33:15,599
Mentor the people underneath you and I

2532
01:33:12,079 --> 01:33:17,880
feel like our industry is very very much

2533
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:20,119
just like that like if you if you're a

2534
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:22,239
good manager what you do is you Mentor

2535
01:33:20,118 --> 01:33:24,039
The People Under you you teach them

2536
01:33:22,238 --> 01:33:25,919
everything you know so that they can be

2537
01:33:24,039 --> 01:33:27,279
the best person that they can be and

2538
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:28,760
then hopefully they grow up to be like

2539
01:33:27,279 --> 01:33:30,759
