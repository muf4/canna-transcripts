most nice but uh let's let's start off

19
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,679
with how you got involved with cannabis

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,960
I was young I was a teenager uh my mom

21
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:57,000
was dating a guy who uh grew she wasn't

22
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:59,280
a consumer of cannabis and he always had

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,039
uh you know flower around the house I

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,359
don't know if it was impressed mom or

25
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,198
something like that but there was always

26
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:08,000
like these you know large outdoor you

27
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:09,840
know you know big baseball bats so when

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,799
I was a kid I just clip the bottom off

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,560
here and there and I didn't even smoke

30
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:15,840
at the time we were just you know we we

31
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,680
didn't have you know lots of money right

32
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,439
you know I just knew if if I if I sell

33
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,720
this to the Stoners I can get some money

34
00:01:20,438 --> 00:01:26,118
I can buy a skateboard and that was the

35
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:27,719
motivation at 145 years old wasn't until

36
00:01:26,118 --> 00:01:29,118
I was you know a little bit older in my

37
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:30,478
teenage years where I actually started

38
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:33,319
consuming it

39
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:36,000
and then um just natural progression you

40
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:37,438
know just went into you know then you

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,478
know next thing you know you're growing

42
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:41,919
well were similar ages those were

43
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:44,280
special times in the early 90s oh yeah

44
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,240
definitely definitely so I mean I used

45
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,799
to drive down to Santa Cruz yeah I've

46
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,798
told the story in my podcast many times

47
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:51,079
but I used to get the the strawberry Bud

48
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:52,479
from Santa Cruz there was nothing

49
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:54,599
strawberry about it it was skunk but it

50
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,200
was strawberry shaped buds okay we used

51
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:57,879
to drive for an eighth we would you know

52
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,478
for $60 eighth we would drive all the

53
00:01:57,879 --> 00:02:02,118
way to Santa Cruz which was over an hour

54
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:03,840
away yeah for an eth yeah you know but

55
00:02:02,118 --> 00:02:05,359
we loved that weed it was insane and

56
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,598
it's funny because names didn't mean

57
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:10,560
what they mean now necessarily yeah so a

58
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:12,639
lot of times it was just the kill yeah

59
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,439
or some crippler or whatever you know

60
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:17,518
whatever the name was at the time yeah U

61
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:19,120
we had uh you know back then yeah

62
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:21,200
exactly names weren't really you know

63
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,878
you had a few strains that were Northern

64
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:24,679
Lights you know the just the old school

65
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:26,719
originals but everything after that was

66
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,360
just kind of make up a name yeah you

67
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,959
know the mid90s it was like just make up

68
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,360
a name I was up in County and I was like

69
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,239
the young guy who was moving all the

70
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,920
older guys stuff I'm like well what is

71
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,280
it they're like it's weed kid and I'm

72
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:40,839
like you got to give it a name just name

73
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,080
it something and I could put a price on

74
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,878
it then and that's when all the names

75
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,400
started coming around you know and

76
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:49,318
everyone just started nameing stuff and

77
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,599
I remember the meno pers was like we got

78
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:54,878
meno perss but it was like probably like

79
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:56,318
four different uh different strains so

80
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:58,239
it wasn't specific it was but it was

81
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:00,079
from Menino and it was purple so we call

82
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,360
it the menal pers yeah yeah yeah had

83
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,120
that was definitely you know we saw the

84
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,519
meno perss around back then uh gosh what

85
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:10,400

93
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,439
that I was working with you know and

94
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,479
each group had their own strain that

95
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:33,000
they you know they focused on so and a

96
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:34,639
you know big chunk of that came from

97
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,519
some some blue dream guys I had some

98
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:38,798

yeah cap his was big back then but then

103
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:50,359
the strains coming out of Eugene Oregon

104
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:53,919
we got a lot of genetics from there the

105
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,840
the four-way we got this the snow not

106

you know kind of put me and my group of

134
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:51,800

136
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,600

football size pounds where where like

147
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,439

148
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:21,559
people that it's actually a gram or a

149

pound you know people like that's a

150
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,079
quarter pound it's if you compared it to

151
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,439
outdoor it would be a quarter of the

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,918
but it's you know so long ago I can't

165
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:57,079
remember any of those yeah we I remember

166
00:05:54,918 --> 00:06:00,198
the Juicy Fruit specific juy Orange

167
00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:03,159

00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,800
flying over there and bringing back

172
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:11,199
seeds going to the cuups going to the

173
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,199
cuffs and saying you guys we do it

174
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,680
better here in Northern California yeah

175
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,079
like they they harvest theirs in six

176
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,400
weeks it's premature it's this it's that

177
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:21,120
it's we do it better here I like oh wow

178
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:23,038
so there's no need for you know to go

179
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,639
other than the experience I never went

180
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:26,639
but I every time a friend went hey bring

181
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,478
me back this and some of the first stuff

182
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,160
that I brought back was uh well that I

183
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:33,038
had was sensey Seedbank

184
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,360
yeah G13 hash plant says he had good

185
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:35,680
really good stuff back in the day not

186
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,759
that they don't have good stuff now but

187
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,959
back in the day that was the seed bank

188
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,439
you know it's like Greenhouse got good

189
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:44,239
stuff other people had good stuff too

190
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:47,000
but sensey had like the real Durban yeah

191
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,879
right like the real deal genetics it was

192
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,918
like oh dude you got the Sensei yeah I

193
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:54,319
had Hindu Kush from them as well Jack

194
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:56,918
Flash Jack Flash [ __ ] amazing Jack

195
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,680
Flash wasn't like the jack that people

196
00:06:56,918 --> 00:07:02,639
know today it was funky it was it was

197
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,720
hung in it would burn your nose and uh

198
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,478
you don't see a lot of that stuff

199
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,160
anymore and I haven't seen Jack Flash in

200
00:07:05,478 --> 00:07:10,079
25 years yeah I haven't seen you know

201
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,520
even just Jack just straight Jack R I

202
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,399
haven't seen that in a long time either

203
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:15,240
some people you know there's same blue

204
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:16,679
love and hate right you know well then

205
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,240
like what people think of as Jack

206
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,038
Herrera is I feel like it's changed a

207
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,720
lot too it's very linear now but the

208
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:24,279
Jack back in the day that we saw as Jack

209
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:27,280
Herrera was not linear it was it was

210
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:29,959
still limey but it was pungent and

211
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:31,559
strong really strong yeah uh and looked

212
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:33,680
amazing in the back it had like this

213
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,478
there was lime green and looked amazing

214
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,319
yeah I had a couple of friends they had

215
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:40,959
uh they were running uh William Williams

216
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:43,319
Wonder yeah willly Jack willly Jack yeah

217
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:45,000
and had it didn't have all pod looking

218
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:47,280
yeah it didn't have that bag appeal you

219
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,038
know our senses our eyes first and then

220
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:51,239
our smell so you would look at it and go

221
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:53,759
H and then you would open up you go whoa

222
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:56,400
yeah okay let's work with this totally

223
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:59,080
the Durban was like that back in the day

224
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:02,000
uh a the sour sometimes sour could be

225
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:05,079
like really fingery and grow fox tails

226
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,079
still be freaking amazing yeah totally I

227
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:08,639
still whenever I mean I rarely step foot

228
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:10,598
into a dispensary but every once in a

229
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,639
while I do just to see what's going on

230
00:08:10,598 --> 00:08:16,240
you know you see it's just all you know

231
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,560
desserts fruits candies yeah purple gas

232
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,400
you know and I'm always like where's the

233
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,839
sour where's the chem where's the OG and

234
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:25,000
and they just you know you can't do you

235
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:26,318
know sour and production once you've

236
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,158
shown a company that you can give them

237
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,560
5.6 runs a year they're not going to let

238
00:08:28,158 --> 00:08:32,879
you throw a 10 week into that cycle I

239
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,399
think even access to the genetics is

240
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:37,719
really really hard yeah CU I have yet to

241
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:39,038
see really amazing sour everyone keeps

242
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:41,240
talking about it but they keep on

243
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:44,720
bringing me stuff that's not like the

244
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,839
sour that I remember yeah I I I agree

245
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,080
but even BL dream I see I see good Blue

246
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:50,279
Dream but I don't see like the blue

247
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,920
dream that we had back in the day was

248
00:08:50,278 --> 00:08:53,159
the you know people talk [ __ ] about blue

249
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:54,919
dream now a lot because they don't know

250
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:57,519
what really good Blue Dream is blue

251
00:08:54,919 --> 00:09:00,039
dream was the apical of structure it it

252
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:03,679
was it was the top as far as looks it

253
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:05,639
looked the best it grew sticky it grew

254
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:08,719
it had its own I wouldn't say pungent

255
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:10,439
but it was strong blueberry nose and it

256
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,959
just the the pounds looked amazing you

257
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,880
open a pound of Amazing Blue Dream

258
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:16,239
you're like [ __ ] that's some of the best

259
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:17,720
looking stuff I've ever seen yeah and

260
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,159
maybe it doesn't smoke how you want it

261
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,839
to smoke or whatever but that it was

262
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:22,679
special in its own right oh yeah and it

263
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,399
was just an easy grower yeah it was the

264
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:26,439
EAS easy was so heavy it was like a

265
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,958
no-brainer like all the beginning people

266
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,000
who like started growing with me and I

267
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,518
taught him how to grow I always gave him

268
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,600
blue drink yeah then they thought they

269
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:35,519
were Champs until they tried to grow OG

270
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,720
yeah why is there all the PM everywhere

271
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,240
welcome to some real stuff now yeah I

272
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,879
mean there's a lot more challenging

273
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,399
genetics I that don't yield as well I I

274
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:44,720
like a lot of those things yeah you know

275
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:48,000
a lot of the stuff that doesn't yield

276
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,240
well it's it's shitty for 60 days and

277
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,159
then you get to smoke and you're like oh

278
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:55,360
yeah this is why I did it

279
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:58,000
exactly yeah it's funny yeah so yeah

280
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,120
Canadian and then uh for a while there I

281
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,720
was working with some guys I was

282
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,600
probably like 19 or 20 they uh they had

283
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,000
a strain this was the first time you

284
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,560
know we always talk about you know

285
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,360
hoarding you know people like not

286
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:11,000
letting the cut out yeah and I worked

287
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,680
with these group of guys I would just I

288
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,200
would move all of their product for them

289
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:16,278
but the cut that they had it was called

290
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,519
gany came from Washington Oregon

291
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:20,278
something like that and these guys held

292
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,278
on to it like it was like you know like

293
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:24,278
the most holiest thing ever like even

294
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:26,838
when I went into the V like I wasn't

295
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:28,838
allowed to go into the bedroom by myself

296
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:30,560
wow they escorted me everywhere I went

297
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:33,680
cuz they weren't going to let me slip a

298
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:34,958
cut into my pocket nothing and I worked

299
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:37,479
with those guys for a little while there

300
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:38,559
and unfortunately they um there were

301
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,519
some older guys I was always the

302
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:43,278
youngest guy wherever I went and uh yeah

303
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,120
there was some drug issues with those

304
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:47,799
guys and and when that kind of surfaced

305
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,839
I was like whoa okay nice knowing you

306
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:53,799
guys I'm GNA go this way moved away from

307
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:55,760
them and then uh just you know that

308
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:58,679
natural progression you know what's the

309
00:10:55,759 --> 00:11:01,838
next move well I've I've met all the you

310
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:03,958
know dist rors that I know let's move to

311
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,480
Humble at the time you know some of my

312
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:07,319
friends you know it was it was you know

313
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,759
still pretty scary back then still

314
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,360
happens now these days you know my

315
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:12,799
friends were getting you know hog tied

316
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,440
and thrown in their bathtub you know and

317
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:16,159
and it started getting closer to me it

318
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,399
was like whoa they hit so and so well

319
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:22,399
they hit so and so those are all my guys

320
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:24,958
like I'm out of here and um bounced up

321
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,120
to Humble County and just started there

322
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,119
went up there with a chunk of money

323
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,240
didn't know a soul I knew one person

00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:13,759
another one back in the day seven of

485
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,880
nine the shaman yeah there was a string

486
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:17,640
called the shaman that my buddy is the

487
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,559
one who actually bred the version that

488
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,959
we all got to smoke he took the shaman

489
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:23,639
crossed it with the ramula and the back

490
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,919
crossed it to the shaman and still

491
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,559
called it the shaman but really it was

492
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:30,799
the shaman mhm but uh but either way it

493
00:17:27,558 --> 00:17:32,319
was freaking amazing and the smoke was

494
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:34,359
we had a lot of good stuff to smoke down

495
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:36,079
to the roach that was all unique flavors

496
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:37,918
now a lot of the stuff tastes the same

497
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:39,480
yeah you know I'd say the majority of

498
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,600
stuff out there is like that purple

499
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,160
candy gas yeah you know even I'm

500
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:46,439
breeding mostly purple candy gas is kind

501
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,400
of the direction I go in for 80% then we

502
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,080
got 20 that were pushing in other

503
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,000
different directions yeah I mean even

504
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:55,399
when I was doing you know production

505
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,679
back then during 215 days it was always

506
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,000
like you know 90% production this is

507
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,960
this is what we're selling this is mine

508
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,240
yeah you know these three lights that's

509
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,880
my stuff you know that's the head stash

510
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,759
yeah yeah and it was the stuff that you

511
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,120
know was it was just wasn't commercially

512
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:12,759
like the G13 hash plant I had a cut it

513
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:14,959
was just that that one cut it was it was

514
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:17,240
dark it had no bag appeel it looked

515
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,919
terrible in a bag but it stuck to the

516
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:22,720
bag it was just the nastiest greasiest

517
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,720
stinkiest foulest stuff yeah no I

518
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,480
couldn't sell it people I don't care you

519
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,960
know so I just grew it for me right and

520
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,798
I just kept that for myself it was leafy

521
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:33,159
right yeah it was little leafy yeah um

522
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:35,359
gosh it's been so long but I I mean I

523
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:37,720
still see that see that flower today

524
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:39,879
someone had posted you know that feno

525
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,360
from the G13 hashplant line and I was

526
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,280
like that's that's it that's the one you

527
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:45,158
found the one right you know and he was

528
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:46,759
like he's like yeah we know it's special

529
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:49,159
that's why we've kept it for so long

530
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:51,319
totally yeah yeah that that's a good

531
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:53,120
breeder too I think that has good well

532
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:55,519
that that has good breeder potential

533
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:58,000
yeah so yeah and then we had the AFU the

534
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:59,319
AFU was one that was freaking amazing

535
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,319
the fruity AF

536
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:04,038
you know it was also a hash plant and

537
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:06,158
that was the first time when I saw AFU

538
00:19:04,038 --> 00:19:07,839
for the first time it was the one that

539
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:09,840
stood out as the frostiest thing I'd

540
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:11,399
ever seen up to that point in my life

541
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:13,839
where it almost looked fake and I was

542
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:16,038
like they spray stuff on this how could

543
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:17,399
it be so Frosty yeah yeah you know and

544
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:20,279
now we see that kind of stuff all the

545
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:25,240
time yeah standard yeah I me the the

546
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:27,119
Oreos and and uh the GMOs yeah and stuff

547
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,558

550
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,840
just caked it's it's amazing you know

551
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:38,480
we've come a long ways yeah we haven't

552
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:40,918
come as far as I think a lot of people

553
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,519
think we have yeah so is we had great

554
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:46,679
stuff to smoke in the 90s there was

555
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:49,558
amazing flour oh yeah so tasted amazing

556
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:52,159
looked amazing uh and the amount of

557
00:19:49,558 --> 00:19:54,000
diversity was significantly more than it

558
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:55,559
is today yeah cuz it seems like you know

559
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,960
everything's just you know been cross

560
00:19:55,558 --> 00:19:58,720
cross cross cross cross and now we just

561
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,000
got a bunch of purple gas yeah you know

562
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,159
it's like where's those original ones

563
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,880
that got buried and lost and I mean I'm

564
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:07,520
still getting some interesting stuff I

565
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,039
get red congales I like every once in a

566
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:14,279
while yeah white Thorn Rose although it

567
00:20:10,038 --> 00:20:17,240
is purple and kind of candy is it's

568
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:18,599
Feelgood weed it's really special nice I

569
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,240
feel like that's a good one that's

570
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:22,759
that's uh one of my favorites for the

571
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,640
last the last year since I tried it and

572
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:26,200
Blue 13 is my buddy Dave's and that's

573
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,200
another special one it's more Feelgood

574
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,159
weed okay I'm coming back for effect and

575
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,159
I feel like like I went away and went to

576
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:35,280
flavor yeah and going away from Flavor

577
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:37,919
now I I still think flavor is super

578
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:39,599
important because I'm as a chef as a

579
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,559
person who gets excited about different

580
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:44,480
flavors I think that's important but

581
00:20:41,558 --> 00:20:46,558
effect in the way it makes you feel is

582
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,200
special and if you can breed towards

583
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:51,158
that and get amazing flavor yeah all the

584
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,240
better yeah see I've I've you know the

585
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:54,840
high is going to be there yeah like mine

586
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,960
was always flavor I want to taste

587
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:57,399
something I want to taste something good

588
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,319
I want to taste something unique I don't

589
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,559
want to taste the same thing thing and

590
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:01,879
it seems like everything has just been

591
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:03,599
like that tastes like that that tastes

592
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,080
like this that tastes like that and so I

593
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:07,038
just try to stick with those original

594
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:08,519
ones and try to find them where they are

595
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:09,839
yeah you know and and get them from

596
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:10,918
people a lot of people aren't doing them

597
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:13,558
just because they don't hit those

598
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:15,360
production numbers that they need you

599
00:21:13,558 --> 00:21:17,119
know or you know the purple gas is going

600
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:18,479
to get them you know x amount of dollars

601
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:20,558
and if if they run this stuff they're

602
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,558
only going to make this much so their

603
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:24,720
whole production is purple gas right now

604
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:26,879
yeah you know and I understand as a

605
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,600
business you have to provide to what the

606
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,200
what the market wants yeah you can't

607
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:31,918
force them like no you're going to like

608
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,640
this you're going to I mean you can if

609
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,960
you have a lot of marketing power well

610
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,400
and there's a small percentage of us

611
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,798
that get excited about things like

612
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,759
melonade or gelonade or lemon tree even

613
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:43,240
still like if you had a if I had an

614
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:45,720
ounce of I I have 50 different flavors

615
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:48,880
right now that I can smoke or try yeah

616
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,880
and but if you brought some a A plus

617
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,360
melanade right now I'd probably smoke

618
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,640
all that before I smoked in definitely

619
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:56,319
definitely so that that stuff gets me

620
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,960
same same thing lemon tree you know I

621
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:59,879
think lemon turps are kind of like not

622
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,558
that hot right now not that popular

623
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,120
Citrus in general seems Citrus in

624
00:22:01,558 --> 00:22:07,359
General Orange whatever but like that

625
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:09,519
lemon tree is gassy yeah it's got a g

626
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:11,759
pungency to it and I love smoking that

627
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:13,918
stuff and maybe I you know if I had it I

628
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:15,960
would get burnt out on it I do get burnt

629
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,840
out on flavors yeah Skittles seems to be

630
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,440
one that I can keep going back to yeah

631
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:22,519

634
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,319

00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,640
house it was a farmhouse big house I had

645
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:54,200
a couple of rooms blown up and I was

646
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,640
like oh man you know the landlord's

647
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,558

651
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:04,038
like we have now no we didn't have it

652
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,720

683
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:08,640
truly had no idea what they were doing

684
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:10,720
and they had they had like bag seed from

685
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,240
like you know the 80s or whatever and

686
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,839
they had germinated all these seeds and

687
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,960
they were I mean stuff was eight feet

688
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:20,000
tall with like a quarter ounce on it I

689
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,319
was like I never seen anything but I

690
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,159
didn't you know poker face I didn't want

691
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:25,798
to you know [ __ ] all over these guys'

692
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:26,880
scene but at the same time I was like I

693
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:29,359
don't know what to say guys and they're

694
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,000
like what and I was like cut it down

695
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:33,079
they're like no no no we're too far in I

696
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,159
was like you're going to lose money on

697
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:38,079
this and you're going to waste a lot of

698
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:40,679
time and I flipped their whole scene

699
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:42,240
around basically they GDP hadn't entered

700
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:45,038
it yet they're the guys who brought it

701
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,839
to me and they said hey you know this

702
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:47,519
kid he gave us his cut just said it's

703
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:49,839
the

704
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,440
perp like should we give it a try I was

705
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:53,439
like yeah give it to me I mothered it

706
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,679
out made a couple of trace for them we

707
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,759
ran just two or three lights of it and

708
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,399
the cool thing about the GDP back then

709
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:02,398
or the the per or the nepes per is it

710
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:04,918
held itself it didn't require any

711
00:25:02,398 --> 00:25:07,519
trellising right it literally held slow

712
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:08,880
Ving no it was just this football you

713
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:11,480
know it always reminded me of the mighty

714
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:14,360
might that I grew back in the day from

715
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:16,798
uh emy's you know Mark emy's catalog

716
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:18,398
back then I would call Mark up and he

717
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:19,960
would you know send down anyone could

718
00:25:18,398 --> 00:25:22,079
call Mark back then he used to put his

719
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,480
phone number right in the magazine right

720
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:25,720
you know you call the guy and he's like

721
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:29,079
it's markk you're like it's actually

722
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:30,640
mark whoa hey right and uh and it you

723
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:31,839
know anyway GDP had that same type of

724
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,559
structure that I remember from mighty

725
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:36,720
might just kind of held itself up and so

726
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:38,558
we run it wow this is great You Know It

727
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,399
produced the numbers that we wanted we

728
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:42,038
were doing living soil back then and

729
00:25:40,398 --> 00:25:44,239
when I first started growing the guys

730
00:25:42,038 --> 00:25:46,759
who taught me the guys with the The gany

731
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,159
Strain they taught me hydroponic when I

732
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:50,919
was 18 years old and I just kind of

733
00:25:49,159 --> 00:25:53,039
thought well that's how you grow

734
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:55,720
cannabis indoors that's it there's no

735
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:59,158
other way you grow it hydroponically so

736
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:00,399
hydroponic meaning uh flow EB and flow

737
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:03,320
yeah EB and flow with you know with

738
00:26:00,398 --> 00:26:05,759
cubes back then on slabs on on on tables

739
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:07,759
slabs too yeah on slabs oh wow yeah yeah

740
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:09,038
yeah and so it was just an ebb and flow

741
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:11,240
wasn't even you know like drained to

742
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:12,919
waste yeah you know you had a you know

743
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,599
giant Reservoir under your table that

744
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:16,278
would you know pump it up and then let

745
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:19,000
it you know go back down so you know

746
00:26:16,278 --> 00:26:22,839
pretty efficient it was you know I mean

747
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,880
three part G exactly three-part GH you

748
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:26,519
know that was it pH and pH and that was

749
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,320
it that it was good it was good you know

750
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:29,319
it worked and it was okay so I always

751
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:31,038
saw like you know well that's how you

752
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:32,759
have to do it indoors and so I go up to

753
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:34,919
Humble County with my hydroponic gear

754
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:36,440
and I'm doing all this stuff and it took

755
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:39,000
another guy coming over my operation

756
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:41,120
going what are you doing kid what is

757
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,398
going on here with all these pumps and

758
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:45,359
these fans and like just get all this

759
00:26:43,398 --> 00:26:47,639
stuff out of here put these put some

760
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:50,199
beds on the floor put down some 2 by10

761
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:52,440
some 12 2 x 12s line it fill it with

762
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:55,200
some good soil spike it with a bunch of

763
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:57,480
Organics and make teas yeah I was like

764
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,798
okay did that for my first time and just

765
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:03,759
the the Again The Taste the the quality

766
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:05,960
of the flavor in taste instant change I

767
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:08,079
was like I'm never growing Hydro ever

768
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:10,200
again you know and it was living soil

769
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:12,839
from that day forward and so we just

770
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:15,240
started growing all the GDP in living

771
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:17,158
soil which just gave it that tightness

772
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,919
that color that tpping profile it was

773
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:21,480
just everyone knew it as soon as they

774
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:23,679
saw it and smelled it right you know and

775
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:27,120
then we ramped up production on all of

776
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:29,519
it I had my 8 light you know 810 light

777
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:32,759
uh another location in they had multiple

778
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:34,359
locations as well um I mean enough to

779
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:36,519
where we were you know producing you

780
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:38,959
know anywhere from 15 to 20 pounds a

781
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:40,798
week wow yeah and I was and I had like

782

786
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:55,319
behind the naming of GDP is again we had

787
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:57,038
strains lavender purple URL yeah purples

788

789
00:27:57,038 --> 00:28:00,319
variety of stuff on the board you would

790

Purple sold out just as

815
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:56,439
quickly and then from then on every

816
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:58,158
other dispensary that I went to and this

817
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:01,200
is Granddaddy Purple because back then

818
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:03,519
and ccg the third floor was the

819
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,600
dispensary yeah above Harborside even at

820
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:07,880
the time you know Harborside was like

821
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:11,000
you know you know second you know second

822
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:12,840
place to them right they had like the

823
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,919
most clones the most the most of

824
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:19,359
everything basically the guy who owned

825
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:21,038
uh ccg at the time Larry yeah he uh he

826
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:24,038
was like from the rumor was he was a

827
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:26,558
Canadian book uh Alaskan bookie who came

828
00:29:24,038 --> 00:29:29,038
down here and he wanted to be the

829
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:30,720
McDonald's of of medical marijuana and

830
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:32,640
he was just quickly trying to open up

831
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,319
places all over the place yeah throwing

832
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,320
money at it throwing money at it just

833
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:37,839
you know hoping something sticks it did

834
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:40,558
stick for a little while unfortunately

835
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:44,079
Larry had cancer uh he ended up passing

836
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:45,519
away legal problems came about you know

837
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:48,158
I think that the manager of the play

838
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:49,960
Sharky he ended up like doing some time

839
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:54,480
I think because all this mess kind of

840
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:56,159
got left on him right um ccg like you it

841
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,159
was like it was like I was like Norm

842
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,600
walking into cheers yeah you know

843
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,480
everyone knew as soon as I it was that

844
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:03,519
feeling there for sure so I used to go

845
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:06,000
and it was a it was the badge of honor

846
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:09,240
to get your card I I went to Dr Frank

847
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,519
Cino and got my card in the 90s late 90s

848
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,038
and then afterwards you would go to the

849
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:15,278
third floor and you would fill out the

850
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:17,158
paperwork and they would call and verify

851
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:19,200
and then you would get your card yeah

852
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:21,120
and that was a big deal back

853
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,880
then they had the card press and

854
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:24,719
everything it was a big deal to have a

855
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,840
card from there the lower the number you

856
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,759
could tell what number of members cuz

857
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:30,519
they did it in order so if you were in

858
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:32,319
the early hundreds like that that me you

859
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:33,759
were you've been doing it for a while

860
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:37,278

861
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:38,558
original you know meia patients you know

862
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:39,919
yeah and he was you know he was one of

863
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:41,678
the originals who was you know putting

864
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:44,519
those out there yeah you know back in

865
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,440
the day you I I always get my car just

866
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:49,319
because you know I was a vendor right

867
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:51,880
you know and there was a dispensary in

868
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:54,798
San Lorenzo off

869
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,760
asperian um they always just had my

870
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:58,440
every year they would just have my

871
00:30:55,759 --> 00:31:00,038
script for me you know I I would show up

872
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,080
to drop off you know product here's your

873
00:31:00,038 --> 00:31:03,398
script for the year just sign here okay

874
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:04,918
thanks yeah it was interesting because

875
00:31:03,398 --> 00:31:07,079
it was a big scam and you'd have to pay

876
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:09,200
more money if you wanted to get the 99

877
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:11,638
plant yeah so you could get the regular

878
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,840
which I think was 10 plants or you could

879
00:31:11,638 --> 00:31:15,439
pay extra money to get the 99 Federal

880
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:19,038
yeah and it was the difference of like

881
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:21,120
$200 or $350 yeah yeah none of us did

882
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:22,480
that yeah yeah no since the guys up

883
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:24,278
north they would just you know stack

884
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,120
scripts they would pay you for your

885
00:31:24,278 --> 00:31:29,480
script so they can just have another 99

886
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:30,719
another 99 like stack that just a stack

887
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,079
yeah well and we did that too so we

888
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,120
would put them on the doors of the

889
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:35,918
Groves right and so but we we were

890
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:37,359
stupid cuz we wouldn't you know it's

891
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,360
like we all got busted at the same time

892
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:41,240
we be [ __ ] yeah but like we all used

893
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:42,839
our skips together so we'd have a whole

894
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,720
door covered with everybody's skip but

895

987
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:05,160

this is how we do it now and when so

1041
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,880
that when all the clubs started to

1042
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:58,759
realize that they had the power yeah

1043
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,440
they didn't have to cash you out I was

1044

1046
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:05,720
front to them at way less than what I

1047

1052
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:17,440
realizing like oh we don't have to cash

1053
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:19,720
these guys out because there was just so

1054
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,159
many people all of a sudden the

1055
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:23,199
consignment thing started and that's

1056
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:24,639
when I was like that's when I was done

1057
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:26,838
with you know Berkeley Patients Group

1058
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:29,000
that's when I was done with you know and

1059
00:37:26,838 --> 00:37:30,440
then CC CG third floor they had moved

1060
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,199
down the street some new people had

1061
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,838
opened it up and it was kind of sketchy

1062
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:37,000
and hey we want you to put your name and

1063
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:38,599
all this information no no no no no and

1064
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,440
that's when I kind of stepped away from

1065
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:45,599
that and that was you know that was 2005

1066
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:48,000
2006 and by then by by by about 2003 OG

1067
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:50,960
came around to the Bay Area and that's

1068
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,079
just what killed GDP yeah killed it

1069
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,760
absolutely it almost felt like overnight

1070
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:56,920
yeah I was going to say that overnight

1071
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:58,160
it went so there was like purple

1072
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:01,519
Cadillac

1073
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:03,399
GDP purple orle lavender and when they

1074
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:05,679
were hot they were hot and then almost

1075
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:07,800
overnight the only place that would buy

1076
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:09,480
them would maybe be Richmond you could

1077
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,480
pull it off in Richmond Richmond was

1078
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,880
still buying a lot of GDP but like they

1079
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,318
weren't at any of the dispensaries

1080
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,079
nobody wanted them anymore and it was

1081
00:38:14,318 --> 00:38:18,239
like overnight it was gone the price

1082
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:20,599
started dropping quick we used to grow

1083
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:23,479
the GDP in octagons and the reason we

1084
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:25,920
did that was because it was a slow veg

1085
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:28,199
the reason I don't like growing GDP is

1086
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,280
for for me it was a 31 day

1087
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:32,559
yeah so it would hates nitrogen dude it

1088
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:34,240
hates nitrogen but it would stay short

1089
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:35,799
so it was really good for octagon and my

1090
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:37,399
buddy figured this out and then he told

1091
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:40,440
me and I was like [ __ ] son of a [ __ ] we

1092
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:41,960
could get these huge yields right in

1093
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,480
these octagons because you're growing

1094
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:46,400
vertical and so under each plant there's

1095
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:48,920
26 lights or 26 plants under each light

1096
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,680
right and so it was h four Stacks four

1097
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,960
tiers and they were all growing towards

1098
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:55,000
it well if you grow chem dog you get a

1099
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:56,639
wall of lar yeah but then you grow GDP

1100
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,318
and it's like you get perfect Buds and

1101
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:00,719
they're huge buds

1102
00:38:58,318 --> 00:39:02,838
and you could flip it after a week and

1103
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:04,480
then you get this amazing this amazing

1104
00:39:02,838 --> 00:39:06,838
yield and you get over 5 pounds so was

1105
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,639
over 2 and a half pounds with GDP in the

1106
00:39:06,838 --> 00:39:11,559
Octagon yeah nice yeah I made the

1107
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:13,480
mistake a few times of running a train

1108
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:15,719
wreck in the same room with with Grand

1109
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:17,400
Daddy Purple yeah bad idea yeah bad idea

1110
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:19,838
train wreck can't hold itself up it's a

1111
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:22,200
freaking nature it's like

1112
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:23,838
SPH just you know one day I walked in

1113
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:25,358
and even the trellising that I had just

1114
00:39:23,838 --> 00:39:27,920
had everything had fallen over onto the

1115
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:30,000
GDP you know I was like oh no

1116
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:32,838
okay don't grow train wreck and GDP in

1117
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,519
the same beds yeah I've I've seen a lot

1118
00:39:32,838 --> 00:39:38,719
of train wreck grown and yeah it always

1119
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:40,280
looks like it's gonna die and know even

1120
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:43,000
when it's healthy it grows in clusters

1121
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:45,119
right golf balls golf balls that so it

1122
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,679
doesn't look quite like it's super

1123
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,760
healthy even though it is even though

1124
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:49,598
when it's healthy and it comes out

1125
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,960
amazing I like good train wreck that's

1126
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,880
another one like Jack and train wreck

1127
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,800
you don't really see anymore but back in

1128
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,440
the day that train wreck was super

1129
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,560
strong the reason they called it train

1130
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:00,760
wreck yeah there's a guy in Santa Cruz

1131
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:03,199
who still has that original cut wow and

1132
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:05,480
he's he he's based his company off of it

1133
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:07,719
and uh he's done quite well with it and

1134
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:10,119
he holds it tight I have done everything

1135
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:14,919
I can yeah come on I believe it was bred

1136
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:18,119
by Tyson Tyson in Humble okay he's the

1137
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:19,920
original breeder of that so back to GDP

1138
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:22,519
where do you think what's the origin of

1139
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,720
GDP that you know of yeah you know

1140
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:25,880
there's always been that story going

1141
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:27,838
around about Chris on Salmon Creek you

1142
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:29,599
know I knew people out on Sal Creek I

1143
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:33,078
almost moved out to Sam Creek I had

1144
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:34,800
grown big bud I had grown purple Urkle

1145
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:37,519
and there was no way there's no way that

1146
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:40,280
it's related to purple well purple orle

1147
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:41,960
maybe grap apape definitely not right

1148
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:44,480
they're too totally and yeah they have a

1149
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:46,760
little bit of purple gra ape has a

1150
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,760
little bit of purple GDP would black out

1151
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:51,240
oh yeah right like magenta like the

1152
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:53,720
deeper you went in the darker it got it

1153
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:55,318
yeah and I like Grape Ape too don't get

1154
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:56,759
me wrong I grew Grape Ape back in the

1155
00:40:55,318 --> 00:40:58,159
day and I really liked it and it was a

1156
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:00,520
biged producer and it would grow these

1157
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:02,838
huge buds but as far as genetically I

1158
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:05,159
don't think that they were related yeah

1159
00:41:02,838 --> 00:41:06,358
now we've had people I've had people

1160
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:07,920
friends of mine they're like no they're

1161
00:41:06,358 --> 00:41:10,078
definitely like sisters and it's like I

1162
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:13,480
don't think that's true now I could see

1163
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:16,160
the origin of purple URL being maybe

1164
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:18,358
bred into GDP is like one of the parents

1165
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:20,559
I mean that to me that was more possible

1166
00:41:18,358 --> 00:41:22,440
than great Bape Theory oh yeah yet I'm

1167
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:24,559
still curious and maybe it was a you

1168
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:28,200
know it was a bag seat or a land

1169
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:31,078
race nepes land race it came to me as

1170
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:32,358
the nepes per or the per you know and so

1171
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:34,039
I just brought it down to the clubs as

1172
00:41:32,358 --> 00:41:35,559
the per you know it's probably you know

1173
00:41:34,039 --> 00:41:37,480
per number one two or three or for

1174
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:38,920
whatever it was that week and it wasn't

1175
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:41,318
until they were like we need to make

1176
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:43,440
yours stand out cuz it's way better than

1177
00:41:41,318 --> 00:41:45,480
all the other purples we got yeah so

1178
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,200
they slapped a name on it and here we

1179
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,960
are talking about it well and we've had

1180
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:51,719
guests talk about it being their their

1181
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,400
strain that made them their they made

1182
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:56,239
the success they're at now we had uh

1183
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:59,119
lose Gazo and his dispensary was all

1184
00:41:56,239 --> 00:42:00,838
about the GDP oh really all about it

1185
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,960
he's all about it still loves talking

1186
00:42:00,838 --> 00:42:05,039
about it you know it's changed people's

1187
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,838
lives it was one of those strains that

1188
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:09,559
has impact as much as I feel like GDP

1189
00:42:07,838 --> 00:42:12,159
has as much impact as any of the other

1190
00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:15,400
big strains yeah whether it's blue dream

1191
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:16,960
or OG Kush and we could argue which ones

1192
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:19,079
were more popular or whatever but like

1193
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:21,199
it had just as much impact because when

1194
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:23,599
it was hot it was extremely hot it was

1195
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:25,358
the one to get you couldn't get it

1196
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:27,440
unless you knew the right people I mean

1197
00:42:25,358 --> 00:42:30,039
and if it was at the dispensary it would

1198
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:32,119
sell out before you would get it y uh I

1199
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:35,039
remember you could look online for a

1200
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:36,599
while I think not sure if it was harbor

1201
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:39,599
side or BPG but you could look online at

1202
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:40,960
their menu and you could look on this is

1203
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,838
back when the Internet isn't what it is

1204
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,358
today you could look online and be like

1205
00:42:42,838 --> 00:42:46,558
oh here's the menu you go down and try

1206
00:42:44,358 --> 00:42:49,159
to buy it whether it was clones or

1207
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:50,359
genetic D clones or flower and man

1208
00:42:49,159 --> 00:42:51,799
sometimes it would be sold out before

1209
00:42:50,358 --> 00:42:53,679
you'd even get there yeah I'd be looking

1210
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,160
at before they open and then try to get

1211
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:57,558
there and then it's weighted line you

1212
00:42:55,159 --> 00:43:00,039
get a weighted line well BPG was an in

1213
00:42:57,559 --> 00:43:01,680
place so BPG there was like the chairs

1214
00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:04,279
for all the vendors and that's where I

1215
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:07,358
met I met the vend area the smoking

1216
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:09,680
Lounge total yeah yeah big glass front

1217
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:11,719
yeah I mean there's been so yeah it's

1218
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:13,480
good times I mean I really liked BPG

1219
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:16,358
back in the day I think I I haven't been

1220
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:18,440
at BPG in a long time same it's been ATN

1221
00:43:16,358 --> 00:43:20,000
15 18 years something like that yeah I

1222
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:23,480
got to go visit ATN I think he's still

1223
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,000
over at BPG yeah nice good people I

1224
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:28,960
stopped with the dispensaries like I you

1225
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,760
know a long time ago 2000 20 5 2006 and

1226
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,639
that's that's when I let the cut out not

1227
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:35,000
saying I'm the only one who had it yeah

1228
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:36,519
there was other sell clones of it too no

1229
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I didn't give a clone out to every

1230
00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:40,880
anyone I had people offering me you know

1231
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,880
10 racks oh yeah you know no I kind of

1232
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,680
you know was like no I'm going to hold

1233
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,440
on to this you know I didn't realize

1234
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:47,440
like how you know important it was until

1235
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,720
I you know I was like okay Co cool it's

1236
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,079
got this little buzz arounded people

1237
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:54,078
like Granddaddy Purple yeah and then uh

1238
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:57,240
was E40 and ke sneak ke the sneak were

1239
00:43:54,079 --> 00:44:00,079
like started rapping about I went oh

1240
00:43:57,239 --> 00:44:01,679
wow this is something here yep you know

1241
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:04,160
and it was also right about that time

1242
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:05,440
when the OG you know came into town and

1243
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:07,279
pretty much des and all a sudden the

1244
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,280
price started dropping and then I

1245
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,079
realized like well no one really car

1246
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,119
even the guy even my network of people

1247
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:15,559
they were like no we're not nuh-uh no

1248
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:17,720
because we can get this much for the OG

1249
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:19,079
right we're not doing the purple anymore

1250
00:44:17,719 --> 00:44:21,239
we're transferring everything over to

1251
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:23,079
this OG Kush cut now yeah there was a

1252
00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:25,439
point where you couldn't sell purple to

1253
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:26,599
save your life if you to yeah blue dream

1254
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,960
was like that too when blue dream was

1255
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:30,920
hot it was really hot yeah but it was so

1256
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,280
easy to grow and the cut got out there

1257
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:34,318
everybody grew it everybody in their

1258
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,960
mothers grew it because it would yield

1259
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:39,519
so much yeah and then all of a sudden

1260
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:42,318
it's completely flooded on the market

1261
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:44,759
I'm going over to PCC off of telegraph

1277
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:16,318

1278
00:45:14,599 --> 00:45:18,440
you open the bag it's loud it hits you

1279
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:20,679
in the face right away yeah especially

1280
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:22,639
when it's done right it's super amazing

1281
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:25,118
yeah and my whole thing again I focused

1282
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:26,598
on tpin you know like I wasn't you know

1283
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,519
trying to you know pump it to get more

1284
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:30,640
tea to get more volume like no I want a

1285
00:45:28,519 --> 00:45:34,199
flavor right you know so I was you know

1286
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:37,440
adding you know back then uh I had run

1287
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:39,639
Trials of of rooms with and I was a I

1288
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,920
was a Earth Juice Guy back in the day uh

1289
00:45:39,639 --> 00:45:47,440
love their products love the Catalyst it

1290
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:49,318
was like a wheat brand molasses finisher

1291
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,679
right and so I had you know side by-side

1292
00:45:49,318 --> 00:45:52,000
rims all right we're going to flush this

1293
00:45:50,679 --> 00:45:53,199
room we're going to run this room with

1294
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,838
the Catalyst we're going to run this

1295
00:45:53,199 --> 00:45:56,279
room without the Catalyst and these

1296
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:58,000
other little additives that I would put

1297
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:59,960
in and there was the different I would

1298
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,199
do blind taste test with friends taste

1299
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:03,159
this one taste this one tell me which

1300
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:05,358
one's better AB testing it's the best

1301
00:46:03,159 --> 00:46:07,239
way and it was always the one that had

1302
00:46:05,358 --> 00:46:09,920
you know that extra oomph you know that

1303
00:46:07,239 --> 00:46:12,000
I felt brought that taste and smell

1304
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:16,280
profile out did you ever

know seaweed as a fer pgr yeah that dark

1320
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:51,039
energy was special it was like when we

1321
00:46:49,719 --> 00:46:53,118
started using that we're like we're on

better it was like holy [ __ ] from

1326
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:03,799
because we used to monocrop too A lot of

1327
00:47:02,318 --> 00:47:05,800
times so it' be like we'd only grow one

1328
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:07,318
thing at a time yeah and so you if you

1329
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,760
were growing that over and over it's

1330
00:47:07,318 --> 00:47:11,039
like the next time you're like what the

1331
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:14,599

you know right near mland Mountain soil

1334
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:21,400
up in Humble when I was up there and so

1335
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:24,079
I would have them do special Blends for

1336
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:25,318
me you know cuz I was practically their

00:47:32,838 --> 00:47:37,318
around here and again yeah we would put

1343
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:39,000
you know dark energy into it and Spike

1344
00:47:37,318 --> 00:47:40,279
it with some guano and you know all the

1345

1346
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:45,359
spare time Organics and Willets and just

00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:49,719
you know you know dollars worth of

1349
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:51,040
Organics take it back up yeah you know

1350
00:47:49,719 --> 00:47:53,279
and that was back then you know I wasn't

1351
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:55,239
doing it was it was even though it was

1352
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,960
like soil living soil it was one and

1353
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:59,719
done like now the living soil beds that

1354
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:01,519
I did know I leave that soil there I

1355
00:47:59,719 --> 00:48:02,759
keep feeding that soil like you know you

1356
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:05,759
feed the so you us to get rid of your

1357
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:07,079
soil time I would start over every time

1358
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,520
and it wasn't until I met like an

1359
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:10,800
ergonomist yeah who explained like no

1360
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:13,000
you don't have to do that you're wasting

1361
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,440
so much money yeah you know and even

1362
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,119
then like I was you

1363
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:19,760
know to this he'd be like you need 72

1364
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:22,200
grams of that yeah 54 grams of that

1365
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:24,119
that's it like really goes it's not

1366
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:25,558
doing anything bad it's just wasteful

1367
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:27,000
yeah you know you're just wasting a lot

1368
00:48:25,559 --> 00:48:28,040
of money you only need a little B of

1369
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,639
that and a little bit of that not the

1370
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:33,039
whole bag yeah oh okay cool and uh yeah

1371
00:48:31,639 --> 00:48:35,598
and so I just I stuck with the the

1372
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:37,960
living soil thing for a long time yeah I

1373
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:39,480
used to do teas we got a Vortex bre at

1374
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:42,119
one point but I used to do teas in five

1375
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:43,960
gallon bucks with panty hose yeah oh

1376
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:46,280
yeah yeah that was the old hum tea

1377
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:48,838
recipe from I used to go to the thrift

1378
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:50,359
stores and I would raid the pantyho

1379
00:48:48,838 --> 00:48:53,920
little drawer and the people look at me

1380
00:48:50,358 --> 00:48:56,078
funny like no I'm making tea you not a

1381
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,760
weird just pack that thing full of

1382
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:00,318
earthworm C

1383
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:02,280
and all kinds of stuff and Shake yeah

1384
00:49:00,318 --> 00:49:04,440
get it bubbled yeah good stuff let it

1385
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:06,000
Brew for a little while then the vortex

1386
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:07,920
Brewers were a game changer where you

1387
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,239
could do the they they made them in five

1388
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,559
and I think 10 gallon they probably had

1389
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:12,798
bigger ones but we used to go to

1390
00:49:11,559 --> 00:49:15,000
Berkeley and Gardens and that's what

1391
00:49:12,798 --> 00:49:16,920
they have oh yeah Berkeley indoor grow

1392
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:20,358
the indoor gardens was like the spot

1393
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:22,240
Patrick yeah yeah he's a lot of people

1394
00:49:20,358 --> 00:49:25,159
use that place and and have fond

1395
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:28,199
memories Tomatoes yeah yeah you had to

1396
00:49:25,159 --> 00:49:29,639
use the language it was all you're like

1397
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:32,000
they wouldn't talk to you if you they

1398
00:49:29,639 --> 00:49:35,279
would sell you Avid in a little vial for

1399
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,880
20 bucks under the counter you know I'm

1400
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:40,280
a pesticide safety guy nowadays I have a

1401
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:42,400
license with the state as an applicator

1402
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:44,839
wow and so I'm yeah I do pesticide

1403
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,920
safety training yeah and uh I look back

1404
00:49:44,838 --> 00:49:49,599
at some of the practices from 20 years

1405
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:52,039
ago and I just go oh God just knowing

1406
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:55,160
what I know now like oh app Abid with

1407
00:49:52,039 --> 00:49:57,759
flipflops on and shorts dude it's so bad

1408
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:59,159
so bad so bad and there was so many like

1409
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,119
well in first it was just pretty much

1410
00:49:59,159 --> 00:50:03,558
Avid that people started using then

1411
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:05,480
there was like I don't remember the

1412
00:50:03,559 --> 00:50:06,960
trifecta but there was like the three

1413
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:11,240
they you would use because they would

1414
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:13,000
get immune to the one and use Avid Judo

1415
00:50:11,239 --> 00:50:16,358
and one of the other ones and they're

1416
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:18,760
all just systemic Gnar systemic yeah

1417
00:50:16,358 --> 00:50:21,000
like we'll past testing now if you're

1418
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:22,200
use them you know no I know guys that

1419
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,079
will still use it I mean if they're just

1420
00:50:22,199 --> 00:50:26,279
trying to hold on to something it's not

1421
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:28,280
in production it's never going to be

1422
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:29,480
it's never going to see the public

1423
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:31,480
Public's never going to see it it's it's

1424
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:33,199
a mother of a of a genetic that they

1425
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:35,519
don't want to die that they don't want

1426
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:38,159
to die but they don't want to have to

1427
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:40,639
maintain it and baby it I might be wrong

1428
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:43,480
but I believe Avid is a trans laminate

1429
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:45,558
and not systemic right so it actually

1430
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:48,440
coats so like the Next Generation or

1431
00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:50,200
Generations after that it's it's not bad

1432
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:51,920
in that sense but it would be bad to

1433
00:50:50,199 --> 00:50:53,598
smoke anything that had any sort of abot

1434
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,000
on it like yeah it makes me cringe a

1435
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:57,559
little bit that people have to use that

1436
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:00,239
stuff still yeah uh well it's it's it's

1437
00:50:57,559 --> 00:51:02,160
literally again it it's uh and it's out

1438
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:03,798
of the plan they've tested yeah you know

1439
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:05,159
they've sent it in it's clean you know

1440
00:51:03,798 --> 00:51:07,039
after 6 months it was just one of those

1441
00:51:05,159 --> 00:51:09,558
things we don't want to dump a bunch of

1442
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:11,960
maintenance on this plant on these

1443
00:51:09,559 --> 00:51:13,280
groups right here of mothers sure you

1444
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:14,838
know I have a you know friends who run

1445
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,240
nurseries and stuff like that one of

1446
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:19,159
them has like a very large Library yeah

1447
00:51:17,239 --> 00:51:21,039
you know they they they hold a lot of my

1448
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:22,838
stuff they hold a lot of breeder stuff

1449
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:24,358
and some of those you know those you

1450
00:51:22,838 --> 00:51:27,920
know triangle cushies some of those

1451
00:51:24,358 --> 00:51:29,639
original with AF goo super Haze yeah and

1452
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,280
they hold on to those for for guys like

1453
00:51:29,639 --> 00:51:33,159
me like I can call them up and say hey I

1454
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:34,480
need this this and this and this if you

1455
00:51:33,159 --> 00:51:36,558
can get it to me in a couple of months

1456
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:38,240
I'm working with a new maale yeah we got

1457
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:40,960
tissue culture for that now we don't

1458
00:51:38,239 --> 00:51:43,318
that you know that's such a GameChanger

1459
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:46,318
for banking genetics and having a large

1460
00:51:43,318 --> 00:51:47,960
library of clean MH as far as especially

1461
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:51,318
the clean side of it because it's before

1462
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:54,280
it used to take 30 lights you know and

1463
00:51:51,318 --> 00:51:56,960
now we can do it with uh racks and and

1464
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:58,280
you know little dishes yeah yeah away

1465
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:02,079
all that space and just put it on the

1466
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:04,079
one shelf it's it's amazing and a big

1467
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:06,160
time Game Changer in that sense

1468
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:08,200
especially the clean aspect of it is I

1469
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:09,519
remember we had genetics that were

1470
00:52:08,199 --> 00:52:10,558
really good and we ran them for a while

1471
00:52:09,519 --> 00:52:12,039
and all of a sudden they weren't

1472
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:14,319
performing and so we were like no we got

1473
00:52:12,039 --> 00:52:15,880
to get rid of it uh we must have cloned

1474
00:52:14,318 --> 00:52:18,159
it too many times that's when we thought

1475
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:19,599
a lot we've we've out cloned it got to

1476
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:21,759
go remember yeah I remember that yeah

1477
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:24,119
yeah too many clonal generations it must

1478
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:27,799
be bad like yeah oh and I would keep

1479
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:29,599
mothers for gosh ever yeah I just a long

1480
00:52:27,798 --> 00:52:32,199
the same plant you could clones off for

1481
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:33,318
two three years yeah you know the GDP I

1482
00:52:32,199 --> 00:52:35,199
would just you know occasionally I would

1483
00:52:33,318 --> 00:52:37,318
pull it out of the bag hack off half the

1484
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:38,960
roots yeah you know hack off you know

1485
00:52:37,318 --> 00:52:40,759
3/4 of the foliage you know the the

1486
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,639
upper and then hack that down put it

1487
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:44,599
back into fresh soil yeah and let it

1488
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:46,598
read you and mean I would keep mothers

1489
00:52:44,599 --> 00:52:47,880
forever to the point where I was like I

1490
00:52:46,599 --> 00:52:50,160
probably should switch these out every

1491
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:52,440
once in a while yeah you know but you're

1492
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:54,279
working with you know space restraints

1493
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:57,200
you know back then especially you know

1494
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:59,040
we were just in houses what I thought I

1495
00:52:57,199 --> 00:53:00,480
honestly thought when I was younger that

1496
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:02,239
the more times you clone it the worse

1497
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,639
the genetics get that it's it does

1498
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:05,719
something bad to the genetics yeah that

1499
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:07,598
was something thought back yeah yeah we

1500
00:53:05,719 --> 00:53:09,679
all thought that yeah I mean I think

1501
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:11,680
that was pretty common knowledge

1502
00:53:09,679 --> 00:53:12,759
yeah you know we didn't know what we

1503
00:53:11,679 --> 00:53:15,558
were doing we were just there was no

1504
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:17,559
book for this you had Ed Rosenthal and

1505
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:20,240
Jorge couple guys

1506
00:53:17,559 --> 00:53:21,640
writing like the three you know and I I

1507
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:23,838
ran all those books when I was a

1508
00:53:21,639 --> 00:53:25,798
teenager and in my early 20s and oh had

1509
00:53:23,838 --> 00:53:27,159
gr caps it wasn't until I started

1510
00:53:25,798 --> 00:53:29,599
reading Rodell

1511
00:53:27,159 --> 00:53:31,358
yeah Organics where like it all just

1512
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:32,920
dropped into place for me it all made

1513
00:53:31,358 --> 00:53:35,558
sense you know a lot of the Cannabis

1514
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:37,440
growing books just seem confusing well

1515
00:53:35,559 --> 00:53:39,839
and I think there was something that you

1516
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:41,798
wanted to have a novel approach to back

1517
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:43,239
then and I think these guys were

1518
00:53:41,798 --> 00:53:45,559
scratching the surface of it and they

1519
00:53:43,239 --> 00:53:48,759
had a lot of stuff that was right but

1520
00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:50,640
there was also stuff on you know I'm not

1521
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:54,280
saying cinnamon is bad I think cinnamon

1522
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:55,679
has its place with IPM but like cinnamon

1523
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:57,119
for this or that and then I would try it

1524
00:53:55,679 --> 00:53:58,399
and be like this [ __ ] doesn't work dude

1525
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:01,680
like not like they say it does in the

1526
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:03,358
book yeah and but the the concepts I

1527
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:04,679
think overall the concepts were good the

1528
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:06,880
fact that they were I just wrote a

1529
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:09,000
breeding book so like I I don't want to

1530
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,640
hate on anybody that's ever put the time

1531
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,079
and effort to write a book because it's

1532
00:54:10,639 --> 00:54:16,039
so much work and so much energy and I

1533
00:54:13,079 --> 00:54:20,039
feel like these guys especially you know

1534
00:54:16,039 --> 00:54:23,358
Rob Clark in 1980 with marijuana botney

1535
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:27,798
and then Mel Frank uh we've got even

1536
00:54:23,358 --> 00:54:30,159
even Ed and Jorge and then Mor and all

1537
00:54:27,798 --> 00:54:32,159
these guys tried to write the best book

1538
00:54:30,159 --> 00:54:34,000
they possibly could right and so it's

1539
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:35,679
all about I mean it's almost like art

1540
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,119
right so you're writing this thing and

1541
00:54:35,679 --> 00:54:38,679
you do the best job you can and then you

1542
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:41,240
got to put it out to the world and see

1543
00:54:38,679 --> 00:54:42,798
how the world accepts it yeah right yeah

1544
00:54:41,239 --> 00:54:45,558
we've come so far since then I'm not

1545
00:54:42,798 --> 00:54:47,199
trying to you know back then back then

1546
00:54:45,559 --> 00:54:48,640
it was it was better than nothing it was

1547
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:49,838
better than nothing but it was hard to

1548
00:54:48,639 --> 00:54:51,400
find those books it's not like you could

1549
00:54:49,838 --> 00:54:53,039
just get them anywhere Telegraph Avenue

1550
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:54,079
they used to have a street fair oh yeah

1551
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:57,000
and you could always get them there was

1552
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:59,318
a table with cannabis books always

1553
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,880
mushroom cannabis all kinds of stuff I

1554
00:54:59,318 --> 00:55:02,358
had all the Cannabis you know stickers

1555
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,960
you could buy back then had them on my

1556
00:55:02,358 --> 00:55:06,039
car and there was a dude that made

1557
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:07,760
seashell pipes with resin there was like

1558
00:55:06,039 --> 00:55:09,400
resin seashell pipes even had a

1559
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:12,200
magnifying glass one where you get was a

1560
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:14,920
bong had seashells and that guy must

1561
00:55:12,199 --> 00:55:16,480
have passed very uh you know on

1562
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:19,000
Telegraph yeah on Telegraph yeah yeah

1563
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:21,240
yeah yeah and I I think I would love if

1564
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,798
somebody knew how to get a seashell pipe

1565
00:55:21,239 --> 00:55:24,118
to get one because I don't have any of

1566
00:55:22,798 --> 00:55:26,440
the ones I have a big collection of

1567
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:28,160
pipes but I never saved any of those I

1568
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:30,358
have an original Proto yeah those

1569
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:32,598
original protop types are amazing like

1570
00:55:30,358 --> 00:55:35,038
the protoype was a great concept yeah I

1571
00:55:32,599 --> 00:55:37,160
still have my protop pipe from back then

1572
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:38,520
sitting in the drawer don't use it

1573
00:55:37,159 --> 00:55:40,118
looked back like wow we used to smoke

1574
00:55:38,519 --> 00:55:41,719
out of this like it was oh yeah I have

1575
00:55:40,119 --> 00:55:43,599
the original vaporizers that have the

1576
00:55:41,719 --> 00:55:45,480
element and where you have a tube and

1577
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:48,280
it's like handblown glass tube in a box

1578
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:50,639
and then you put it on the you vaporize

1579
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:53,280
before the volcano yeah was when volcano

1580
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:54,159
came out that was like whoa this is new

1581
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,200
but I just couldn't understand I would

1582
00:55:54,159 --> 00:55:58,000
show up to a friend's house and he'd

1583
00:55:55,199 --> 00:55:59,879
have jars like this just tap out you

1584
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,119
know to me it was like wait a minute so

1585
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:03,358
wait you're just

1586
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:05,358
melting it just didn't it didn't make

1587
00:56:03,358 --> 00:56:07,519
sense to me I know I'm burning my weed

1588
00:56:05,358 --> 00:56:09,519
you're just wasting a bunch of weed yeah

1589
00:56:07,519 --> 00:56:11,239
you know he would take his jars and make

1590
00:56:09,519 --> 00:56:12,679
brownies with it he always made sure but

1591
00:56:11,239 --> 00:56:14,118
it just didn't make sense we used to

1592
00:56:12,679 --> 00:56:16,239
throw it out but we used to have big

1593
00:56:14,119 --> 00:56:17,519
freaking long you know because we

1594
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:20,318
especially because we trimmed a lot

1595
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:23,000
right because everybody there was a time

1596
00:56:20,318 --> 00:56:25,880
where all my friends not all my friends

1597
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,159
but my friends that grew uh we all

1598
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:28,798
needed trimming done and we all

1599
00:56:27,159 --> 00:56:30,838
harvested at different time so it'd be

1600
00:56:28,798 --> 00:56:33,719
like you go trim for free a lot of times

1601
00:56:30,838 --> 00:56:35,318
we didn't pay anybody to trim you would

1602
00:56:33,719 --> 00:56:37,439
trim your friend stuff and we'd hang out

1603
00:56:35,318 --> 00:56:40,199
we were watching In Living Color DVDs

1604
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:42,519
yeah yeah and uh yeah and we had the big

1605
00:56:40,199 --> 00:56:44,439
the big hu we we used the volcano so

1606
00:56:42,519 --> 00:56:46,440
much that we melted the [ __ ] top to

1607
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:49,079
it oh really like literally but we' get

1608
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:50,920
the big bags and then someone got smart

1609
00:56:49,079 --> 00:56:52,760
I was like dude you can't use multiple

1610
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:54,760
flavors so each flavor has to have its

1611
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:56,960
own bag and that was a game changer cuz

1612
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:58,920
then it tasted like that strange right

1613
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:01,599
right so if you had one bag for each

1614
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:03,039
flavor and we didn't have I mean we had

1615
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:05,720
diversity so there was a lot of

1616
00:57:03,039 --> 00:57:07,280
different stuff but I grew this and my

1617
00:57:05,719 --> 00:57:09,239
buddy grew this and my other buddy grew

1618
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,960
this and so we had like a handful of

1619
00:57:09,239 --> 00:57:12,000
stuff that we knew was topnotch that we

1620
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,639
really wanted to smoke because there was

1621
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,318
the work weed and then there was like

1622
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:18,838
the [ __ ] that we like smoking ourselves

1623
00:57:15,318 --> 00:57:20,838
yeah yeah you brought up a uh Kenny you

1624

1629
00:57:30,159 --> 00:57:33,440

1631
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,358
hooka Co that the original dab you know

1632
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:41,039

1633
00:57:37,358 --> 00:57:42,880
glass tube or something yeah and uh yeah

1634

20 and uh brought that around and it

1637
00:57:47,639 --> 00:57:52,440
just it changed people's lives yeah you

1638
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:54,318
I had a few friends who were uh you know

1639
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:55,838
they were heroin addicts back then and

1640
00:57:54,318 --> 00:57:58,960
they took a dab for the first time and

1641
00:57:55,838 --> 00:58:00,199
they were like whoa just sent them soar

1642
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:03,280
and they're like I've never been this

1643
00:58:00,199 --> 00:58:05,519
high off of H yeah let you know whoa

1644
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:08,920
like and one person like literally used

1645
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:11,199
that to kick heroin that's amazing was

1646
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:12,559
just honey oil cuz you know she felt

1647
00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:15,118
like well this this is giving me the

1648
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:17,519
same effect you know and when I ran out

1649
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:19,400
of it you I realized like oh wow that's

1650
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:21,519
how bad heroin addiction can be cuz she

1651
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:23,160
was like pissed yeah that she could not

1652
00:58:21,519 --> 00:58:26,480
get this anymore from me and she was

1653
00:58:23,159 --> 00:58:29,078
going to relapse and I was like oh sorry

1654
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:32,480
I'll try you know yeah yeah but yeah

1655
00:58:29,079 --> 00:58:34,960
that col Tech was the original way

1656
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:36,960
before they had Rigs and we used to

1657
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:38,679
smoking on coal with a straw you heat

1658
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,159
the coal up and you would have your

1659
00:58:38,679 --> 00:58:42,399
little Dabber whatever you touch it

1660
00:58:40,159 --> 00:58:44,920
there and hit it with the straw and

1661
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:46,760
amazing stuff like our parents before us

1662
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:49,200
with the hot knives oh yeah well see I

1663
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:52,079
used hot knives too those those were

1664
00:58:49,199 --> 00:58:54,399
like legendary hot knives you know those

1665
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:55,680
would take you to another level yeah uh

1666
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,920
especially with the traditional hash

1667
00:58:55,679 --> 00:58:59,199
where you burn it and you would just get

1668
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:01,280
a cloud of smoke your eyes would

1669
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:03,679
instantly turn red yeah you if you

1670
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:06,559
didn't choke you would be completely

1671
00:59:03,679 --> 00:59:08,078
freaking ripped off your ass yeah Kenny

1672
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:10,480
and them they had some good strains back

1673
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:13,440
then I remember they had uh the sweet

1674
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:15,880
one yeah B1 they had a purple you purple

1675
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:18,400
purple cush K's purple cush K's purple

1676
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:20,720
cush and I was lucky enough uh through a

1677
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:22,720
mutual friend to get a tray of clones

1678
00:59:20,719 --> 00:59:24,078
from those guys wow didn't realize at

1679
00:59:22,719 --> 00:59:26,159
the time that I should have held on to

1680
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:28,240
this stuff this is all new I didn't even

1681
00:59:26,159 --> 00:59:29,440
know I don't even I think maybe Kan and

1682
00:59:28,239 --> 00:59:31,879
Sharky had already been doing some

1683
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:34,720
articles in in High Times maybe at the

1684
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:37,119
time um but even still to this day I

1685
00:59:34,719 --> 00:59:39,358
don't pay attention to things in the

1686
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:41,358
Cannabis industry like I used to I mean

1687
00:59:39,358 --> 00:59:43,400
there's people who live eat and breathe

1688
00:59:41,358 --> 00:59:44,598
they read everything watch everything

1689
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:46,798
there's too much now it's sensory

1690
00:59:44,599 --> 00:59:48,318
overload it's sensory overload you know

1691
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:50,838
I've I've been doing this for 30 you

1692
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:53,480
know years now I've got kids you know

1693
00:59:50,838 --> 00:59:56,639
and right now like I've I've already

1694
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:58,280
sacrificed a lot of family time a lot of

1695
00:59:56,639 --> 01:00:00,199
time with my wife and my children for

1696
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:02,039
this plant right and and I've I've

1697
01:00:00,199 --> 01:00:04,318
stepped away in the last year and a half

1698
01:00:02,039 --> 01:00:05,960
and I'm like my kids are only going to

1699
01:00:04,318 --> 01:00:07,639
be you know they're 10 and 12 right now

1700
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:10,119
they're only going to be that age once

1701
01:00:07,639 --> 01:00:12,078
right you know my son's going to get to

1702
01:00:10,119 --> 01:00:14,599
that age I remember when I was 15 yeah

1703
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:16,480
oh bye dad I got my friends now right

1704
01:00:14,599 --> 01:00:18,119
and I I missed a lot of that because I

1705
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:20,119
was always gone I was working all the

1706
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:21,920
time I was hustling I was just so

1707
01:00:20,119 --> 01:00:23,440
immersed in the Cannabis industry that

1708
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:25,960
for this last year and a half of not

1709
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:26,880
working in the Cannabis industry yeah

1710
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:29,000
you know I was like wow there's a whole

1711
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:31,200
another world out there this is what the

1712
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:33,039
plant gives too you know it takes and it

1713
01:00:31,199 --> 01:00:35,199
gives and it's the most amazing thing

1714
01:00:33,039 --> 01:00:37,720
right yeah you know and so finally I was

1715
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:40,519
just like I'm I I got laid off you know

1716
01:00:37,719 --> 01:00:41,879
and I was like I was expecting it you

1717
01:00:40,519 --> 01:00:44,880
know in the last seven years I worked

1718
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:47,200
for six different companies and uh so

1719
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,318
when that layoff came I was like well

1720
01:00:47,199 --> 01:00:50,199
I'm just going to spend time with my

1721
01:00:48,318 --> 01:00:51,639
family you know I've I've been going so

1722
01:00:50,199 --> 01:00:53,239
hard for so long and the wife was just

1723
01:00:51,639 --> 01:00:54,358
you know she's the one who actually said

1724
01:00:53,239 --> 01:00:56,038
like you've been doing this you know

1725
01:00:54,358 --> 01:00:57,400
you've been going hard for a long time

1726
01:00:56,039 --> 01:00:59,760
yeah why don't you take some time off

1727
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:03,318
and I was like say no more honey yeah

1728
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:05,119
you know it took some time off and um I

1729
01:01:03,318 --> 01:01:07,519
gave all my plants away shut my rooms

1730
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:09,280
down wow I literally have nothing going

1731
01:01:07,519 --> 01:01:11,318
at the moment and it's probably been

1732
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:13,559
like one of the best years of my life

1733
01:01:11,318 --> 01:01:15,519
yeah you know just I'm not I've just

1734
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:17,079
totally stepped away I'll always love

1735
01:01:15,519 --> 01:01:18,880
the plant I'll always love the industry

1736
01:01:17,079 --> 01:01:20,798
I'll always love the people but right

1737
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:22,960
now I'm focused on my my children my

1738
01:01:20,798 --> 01:01:25,038
wife and myself yeah that's beautiful

1739

yeah and it's been great you I've I've I

1740
01:01:25,039 --> 01:01:28,160
always was a fisherman I always liked

1741
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:29,880
fishing here and there but in this last

1742
01:01:28,159 --> 01:01:31,920

1745
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,920
going to go hit a lake nice you know

1746
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:40,000
like that's my zen and for me something

1747
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:42,119
about bass fishing don't mean to steer

1748
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,318
the conversation to that but it's this

1749
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:46,440
it itches it scratches that same itch

1750
01:01:44,318 --> 01:01:48,279
that I had as a grower trying to figure

1751
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:50,480
out this plant trying to figure out this

1752
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:52,559
fish yeah you know what did I do right

1753
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:55,199
where did I did I use this color bait

1754
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:57,839
did I do this it's that same feeling of

1755
01:01:55,199 --> 01:02:00,159
like accompl M like I'm going to conquer

1756
01:01:57,838 --> 01:02:02,679
this thing yeah and so it's just kind of

1757
01:02:00,159 --> 01:02:04,960
filled that void for me yeah and so a

1758
01:02:02,679 --> 01:02:07,558
lot of my focus you know again stepping

1759
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:09,720
away from the industry family fishing

1760
01:02:07,559 --> 01:02:11,798
just life you know because my life has

1761
01:02:09,719 --> 01:02:14,278
been this plant this community this

1762
01:02:11,798 --> 01:02:16,519
industry yeah it's come before

1763
01:02:14,278 --> 01:02:19,000
everything you know we I mean you know

1764
01:02:16,519 --> 01:02:21,239
as a grower you miss holidays you miss

1765
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:23,239
vacations you miss those little things I

1766
01:02:21,239 --> 01:02:25,239
can't like I mean no matter how many

1767
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:28,118
times I would try to not have to harvest

1768
01:02:25,239 --> 01:02:29,679
at Christmas it always landed like right

1769
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:31,440
around Christmas time where I was like

1770
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:33,519
sorry I can't go well what why because

1771
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:35,200
you got to harvest again like yeah sorry

1772
01:02:33,519 --> 01:02:37,079
yeah you know so you have some people

1773
01:02:35,199 --> 01:02:39,078
just don't understand yeah it's like

1774
01:02:37,079 --> 01:02:42,200
it's you're a farmer yeah it's seven

1775
01:02:39,079 --> 01:02:43,519
days a week it's great in the sense that

1776
01:02:42,199 --> 01:02:45,439
especially when you're younger that you

1777
01:02:43,519 --> 01:02:46,798
learn about prioritizing something

1778
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:48,559
that's bigger than yourself and more

1779
01:02:46,798 --> 01:02:51,038
important than you yeah because I think

1780
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:52,839
a lot of us feel like we're so important

1781
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:54,440
and it kind of gets rid of that ego to a

1782
01:02:52,838 --> 01:02:56,719
degree like if you want to grow good

1783
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:58,519
flower you prioritize that plant first

1784
01:02:56,719 --> 01:03:01,159
it comes before everything yeah

1785
01:02:58,519 --> 01:03:02,519
unfortunately fames yeah when I met my

1786
01:03:01,159 --> 01:03:03,639
wife when I first started dating her and

1787
01:03:02,519 --> 01:03:05,559
this has gone with you know just about

1788
01:03:03,639 --> 01:03:07,480
every girl I've ever dated like just so

1789
01:03:05,559 --> 01:03:10,000
you know you know who I am right but

1790
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:12,838
just so you know like this will always

1791
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:15,760
come before you yeah if you can hang

1792
01:03:12,838 --> 01:03:18,159
with that then we can move forward with

1793
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:19,920
this yeah you know and my wife you know

1794
01:03:18,159 --> 01:03:23,118
I've I've put her through some things

1795
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:25,000
you know in the Cannabis industry um

1796
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:26,358
yeah we almost moved up to Salmon Creek

1797
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,960
when she was you know eight months

1798
01:03:26,358 --> 01:03:30,519
pregnant with my first son and that guy

1799
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:32,920
backed out on me practically when I

1800
01:03:30,519 --> 01:03:34,519
already packed up my house here you know

1801
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:36,400
and it was like this she's a square

1802
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:38,759
she's not from the Cannabis industry

1803
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:40,440
she's not you know and here she is she's

1804
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:42,680
like sure honey let's do this this is

1805
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:45,240
your passion let's go and then that

1806
01:03:42,679 --> 01:03:47,679
happened you know it was like oo that

1807
01:03:45,239 --> 01:03:50,118
was a big one I mean to put her through

1808
01:03:47,679 --> 01:03:51,838
that um and for her to still you know

1809
01:03:50,119 --> 01:03:54,240
stick around was like wow I got me a

1810
01:03:51,838 --> 01:03:56,078
trooper here I I know the feeling I the

1811
01:03:54,239 --> 01:03:58,278
same thing heard my wife through lot of

1812
01:03:56,079 --> 01:04:02,359
[ __ ] yeah over the years she's had to

1813
01:03:58,278 --> 01:04:03,559
suffer when I suffered yep and she she's

1814
01:04:02,358 --> 01:04:05,639
accepted the good times and the bad

1815
01:04:03,559 --> 01:04:08,440
times and we've had a lot of good times

1816
01:04:05,639 --> 01:04:10,558
we've had some bad times too yeah yeah

1817
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:13,039
you know and I think that's life but

1818
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:15,319
that also builds character yeah you know

1819
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:18,760
I think uh people are afraid of bad

1820
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:20,119
times but like no risk no reward yeah

1821
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:23,319
you there's a certain

1822
01:04:20,119 --> 01:04:25,519
level uh what's what's the Latin saying

1823
01:04:23,318 --> 01:04:26,838
fortune favors the brave I don't

1824
01:04:25,519 --> 01:04:28,880
remember remember the Latin translation

1825
01:04:26,838 --> 01:04:32,400
but briyan will put it up on the

1826
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:34,000
screen but uh you know there's risk when

1827
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,798
whenever you're doing stuff there's risk

1828
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,519
yeah so it's about like the level of

1829
01:04:35,798 --> 01:04:40,318
risk you're willing to take and my wife

1830
01:04:37,519 --> 01:04:41,759
has gone through the trenches with me

1831
01:04:40,318 --> 01:04:43,199
she's not in the industry either but

1832
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:45,160
she's had to put up with all the

1833
01:04:43,199 --> 01:04:46,960
[ __ ] that goes with the industry

1834
01:04:45,159 --> 01:04:49,239
yeah you know the lack of all and also I

1835
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:50,798
was a chef too so like along with that

1836
01:04:49,239 --> 01:04:53,159
where it's like okay the kitchen comes

1837
01:04:50,798 --> 01:04:56,960
first and then was like I I had plants

1838
01:04:53,159 --> 01:04:58,920
in the kitchen yeah and so yeah it's

1839
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:00,199
it's it's one of those things yeah you

1840

01:05:02,239 --> 01:05:05,479
selfish yeah you know at least I did you

1843
01:05:04,239 --> 01:05:07,278

the benefits of it but it was like they

over to Amsterdam a couple hours I've

1894
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:57,119
never been to any of those places I did

1895
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:59,200
just uh visit Ireland in Northern

1896
01:06:57,119 --> 01:07:01,200
Ireland got to do some Tri fishing there

1897
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:02,598
which was pretty cool tapped in to see

1898
01:07:01,199 --> 01:07:05,358
what the industry is like over there

1899
01:07:02,599 --> 01:07:07,920
they just got some medical going on um

1900
01:07:05,358 --> 01:07:09,558
found a couple of shops that sold seed

1901
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:11,680
yeah went in you know talked with the

1902
01:07:09,559 --> 01:07:15,079
guys and I had some regular seed on me

1903
01:07:11,679 --> 01:07:16,480
you know regular and uh you know I was

1904
01:07:15,079 --> 01:07:18,559
asking them about how how come you guys

1905
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:21,000
got all the autos and I never understood

1906
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:22,319
why Europeans were so heavy on the autos

1907
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,679
and then when they explain the climate

1908
01:07:22,318 --> 01:07:26,119
and the grow season they're like we got

1909
01:07:23,679 --> 01:07:28,919
60 days yeah you know we don't have a we

1910

someone who wants to see fast results

and Autos will give you that instant

1917
01:07:41,798 --> 01:07:45,679

01:07:55,239 --> 01:07:59,919
you can't do that with anything else

1924
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:01,400
from seed yeah and the genetics have

1925
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:04,318
gotten better and better and better with

1926
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:05,639
autoflow absolutely I mean 20 years ago

1927
01:08:04,318 --> 01:08:07,199
if you would brought yeah if you would

1928
01:08:05,639 --> 01:08:09,400
have brought up Autos or rutell I'd have

1929
01:08:07,199 --> 01:08:12,919
laughed at you

1930
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:15,480
yeah time for like hey like want to

1931
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:17,359
smoke hey it was a foundation to start

1932
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:20,000
from if that was a direction you wanted

1933
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:22,798
to go y but for me it was like it was

1934
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:24,838
production you know back then like I

1935
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:27,158
wasn't trying to make seeds that was for

1936
01:08:24,838 --> 01:08:30,278
that was for the older guys who had made

1937
01:08:27,158 --> 01:08:32,039
their money they were just now R&amp;D just

1938
01:08:30,279 --> 01:08:34,159
playing around making things here and

1939
01:08:32,039 --> 01:08:36,479
there having fun mine it was work work

1940
01:08:34,158 --> 01:08:38,879
work work think before our

1941
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:41,479
time it was all about making seeds for

1942
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:44,880
the next year right especially up in

1943
01:08:41,479 --> 01:08:48,959
Humble right so like in the 60s late 60s

1944
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:50,960
70s 80s early P probably 90s a lot of

1945
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:52,560
farmers would you know they they were

1946
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:54,439
making seeds for that next year so

1947
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:55,960
they'd make a handful of seeds yeah they

1948
01:08:54,439 --> 01:08:58,119
were breeding

1949
01:08:55,960 --> 01:09:00,480
uh those varieties that were up there

1950
01:08:58,119 --> 01:09:02,640
they're almost land race varieties from

1951
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:04,119
there depending on what you define as a

1952
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:06,279
land race but some of these guys made

1953
01:09:04,119 --> 01:09:09,318
them for 20 Generations they were making

1954
01:09:06,279 --> 01:09:11,440
seeds every year yeah but when cloning

1955
01:09:09,319 --> 01:09:13,520
got popular especially in the 90s it's

1956
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:15,358
like we were growing a lot from clone

1957
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:16,960
yeah we'd pop seeds but we'd clone it

1958
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:18,400
and then we'd shed the Clones yeah

1959
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:20,319
exactly and that was the thing with you

1960
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:23,399
know back to the GDP cut yeah there was

1961
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:26,120
no melt it was a cut right you know and

1962
01:09:23,399 --> 01:09:28,559
so clone only clone only yeah you know

1963
01:09:26,119 --> 01:09:30,559
and so when people you know and I wasn't

1964
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:32,359
one of those people as a matter of fact

1965
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:35,279
I had I had a person tell me you know if

1966
01:09:32,359 --> 01:09:37,120
if uh you because I wasn't a forum guy I

1967
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:38,679
wasn't on the forums back in the day and

1968
01:09:37,119 --> 01:09:40,759
if if I wasn't on the forums then I

1969
01:09:38,679 --> 01:09:43,399
wasn't part of the Cannabis Community

1970
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:45,439
right then I was like whoa dude like I

1971
01:09:43,399 --> 01:09:47,759
was put I was putting 100,000 miles a

1972
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:49,678
year on my truck driving boxes up and

1973
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:51,279
down the West Coast right okay I didn't

1974
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:53,279
have time to sit in front of a computer

1975
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:55,640
and and argue the finer points of

1976
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:59,000
totally of growing a lot of that just

1977
01:09:55,640 --> 01:10:01,079
ego anyway yeah you know and um so when

1978
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,359
people would hit me you know hit me up

1979
01:10:01,079 --> 01:10:04,519
back in the day and tell me that they

1980
01:10:02,359 --> 01:10:08,399
had you know a granddaddy purple male

1981
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:10,280
yeah and I was like okay you know like

1982
01:10:08,399 --> 01:10:12,759
sure that's fine you I mean there's been

1983
01:10:10,279 --> 01:10:16,479
a lot of origin stories about the

1984
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:18,640
GDP um yeah I mean I've heard stories

1985
01:10:16,479 --> 01:10:21,198
you know there's been a lot of folklore

1986
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:23,280
about genetics all around oh yeah you

1987
01:10:21,198 --> 01:10:25,479
know and I think we didn't have the the

1988
01:10:23,279 --> 01:10:29,119
the recorded history of 20 years in

1989
01:10:25,479 --> 01:10:31,158
before without the internet yeah was I

1990
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:33,880
heard this from this person who heard it

1991
01:10:31,158 --> 01:10:35,158
from this person and a lot of the guys

1992
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:36,920
were in the shadows they didn't want to

1993
01:10:35,158 --> 01:10:38,279
be known even if they were the real

1994
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:40,359
reader they didn't want to be known as

1995
01:10:38,279 --> 01:10:41,920
the real reader yeah they didn't want

1996
01:10:40,359 --> 01:10:44,158
any credit they wanted the money that's

1997
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:46,359
it right that was my that was my

1998
01:10:44,158 --> 01:10:47,599
mentality yeah that was my mentality

1999
01:10:46,359 --> 01:10:49,799
back then you know there was the you

2000

2004
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:03,560
believed in the plant and just not just

2005

she was like hemp will save the world to

2007
01:11:06,399 --> 01:11:10,639
the point where when I was young I would

2008

01:12:48,439 --> 01:12:52,879
things that can only you know I don't

2054
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:56,560

01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:03,360
all agree on that but delt about THC

2058
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:05,719
taken orally as a medicine as a plant

2059
01:13:03,359 --> 01:13:08,399
medicine yeah I I just there's a place

for it there's a place for it and and

2061

that it's wrong yeah you know wrong to

2063
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:17,920

01:13:15,439 --> 01:13:20,158
yourself or for your children that might

2065
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:22,760
make them better yeah I mean I think so

2066
01:13:20,158 --> 01:13:24,479
many people feel very helpless so and

2067
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:26,560
especially the 20 years ago we were

2068
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:28,519
really helpless and you could go to jail

2069
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:31,800
for giving your kid medicine oh you can

2070
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:34,120
still now you you know now now it's

2071
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:35,760
possible yeah yeah you know and it's I

2072
01:13:34,119 --> 01:13:38,800
mean we'll get there one day I just you

2073
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:40,920

2074
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:42,520
of people like us didn't vote for it I

2075
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:43,520
read it right away I was like Oh I

2076
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:45,960
thought it was going to be the greatest

2077
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:47,320
thing for us for the community and I was

2078
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:49,719
reading it and I was like no they didn't

2079
01:13:47,319 --> 01:13:52,359
write this for us they they wrote this

2080
01:13:49,719 --> 01:13:54,679
for big Corporation you know and you

2081
01:13:52,359 --> 01:13:56,359
know here we are seven years in and you

2082
01:13:54,679 --> 01:13:59,440
know every mom and pop has been you know

2083
01:13:56,359 --> 01:14:01,158
just about decimated you know yeah I

2084
01:13:59,439 --> 01:14:03,519
mean I think we're seeing a Resurgence

2085
01:14:01,158 --> 01:14:05,839
and but you look at humble and Humble

2086
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:07,440
County is nothing compared to what it

2087
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:09,880
used to be the amount of grows and I

2088
01:14:07,439 --> 01:14:11,759
mean yeah it was traditional or whatever

2089
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:14,359
yeah but the the

2090
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:16,920
passion that stemmed out of Humble

2091
01:14:14,359 --> 01:14:18,559
County oh yeah was something special and

2092
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:20,800
the flower quality that came out of

2093
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:21,840
there like the top shelf you don't I

2094
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:23,560
don't see that stuff anymore

2095
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:25,920
unfortunately not not in the abundance

2096
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:28,239
that it was yeah cuz

2097
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:30,279
if most people around today that weren't

2098
01:14:28,238 --> 01:14:32,238
around back then were to see that

2099
01:14:30,279 --> 01:14:34,198
quality that smoke they would have a

2100
01:14:32,238 --> 01:14:35,238
different appreciation for outdoor yeah

2101
01:14:34,198 --> 01:14:38,399
you know I think there's a lot of people

2102
01:14:35,238 --> 01:14:40,678
that are like outo outdoor [ __ ] I love

2103
01:14:38,399 --> 01:14:42,759
outdoor I mean that's the real flavor

2104
01:14:40,679 --> 01:14:44,800
especially if you get a good OG or

2105
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:46,560
something that's piny and earthy like

2106
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:49,279
you smoke it and you taste all of that

2107
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:50,679
Pine all of that Earth Citrus in there

2108
01:14:49,279 --> 01:14:52,479
you can't go wrong with that and then it

2109
01:14:50,679 --> 01:14:54,119
just it's another one of those feel-good

2110
01:14:52,479 --> 01:14:56,238
moments where like a lot of that stuff

2111
01:14:54,119 --> 01:14:57,279
you can smoke a d night you smoke in the

2112
01:14:56,238 --> 01:15:00,359
middle of the day doesn't matter what

2113
01:14:57,279 --> 01:15:02,679
you're doing you feel amazing same plant

2114
01:15:00,359 --> 01:15:04,399
indoor outdoor two different highs yeah

2115
01:15:02,679 --> 01:15:06,399
two different highs I mean it's there on

2116
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:08,359
the indoor but that outdoor yeah and you

2117
01:15:06,399 --> 01:15:10,559
can have yeah two completely different

2118
01:15:08,359 --> 01:15:11,960
experiences with it yeah so and then

2119
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:14,039
some of the stuff you might have to

2120
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:16,039
smoke more of it because it's not as

2121
01:15:14,039 --> 01:15:18,039
concentrated but like it doesn't matter

2122
01:15:16,039 --> 01:15:20,399
because you get that good flavor well it

2123
01:15:18,039 --> 01:15:21,880
was like the same with GDP like GDP

2124
01:15:20,399 --> 01:15:24,119
wasn't I mean we didn't have testing

2125
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:26,639
back then yeah you know you didn't know

2126
01:15:24,119 --> 01:15:28,639
how and I've heard you know like GDP is

2127
01:15:26,639 --> 01:15:30,679
a low tester you I was like well that I

2128
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:32,800
don't care it was like it taste it was

2129
01:15:30,679 --> 01:15:35,480
the taste you got high you might have

2130
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:37,440
had to smoke a little more you know then

2131
01:15:35,479 --> 01:15:39,559
it tests in the 20s I mean it wasn't you

2132
01:15:37,439 --> 01:15:41,678
know back the one hitter quitters you

2133
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:42,960
know one hit you're done oh yeah you

2134
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:44,000
know it's been a while since I've had a

2135
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:46,679
one hitter

2136
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:48,039
quitter yeah I mean I then creep so I

2137
01:15:46,679 --> 01:15:50,880
just smoked some creeper weed for the

2138
01:15:48,039 --> 01:15:52,800
first time in years and I forgot what

2139
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:55,480
creeper Weed really is because I smoke

2140
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:59,079
this stuff and it was given

2141
01:15:55,479 --> 01:16:01,158
by John from Huckleberry Hill Farms okay

2142
01:15:59,079 --> 01:16:03,439
and it's called mother's mom's weed or

2143
01:16:01,158 --> 01:16:05,000
mother's weed and he gave me the white

2144
01:16:03,439 --> 01:16:06,439
Thorn Rose which I love and then I was

2145
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,479
like smoking on that and I'm like I got

2146
01:16:06,439 --> 01:16:09,599
to try some of this other stuff so I

2147
01:16:07,479 --> 01:16:11,158
roll a joint of it I'm puffing this

2148
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:13,120
joint I'm like [ __ ] dude this stuff's

2149
01:16:11,158 --> 01:16:16,439
not getting me high like literally not

2150
01:16:13,119 --> 01:16:19,519
getting me I smoked I smoked uh probably

2151
01:16:16,439 --> 01:16:21,000
a gram to my head I'm like [ __ ] this

2152
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:22,639
stuff didn't really give me that eye it

2153
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,639
tastes out right but it's not as good as

2154
01:16:22,639 --> 01:16:27,279
the white Thorn Rose and I'm sitting on

2155
01:16:24,639 --> 01:16:31,319
my couch and I I do this trivia thing on

2156
01:16:27,279 --> 01:16:34,158
on uh I play trivia trivia Quest or

2157
01:16:31,319 --> 01:16:36,039
trivia whatever it's on Netflix trivia

2158
01:16:34,158 --> 01:16:38,000
game and so I'm playing that and I'm

2159
01:16:36,039 --> 01:16:40,439
like 10 minutes in and all of a sudden

2160
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:42,840
I'm like wow feel great I haven't had

2161
01:16:40,439 --> 01:16:45,039
creeper weed and I don't head change how

2162
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:46,279
long where it's like you're not high

2163
01:16:45,039 --> 01:16:47,800
you're not high you're not high and then

2164
01:16:46,279 --> 01:16:50,559
all of a sudden it creeps up on you and

2165
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:53,199
you're like whoa whoa yeah dick in the

2166
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:55,639
dirt yeah yeah yeah especially when you

2167
01:16:53,198 --> 01:16:57,879
consume a bunch of it yeah uh but yeah

2168
01:16:55,639 --> 01:16:59,159
the delayed effect from that yeah and

2169
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:00,719
that's great and we used to have stuff

2170
01:16:59,158 --> 01:17:02,119
like that where you wouldn't you you'd

2171
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:03,520
be a little bit high off of smoke and

2172
01:17:02,119 --> 01:17:05,158
some like You' take a bong rip you'd

2173
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:06,880
feel little head change and then all of

2174
01:17:05,158 --> 01:17:08,879
a sudden 15 minutes later you're like

2175
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:10,159
can't even open your eyes yeah well I've

2176
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:11,600
noticed that too you know stepping away

2177
01:17:10,158 --> 01:17:13,319
from the industry like I have you know

2178
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:15,120
and I had variety you know everyone was

2179
01:17:13,319 --> 01:17:17,880
always throwing samples at me so I was

2180
01:17:15,119 --> 01:17:20,399
smoking stuff all the time and you know

2181
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:22,760
now I'm focused on other things I'm not

2182
01:17:20,399 --> 01:17:25,559
smoking as much and so when I do smoke

2183
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:26,960
now I'm just like whoa I get High yeah

2184
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:29,440
you know like high school high like I

2185
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:31,039
did back in the day like chems always do

2186
01:17:29,439 --> 01:17:32,919
that to me and that's why I love chems I

2187
01:17:31,039 --> 01:17:33,960
always call it high school high cuz it

2188
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:36,239
gets you to that level of high where

2189
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:38,800
you're like [ __ ] everyone knows I'm high

2190
01:17:36,238 --> 01:17:41,238
yeah you know and chem's no matter what

2191
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:43,159
no matter I mean it's like I don't

2192
01:17:41,238 --> 01:17:46,158
personally my endocannabinoid system I

2193
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:48,359
guess does not have a tolerance to chem

2194
01:17:46,158 --> 01:17:50,839
and it just gets me high I could just

2195
01:17:48,359 --> 01:17:53,000
smoke it all night the sour was a low

2196
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:55,600
tester I remember testing some Sour when

2197
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:58,039
they first started doing testing um

2198
01:17:55,600 --> 01:18:00,320
before it was Steep Hill I mean there

2199
01:17:58,039 --> 01:18:02,359
was Halen I got Halen labs they they

2200
01:18:00,319 --> 01:18:03,639
tested some stuff and I still have the

2201
01:18:02,359 --> 01:18:06,319
testing results from it I think it was

2202
01:18:03,639 --> 01:18:08,520
Sour Diesel I tested 12 and a half% or

2203
01:18:06,319 --> 01:18:10,559
133% something like that super low yeah

2204
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:13,159
super low but it was strong it would it

2205
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:16,560
would kick your ass yeah especially

2206
01:18:13,158 --> 01:18:19,319
compared to the stuff is like 25 27 30%

2207
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:21,080
now yeah that stuff was strong and it

2208
01:18:19,319 --> 01:18:22,439
sour it was like couch lock weed like

2209
01:18:21,079 --> 01:18:26,238
you would smoke it and you would be

2210
01:18:22,439 --> 01:18:27,839
wrecked yeah yeah at 12% yeah yeah my

2211
01:18:26,238 --> 01:18:29,279
dad you know he's an old old school

2212
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:31,319
longtime smoker same with my

2213
01:18:29,279 --> 01:18:33,039
father-in-law and I I think that's one

2214
01:18:31,319 --> 01:18:35,399
thing that the industry is missing is

2215
01:18:33,039 --> 01:18:38,319
you know they try to cater to that

2216
01:18:35,399 --> 01:18:40,000
demographic that 21 to 35 year old male

2217
01:18:38,319 --> 01:18:42,158
yeah drives the industry and that's why

2218
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,800
we have all this purple gas well you

2219
01:18:42,158 --> 01:18:47,039
have these guys from the 70s and 80s who

2220
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:49,119
are you know in their 70s now and they

2221
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:50,399
want to come back to cannabis you know

2222
01:18:49,119 --> 01:18:52,800
they've raised their families they've

2223
01:18:50,399 --> 01:18:54,439
got their grandchildren now both my

2224
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:57,920
father and my father-in-law you know

2225
01:18:54,439 --> 01:19:00,399
like the weed you guys have now nope

2226
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:02,520
can't do it and so it it just seems like

2227
01:19:00,399 --> 01:19:05,559
to me like the the market is missing

2228
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:07,600
this whole demographic of buyer because

2229
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:09,920
the THC levels are so high and so

2230
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:11,239
through the roof and uh I've always

2231
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:13,480
everywhere I've went I've always try to

2232
01:19:11,238 --> 01:19:18,079
push get them give them a one to one

2233
01:19:13,479 --> 01:19:20,479
yeah for red you know a 10% to 10%

2234
01:19:18,079 --> 01:19:22,719
something low key for these it'll bring

2235
01:19:20,479 --> 01:19:24,959
those old smokers back into the fold the

2236
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:26,600
white Thorn Rose if you have a chance to

2237
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:29,198
get it if I can get some I'll get you

2238
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:30,719
get you some love try those guys and to

2239
01:19:29,198 --> 01:19:31,759
give it to those guys because I feel

2240
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:33,679
like I just want to give it out to

2241
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:34,719
everybody and I'm grow some Blue 13 and

2242
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:37,039
I'm going to do the same thing I'm GNA

2243
01:19:34,719 --> 01:19:38,639
give it out to all the ogs all the older

2244
01:19:37,039 --> 01:19:41,519
guys that don't want strong weed but

2245
01:19:38,639 --> 01:19:44,000
want the good effect yeah because

2246
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:47,239
there's certain varieties that just make

2247
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:48,319
you feel good and I feel and I don't

2248
01:19:47,238 --> 01:19:49,879
know though I haven't done enough

2249
01:19:48,319 --> 01:19:53,920
testing this is all anecdotal right so

2250
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:55,119
it's all just on me and I feel like

2251
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:56,239
there's a lot of people that would

2252
01:19:55,119 --> 01:19:57,559
probably benefit from it where they

2253
01:19:56,238 --> 01:19:58,879
smoke it they just feel great and they

2254
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:01,159
would love that and they would want to

2255
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:03,719
smoke more of that and they would just

2256
01:20:01,158 --> 01:20:05,519
enjoy weed again and feel like because

2257
01:20:03,719 --> 01:20:06,760
some people it's too strong or whatever

2258
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:08,360
or some people they're lightweights and

2259
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:11,079
it makes a you they get heart

2260
01:20:08,359 --> 01:20:12,479
palpitations or whatever it is and it's

2261
01:20:11,079 --> 01:20:13,840
like but if they smoke this stuff they

2262
01:20:12,479 --> 01:20:16,238
would probably feel good and be happy

2263
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:18,400
and be like yeah I like weed yeah yeah

2264
01:20:16,238 --> 01:20:20,718
and that's you know and again though you

2265
01:20:18,399 --> 01:20:22,559
know try back to the 10 week strains in

2266
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:24,399
in a commercial production they won't do

2267
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:26,199
it you know just it doesn't fit sorry we

2268
01:20:24,399 --> 01:20:28,519
can't do it the demographic who's going

2269
01:20:26,198 --> 01:20:30,638
to buy this is too small right you know

2270
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:32,120
there was a gentleman who who who came

2271
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:33,639
to us you know one of the companies I

2272
01:20:32,119 --> 01:20:35,800
was working for and he was trying to

2273
01:20:33,639 --> 01:20:37,600
pitch that same idea and he came to me

2274
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:39,960
first through a connection of of a

2275
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:41,920
mutual friend yeah you know hey Jimmy I

2276
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:44,560
got this buddy Jerry I want to introduce

2277
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:46,679
you to him he's a he's a marketing guy

2278
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:48,760
he's not even a weed guy and he comes

2279
01:20:46,679 --> 01:20:51,920
and he pitches this whole and when he

2280
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:54,039
starts pitching low THC I was just like

2281
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:56,239
yes I have been talking about this for

2282
01:20:54,039 --> 01:20:58,238
the last five 5 years six years in

2283
01:20:56,238 --> 01:21:01,399
companies trying to and here he had the

2284
01:20:58,238 --> 01:21:04,319
whole marketing deal packaged you know

2285
01:21:01,399 --> 01:21:08,158
it was this low low uh you know low

2286
01:21:04,319 --> 01:21:09,439
THC uh a light beer you know a day beer

2287
01:21:08,158 --> 01:21:11,479
right it's kind of you know kind of you

2288
01:21:09,439 --> 01:21:14,079
know it's daytime it's a daytime smoke

2289
01:21:11,479 --> 01:21:16,279
or or or for you know that guy from who

2290
01:21:14,079 --> 01:21:19,359
used to smoke in the 70s and the 80s who

2291
01:21:16,279 --> 01:21:21,639
only had 10 and 12% you know THC back

2292
01:21:19,359 --> 01:21:24,039
then even so i' i've smoked some really

2293
01:21:21,639 --> 01:21:26,079
cool CBG and I'm working on some CBG

2294
01:21:24,039 --> 01:21:28,158
stuff right now now and I mean I think

2295
01:21:26,079 --> 01:21:30,679
some of those guys would love CBG

2296
01:21:28,158 --> 01:21:32,399
because it doesn't really get you high

2297
01:21:30,679 --> 01:21:34,079
it does make you feel different though

2298
01:21:32,399 --> 01:21:35,519
you a little bit of head change whereas

2299
01:21:34,079 --> 01:21:37,479
you're not really high you could I could

2300
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:39,800
smoke at any time of the day and not be

2301
01:21:37,479 --> 01:21:41,799
high but it does make me feel super

2302
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:43,320
relaxed yeah and I think some of those

2303
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:44,639
guys that used to smoke just the leaves

2304
01:21:43,319 --> 01:21:46,000
maybe that's what it did it for them and

2305
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:47,960
maybe there was CBG that they were

2306
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:50,439
smoking too because it's a precursor

2307
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:52,039
that turns into CBD and you know and you

2308
01:21:50,439 --> 01:21:54,119
know you know back in the day we had

2309
01:21:52,039 --> 01:21:55,600
prenda oh yeah and I just think back

2310
01:21:54,119 --> 01:21:57,920
then now that what we know now those

2311
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:59,520
were CBD strains yeah those were CBD

2312
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:01,079
dominant strains and we just it didn't

2313
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:03,600
even get you high yeah it didn't get you

2314
01:22:01,079 --> 01:22:05,600
high you know and but it looked just

2315
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:07,280
like the stuff that got you high for

2316
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:08,600
sure yeah there's a good chance yeah we

2317
01:22:07,279 --> 01:22:11,399
didn't have testing so we didn't know we

2318
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:13,239
didn't know the pretend yeah the prenda

2319
01:22:11,399 --> 01:22:14,799
that's you know you bring up CVG and I I

2320
01:22:13,238 --> 01:22:15,919
really would like to try some myself

2321
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:18,960
because I've heard a lot of good things

2322
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:20,560
about it yeah yeah so yeah it's great

2323
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:22,158
especially if you don't want to

2324
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:24,280
necessarily be high but you just want to

2325
01:22:22,158 --> 01:22:26,039
relax and chill yeah uh I think it's a

2326
01:22:24,279 --> 01:22:27,719
great alternative to cigarettes for all

2327
01:22:26,039 --> 01:22:29,560
you cigarette smokers out there I think

2328
01:22:27,719 --> 01:22:32,239
it's a great way to go because you do

2329
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:34,199
get an effect but it's not like you're

2330
01:22:32,238 --> 01:22:36,279
so high you can't work or you can't do

2331
01:22:34,198 --> 01:22:39,039
this or you can't do that sure it's this

2332
01:22:36,279 --> 01:22:41,399
weird euphoric kind of high to it you

2333
01:22:39,039 --> 01:22:44,560
know you're just elevated or something

2334
01:22:41,399 --> 01:22:47,319
just elevated it's almost relaxing like

2335
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:48,560
like ibuprofen is for for me when I take

2336
01:22:47,319 --> 01:22:51,039
because I don't take ibuprofen a lot but

2337
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:54,039
when I do take it ipren really relaxes

2338
01:22:51,039 --> 01:22:56,679
when you're like oh wow interesting yeah

2339
01:22:54,039 --> 01:22:58,399
never that effect from ibuprofen but

2340
01:22:56,679 --> 01:23:00,639
yeah yeah I mean it's just it's a muscle

2341
01:22:58,399 --> 01:23:02,799
yeah it's a anti-inflammatory and it

2342
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:05,159
relaxes your muscles but I that makes me

2343
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:06,800
I could sleep when I take AB roof I'm

2344
01:23:05,158 --> 01:23:08,559
like one of those guys I'm I'm always

2345
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:11,400
working I don't sleep that much yeah

2346
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:13,039
yeah so yeah if I take benagil or I take

2347
01:23:11,399 --> 01:23:15,279
Ibuprofen and make you tired oh yeah I'm

2348
01:23:13,039 --> 01:23:17,039
out yeah I've gotten that way too I mean

2349
01:23:15,279 --> 01:23:18,559
I'm in my 50s now it's I've gotten to

2350
01:23:17,039 --> 01:23:21,198
that point where I sit on the C if I sit

2351
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:23,280
on the couch for too long yeah I'm out

2352
01:23:21,198 --> 01:23:25,960
yeah you know like really I got to that

2353
01:23:23,279 --> 01:23:28,359
age I feel because I work so much when I

2354
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:29,679
do sit on the couch I'm I'm out yeah

2355
01:23:28,359 --> 01:23:32,158

2376
01:24:16,439 --> 01:24:20,439
another new ankle because I'm bone to

2377
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:23,000
bone nice so another reason you know

2378
01:24:20,439 --> 01:24:24,559
like I'm falling apart physically you

2379
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,158
know just from all of the you the

2380
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:27,800
Cannabis industry work sure you know

2381
01:24:26,158 --> 01:24:29,638
being a farmer doing this stuff my whole

2382
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:31,639
life popping up passion for the sacred

2383
01:24:29,639 --> 01:24:33,319
plant it'll do that to you yeah you know

2384
01:24:31,639 --> 01:24:35,119
and it's it's really it's it's starting

2385
01:24:33,319 --> 01:24:37,439
to take an effect on my body you know

2386
01:24:35,119 --> 01:24:40,198
physically even you know I always

2387
01:24:37,439 --> 01:24:42,678
promote you know melanoma awareness yeah

2388
01:24:40,198 --> 01:24:45,238
you know I've had melanoma I've had skin

2389
01:24:42,679 --> 01:24:47,840
cancer you know and and to all you you

2390
01:24:45,238 --> 01:24:49,959
know young Growers out there who uh you

2391
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:53,199
know out there doing your full terms and

2392
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:54,960
uh you're in the sun all day and uh you

2393
01:24:53,198 --> 01:24:56,519
know cover yourself up it's important

2394
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:58,560
you know cuz not only that like I spend

2395
01:24:56,520 --> 01:25:01,080
you know my days out in the sun and then

2396
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:03,400
I'll go into an indoor room where I have

2397
01:25:01,079 --> 01:25:05,079
UV pounding me all day long too go get

2398
01:25:03,399 --> 01:25:07,198
your sunscreen in Europe don't buy this

2399
01:25:05,079 --> 01:25:08,639
American stuff no yeah I mean I'll

2400
01:25:07,198 --> 01:25:10,599
probably get some hate for that well I

2401
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:13,560
try I I I'm not a fan of sunscreen

2402
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:15,920
period just greasy oily I I have now I

2403
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:17,960
have a u UV protective clothing like

2404
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:19,560
I'll wear a UV Gator I'll wear a long

2405
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:21,639
sleeve cuz I just don't like that's the

2406
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:23,639
way to go and I I think some of these

2407
01:25:21,639 --> 01:25:26,880
these creams and some of these lotions

2408
01:25:23,639 --> 01:25:29,079
the you know these SPF lotions can cause

2409
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:31,199
cancer I'm not an expert on the subject

2410
01:25:29,079 --> 01:25:32,679
but I know in Europe they're a lot

2411
01:25:31,198 --> 01:25:35,479
healthier and they're a lot cleaner they

2412
01:25:32,679 --> 01:25:36,560
don't test them on animals yeah so yeah

2413
01:25:35,479 --> 01:25:39,678
because the ones of the state you have

2414
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:41,920
to test them on animals okay yeah so my

2415
01:25:39,679 --> 01:25:45,000
first time it my first time going to

2416
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:47,199
Europe I went to Ireland and just see

2417
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:49,399
their culture compared to ours all the

2418
01:25:47,198 --> 01:25:52,399
things that they don't have in their

2419
01:25:49,399 --> 01:25:55,479
food and in their products and and in

2420
01:25:52,399 --> 01:25:58,519
their society was just kind of just was

2421
01:25:55,479 --> 01:26:00,000
an eye opener to me you know like whoo

2422
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:03,040
okay I mean they don't even have high

2423
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:05,158
fructose corn syrup banned yeah you know

2424
01:26:03,039 --> 01:26:07,279
like uh so it was just interesting the

2425
01:26:05,158 --> 01:26:09,118
food tasted different it tasted better

2426
01:26:07,279 --> 01:26:11,719
the bread I think the bread for me the

2427
01:26:09,118 --> 01:26:14,039
bread it I digest the bread better for

2428
01:26:11,719 --> 01:26:16,158
sure I digest the bread in Europe better

2429
01:26:14,039 --> 01:26:19,238
so something with the better quality

2430
01:26:16,158 --> 01:26:21,198
yeah Roundup oh there's no Roundup over

2431
01:26:19,238 --> 01:26:22,799
in Europe it's all [ __ ] band yeah

2432
01:26:21,198 --> 01:26:25,039
there it's funny you bring that up and

2433
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:27,000
I'm like oh yeah I apply hundreds of

2434
01:26:25,039 --> 01:26:29,560
gallons of Roundup on the weekend as a

2435
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:31,920
state you know I have a state license

2436
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:34,320
yeah I have a qac uh I I you know for a

2437
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:35,480
while there I you know started a family

2438
01:26:34,319 --> 01:26:37,759
you know Dad's like you got to get a

2439
01:26:35,479 --> 01:26:40,839
real job son of course you know I got to

2440
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:42,440
get some benefits here and he gets me in

2441
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:46,039
uh with the state applying you know

2442
01:26:42,439 --> 01:26:48,559
being a pesticide applicator and so uh

2443
01:26:46,039 --> 01:26:50,800
glyphosate and so I end up yeah you know

2444
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:53,119
become an State applicator U and that's

2445
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:54,840
where I got my education basically like

2446
01:26:53,118 --> 01:26:57,198
understanding so I had that you know and

2447
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:59,239
then Here Comes legalization around you

2448
01:26:57,198 --> 01:27:00,519
know and I realize oh wow all of my

2449
01:26:59,238 --> 01:27:01,839
friends who are now going into this

2450
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:04,080
legal thing they're going to have to

2451
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:05,960
follow all of these rules all these a

2452
01:27:04,079 --> 01:27:09,399
rules and all these pesticide safety

2453
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:11,239
rules and that's where I come in and so

2454
01:27:09,399 --> 01:27:12,879
I was able to come into places and

2455
01:27:11,238 --> 01:27:14,759
explain to you know people who thought

2456
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:16,760
they had like the full compliance

2457
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:18,039
program you know well we've got

2458
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:19,360
everything we've got the metric we've

2459
01:27:18,039 --> 01:27:21,880
got this okay are you guys doing your

2460
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:23,599
pesticide use reports what are those

2461
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:25,279
yeah oh so you're not doing them you're

2462
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:26,639
not doing your money P use reports

2463
01:27:25,279 --> 01:27:28,399
either what's that well that's where you

2464
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:30,600
have to report all the stuff that you've

2465
01:27:28,399 --> 01:27:32,319
applied and so I already knew this whole

2466
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:33,920
system and so when legalization came

2467
01:27:32,319 --> 01:27:36,118
around I read that like you oh this

2468
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:38,800
isn't for us this is for corporations

2469
01:27:36,118 --> 01:27:39,960
and stuff like that I just kind of

2470
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:41,880
pivoted I was like I'll do this

2471
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:43,600
Consulting thing yeah you know where I'm

2472
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:45,639
helping my friends you know who don't

2473
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:47,360
know and we're the Cannabis industry so

2474
01:27:45,639 --> 01:27:48,440
they're going to come down hard on us

2475
01:27:47,359 --> 01:27:50,399
for sure you know I've been through

2476
01:27:48,439 --> 01:27:53,238
inspections they're waiting for just

2477
01:27:50,399 --> 01:27:54,519
just give us a reason to you know to to

2478
01:27:53,238 --> 01:27:55,479
write you up something you know that's

2479
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:59,000
not in

2480
01:27:55,479 --> 01:28:01,000
compliance and um and so you know I

2481
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:03,000
already knew how to run these programs

2482
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:04,639
and so I was super confident in selling

2483
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:06,319
that information to people and going in

2484
01:28:04,639 --> 01:28:08,199
and setting up IPM programs and

2485
01:28:06,319 --> 01:28:11,479
Reporting and recordkeeping and all that

2486
01:28:08,198 --> 01:28:13,238
stuff be from my you know past you know

2487
01:28:11,479 --> 01:28:15,559
as being an applicator with the state

2488
01:28:13,238 --> 01:28:17,079
for a while there fortunately I only did

2489
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:19,800
that you know for like two or three

2490
01:28:17,079 --> 01:28:21,840
years I end up getting injured uh

2491
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:24,159
because of Union rules I had to give up

2492
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:25,679
my position which I was kind of fine

2493
01:28:24,158 --> 01:28:27,519
because most of the time all I was doing

2494
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:29,158
was applying glyphosate on the weekends

2495
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:31,560
yeah hundreds and hundreds of gallons

2496
01:28:29,158 --> 01:28:33,319
every weekend and I you know I was just

2497
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:35,880
like you know this this is not you know

2498
01:28:33,319 --> 01:28:38,759
being an applicator is not a career it's

2499
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:41,520
not something you want to do for 25 30

2500
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:42,880
years so when I got injured and I had to

2501
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:45,280
like give up that position as an

2502
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:47,159
applicator I was perfectly fine with

2503
01:28:45,279 --> 01:28:48,840
that I bet and I just you know and

2504
01:28:47,158 --> 01:28:50,559
that's you know I had to get my first

2505
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:52,199
ankle reconstructed and so I just

2506
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:53,480
pivoted you know took that and like

2507
01:28:52,198 --> 01:28:55,000
switched it over to the Cannabis

2508
01:28:53,479 --> 01:28:57,399
industry

2509
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:58,880
and uh I still do you know people still

2510
01:28:57,399 --> 01:29:02,519
hit me up who are having you know

2511
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:04,319
questions about compliance or um you

2512
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:07,760
know just you know some of the recipes

2513
01:29:04,319 --> 01:29:09,479
that I've Sops yeah you know and a lot

2514
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:11,280
of them are friends and homies so it's

2515
01:29:09,479 --> 01:29:13,439

01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:19,679
for what I've no I mean this we were all

2519
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:21,840
you know this this all started off as

2520
01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:24,279
you know we all share the information

2521
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:26,560
with each other so we cool people yeah

2522
01:29:24,279 --> 01:29:28,279
with cool people if you're a good person

2523
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:29,440
you're going to be a good grower and

2524
01:29:28,279 --> 01:29:31,639
that was the other thing is back in the

2525
01:29:29,439 --> 01:29:33,000
day you know if you were a shitty grower

2526
01:29:31,639 --> 01:29:34,920
well that's because everyone you knew

2527
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,600
was a shitty grower you had a shitty

2528
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:38,118

good grower it's cuz you had good people

2530
01:29:38,118 --> 01:29:41,439
around you well I think a lot of people

2531
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:42,719
got by because I had friends that were

2532
01:29:41,439 --> 01:29:44,238
shitty Growers and I had friends that

2533
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:47,279
were amazing Growers but the shitty

2534
01:29:44,238 --> 01:29:48,839
Growers still got by because people

2535
01:29:47,279 --> 01:29:50,599
would still buy weed for a good amount

2536
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:53,199
of money and those guys are long gone

2537
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:55,760
because people won't pay for shitty weed

2538
01:29:53,198 --> 01:29:57,759
now no you $300 it cost you more than

2539
01:29:55,760 --> 01:30:00,800
$300 to produce a pound and there's

2540
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:02,560
shitty pounds for $300 yeah well then

2541
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:04,719
when when all that BC came around it

2542
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:06,199
just really wrecked the market it really

2543
01:30:04,719 --> 01:30:08,399
it just destroyed all of a sudden you

2544
01:30:06,198 --> 01:30:11,399
had this middle category you know that

2545
01:30:08,399 --> 01:30:13,839
was like what way for a little bit right

2546
01:30:11,399 --> 01:30:16,359
from like 97 there was like a decline in

2547
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:19,360
the home grows until 2001 when the World

2548
01:30:16,359 --> 01:30:21,359
Trade Center happened 911 and then all

2549
01:30:19,359 --> 01:30:23,439
of a sudden the borders were locked down

2550
01:30:21,359 --> 01:30:25,000
so the BC Bud wasn't coming in and so

2551
01:30:23,439 --> 01:30:27,158
all of a sudden H grow started popping

2552
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:28,800
up again like crazy yeah yep so there

2553
01:30:27,158 --> 01:30:31,599
was this Resurgence of all this stuff

2554
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:33,119
and people were striving to grow quality

2555
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:35,159
but I think a lot of people were like

2556
01:30:33,118 --> 01:30:36,519
just resting on their Laurels they grew

2557
01:30:35,158 --> 01:30:37,879
good enough weed yeah and they were

2558
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:39,280
still making a good like you could make

2559
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:41,560
a good living if you were just willing

2560
01:30:39,279 --> 01:30:43,519
to grow plants see in my whole thing you

2561
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:45,719
you said the good enough weed it was you

2562
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:47,880
know if you grow good weed it sells

2563
01:30:45,719 --> 01:30:50,158
itself right it should that's the best

2564
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:51,840
part about it yeah and so I was always

2565
01:30:50,158 --> 01:30:54,559
fortunate enough to be a good grower to

2566
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:56,560
wear my stuff was sold before it was

2567
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:58,480
even dry yeah you know they were just

2568
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:59,880
waiting for me to say they would take it

2569
01:30:58,479 --> 01:31:01,359
when it was still a little bit wet just

2570
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:02,719
a little and I was one of those guys I

2571
01:31:01,359 --> 01:31:05,238
would I would drive for three and four

2572
01:31:02,719 --> 01:31:07,920
weeks yeah I you know I wanted a long

2573
01:31:05,238 --> 01:31:09,879
slow dry with a cure and all that really

2574
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:11,158
bring that flavor out you know I had a

2575
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:13,118
network of friends who were who were

2576
01:31:11,158 --> 01:31:15,599
doing OG and they would send that stuff

2577
01:31:13,118 --> 01:31:17,799
down to you know La half soggy yeah you

2578
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:20,000
it's dry but yeah but by the time it got

2579
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:21,560
to La it sweat it out yeah they weren't

2580
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:23,279
burping it and they weren't burping it

2581
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:24,760
you know yeah it just was all gooey and

2582
01:31:23,279 --> 01:31:26,719
and the guys were still taking it down

2583
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:29,159
there I said yeah but eventually they're

2584
01:31:26,719 --> 01:31:31,118
going to find someone who has same at a

2585
01:31:29,158 --> 01:31:33,599
better quality at the same price and

2586
01:31:31,118 --> 01:31:35,399
you're out yeah you know and so I always

2587
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:37,920
made sure that yeah I grew the best that

2588
01:31:35,399 --> 01:31:40,118
I could it was always sold ahead of time

2589
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:42,480
because if it was subpar now you're

2590
01:31:40,118 --> 01:31:44,000
having to shop it everywhere exactly you

2591
01:31:42,479 --> 01:31:45,519
know and it was just oh sample for you

2592
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,238
sample for you sample for you your price

2593
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:48,920
goes down and then your price drops and

2594
01:31:47,238 --> 01:31:51,158
drops and drop you could hold a good

2595
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:52,840
price yeah you know especially back in

2596
01:31:51,158 --> 01:31:54,479
those days when it was 4,000 a pound

2597
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:55,840
yeah yeah especially had the best it

2598
01:31:54,479 --> 01:31:58,519
sell itself you didn't have to worry

2599
01:31:55,840 --> 01:32:00,440
about it unless you grew Blue Dream at a

2600
01:31:58,520 --> 01:32:02,360
certain point or GDP at a certain point

2601
01:32:00,439 --> 01:32:04,359
at a certain point you know but you know

2602
01:32:02,359 --> 01:32:06,198
if you know blueberry Hayes you know

2603
01:32:04,359 --> 01:32:08,479
always always use no it's not Blue Dream

2604
01:32:06,198 --> 01:32:11,198
It's blueberry Hayes yeah oh okay oh the

2605
01:32:08,479 --> 01:32:14,000
rename game was big back then yeah yeah

2606
01:32:11,198 --> 01:32:16,759
yeah exactly when granddaddy per came

2607
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:18,840
out you know that was you know where you

2608
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:20,159
know things got confusing yeah you know

2609
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:21,960
because it was like wait a you know

2610
01:32:20,158 --> 01:32:24,719
where did this come from wait how come I

2611
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:27,399
got granddaddy per seeds

2612
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:28,800
but half of my plants are green yeah you

2613
01:32:27,399 --> 01:32:30,198
know how come it's not purple like the

2614
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:32,480
granddaddy purple that we used to get

2615
01:32:30,198 --> 01:32:34,439
the third floor yep because it's two

2616
01:32:32,479 --> 01:32:36,000
different things well there was the feno

2617
01:32:34,439 --> 01:32:37,359
of the green granddaddy per that was

2618
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:39,039
going around that would like maybe

2619
01:32:37,359 --> 01:32:40,639
purple a little bit but for just a

2620
01:32:39,039 --> 01:32:43,600
little on the inside deep in a little

2621
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:46,639
bit but it was a green plant that was it

2622
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:48,000
yeah that was the that was the inferior

2623
01:32:46,639 --> 01:32:49,920
yeah when people would show me that you

2624
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:52,359
know the the picture of their Granddaddy

2625
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:54,359
Purple plant and it was green I'm like

2626
01:32:52,359 --> 01:32:56,479
that's not it no that's what what do you

2627
01:32:54,359 --> 01:32:58,920
mean it's not I'm I don't want to like

2628
01:32:56,479 --> 01:33:00,519
real GDP blacks out and yeah and I would

2629
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:02,279
tell people like and I I don't want to

2630
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:04,360
cuz you know people take a lot of Pride

2631
01:33:02,279 --> 01:33:06,319
and we take pride in our work yeah you

2632
01:33:04,359 --> 01:33:08,920
know and these you know people were very

2633
01:33:06,319 --> 01:33:10,519
proud you know that they had GDP and

2634
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:13,960
they were working with GDP and then they

2635
01:33:10,520 --> 01:33:16,119
would show me and I would be like H you

2636
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:17,679
know and it's like it was really hard to

2637
01:33:16,118 --> 01:33:19,279
you know to not I was like well hey

2638
01:33:17,679 --> 01:33:20,560
that's that's how you want to do it

2639
01:33:19,279 --> 01:33:22,118
that's your thing that's fine you know

2640
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:23,400
but just a lot of that stuff went in R

2641
01:33:22,118 --> 01:33:25,399
dispensaries too where they had like

2642
01:33:23,399 --> 01:33:28,000
green GDP and it's like how can it be

2643
01:33:25,399 --> 01:33:30,158
green it's not a green purple it's got

2644
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:32,279
to be purple yeah it's called GDP for a

2645
01:33:30,158 --> 01:33:34,319
reason yeah and then yeah when I let the

2646
01:33:32,279 --> 01:33:37,359
cut go finally I think like around in

2647
01:33:34,319 --> 01:33:39,319
2005 again OG had kind of taken over

2648
01:33:37,359 --> 01:33:40,839
purple was fading out I gave it to a

2649
01:33:39,319 --> 01:33:43,559
group of guys in San Francisco and a

2650
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:45,920
group of guys in Oakland where they went

2651
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:47,480
with it I don't know I it got everywhere

2652
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:50,158
though I heard it went up made it up to

2653
01:33:47,479 --> 01:33:52,919
Canada yeah it did for sure you it was

2654
01:33:50,158 --> 01:33:54,399
up in Washington it was it was yeah I

2655
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:55,719
mean I'm sure it was in Colorado and

2656
01:33:54,399 --> 01:33:57,638
east coast and stuff like that tooo but

2657
01:33:55,719 --> 01:34:00,000
I remember from here when they started

2658
01:33:57,639 --> 01:34:01,760
selling clones of it okay you buy clones

2659
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:05,279
of the dispensary GDP and it was maybe

2660
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:07,600
200 five or six yeah that's about right

2661
01:34:05,279 --> 01:34:10,519
and that's kind I mean by then I had let

2662
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:12,239
it out again not saying only I had it

2663
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:14,560
because I it came to me as a cut someone

2664
01:34:12,238 --> 01:34:16,919
else up in Humble had it too right but

2665
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:19,280
to them it was just the per yeah you

2666
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:20,639
know maybe they didn't know that hey

2667
01:34:19,279 --> 01:34:21,920
this other guy who got it and they took

2668
01:34:20,639 --> 01:34:23,400
it down to the Bay Area and now it's

2669
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:26,520
granddaddy per sure one point it was

2670
01:34:23,399 --> 01:34:28,759
being so his meno per I'm sure in Menino

2671
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:30,760
yeah yeah uh there was only one person

2672
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:33,000
who actually like came really close and

2673
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:36,320
that was Brandon from di breed seeds

2674
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:38,520
yeah he came to me with a bag and he was

2675
01:34:36,319 --> 01:34:40,039
just like smell this look at it and I as

2676
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:42,880
soon as I smelled it I was like that's

2677
01:34:40,039 --> 01:34:44,639
Grandaddy purple yeah and he's like I

2678
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:47,118
thought it was I I knew it was and I

2679
01:34:44,639 --> 01:34:49,560
knew you would you know he gave me a cut

2680
01:34:47,118 --> 01:34:52,839
and I held onto that cut for a while and

2681
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:54,280
then uh I thought it was great bab you

2682
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:55,719
know I thought the cut was gra AP

2683
01:34:54,279 --> 01:34:58,800
because it just didn't have that

2684
01:34:55,719 --> 01:35:01,118
structure you know GDP had those long

2685
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:03,159
you know leavs that kind of overlapped

2686
01:35:01,118 --> 01:35:04,920
each other right you know and this

2687
01:35:03,158 --> 01:35:06,879
didn't have that look and so I was like

2688
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:09,239
ah this this might be a watered down

2689
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:11,520

2691
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:17,199
closest that it came you know to anyone

2692
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:19,239

2693
01:35:17,198 --> 01:35:22,479

2700
01:35:35,118 --> 01:35:39,439
I was so excited to see it and such a

2701
01:35:37,719 --> 01:35:41,359
disappointment it was it was just like

2702
01:35:39,439 --> 01:35:42,960
damn this isn't it it didn't have the

2703
01:35:41,359 --> 01:35:44,198
smell it didn't have the look it didn't

2704
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:47,520
definitely didn't have the structure the

2705
01:35:44,198 --> 01:35:49,319
structure was way off you know Genie p i

2706
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:51,520
mean there's I'm not going to start

2707
01:35:49,319 --> 01:35:53,319
going into what crosses have GDP that

2708
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:55,400
weren't named that they people don't

2709
01:35:53,319 --> 01:35:56,799
admit that GDP was in there but there's

2710
01:35:55,399 --> 01:35:59,519
definitely some stuff that I think is

2711
01:35:56,800 --> 01:36:02,079
amazing throughout the last 15 years

2712
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:05,040
they've crossed with it yeah um that

2713
01:36:02,079 --> 01:36:08,800
maybe asn't G as Fair Credit yeah but if

2714

2722
01:36:25,158 --> 01:36:30,879
pessimistic I'm not too optimistic about

2723

2736
01:36:59,198 --> 01:37:02,238
you know unless you're guy who you know

2737

traditional Market hey that's your own

2741
01:37:07,399 --> 01:37:11,319
thing but for the people who are trying

2742
01:37:09,158 --> 01:37:13,079
to step into you know what we have now

2743
01:37:11,319 --> 01:37:16,840
is you know 6

2744
01:37:13,079 --> 01:37:19,279
64 I wouldn't advise I wouldn't do it

2745
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:21,039

2746
01:37:19,279 --> 01:37:23,319
yeah it really takes a lot I mean you

2747
01:37:21,039 --> 01:37:25,158
got to be able to work out a loss you

2748
01:37:23,319 --> 01:37:26,519
know and take some real hard hits for

2749
01:37:25,158 --> 01:37:29,759
the first five years and if you can

2750
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:31,920
financially survive that then you know

2751
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:33,560
you might have a place at the table Yeah

2752
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:35,000
but if you're just you know again if

2753
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:36,480
you're just you know firing up your

2754

you know but you know do do it for fun

2759
01:37:47,479 --> 01:37:51,479
and do it for yourself but then you know

2760
01:37:48,639 --> 01:37:54,920
it gets to this point where it's like my

2761
01:37:51,479 --> 01:37:56,479
energy bill you know residential rate

2762
01:37:54,920 --> 01:37:58,039

LEDs do it small because it gets to the

2765
01:38:00,118 --> 01:38:04,759
point where you're like wow I could go

2766
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:06,679
buy even an overpriced ounce in the

2767
01:38:04,760 --> 01:38:08,800

2768
01:38:06,679 --> 01:38:12,239
I'm growing it in my on my residential

2769
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:14,320
rate yeah you know and that's and that's

2770
01:38:12,238 --> 01:38:16,039
where you know I was always on a

2771
01:38:14,319 --> 01:38:18,238
residential rate I never had a

2772
01:38:16,039 --> 01:38:20,118
commercial setup you know I had access

2773
01:38:18,238 --> 01:38:21,959
to you always paid for power always paid

2774
01:38:20,118 --> 01:38:24,439
for power well back in the day I had

2775
01:38:21,960 --> 01:38:26,279
friends and we we did big hund lighters

2776
01:38:24,439 --> 01:38:28,559
in Oakland where yeah jumping the power

2777
01:38:26,279 --> 01:38:30,279
was the thing the only way to go though

2778
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:31,920
for your power they bust you oh yeah

2779
01:38:30,279 --> 01:38:33,319
absolutely I mean it's I think there was

2780
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:35,520
even a time up north where they would

2781
01:38:33,319 --> 01:38:37,479
infrared your your power line yeah and

2782
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:39,960
see it all just glowing and oh this

2783
01:38:37,479 --> 01:38:42,238
guy's pulling you know how many amps you

2784
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:44,000
know then you would see like the the you

2785
01:38:42,238 --> 01:38:45,519
know or in places where it was cold and

2786
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:47,760
there was that one room in the corner

2787
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:49,400
where the snow didn't stick right you

2788
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:53,800
know because you had a you know 90

2789
01:38:49,399 --> 01:38:55,439
degree grow room right there so yeah so

2790
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:57,079
again just you know do it for yourself

2791
01:38:55,439 --> 01:39:01,439
do it for the passion Do It For the Love

2792
01:38:57,079 --> 01:39:03,559
of the plant uh it is uh probably one of

2793
01:39:01,439 --> 01:39:05,799
the more funner Hobbies yeah if you

2794

2799
01:39:16,118 --> 01:39:20,519
when you grow your own it's always good

2800
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:21,880
like you always think it's I feel like

sharing and there's something special if

2805
01:39:29,279 --> 01:39:34,920
you're a hom grower that gets to either

2806

grow from seed or grow from clone you

2807
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:39,800
get to experience that plant for three

2808
01:39:38,599 --> 01:39:42,960
weeks of

2809
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:44,840
edge 63 days of flour whatever it is

2810
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:46,800
maybe it's 54 maybe it's 70 days of

2811
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:48,639
flour right then you got to dry it and

2812
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:50,279
cure it there's all these little things

2813
01:39:48,639 --> 01:39:52,440
that you can screw up and then to get

01:40:51,359 --> 01:40:54,839
getting free vegetables you know and

2849
01:40:53,079 --> 01:40:57,238
then yeah and then you know always had

2850
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:59,760
my full terms and then have my indoors

2851
01:40:57,238 --> 01:41:02,519
and and yeah it was it was it was a

2852
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:05,480
lifestyle you know rarely does

2853
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:07,080
one's occupation become who they are but

2854
01:41:05,479 --> 01:41:11,238
I always tell people like no this is who

2855
01:41:07,079 --> 01:41:13,238
I am yeah it's become who I am you know

2856
01:41:11,238 --> 01:41:15,000
well and the plant's given you a lot you

2857
01:41:13,238 --> 01:41:17,118
know you've given a lot to the plant

2858
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:19,238
plants it's a symbiotic relationship

2859
01:41:17,118 --> 01:41:21,960
right so on on some level it's like what

2860
01:41:19,238 --> 01:41:23,479
you put in is what you get out and

2861
01:41:21,960 --> 01:41:26,800
you're an example of somebody that's put

2862
01:41:23,479 --> 01:41:28,879
in a lifetime dedicated to the plant and

2863
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:31,840
the plant's given back to you on many

2864
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:34,239
levels and many you know it's it's

2865
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:36,440
provided me a book worthy you know book

2866
01:41:34,238 --> 01:41:37,759
worthy lifestyle you know people always

2867
01:41:36,439 --> 01:41:39,759
say I should you know write a book about

2868
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:41,560
all this stuff and you probably should I

2869
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:43,159
don't want to you know I get that I get

2870
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:44,520
that a lot I get a lot though you know

2871
01:41:43,158 --> 01:41:46,118
there's part of me as like yeah yeah

2872
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:47,679
that'd be pretty cool and then I'm like

2873
01:41:46,118 --> 01:41:49,479
yeah there's some stories in

2874
01:41:47,679 --> 01:41:50,760
there yeah well that's why these

2875
01:41:49,479 --> 01:41:53,198
podcasts are great because we get the

2876
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:55,520
oral history of cannabis and we get you

2877
01:41:53,198 --> 01:41:57,719
you know before history was told by the

2878
01:41:55,520 --> 01:42:00,119
perspective of one person or a handful

2879
01:41:57,719 --> 01:42:03,480
of people and now with things like

2880
01:42:00,118 --> 01:42:07,359
podcasts and YouTube and Instagram we

2881
01:42:03,479 --> 01:42:08,718
can get a real Vivid picture yeah of the

2882
01:42:07,359 --> 01:42:10,399
reality of the situation because you're

2883
01:42:08,719 --> 01:42:13,158
not just taking one person's perspective

2884
01:42:10,399 --> 01:42:15,039
you're taking 200 people from now yeah

2885
01:42:13,158 --> 01:42:17,559
and to be part of that because I think

2886
01:42:15,039 --> 01:42:19,000
we're all part of this bigger thing and

2887
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:20,679
that's the be especially with cannabis

2888
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:22,359
is like I did my thing in cannabis

2889
01:42:20,679 --> 01:42:24,000
you've done your thing and I've done

2890
01:42:22,359 --> 01:42:26,359
things outside of can I've done things

2891
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:28,800
with food and with other things and it's

2892
01:42:26,359 --> 01:42:31,198
all part of this network of amazing

2893
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:34,239
things that happened to make the world

2894
01:42:31,198 --> 01:42:36,439
like it is right now yeah yeah I agree

2895
01:42:34,238 --> 01:42:39,759
yeah super fortunate super lucky to be

2896
01:42:36,439 --> 01:42:41,638
in uh to be you know again like you know

2897
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:43,440
the things that I did back then didn't

2898
01:42:41,639 --> 01:42:44,880
you know I didn't think like you know 25

2899
01:42:43,439 --> 01:42:46,559
years from now this is going to this is

2900
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:48,719
going to be like a story people are

2901
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:51,520
going to want to hear about right you

2902
01:42:48,719 --> 01:42:52,639
know and I mean to be honest I was super

2903
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:55,080
reluctant you know people have been

2904
01:42:52,639 --> 01:42:56,800
pushing me to do just this very thing

2905
01:42:55,079 --> 01:42:58,079
that we're doing right now for a long

2906
01:42:56,800 --> 01:42:59,719
time you need to get out there and you

2907
01:42:58,079 --> 01:43:01,519
need to tell this story you know we all

2908
01:42:59,719 --> 01:43:03,279
know the story we all know you we've all

2909
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:05,199
heard these stories from you for years

2910
01:43:03,279 --> 01:43:07,439
now right the rest of the community

2911
01:43:05,198 --> 01:43:09,559
doesn't know it and I part of me was

2912
01:43:07,439 --> 01:43:11,158
just like I don't really care yeah you

2913
01:43:09,560 --> 01:43:13,119
know let this story be where it is you

2914
01:43:11,158 --> 01:43:15,238
know and as a matter of fact you know it

2915
01:43:13,118 --> 01:43:16,799
kind of feels like you know Al Bundy

2916
01:43:15,238 --> 01:43:18,718
living His Glory Days as a football

2917
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:21,279
player yeah you know it's like yeah I

2918
01:43:18,719 --> 01:43:22,880
did the GDP thing back then but that's

2919
01:43:21,279 --> 01:43:25,238
all done that's all gone it's all part

2920
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:27,480
of my pass now and and now it comes up

2921
01:43:25,238 --> 01:43:29,039
you know here it is legalization and all

2922

of a sudden everyone's talking about it

2923
01:43:29,039 --> 01:43:33,279
again and all these stories and the

2924
01:43:30,319 --> 01:43:34,559
origin histories of stuff and I was like

2925
01:43:33,279 --> 01:43:36,118
okay I guess I need to get out there and

2926
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:38,360
tell the story you know I went on that

2927
01:43:36,118 --> 01:43:40,479
one podcast like a year ago yeah you

2928
01:43:38,359 --> 01:43:42,198

get some push back you know there's

2938
01:43:58,520 --> 01:44:01,760
going to be some people who you know

2939
01:44:00,198 --> 01:44:03,158
yeah yeah whatever always push back yeah

2940
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:05,039
there's always push back someone's got a

2941
01:44:03,158 --> 01:44:08,039
story and it's like you know okay cool

2942
01:44:05,039 --> 01:44:09,439
if if if you've got a GDP story a

2943
01:44:08,039 --> 01:44:11,599
granddaddy purple story that predates

2944
01:44:09,439 --> 01:44:13,158
999 let's hear it yeah you know let's

2945
01:44:11,599 --> 01:44:15,880
hear it because then maybe you have me

2946
01:44:13,158 --> 01:44:18,439
predated but I'm telling you you know I

2947
01:44:15,880 --> 01:44:21,079
was in the Oaker Dam scene yeah you from

2948
01:44:18,439 --> 01:44:23,319
the beginning there was no GDP there was

2949
01:44:21,079 --> 01:44:25,158
no Granddaddy Purple at that time you

2950
01:44:23,319 --> 01:44:26,719
know until the third floor named it and

2951
01:44:25,158 --> 01:44:29,279
then you know a few years later Ken

2952
01:44:26,719 --> 01:44:31,198
released his seeds yeah you know and and

2953
01:44:29,279 --> 01:44:32,840
Ken got the credit for it and at the

2954
01:44:31,198 --> 01:44:35,279
time like I didn't even realize that

2955
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:36,480
there was you know you know credit you

2956
01:44:35,279 --> 01:44:38,000
know like he was getting credit for this

2957
01:44:36,479 --> 01:44:40,238
because I wasn't on the forums I wasn't

2958
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:43,039
keeping up with stuff I didn't

2959
01:44:40,238 --> 01:44:45,198
really we can call his Ken's GDP and

2960
01:44:43,039 --> 01:44:46,840
it's whatever yeah it's like he's got

2961
01:44:45,198 --> 01:44:48,678
his thing and that's fine you know and I

2962
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:50,760
mean the one thing is he did you know he

2963
01:44:48,679 --> 01:44:52,880
called it granddaddy perp yeah you know

2964
01:44:50,760 --> 01:44:55,239
and it was Granddaddy Purple so there is

2965
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:57,039
that subtle difference which is I don't

2966
01:44:55,238 --> 01:44:58,678
know you know back then he used to put

2967
01:44:57,039 --> 01:45:01,840
on the strains on there he would tell

2968
01:44:58,679 --> 01:45:04,118
you what he used to make that those

2969
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:05,960
seeds right and none of them were were

2970
01:45:04,118 --> 01:45:08,679
were Granddaddy Purple he never got a

2971
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:10,319
cut because I never put it out and

2972
01:45:08,679 --> 01:45:12,319
unless you knew who it came from up

2973
01:45:10,319 --> 01:45:14,639
North you weren't going to get it either

2974
01:45:12,319 --> 01:45:16,719
yeah you know some people say you know

2975
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:18,560
that was probably purple urle it was

2976
01:45:16,719 --> 01:45:20,560
just the way that I grew it but I've

2977
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:23,840
grown URL and I've smoked URL I'm like

2978
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:26,960
it's it's not it's me I have access to

2979
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:28,800
urle now too and I like and I could do I

2980
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:31,399
I could tell you that I think they're

2981
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:34,159
maybe related sure I think that urle

2982
01:45:31,399 --> 01:45:36,638
might be the parent it's possible or or

2983
01:45:34,158 --> 01:45:38,879
the lineage is the same from the same

2984
01:45:36,639 --> 01:45:41,000
region of wherever it came it came down

2985
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:44,719
right through some urle you know or or

2986
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:47,039
urle and GDP at one point yeah have

2987
01:45:44,719 --> 01:45:49,760
similar genetics but you know especially

2988
01:45:47,039 --> 01:45:52,118
if you look it compared to the purple

2989
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:53,599
kushes that I've seen and you know all

2990
01:45:52,118 --> 01:45:55,559
the other purple things that I've seen

2991
01:45:53,599 --> 01:45:58,199
over the years mhm those are the two

2992
01:45:55,560 --> 01:46:00,760
that are kind of closely y closely

2993
01:45:58,198 --> 01:46:02,799
resemble each other in some ways yeah U

2994
01:46:00,760 --> 01:46:04,400
but yeah flavor off though flavor off

2995
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:06,599
look Lavender is completely different

2996
01:46:04,399 --> 01:46:08,960
yeah and urle is very soft it's a very

2997
01:46:06,599 --> 01:46:11,639
soft it's a very it's more subtle

2998
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:14,359
whereas GDP is like turps yeah it's like

2999
01:46:11,639 --> 01:46:17,199
orle on steroids anything yeah oh I know

3000
01:46:14,359 --> 01:46:19,519
I miss it I didn't you know know back

3001
01:46:17,198 --> 01:46:21,759
then that I should hold on to this cut

3002
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:24,760
yeah you know it just it it faded again

3003
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:26,679
you know when that OG came around even I

3004
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:29,079

green oh wow and I said something like

3011
01:46:42,118 --> 01:46:47,519
real GDP is purple and that kind of

3012
01:46:44,479 --> 01:46:49,118
fired up some people you know and I I

3013
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:50,400
actually apologized cuz he was trying to

3014
01:46:49,118 --> 01:46:52,399
sell these you know he was trying to

3015
01:46:50,399 --> 01:46:53,479
sell these seeds oh yeah and here I was

3016
01:46:52,399 --> 01:46:56,679
you know kind

3017
01:46:53,479 --> 01:46:59,158
blasting him you know finished green I

3018
01:46:56,679 --> 01:47:02,199
mean I saw the Clones yeah but was were

3019
01:46:59,158 --> 01:47:05,039
your clones purple no no it was green

3020
01:47:02,198 --> 01:47:06,799
right and then it started getting purple

3021
01:47:05,039 --> 01:47:08,359
halfway through yeah halfway through and

3022
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:10,560
then we get that deep set about the

3023
01:47:08,359 --> 01:47:13,279
sixth week right and it would go dark

3024
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:15,360
dark go dark dark midnight just so dark

3025
01:47:13,279 --> 01:47:17,279
yeah yeah so you know and I wrote him

3026
01:47:15,359 --> 01:47:18,960
and I apologized you know hey I'm sorry

3027
01:47:17,279 --> 01:47:21,319
I you know shouldn't have you know I

3028
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:23,439
should have privately written you and

3029
01:47:21,319 --> 01:47:25,639
expressed yeah this opin

3030
01:47:23,439 --> 01:47:29,039
and I think at the time you know he

3031
01:47:25,639 --> 01:47:31,400
didn't uh maybe I don't think he knew

3032
01:47:29,039 --> 01:47:33,880
about the GDP story with me yeah so I

3033
01:47:31,399 --> 01:47:35,839
was just some Rando online which you

3034
01:47:33,880 --> 01:47:38,520
know I would be like whatever pal to

3035
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:40,159
yeah you know so I mean if he does again

3036
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:42,440
I mean I haven't seen it I haven't

3037
01:47:40,158 --> 01:47:44,399
smoked it I haven't smelted it right um

3038
01:47:42,439 --> 01:47:46,158
the closest that that that I came to

3039
01:47:44,399 --> 01:47:48,118
though was just with Dy and breed seeds

3040
01:47:46,158 --> 01:47:51,158
with Brandon that one time it was one

3041
01:47:48,118 --> 01:47:52,960
bag one time he showed it to me and uh I

3042
01:47:51,158 --> 01:47:54,359
think I might have some photos so I have

3043
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:55,840
to give you some I'll I'll dig out some

3044
01:47:54,359 --> 01:47:58,639
photos I definitely have photos of the

3045
01:47:55,840 --> 01:48:02,239
bud and I probably have some photos of

3046
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:04,118
the plants okay so I grew God's gift for

3047
01:48:02,238 --> 01:48:06,118
a while that's a good one too oh it was

3048
01:48:04,118 --> 01:48:07,799
good yeah it was so good and it had the

3049
01:48:06,118 --> 01:48:10,158
it had the taste it had the structure

3050
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:11,840
but it had that little gas note to it

3051
01:48:10,158 --> 01:48:13,719
still had a deep purple cuz we had that

3052
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:15,360
cut in Santa Cruz mountains you know for

3053
01:48:13,719 --> 01:48:16,920
for a while there it was floating around

3054
01:48:15,359 --> 01:48:19,399
I think it was

3055
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:22,399
um geez I want to say

3056
01:48:19,399 --> 01:48:24,559
Ricky Ricky out in the home um out in

3057
01:48:22,399 --> 01:48:26,960
Santa Cruz County I forgot the name of

3058
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:28,520
his uh his little his little company but

3059
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:31,319
uh some people like to give him credit

3060
01:48:28,520 --> 01:48:32,840
for that God's Gift nice yeah so yeah I

3061
01:48:31,319 --> 01:48:35,198
don't know if God's gift is Canadian or

3062
01:48:32,840 --> 01:48:36,719
if it's from I've heard different things

3063
01:48:35,198 --> 01:48:38,279
yeah love to get those guys on the show

3064
01:48:36,719 --> 01:48:40,000
and I love well that's the same with

3065
01:48:38,279 --> 01:48:41,279
this you know the Santa Cruz Blue Dream

3066
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,359
you know a lot of people in Santa Cruz

3067
01:48:41,279 --> 01:48:45,599
like yeah it's actually

3068
01:48:42,359 --> 01:48:47,158
Davenport yeah or Grass Valley or well

3069
01:48:45,599 --> 01:48:48,760
there's the Grass Valley meno and I

3070
01:48:47,158 --> 01:48:50,638
think there's different cuts I think

3071
01:48:48,760 --> 01:48:54,639
yeah the thing is is with blue dream if

3072
01:48:50,639 --> 01:48:56,920
you make s1's of it the s1's are I think

3073
01:48:54,639 --> 01:48:58,440
it's one of the most stable stable

3074
01:48:56,920 --> 01:49:00,118
crosses that's ever been made is Blue

3075
01:48:58,439 --> 01:49:03,279
Dream because you take it and there's

3076
01:49:00,118 --> 01:49:04,920
only four different phenotypes typically

3077
01:49:03,279 --> 01:49:06,599
you get one that's dead on Blue Dream

3078
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:08,158
right right so like you can make seeds

3079
01:49:06,599 --> 01:49:10,360
you can get a dead on Blue Dream seed

3080
01:49:08,158 --> 01:49:12,079
from the Blue Dream you get one that has

3081
01:49:10,359 --> 01:49:15,079
the structure one that has the smell and

3082
01:49:12,079 --> 01:49:17,479
then one that has all of it and then one

3083
01:49:15,079 --> 01:49:19,559
that's not really very good okay but but

3084
01:49:17,479 --> 01:49:21,359
still with that I mean you can see how

3085
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:23,000
the s1's could be slightly different but

3086
01:49:21,359 --> 01:49:25,479
it definitely resembles and definitely

3087
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:28,238
is Blue Dream on some level yeah yeah I

3088
01:49:25,479 --> 01:49:30,039
think uh Santa Cruz goat farm Pac-Man

3089
01:49:28,238 --> 01:49:31,799
out there I know he definitely reversed

3090
01:49:30,039 --> 01:49:33,479
the arcade of train wreck yeah who I

3091
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:35,320
talked about earlier I think he might

3092
01:49:33,479 --> 01:49:36,678
have even reversed the uh the Santa Cruz

3093
01:49:35,319 --> 01:49:38,920
blue dream I believe it was the hay

3094
01:49:36,679 --> 01:49:40,719
brothers that created Santa Cruz Blue

3095
01:49:38,920 --> 01:49:43,599
Dream oh really and the hay brothers and

3096
01:49:40,719 --> 01:49:47,679
they created Green Crack okay all right

3097
01:49:43,599 --> 01:49:51,360
the real deal wow Green Crack is that

3098
01:49:47,679 --> 01:49:54,319
any is that relation to Big s Big Sir

3099
01:49:51,359 --> 01:49:56,759
holy I don't think so I think I like the

3100
01:49:54,319 --> 01:49:58,679
big so that Mojave Richmond is the one

3101
01:49:56,760 --> 01:50:00,960
who introduced me to Big Sir Ole Bud

3102
01:49:58,679 --> 01:50:03,079
okay and that is amazing okay that's

3103
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:05,560
very hazy that's like a haze ha like

3104
01:50:03,079 --> 01:50:08,679
when I think of haze okay yeah only butt

3105
01:50:05,560 --> 01:50:11,199
is it was papaya my bad yeah was papaya

3106
01:50:08,679 --> 01:50:12,639
Green Crack there's some relationship

3107
01:50:11,198 --> 01:50:14,399
there is okay yeah I thought there was a

3108
01:50:12,639 --> 01:50:16,719
little blurred line there with those two

3109
01:50:14,399 --> 01:50:18,799
as well Green Crack is the one that the

3110
01:50:16,719 --> 01:50:20,920
high just goes away real quick like

3111
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:22,719
super fast right when you I mean it's on

3112
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:25,480
set really fast but you build it

3113
01:50:22,719 --> 01:50:27,439
tolerance to it real quick fast then you

3114
01:50:25,479 --> 01:50:29,118
don't get high from it right like to

3115
01:50:27,439 --> 01:50:30,879
where like it's like pretend to guy like

3116
01:50:29,118 --> 01:50:32,000
I could smoke huge joints and it doesn't

3117
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:35,199
