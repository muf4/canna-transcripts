Dave Perkins from butero we met at re on

10
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,399
the river how you doing today I'm doing

11
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,719
pretty good thanks for having me on I

12
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:01,120
appreciate it absolutely so when we

13
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:04,680
first met you came up to me and you said

14
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:06,200
tell me the truth you don't have to lie

15
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,560
just tell me tell me what you think of

16
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,159
this and I'm like what is this guy

17
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,240
talking about and you bust out a bag of

18
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,680
Sour Diesel and you said if it's not the

19
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,280
real Sour Diesel it's no big deal just

20
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,960
tell me your opinion and right when you

21
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,640
said that I was kind of like who is this

22
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,759
guy I've never met him before in my life

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,400
but he's saying something interesting

24
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:26,159
because usually people give me bags of

25
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,280
sour they're like dude this is the real

26
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,680
Sour and it's usually this gassy version

27
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,399
of sour diesel that's not what I

28
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,240
remember as Sour Diesel it looks like

29
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:37,879
sour diesel maybe it smells a little bit

30
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:40,359
like it but it's a much gassier version

31
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:44,158
and then when I cracked your butt

32
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:45,920
open it made me think that there's only

33
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,479
one type of sour that I ever remember

34
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,879
and that's it the one that you have is

35
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:53,478
the sour we it was only called sour when

36
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,078
I first started smoking it and you came

37
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:57,799
to me with his bud and I'm like it

38
00:01:55,078 --> 00:02:01,438
brought back all these memories from you

39
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:04,560
know the last 25 years of Sour Diesel

40
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:06,438
and it it's the one it's undoubtedly the

41
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,640
real one I've showed it to so many

42
00:02:06,438 --> 00:02:11,840
different people smoke some with Jason

43
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,759
Pinsky I smoked Nick all these guys have

44
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,239
also verified and are all excited about

45
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:18,239
the sour so thank you very much oh I'm

46
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm glad I'm glad you enjoyed it you

47
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,000
know something that I I knew was special

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,959
when I got it and I knew I had to do

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,360
whatever it took to keep it for as long

50
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:31,719
as I felt necessary yeah when you've had

51
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:34,560
the cut for a long time yeah 20

52
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:38,239
three I got it for the first time wow I

53
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:41,158
believe yeah 2003 um and yeah I got it

54
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,759
from this guy in in the bay and I had

55
00:02:41,158 --> 00:02:46,759
been buying sour I bought it for the

56
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:48,479
first time in 1999 out in Kirkwood um

57
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:49,719
out in Animal House if you know Kirkwood

58
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:51,759
you know the Animal House the employee

59
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:53,680
housing I was like damn this stuff is

60
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:55,560
you know it's pretty good yeah uh fast

61
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,519
forward a few years later was able to

62
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,878
like still get it and this guy one time

63
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,280
I was at his house he was just like hey

64
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,359
you want to you want to cut you want a

65
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,120
clone and I was like sure what is it

66
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,640
he's like it's the sour and I was like

67
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,480
yeah I'll definitely take it he reached

68
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:09,798
into his closet where there was no grow

69
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:11,399
light of any sort and there was just a

70
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:14,719
plant in a red K cup and he's like here

71
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,920
you go here's the sour wow so I took it

72
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:19,359
home and here we are yeah and the sour

73
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:21,598
is really special and I feel like my

74
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,640
opinion of it is that it's a chem 91 bag

75
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,119
seed there's all kinds of different

76
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:26,719
opinions out there I mean I've done as

77
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,599
much research as I could and it's led me

78
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:30,080
to believe that not just from the

79
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:32,399
stories from other people but but the

80
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,239
way it grows and all these other

81
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,239
phenotypes that are very similar that

82
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,560
actually test genetically different uh

83
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:41,640
that lean heavy on the chem that are

84
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:45,640
they remind me more of the chem from

85
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:47,559
chem 91 or that chem D than sour but it

86
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:49,119
has the same structure right and so

87
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:53,039
these are all derivatives of each other

88
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:56,039
but I feel like that sour is got its own

89
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:57,878
thing and you know I've seen so many

90
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:01,359
different things that that people say

91
00:03:57,878 --> 00:04:03,239
are sour or cuts that I've seen in the

92
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,040
last like especially the last 10 years

93
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:07,920
that's it's like okay it's sour and then

94
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,639
it's not sour um and I think you also

95
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,318
mentioned something about probably the

96
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:13,679
way it's grown can definitely make it

97
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:16,680
express differently and I think there's

98
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,600
a lot of Truth to that I 100% think that

99
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,199
and I think that about about all herb

100
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,680
you know my father-in-law won a cup um

101
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,840
with a variety called the Cherry slider

102
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,240
and it was like a grow off but it was

103
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:27,239
back in the early 2000s everybody got

104
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,160
the same cut and then when they got

105
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,000
together to kind of like show his was

106
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,320
totally different than everybody and

107
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,959
people are like why is yours so

108
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:36,319
different and he won that year with that

109
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:38,680
cherry slider um and so they're like you

110
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:42,319
know what's the deal what's the deal um

111
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:44,720
in growing environment the person um you

112
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:46,719
know time of year type of grow I think

113
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,880
these are all things that go into it

114
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,240
yeah the Cure I know for sure is

115
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:53,478
probably the biggest part I I think more

116
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,840
so than the way it's grown or who grows

117
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:57,879
it because I've had sour that you know

118
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:00,239
is like right where it needs to be and

119
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:01,639
then it can quickly disappear if you

120
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,360
don't store it in the right conditions

121
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:06,600
or if you don't seal it up at the right

122
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,479
time um so I think that as much of it

123
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,879
has to go with the Cure yeah as it does

124
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:14,758
like this cut of the sour but I've also

125
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:16,800
had people grow like Hermes seed or like

126
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:18,600
self seed from one of my friend's sour

127
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,160
batches right it was a room full of sour

128
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,360
nothing else in there and they came back

129
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,360
and they're like it's just not the same

130
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,840
sour um and I've been you know pretty

131
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,800
transparent with people about like how I

132
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:28,159
grow it what what I've used to grow I've

133
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,840
grown with a bunch of different

134
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,560
nutrients a bunch of different ways and

135
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,519
comes out different in every way yeah

136
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,519
you know some people say oh the sour

137
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:38,519
that I've seen is loose and Airy um the

138
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:40,439
real Sour is loose and Airy and I'm like

139
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:42,758
well I've grown loose and ay sour and

140
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:45,399
I've also grown like really tight sour

141
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:47,960
outside and I've grown it inside yeah um

142
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:49,120
so it's like a you know every plant is

143
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:50,279
different depending on who you give it

144
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,959
to and how they treat it so I think

145
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:55,399
there's a lot of variation within that

146
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:57,478
and then a lot of people striving to say

147
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:59,120
like I got the sour and I've had it for

148
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:01,599
a long time so I've never really felt

149
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,199
that need for validation mhm um I think

150
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,000
is what it is well and I have a cut

151
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,439
called the weasel Diesel and that is

152
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,240
supposedly sour and it is a sour but

153
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:13,038
it's not the sour that I remember from

154
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,280
back in the day and there was also an

155
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:17,519
AJ's cut that we got probably like 2005

156
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:19,198
or 2006 that was more lemon and this is

157
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,758
before I knew AJ and knew the whole

158
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,598
story and so I feel like a lot of these

159
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,479
things are probably bag seeds

160
00:06:23,598 --> 00:06:27,240
potentially but what you're saying about

161
00:06:25,478 --> 00:06:28,879
drying and curing I know for a fact

162
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,478
because I used to grow sour and I

163
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:32,399
remember there was one time where I

164
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:34,079
yielded way more than I thought I was

165
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,399
going to yield and I didn't have the

166
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:39,079
capacity to really dry it all properly

167
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:41,079
and I dried it too fast and then I tried

168
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:43,439
to rehydrate it a little bit and I

169
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:44,918
killed the smell completely and so it

170
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:46,959
looked like sour it looked like the most

171
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:48,478
amazing sour but then you'd have to

172
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:50,680
really squeeze it to get in there to get

173
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,318
the nose and then the smoke just didn't

174
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,240
translate because sour you should be

175
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,479
able to take a joint and smoke it all

176
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,759
the way down to the roach and it should

177
00:06:56,478 --> 00:06:59,359
taste like sour you should be able to

178
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,840
put it out five times you light it back

179
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,879
up and it still tastes like come back

180
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:03,279
the next day and it still tastes like

181
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,840
sour come back a week later and you

182
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:07,000
could tell that roach was a sour diesel

183
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:08,159
roach and that's you know that there's

184
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,680
only a handful of things I've

185
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,879
experienced in my whole life that are

186
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,240
capable of doing that that's one cat

187
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:14,919
piss is another one I mean there's a

188
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,680
handful of good herb that'll do that but

189
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:19,680
it's it's just compared to everything on

190
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,519
the market you don't get that across the

191
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,959
board and it's a pronounced flavor in

192
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:25,279
the roach you're not just like oh it's

193
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:27,198
kind of like it tastes like the first

194
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:28,839
hit oh yeah and your room smells like

195
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,038
sour people walk into your room and they

196
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:32,758
know that it's sour if you've been

197
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:35,560
smoking sour uh yeah it's just something

198
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:37,759
extremely special so thank you very much

199
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,478
for that yeah of course you're not

200
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,319
linear in the sense that you're just

201
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:43,800
about Sour you have so many different

202
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:45,520
things you gave me some Bubba that was

203
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:49,360
really nostalgic as well which I haven't

204
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:52,279
seen real good bubba a lot in the last

205
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:56,960
10 15 years it was huge in the late 90s

206
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:59,158
early 2000s and then the market like the

207
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:01,839
traditional Market in the Bay Area they

208
00:07:59,158 --> 00:08:04,519
had a pheno that was like a 53 day feno

209
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:06,318
and they probably Harvest on day 47 and

210
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:08,758
they were just rocking it and turning it

211
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,240
and it it was reminiscent of Bubba it

212
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:13,919
smoked okay but it wasn't like the

213
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,158
pre-98 I guess pre-98 Bubba we just call

214
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:18,158
it Bubba Kush back in the day but then

215
00:08:15,158 --> 00:08:21,918
they came out with the pre98 or the name

216
00:08:18,158 --> 00:08:24,399
pre98 so yeah tell us about the Bubba so

217
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:27,000
this is uh it's a Bubba cush cross with

218
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:30,839
original Haze so the Bubba Kush is from

219
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:35,599
Caleb at CSI humble yeah he did a 100

220
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:39,120
plant feno hunt S1 with his pre98 Bubba

221
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,080
yeah and so he grew those out took a few

222
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,639
of those fenos a few of the winners over

223
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:46,399
to my father-in-law's house Tony aka

224
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:48,480
budo yeah um and they went through them

225
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,559
and so my father inlaw Tony he picked

226
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,759
out the number seven yeah and so the

227
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:56,039
number seven turned slightly purple it

228
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:59,159
had more of like an OG cush kind of

229
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:01,000
smell and flavor to it yeah um and so

230
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:02,480
out of all of the fenos that they had he

231
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,679
was like the number seven's the one and

232
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,920
he named that the bomb threat Bubba so

233
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:07,958
if you ever hear of the bomb threat

234
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:09,679
Bubba or number seven that's what this

235
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:11,919
is crossed with the original haze from

236
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:14,519
Sam the skunkman ni it comes kind of via

237
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:16,519
some guys in Germany that got the

238
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:19,200
original haze from Sam the skunkman and

239
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:23,759
then did reproductions of that right um

240
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:26,800
and so they use that um the pollen from

241
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:28,240
that original Haze nice to create this

242
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:30,799
um and it's great because it's very

243
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,440
reminiscent of the Bubba Kush but from a

244
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:36,919
cultivator standpoint it grows really

245
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,760
fast and you get a a really good yield

246
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:41,479
so it's kind of like Bubba cush on

247
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:43,240
steroids and so you know being able to

248
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:47,959
offer something that you usually has a

249
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:49,680
slower or uh a lower yield and a slower

250
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:51,119
veg process you know I mean you can put

251
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,559
in a foot tall plant and end up with

252
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,480
like a three foot four tall plant wow

253
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:56,879
and and get a decent yield on it yeah

254
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,639
because Bubba is a little bit slower to

255
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:01,399
veg it's not the biggest yield it's like

256
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:04,199
a medium yield and it has this amazing

257
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:06,078
soap character and I love the the flower

258
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,040
that you gave me has that little bit of

259
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:09,599
soapiness to it okay and I really like

260
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:11,919
the gas with the soapiness I think

261
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,879
that's what makes it special but I also

262
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:16,159
love Haze and I love you know the land

263
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:17,838
race varieties that you're working with

264
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:20,799
because you seem to have a good

265
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,800
collection of land race and pearls and I

266
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:26,120
think reintroducing pearls to the world

267
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:27,958
that that may be your purpose for being

268
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,360
here on this planet I don't know but

269
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:31,518
like I feel like that's extremely

270
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,399
special I feel like I'm definitely here

271
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,159
to grow the sacred herb you know I I

272
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:37,360
view it as a sacred plant like we all

273
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:40,159
got to be able to survive and do this we

274
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:43,440
can't lose money to do it right um but I

275
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:46,480
I still 100% believe that you

276
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,880
can survive and treat a plant as a

277
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,720
sacred plant right um yeah and the

278
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:53,720
pearls are a great example of something

279
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,278
that checks none of the boxes except for

280
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:59,320
the effect right it wins in the effect

281
00:10:56,278 --> 00:11:02,159
category um you know so it's a it's a

282
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:04,800
Colombian Mexican tie and my

283
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:07,120
father-in-law got the seeds it's from uh

284
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:09,240
Charlie Garcia canab Biogen it's a

285
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,320
destroyer and so he popped the seeds I

286
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:15,039
think he got one of them that spit out

287
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:16,278
pearls and so he finished it which you

288
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:17,599
know he could have gone two different

289
00:11:16,278 --> 00:11:19,159
directions he could have said oh there's

290
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,040
nothing on this plant it's not going to

291
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:23,719
yield anything I'm just going to toss it

292
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:25,399
and that would have been that on to the

293
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,759
next thing but instead he was like you

294
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:29,639
know what he's been growing for 56 years

295
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:31,639
he's got a lot of wisdom when it comes

296
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:34,600
to watching plants grow he's not just a

297
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:37,079
weed wizard yeah he's got um you know

298
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,680
knowledge um and an understanding of

299
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:41,078
plants from the whole entire world the

300
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:42,638
whole entire plant kingdom Ian he used

301
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:46,399
to travel all around the world to get

302
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:48,560
seeds of rare Palms bring them back home

303
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,200
um he's got like a a tropical Palm

304
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:51,719
Plantation at his house up in Humble you

305
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,000
know he's got all these varieties of

306
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:57,079
plants from all over the world wow and

307
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,679
so when he stumbled across the pearls

308
00:11:57,078 --> 00:12:00,958
you know he let it do its thing 16 weeks

309
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:03,719
finished it and he smoked and he was

310
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:06,599
like man this is this is what I've been

311
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,879
searching for after 56 years of smoking

312
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:12,720
you know he still smokes every day lots

313
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:14,879
of joints um he still really loves herb

314
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,680
and he's like this is what the tie stick

315
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:19,120
made me feel like the first time I I

316
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:22,559
found TI stick and so for him it's this

317
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,480
like lifelong quest of smoking herb and

318
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,799
being quas satisfied you know he went

319
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,639
through the whole like OG craze the cham

320
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:31,078
craze the sour he's grown it all and

321
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:32,039
when he found the pearls he was like

322
00:12:31,078 --> 00:12:34,078
this is it this is what I've been

323
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:36,198
looking for my whole entire life this is

324
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:38,399
all that I want to smoke right and so

325
00:12:36,198 --> 00:12:40,399
now he's got I think six or six or seven

326
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:44,120
different fenos of the pearls that he's

327
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:46,360
found um and it's pretty much all he

328
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,679
wants to smoke yeah and so it's just

329
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,839
interesting to me that he could have

330
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:52,638
thrown it away and we would have not

331
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,399
ended up with the pearls but he has the

332
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,320
wisdom in foresight to know that just

333
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,198
because a plant looks like crap doesn't

334
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,278
mean that it's not going to have this

335
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:04,519
amazing effect that now a lot of people

336
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:06,600
are starting to see and recognize and

337
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:08,159
really really like I mean you know I

338
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,440
think a lot of people that we surround

339
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:10,360
oursel with a lot of people you've had

340
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,959
on your

341
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,759
podcast and myself included up until

342
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,439
about a year and a half two years ago

343
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:19,198
had not felt an effect or had an

344
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,240
experience like this from any other

345
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:23,198
cannabis flow yeah um it's just it's

346
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,879
different you know I was smoking some at

347
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:27,278
the hall of flowers last week with uh

348
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:30,000
Dan Herer Jack harr's son and he was

349
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:32,078
blown away he took one hit and was just

350
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,559
like I feel he basically like I feel so

351
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:35,319
good I just want to stop right here and

352
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:38,078
enjoy it yeah and for me too I took that

353
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,278
one hit and I was just like I want to

354
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:41,159
just I just want to hang out right here

355
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:42,639
and be this high and be high like this

356
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:44,198
because it it feels great you know it's

357
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,079
something you don't want to get rid of

358
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:47,599
yeah well and it's so hard to classify

359
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:50,319
when you start talking you know they

360
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,680
want to classify indicia and sativa and

361
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,839
and you know Broad Leaf versus narrow

362
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:58,319
leaf and for effect and I feel like it's

363
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,800
somewhere in the middle and there's a

364
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,480
handful of things that I feel like are

365
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:03,639
just their own thing right it's really

366
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:07,278
hard to classify that I mean you could

367
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:09,079
say equatorial maybe in structure but

368
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:11,759
then effect is just its own thing and

369
00:14:09,078 --> 00:14:14,159
you gave me some last time we were

370
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:16,639
together I think at canif Fest the

371
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:18,000
African Haze 11 the African Haze 11 yeah

372
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,079
yeah the interesting thing about the

373
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,159
Indica sativa you know wide Leaf narrow

374
00:14:21,078 --> 00:14:25,958
Leaf is you know you could have

375
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:29,198
something that has maybe more of a

376
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:31,119
sativa high but has a broad leaf um You

377
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:33,758
Know Jack her is a good example really

378
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,879
quick flowering time it's like a 56 day

379
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:38,600
you know we'll finish in September in

380
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:39,879
mesino yeah but it has skinny leaves so

381
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,560
a lot of people say oh it's got skinny

382
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:45,078
leaves it's a sativa right but the

383
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:47,479
length of flowering and the effect are

384
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:48,599
things that we have to consider and so

385
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,240
I've been learning a lot from my

386
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,000
father-in-law about just plants in

387
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,720
general you know um you know we don't

388
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,919
want to box ourselves in and and say

389
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,240
this is this because it's like is it

390
00:14:56,919 --> 00:15:02,838
really you know the flowering time the

391
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,000
amount of days it takes to flower seems

392
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:07,079
for us in my experience to correlate to

393
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
the type of high that you get with it

394
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:12,758
right so when you're on the 45 50 day

395
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,480
Spectrum you get this very sedative

396
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:18,039
feeling and when you hit the 100 100

397
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,920
plus 120 it seems to move towards this

398
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:23,198
like euphoric

399
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:25,399
soaring uplifting type of high right and

400
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:27,758
so we can call it whatever we want but

401
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:29,919
the effect is really what is the measure

402
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:32,639
of how high we get and the type of high

403
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:36,479
that we have and for me the longer

404
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:38,039
flowering the more uplifting the the um

405
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,720
the highs and the shorter flowering is

406
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:44,719
that more sedative and so I I feel like

407
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:47,480
that's a a a better place to start yeah

408
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:51,120
than wide leaf or narrow leaf or you

409
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:55,240
know or I I totally agree you know and

410
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:59,480
my friend Dave passed on 420 and so he

411
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:02,318
redirected my focus back into effect

412
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,039
and I feel like meeting you and then I

413
00:16:02,318 --> 00:16:05,838
have a collection this big collection of

414
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:07,439
land R seeds from my buddy fritzy who's

415
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,480
been all over India in fact he's there

416
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,839
right now and so he's collecting all

417
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:14,800
kinds of stuff from India and so with

418
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:16,440
the access to the genetics that I have

419
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:19,159
it's like the possibilities are really

420
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,839
they start becoming endless um where

421
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:22,958
it's like I mean it just takes so much

422
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,839
time a lot of people don't understand

423
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:28,278
the amount of time it takes to go

424
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:29,839
exploring for new things and then for me

425
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:31,958
part of what I need to do is I need to

426
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,120
make it appealing to I mean there's

427
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:35,838
there's stuff that I can have that's

428
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,240
completely just for me but then as far

429
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,480
as a seed company I have to make it

430
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,639
appealing to other people so I feel like

431
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,159
maybe my job is to figure out how to

432
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:46,519
cross it with modern genetics to where

433
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:48,838
we can sneak it into people's minds

434
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:51,639
where they're like oh maybe it doesn't

435
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:53,519
have to be purple candy gas or maybe it

436
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:55,519
doesn't have to be this and maybe I can

437
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,078
just smoke it for the effect you know or

438
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,198
maybe we can find some happy place in

439
00:16:57,078 --> 00:17:01,120
the Middle where they can get a little

440
00:16:58,198 --> 00:17:03,240
bit of both to where it spawns their

441
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,558
curiosity to where they're like well if

442
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,679
this is good maybe I should try this you

443
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:08,279
know CU I always walk around with the

444
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:09,439
super silver haze late lately the last

445
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:11,519
year it's always been the super silver

446
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,079
haze I I try to share it with people

447
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:15,119
especially the people that are like oh I

448
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:16,879
don't like Haze it's like smoke this and

449
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,719
tell me you think it tastes great you

450
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,360
smoke it down and it has a great effect

451
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:24,439
it's organic living soil my buddy Chris

452
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:26,078
he grows it flora and Flame and that's

453
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:27,439
extremely special to me and then with

454
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,438
your stuff it's like I'm able to give

455
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,000
that to the same kind of people

456
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:32,558
especially my friends who who trust me a

457
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,599
lot I'm like okay well I just rolled

458
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:37,399
this let's smoke it and getting getting

459
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:40,399
their opinion so I feel like it's almost

460
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:43,120
our duty as as stewards to this plant to

461
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,160
be able to be the ones to have the

462
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:46,759
foresight to be able to reintroduce this

463
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,798
stuff to people that have never

464
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:49,720
experienced it because there's a lot of

465
00:17:47,798 --> 00:17:51,759
people that love weed and they they

466
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,038
think they love this one thing because

467
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:55,400
that's what they've experienced but they

468
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:57,038
haven't really got to experience the

469
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,038
whole world of what's available with

470
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:00,158
cannabis and it's like if if you've

471
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:01,679
never been to Europe you don't know if

472
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:03,440
you're going to like it or not it's the

473
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,880
same thing with flour it's like until

474
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,679
you've actually tried it and you smoked

475
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,559
these things and maybe white Thorn Rose

476
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,200
is the the one for you you know I feel

477
00:18:09,558 --> 00:18:13,240
that's extremely special and maybe

478
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,679
that's the one for you but maybe you

479
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,400
smoke one of these new varieties not

480
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,038
even new but these land race varieties

481
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,759
have been out forever but new to you and

482
00:18:20,038 --> 00:18:24,400
that's what you can attach yourself with

483
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:27,158
is I want to feel like this yeah and I

484
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,759
mean I I'll pull out some of the pearls

485
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:31,880
um and this you know this is new to me

486
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:33,558
this is this is also new to my

487
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:36,400
father-in-law who's the one that is

488
00:18:33,558 --> 00:18:38,440
responsible for these being in this box

489
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,519
you know and he's he's been growing and

490
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:44,279
smoking for a really long time and uh so

491
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:46,639
I think the fact that there's things

492
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:48,759
that we may call new but that have

493
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,320
actually been around for centuries is

494
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:54,000
amazing because we're still kind

495
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:55,960
of discovering things about the plant

496
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,240
whether it be medicinal properties you

497
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,440
know the different compounds in it but I

498
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,960
think for

499
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,360
you know for a a he in his mid 70s for a

500
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,640
75-year-old man that's been growing his

501
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:10,199
whole life to come across this and then

502
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:13,000
be like this is the one yeah you know he

503
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:16,000
like you also has a lot of credibility

504
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,480
respect in the online community um a lot

505
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,880
of the younger humble Growers uh that

506
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,480
were kind of in our circle of friends

507
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:25,080
would go to him for for herb because he

508
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,720
had he had the high grade and they were

509
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:27,879
growing a lot of outdoor you know so

510
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,519
they would go to them for their head

511
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,080
stash at the end of the year here and so

512
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:32,599
they would trust him okay yeah Tony

513
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:34,079
knows what he's talking about cuz he's

514
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:35,918
been growing longer than like most

515
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:37,279
people that we know and smoking and and

516
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,799
still is really passionate about it so

517
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:42,720
the fact that he's like hey this is it

518
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:45,038
to a youngster like me is like man I

519
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,360
need to pay attention to this and now I

520
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:49,440
feel like we're in a in a time where

521
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:53,359
people are open

522
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,880
because they it's magical people are

523
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,359
curious there's a lot of new smokers

524
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,799
there's a lot of people that have never

525
00:19:56,359 --> 00:20:01,719
tried a vape pen or an edible and even

526
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:04,000
those things can be new to people when

527
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,798
for other people like oh this like it's

528
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,400
nothing new this has been around forever

529
00:20:05,798 --> 00:20:08,960
but so it's always going to be something

530
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,960
new even to some of the experienced

531
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,200
smokers out there so I think something

532
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,558
like this you know when you when you

533
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,880
pull it out I think a lot of our viewers

534
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:21,599
probably don't even know what pearls are

535
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:24,120
and you know so this is the number one

536
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:25,558
so we so this is number one we have uh

537
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:28,319
seven six or seven different fenos

538
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:31,759
there's a one or the one the two and

539
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:35,079
then the a b c and d yeah and the a is

540
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:36,919
the one um that's like the in pearls you

541
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:39,000
would classif like Dr grin spoon would

542
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:42,600
be you get pearls from Dr grin spoon

543
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:46,440
anything that creates a a single Brack

544
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:48,480
bud is a pearl right not necessarily I

545
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,679
think it's a I think it's a trait that

546
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,720
exists within cannabis there's another

547
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:54,600
uh there's somebody else on Instagram

548
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,679
that's one of I think maybe one other

549
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:59,918
person I've seen with pearls and they

550
00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:02,360
have pearls from the Destroyer oh and so

551
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,159
I think it's a he was referring to like

552
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:06,399
a single braat or it was like a certain

553
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:09,640
type of plant that actually spits out

554
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,960
this type of kaix or brat yeah so it's

555
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:15,400
not just the Pearl plants um but these

556
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,000
ones in particular there's been some uh

557
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,519
some plants that have selfed and have

558
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,200
we've got some seeds out of them when

559
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:22,200
those get planted they also turn out

560
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,798
like pearls so we've got some W hawen

561
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,120
pearls that we're working on right now

562
00:21:23,798 --> 00:21:28,679
yeah it's a strain from Waka that spits

563
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:32,079
out these single kix's it's definitely

564
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:34,120
different um and and so far it's it's

565
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:36,439
one of the few varieties out there that

566
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:38,839
is uh putting out pearls we used to get

567
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,720
the grin spoon in Amsterdam and that was

568
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:43,519
what it the grin spoon from Amsterdam

569
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,240
was this most it's some of the strongest

570
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:49,158
flour and it's very

571
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:50,599
reminiscent of Green Spoon so I asked my

572
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:52,000
I asked my father law the other day

573
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:54,798
because every single person says

574
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,200
greenspoon I mean even DNA genetics uh

575
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:59,278
commented on DNA is the one who gave me

576
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:03,038
a bag of grin spoon when we in Amsterdam

577
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:04,919
in 2012 Dawn from DNA was like you ever

578
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:06,480
smoke grin spoon I'm like no he's like

579
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:08,520
here you go somebody gave me some grin

580
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,679
spoon okay he's like it's super strong

581
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:12,319
be careful and I was like whatever you

582
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:15,919
know I'm like I've been smoking Haze and

583
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:17,278
it was so strong that uh you know it

584
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,600
makes it would give me heart

585
00:22:17,278 --> 00:22:22,798
palpitations yeah I I get that all the

586
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:24,119
time I mean I'm I'm at a point where I

587
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:26,319
don't say I'm not going to say I like

588
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:29,519
heart palpitations but I like i' I've

589
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:32,200
learned to deal with the raciness of the

590
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:33,839
highs right um you're going to hear me

591
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,000
talk a lot about my father-in-law Tony

592
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:36,519
because he's the one that really has

593
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,960
turned me on to all this and has really

594
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:39,599
dropped a lot of knowledge and game on

595
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,400
me and it's like there's these hoops of

596
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:43,879
fire right you got to get through them

597
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:46,120
whether it's 120 days of flowering or

598
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,799
it's a low yield or someone going that

599
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:50,079
looks like crap why would I ever want to

600
00:22:47,798 --> 00:22:51,679
smoke that you know and it's the same

601
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:53,119
with the racy high like once you get

602
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,519
comfortable with that and you know what

603
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:57,439
going to happen you can be a little more

604
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:59,440
okay with how high you're going to get

605
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,558
yeah but you also take it easy and not

606
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,278
smoke quite as much in the beginning and

607
00:23:01,558 --> 00:23:05,079
then as you you know I feel like

608
00:23:03,278 --> 00:23:07,119
everybody has different tolerances right

609
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:09,079
and so maybe you don't need 10 hits

610
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:10,199
maybe you only need three you know

611
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:11,839
that's one of the things that I really

612
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:15,159
like about the pearls is you don't need

613
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:17,319
a big fatty you know um it's really

614
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:20,880
shifted a lot of these sativas these

615
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:23,119
long flowering varieties have shifted my

616
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,960
perception or my expectation that like

617
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:27,239
you have to have you have to smoke a lot

618
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,798
of weed to get high yeah and sure there

619
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,640
are some I mean I you know people give

620
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:32,400
me weeds some of the more like shorter

621
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,640
flowering varieties don't get me high as

622
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,120
much or they get me high in a different

623
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:37,679
way for a very short amount of time yeah

624
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:40,158
these varieties you know they get you

625
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,480
high for a really long time and and

626
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,720
something interesting about the Green

627
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,759
Spoon and I'm and I'm trying to get Tony

628
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,480
my father-in-law to kind of to get

629
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:48,759
online and clear this up because I was

630
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,599

try and say it in like a in an authentic

644
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:23,079
like kind of uh true way is that that Dr

645
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:26,360
greenspoon

646
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:28,960
was something that somebody else

647
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:31,599
purchased from somebody yeah

648
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,558
they took that and then called it the

649
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:36,119
greenspoon so it wasn't like this the Dr

650
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:38,038
greenspoon that everybody knows is Dr

651
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:41,038
greenspoon was something before that

652
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:43,640
sure it for sure was named it after Dr

653
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:46,278
Lester greenspoon right but so so Dr

654
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,679
greenspoon for most everybody is is this

655
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:49,839
one specific thing but it was actually a

656
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,080
strain that was made by someone else

657
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:52,599
that they saw and they're like oh we

658
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:55,720
want to buy the seeds to this and then

659
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:58,519
they gave it the name right this has no

660
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:01,000
genetic resemblance to that it's its own

661
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:04,038
thing sure I mean I've seen LR stuff

662
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,759
that that that bust out pearls that I've

663
00:25:04,038 --> 00:25:07,240
popped before yeah I saw somebody

664
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:09,440
recently they're like oh it's not rare

665
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:12,480
if you grow out fields of thae and it's

666
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,120
like okay yeah it it might not be rare

667
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,679
if you grow out fields of thae but who's

668
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:19,038
growing out fields of tie right like

669
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:20,798
there's nobody else has this really so

670
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:22,599
it's rare even if somebody else is like

671
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:24,839
oh I got a lot of that it's like for you

672
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:26,398
the sour like the sour is gone it's rare

673
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:28,119
well I've had it the whole entire time

674
00:25:26,398 --> 00:25:29,038
it's never been rare for me so it's all

675
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:31,798
this

676
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:34,640
perception of who you've met what your

677
00:25:31,798 --> 00:25:36,720
experience is like I got a buddy and you

678
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,399
know you say oh I got some good weed

679
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,240
well I got a buddy he was at like the

680
00:25:38,398 --> 00:25:41,839
top tier of that I got some good weed

681
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,159
level you know I knew when he said he

682
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:45,079
had good weed it was going to be better

683
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:47,960
than everybody else's because his

684
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:49,278
experience with good weed was elevated

685
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:52,399
from that of everybody else so it was

686
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:54,480
like he had uh an experience that was

687
00:25:52,398 --> 00:25:57,000
that of above maybe say even me and then

688
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,759
my father-in-law is quite a few notches

689
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,038
above where I am with that it's like you

690
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:01,599
want to know what good weed is ask

691
00:26:00,038 --> 00:26:03,158
somebody that's been smoking for 60

692
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:05,599
years for sure anybody that's been

693
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:07,000
smoking for an extended amount of time

694
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:09,199
they'll have their opinion on what's

695
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,079
good and what's not good for sure and

696
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,558
and that just comes with experience you

697
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:15,599
know he he has no interest in seeing any

698
00:26:13,558 --> 00:26:17,918
of this sold he stands to make no money

699
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:19,398
off of it yeah it's just what he likes

700
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,840
and it's you know he's like I said he's

701
00:26:19,398 --> 00:26:23,839
smoked a lot of other stuff in his life

702
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:25,439
um and this is what works for him you

703
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:26,678
know some people might like blue dream

704
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,038
and that's their favorite that's a great

705
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:28,919
strain I mean that I think that's one of

706
00:26:28,038 --> 00:26:32,278
the

707
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:34,799
gonna go down as like the most overhyped

708
00:26:32,278 --> 00:26:37,278
yet most underrated hybrids of all time

709
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:39,240
yeah it is I think it's the best hybrid

710
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:40,960
of all time I mean you take an Inda and

711
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,440
a sativa for back of lack of better

712
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,240
terms and created something that just

713
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:47,080
had this crazy Vigor that went wild

714
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,359
outside and you could throw it up

715
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:51,798
outside and get huge numbers you know

716
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:53,439
with a great smell right um that's what

717
00:26:51,798 --> 00:26:56,079
I really like about this bubak cush

718
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,399
original Haze is it's a great hybrid I

719
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:59,439
mean it's like right down the middle

720
00:26:57,398 --> 00:27:02,158
it's got great back AG appeal it's got

721
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:04,240
more of the original Haze high but it's

722
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,640
got the flavor and the look of the Bubba

723
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,558
I mean it looks you know some of looks

724
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,159
like

725
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:13,879
indoor for a haze of that plant is

726
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:17,360
amazing and I think Blue Dream yeah as

727
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:20,080
far as like checking the boxes as from a

728
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:21,918
Grower's perspective it's absolutely

729
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:24,079
amazing the Vigor of it is amazing it

730
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:26,640
has that hybrid Vigor That You Don't See

731
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:29,119
in a lot of plants and uh it doesn't get

732
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,240
enough credit it gets a lot of hate

733
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:34,079
um but I think that's because Justin

734
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:35,880
Bieber said he liked Blue Dream well

735
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:37,359
because because everybody in their mom

736
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,960
was growing it outside and it's just

737
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:40,319
like everything you too many people

738
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,278
start to do it and you get too many

739
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:44,398
watered down versions of it and then you

740
00:27:42,278 --> 00:27:47,079
get people it's too easy to grow good

741
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:50,398
right Sour Diesel everybody was growing

742
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:51,759
sour at a point in in somoma and meno

743
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:53,918
and there was some people in humbled as

744
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:55,000
well but they tried to blow that out a

745
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,440
little bit but there wasn't a lot of

746
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,679
good sour on the market because it's not

747
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,640
easy to grow yeah and we growing

748
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:02,480
inferior cuts too I believe that's part

749
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,720
of it yeah I mean I got mine pretty

750
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,399
early on and I got it from the guys that

751
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,519
came out from the East Coast with it

752
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:10,599
yeah so it wasn't like I got a cut off

753
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:12,558
of a mom off of a cut off of a mom off

754
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:14,038
of a back seat off of a cut of a mom

755
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:16,240
yeah maybe that who knows maybe that's

756
00:28:14,038 --> 00:28:19,119
where my cut came from but as far as I

757
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,480
know that was just like the cut from the

758
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:22,398
guys that brought the cut out it wasn't

759
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,839
a bag seed and they were growing it in

760
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:27,678
1999 in honeydew yeah and I remember the

761
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:30,319
first time I saw that I saw the perss

762
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:32,759
and the sour both for the first time in

763
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:36,158
the same week wow and I was showing it

764
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:37,919
to people and uh I showed this you saw

765
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:42,320
the perss is in the meno perss or is in

766
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:44,919
the GDP maybe it was 1999 cuz before the

767
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:46,398
GDP was called GDP it was called the

768
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:48,600
perss

769
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:50,558
or I can't remember the other name for

770
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:52,719
it but the pers it was the pers it was

771
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:55,200
just the perss you know uh soon after it

772
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,079
turned into like the GDP and all this

773
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,278
other stuff I mean it was coming from

774
00:28:57,079 --> 00:29:01,918
Humble to Tahoe straight As the pers it

775
00:29:00,278 --> 00:29:04,519
was like nothing else any of us had ever

776
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,960
seen and so I got to see both of those

777
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:07,839
for the first time in the same week it's

778
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,278
kind of crazy and I show I was like I

779
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:10,678
was like hey check out this pers I just

780
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:11,839
got and my buddy was like yo screw that

781
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:13,519
where's that stuff from last week you

782
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:15,599
know because we were I got weed every

783
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:18,159
Sunday that just how my program was and

784
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:19,879
I was like what I got the pers like you

785
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,159
know and now looking back on it I'm like

786
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:23,278
damn I had two of like the most

787
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:25,399
legendary strains in my hands in the

788
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:28,519
same week and the sour kind of went to

789
00:29:25,398 --> 00:29:31,678
the Wayside until aoup couple years

790
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:33,480
later I started seeing it again from uh

791
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,278
my buddy introduced me to his guy and so

792
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,960
I you know got to go a little bit more

793
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:38,558
direct that was in SF I think this was

794
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,240
probably around the same time a lot of

795
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:43,119
people were getting hip to the sour I

796
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:46,319
started seeing it 99 2000 2001 was

797
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:47,759
buying it um and then you know ended up

798
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:50,038
getting my hands on it those were good

799
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:51,679
years for sour and the price point was

800
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:54,480
expensive back I mean flour was just

801
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:57,600
expensive in general but sour was the

802
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,640
Exotic of its day and it wasn't it

803
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:01,639
wasn't super accessible for really good

804
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:03,440
sour anywhere these guys would only let

805
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,880
me buy an ounce at a time you know it's

806
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,798
like for all those people out there that

807
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,760
are like you know just be thankful that

808
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:10,960
you have access to this stuff now it's

809
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:13,519
like you know you would get one ounce

810
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,399
one it came around yeah 400 500 bucks

811
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:17,000
maybe 600 bucks I mean it was what

812
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:19,439
somebody wanted for it and I've even

813
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,759
still people to this day like oh if you

814
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,360
got sour I'll pay you like name your

815
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:25,960
price you know yeah um it just commanded

816
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:27,759
that it was such a different high back

817
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,880
then yeah and I feel like that's maybe

818
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:32,119
why gravitating towards these pearls and

819
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:34,640
some of these other flavors now is the

820
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:36,759
high is different than than everything

821
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,640
else out there you know I find myself

822
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:41,278
not getting as confused anymore smoking

823
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:43,399
like you know these pearls they're just

824
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:45,759
like laser sharp you know really gives

825
00:30:43,398 --> 00:30:48,158
you a Clarity like if you're a um if

826
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:51,519
you're a computer programmer or you're

827
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:54,640
an athlete yeah I mean one day they will

828
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:56,960
consider certain types of herb a uh

829
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,120
performance enhancing drug for sure I

830
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,759
mean it's it's a fact you look I mean

831
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:02,038
you look at the Diaz brothers the reason

832
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:04,000
they're such good Fighters I mean they

833
00:31:02,038 --> 00:31:05,960
smoke I mean I would I would say that

834
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,519
there's that contributing factor it's

835
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:10,480
not the only thing but it's able they're

836
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:12,440
able to smoke and train and to be

837
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,240
hyperfocused when they train and I feel

838
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:17,360
like you look at a lot of these

839
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:20,798
Jiu-Jitsu guys too and these guys smoke

840
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:24,119
heavy but yeah performance enhancing for

841
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:26,638
sure I uh I like smoking and doing stuff

842
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:29,199
even cardio it makes cardio better dude

843
00:31:26,638 --> 00:31:30,719
the African Haze 11 yeah I mean me and

844
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,038

846
00:31:32,038 --> 00:31:38,440
routine and uh it's it's great for for

847
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:40,398
athletics you know for creativity um I

848
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,720
mean it's got me I think you you know

849
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:42,759
we've we've hung out a couple times now

850
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,960
and I feel like people when they hang

851
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:46,440
out with me they're like kind of look at

852
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:48,159
me like what's up with this guy he seems

853
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,600
pretty enthusiastic or pretty excited

854
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,720
about a weed industry that is like seems

855
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:54,839
like it's just dwindling yeah and I hope

856
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,519
that these types of flowers get out to

857
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:59,798
people they can have the experience and

858
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:01,200
then can have that kind of passion kind

859
00:31:59,798 --> 00:32:03,319
of put back into their life because

860
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,519
whether you're like a seasoned smoker a

861
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:07,599
grower a hustler like something that

862
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,960
makes you feel good and just kind of

863
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:10,638
like brightens up your day like my buddy

864
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,960
Danny from GW he's just like dude every

865
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:14,000
time I smoke the pearls it like

866
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:15,759
instantly within five seconds just makes

867
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
things brighter you know I haven't done

868
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:20,038
a lot of psychedelics or really any ever

869
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,278
and I imagine that these pearls are kind

870
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:24,440
of like at the bottom end of like the

871
00:32:22,278 --> 00:32:25,960
Psychedelic threshold yeah where it's

872
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:29,600
not quite there but there's these

873
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:32,360
elements to it mhm that that I can

874
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:34,719
see could be similar sometimes all it

875
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:37,839
takes to get someone passionate again is

876
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:40,120
to remind them why they love the plant

877
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:42,558
so much and if you can show them a

878
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:44,319
different side of it man it's it's it's

879
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:47,440
it's special and to be able to be that

880
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:49,200
person for me it's I feel like I've been

a client who maybe has a civil dispute

899
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,720
say you're a cultivator and you have an

900
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,559
investor you had an agreement a contract

901

00:33:47,798 --> 00:33:50,359
to put up the money so they can get

909

their equipment so they get their plants

910
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:52,719
in the ground so get their clones at the

911

00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:10,079
pictures you know photos videos and give

918
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:11,918
my opinion about what I think about the

919
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:13,760
situation you get called to the stand

920

we're interested in hiring you I'm like

923
00:34:17,878 --> 00:34:21,279
cool we do the deal they send me court

924
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:23,398
documents they send me paperwork I

925
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:26,040
review them I write a

926
00:34:23,398 --> 00:34:28,239
report then most of the time I get

927
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:31,279
deposed so the opposing counc gets to

928
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:33,559
sit me down uh I found out recently for

929
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:36,079
up to8 hours in one day so I just a

930
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:37,599
couple weeks ago was deposed for almost

931
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,560
eight hours and it's basically a lawyer

932
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:41,760
getting to ask you questions about the

933
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:44,480
report that you wrote I know a lot about

934
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,320
depositions yeah it's rough it can be

935
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,878
rough it you know I mean I feel like

936
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,599
you're basically being interrogated for

937
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:53,598
eight hours especially by the opposing

938
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:55,679
side um trying to poke holes in in you

939
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,240
and everything else yeah and they'll

940
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,119
poke holes in every like this guy

941
00:34:57,239 --> 00:35:01,719
recently he pulled up everything I've

942
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,760
ever said anywhere you could actually

943
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:07,039
find it you know and I was not ready for

944
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:09,280
it um so you have to be able

945
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:12,559
to um

946
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:15,040
respond accurately quickly correctly I

947
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:17,440
kind of like lawyers I feel are kind of

948
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:19,759
like uh freestyle rappers yeah you you

949
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,079
have a situation where you have an

950
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,520
outcome maybe you're doing a rap battle

951
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:23,880
and someone's discs you and you're like

952
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:25,358
oh I got to come back at them same thing

953
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,079
with the lawyer like the lawyer made a

954
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:28,759
point now I've got to come back and make

955
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:30,359
my point so you have to be able to

956
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,839
quickly analyze what somebody said and

957
00:35:30,358 --> 00:35:33,719
then to say something back fact the

958
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:35,639
better the lawyers the better the battle

959
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:37,799
you know like some of these lawyers you

960
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:39,519
know it's it's it's pretty wild so my

965
00:35:46,358 --> 00:35:49,960
Conrad for most of her criminal cases

966
00:35:48,838 --> 00:35:51,679
because same thing happens for a

967
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:55,440
criminal case except for it's against

968
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:57,399
the cops right um and so Chris bless his

969
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,679
heart has been just kind of like passing

970
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,000
cas on to me um you know I don't know

971
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:02,838
he's done hundreds and hundreds and

972
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,440
hundreds of cases and so I'm kind of

973
00:36:02,838 --> 00:36:07,000
following his footsteps a little bit you

974
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:10,358
know he was a big proponent of prop 215

975
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,079
really involved with Oaker Dam and and

976
00:36:10,358 --> 00:36:14,559
kind of pioneering a lot of their

977
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,800
curriculum and from a legal standpoint

978
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:18,880
and so I kind of fell into the whole

979
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:21,000
expert witness thing through my wife and

980
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,318
him um and you know I started getting a

981
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,318
couple referrals I had an oaksterdam

982
00:36:22,318 --> 00:36:25,800
student that took uh one of my classes

983
00:36:24,318 --> 00:36:27,960
that referred me to a law firm that he

984
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:30,039
got a job with yeah um so that's been

985
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:33,800
great um so it's you know it's kind of

986
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:35,318
my other thing that I've gone into I you

987
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,599
know for five years was trying to figure

988
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:39,000
out what am I going to do as a

989
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,720
cultivator that now doesn't have a grow

990
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,719
space right like I had my own grow out

991
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:44,639
in Yuba

992
00:36:41,719 --> 00:36:46,679
County not friendly to cannabis Growers

993
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:48,279
whatsoever um you know they they raid

994
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:51,039
every neighborhood about every 10 years

995
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,839
and so I was there on the 10th year they

996
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:55,440
didn't hit me CU when they did the fly

997
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:56,719
over I was in between plantings so they

998
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,159
didn't see me plant so they didn't stop

999
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:59,519
at my place and I was like after they

1000
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:02,318
raided the whole neighborhood I was like

1001
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:04,599
I'm out I'm done um I was already living

1002
00:37:02,318 --> 00:37:06,639
in Washington working for a company up

1003
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:08,920
there managing a fairly decent sized

1004
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:11,078
indoor at the time and then I came back

1005
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:13,119
started working for other people and um

1006
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:16,760
you know just like you trying to find my

1007
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:18,079
kind of my place in the industry and um

1008
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,800
you know I kind of just fell into this

1009
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:22,200
expert witness thing I kind of just fell

1010
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:24,200
into these hazes my father-in-law has

1011
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:26,399
been doing this his whole life when I

1012
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:27,519
first met him 12 years ago and I started

1013
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,240

her whole life yeah and after that week

1041
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,400
I was just like damn there's something

1042
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:30,519
different to this week

1043
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,720
and I had just come off of a light Depot

1044
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:34,400
out in Grass Valley and I was like yo I

1045
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:36,039
want to put these hazes these sativas in

1046
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,318
a light Depot that's the only re the

1047
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:41,199
only way I thought it could be done yeah

1048
00:38:38,318 --> 00:38:43,759
he's now doing it indoors growing I mean

1049
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:46,199
he's got hazes that have gone 22 weeks

1050
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,520
inside that's amazing he's growing these

1051
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:50,519
pearls inside um it's just something new

1052
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:53,239
it's something different you know yeah

1053
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:55,280
it's exciting I mean grin spoon the grin

1054
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:57,639
spoon used to stretch out so much they

1055
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,160
I've I've seen it stapled to the wall

1056
00:38:57,639 --> 00:39:00,799
where they've they've actually stapled

1057
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:02,598
it to the wall because it stretches so

1058
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,519
much yeah I thought about growing it

1059
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:06,318
like a like a vine on a vine like you

1060
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:08,000
know just two branches going opposite

1061
00:39:06,318 --> 00:39:10,639
directions because I've got 20 in a

1062
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,679
greenhouse right now and they hit the

1063
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:14,318
10- foot Mark you know a month ago they

1064
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:16,118
just they're weird because they they

1065
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:17,719
start to weep down at a certain point

1066
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:20,599
almost like a weeping willow so they go

1067
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:22,399
up and then they start to go down and I

1068
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:24,680
mean it's the biggest mess ever like

1069
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,838
they just kind of grow into each other

1070
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:28,879
harvesting them handling I mean you saw

1071
00:39:26,838 --> 00:39:32,960
like just pulling out this bag is just

1072
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:34,599
messy not a big yield but I love it I'm

1073
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,599
I'm stoked that I got onto it yeah I

1074
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:37,559
love unique things so as far as the Big

1075
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:40,280
Sir

1076
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:44,318
holy uh my friend Mojave Richmond used

1077
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:47,160
to GI me Big Sir holy flower along with

1078
00:39:44,318 --> 00:39:49,000
sage flower and I believe the Big Sir

1079
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:53,559
holy was one of the page uh parents of

1080
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:58,119
the sage that he created and my thoughts

1081
00:39:53,559 --> 00:40:01,358
were always that it was either sister to

1082
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:03,000
like the original Haze or something very

1083
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:05,639
very close because I feel like the

1084
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,480
effect the structure all the things the

1085
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:09,519
boxes that it checked were the same

1086
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:11,920
boxes as the original Haze that I've

1087
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:13,559
seen But the funny thing about you know

1088
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,920
I'm teaching cul ofar selection at oer

1089
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:17,960
Dam actually in October and part of that

1090
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:21,119
class is like just because you were

1091
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:23,358
given something that's called this does

1092
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:25,000
not mean that it's this I deal with that

1093
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:26,318
in my court cases they're like you know

1094
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,838
cuz they're trying to discredit me in

1095
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:29,440
every single way they can so have you

1096
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:32,039
ever grown this strain I'm like no do

1097
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,760
you have a genetic stamp for it no then

1098
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:35,639
it's not you can't prove to me that it's

1099
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,119
that strain so you can't discredit me

1100
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:39,838
from saying that I haven't grown The

1101
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:41,119
Strain and therefore I don't know

1102
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:42,440
anything about these genetics you're

1103
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,000
talking about and then like I shouldn't

1104
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,318
be able to test it's like that's not how

1105
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,000
it works so I find myself a lot of times

1106
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:50,920
explaining to these lawyers like stop

1107
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,119
you don't have any proof of what you're

1108
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:55,240
talking about most people don't and so

1109
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:58,280
yeah it's like it's hard to tell but as

1110
00:40:55,239 --> 00:41:00,318
cultivators we our our noses as Growers

1111
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:02,000
I think there's something with us

1112
00:41:00,318 --> 00:41:03,279
Growers we have that like memory that

1113
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,760
it's just like boom you could smell

1114
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,640
something one time and smell it 20 years

1115
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:09,240
later like the sour and you're like boom

1116
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:11,039
that's it you know unmistakably it like

1117
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:12,598
yeah I mean no doubt in my mind and I've

1118
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:14,880
smelled like cat piss if you showed me

1119
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:17,760
the real catpiss and I was able to

1120
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:20,079
actually smoke it I could tell you 100%

1121
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,760
with the first hit if it's catpiss or

1122
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:25,240
yeah and I love catpiss that's that's my

1123
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,440
desert island if I could smoke anything

1124
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:28,439
the rest of my life it would be the

1125
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:30,760
catpiss and it's interesting because

1126
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:32,639
I've shown the pearls to a few people

1127
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:34,760
yeah and they're like oh this you know

1128
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:37,559
it's some of it's got a terpinolene

1129
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:39,119
dominant kind of like nose to it um some

1130
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:41,400
of it smells like a Christmas tree some

1131
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:45,760
of it smells like seven up I've gotten

1132
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:47,480
OG Kush notes out of it um once one time

1133
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,520
and my father-in-law also got that out

1134
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:52,119
of it you know yeah um but like some of

1135
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:53,920
this is a little bit older um that's the

1136
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:55,440
great thing about hazes is they store

1137
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,079
really well yeah you know I mean I've

1138
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,639
got some like year old IND Bubba cush

1139
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:01,240
original Haze that still looks and

1140
00:41:59,639 --> 00:42:03,639
smokes great it's so funny because I

1141
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:06,159
feel like limenine and tpine are the two

1142
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:08,480
dominant tpes in Haze but then you look

1143
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:12,559
at Jack herrer which is super high in

1144
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:15,358
lanine and the Jack herrer I've seen it

1145
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:17,599
has the the least amount of shelf life

1146
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:21,239
of all the flower that I've basically

1147
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:22,680
tried to age and cure and so some stuff

1148
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:23,919
and a lot of these new varieties they

1149
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:26,279
they just don't have a lot of shelf life

1150
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:28,200
to them you know it's like they harvest

1151
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:30,079
they Peak and unless you're keeping them

1152
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:33,159
in optimal conditions it just starts

1153
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:36,200
declining within probably two weeks of

1154
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:38,279
the time where it's it's perfectly cured

1155
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:39,919
and some of these other some varieties

1156
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,960
I've been able to keep perfect for four

1157
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,559
months you know so it's just so so

1158
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,760
strain dependent as well and it's

1159
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:46,319
interesting too because we talk about

1160
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:48,680
the sour and how it can be finicky I

1161
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:52,079
remember when I first started growing it

1162
00:42:48,679 --> 00:42:54,199
I was growing it inside and I would keep

1163
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:55,440
a quarter pound of every Harvest so

1164
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:58,879
every two months I had a new quarter

1165
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:01,200
pound and so I had four JS in my closet

1166
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,960
had a two a four a 6mon and an 8mon and

1167
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:05,639
I just referred to them as the four

1168
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:07,159
month the six Monon when the 8 month hit

1169
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:09,719
the eighth month it was better than the

1170
00:43:07,159 --> 00:43:12,920
two four and the six that's awesome and

1171
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:16,039
it was as good or better than it was

1172
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:18,039
when I first harvested yeah and so I've

1173
00:43:16,039 --> 00:43:20,318
heard some people talk recently about

1174
00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:23,920
like uh you know the shelf life maybe it

1175
00:43:20,318 --> 00:43:25,440
has something to do with the inputs that

1176
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,599
it was grown with I believe there's

1177
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:30,440
absolute truth to that and so I think

1178
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:33,160
maybe you know um a lot of people

1179
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:35,240
weren't necessarily growing the sour cuz

1180
00:43:33,159 --> 00:43:36,838
they wanted that dank sour I knew guys

1181
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:38,919
that grew hundreds of pounds of sour

1182
00:43:36,838 --> 00:43:40,880
because they wanted to make money yeah

1183
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:43,200
and their sour was money sour it wasn't

1184
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:45,599
like love sour you know it wasn't grown

1185
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:48,000
by someone that like wanted some dank

1186
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:50,000
sour to smoke they wanted some Sour to

1187
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,239
sell that's always the best when you got

1188
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,920
the guy who well I feel like there's

1189
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:55,598
some guys that just they don't smoke and

1190
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,760
they grow and that's it's a money thing

1191
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:59,200
and then there's guys my friend Josh

1192
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:02,640
freem used to grow the Sour Diesel and

1193
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:04,439
his Sour Diesel was that kind where it

1194
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:06,960
just stayed on your palette it was the

1195
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:09,039
perfect he was up in cazadero and it was

1196
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,599
outdoor and it was you know there's a

1197
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:14,000
banana belt up there and when you grow

1198
00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:15,960
the sour in Cass I feel like the sour

1199
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,519
from Cass is the best I've seen in my

1200
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:20,159
life and it was like sticky in the bag

1201
00:44:18,519 --> 00:44:23,039
you'd open it and it' punch you in the

1202
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:26,239
face and every time he used to grow it

1203
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:28,239
it was like just amazing and but he was

1204
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:29,399
a sour smoke he's a sour smoker now in

1205
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:31,399
fact I was telling him about the sour

1206
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,838
he's like man I need to get some Sour

1207
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:35,838
let's just split some so he's one of

1208
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:37,920
those guys he just loves the sour and

1209
00:44:35,838 --> 00:44:40,239
every batch he used to grow it was all

1210
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:42,119
all passion you know and people it you

1211
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:44,838
put your energy into that plant and then

1212
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:47,160
that plant gives you back what you put

1213
00:44:44,838 --> 00:44:49,239
into it and these guys that aren't

1214
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:50,519
smokers a lot of times it's like maybe

1215
00:44:49,239 --> 00:44:52,118
these guys are good at growing at scale

1216
00:44:50,519 --> 00:44:53,519
and they can produce good stuff but

1217
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:55,440
there's something special about the

1218
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:57,480
passionate guys that just love it and

1219
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,358
they are smoking their own product yeah

1220
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:02,559
I mean these guys they weren't even

1221
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:05,159
smokers they would you know they use

1222
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:06,559
grow more you know I mean I think we all

1223
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:08,799
at some point of used things that have

1224
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:10,720
monop potassium phosphate in them right

1225
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,200
um you know I'm I will definitely not

1226
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:15,239
pretend like I'll be the first to admit

1227
00:45:12,199 --> 00:45:18,000
that I have um but that was like all

1228
00:45:15,239 --> 00:45:20,000
that they grew with you know um you know

1229
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,639
a lot of organic guys you know maybe

1230
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,280
some syn you know kind of the guys that

1231
00:45:21,639 --> 00:45:25,318
do the blend maybe you do like a a

1232
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,720
booster mid round and then you know you

1233
00:45:25,318 --> 00:45:29,920
finish up with some organic stuff but

1234
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:32,318
when you're doing just hard cams you

1235
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:35,159
know it it seems to like my buddy he was

1236
00:45:32,318 --> 00:45:37,039
growing Hydro I was growing in soil we

1237
00:45:35,159 --> 00:45:38,598
were both growing sour I was using

1238
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:41,239
botanic air he was using Advanced

1239
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:42,640
Nutrients yeah and the soil beds came

1240
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:44,479
out better you know and that's what he

1241
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:45,799
used to say that's not my opinion he

1242
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,079
would just say that when we were out at

1243
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:49,720
shows smoking you know I grew 10 I think

1244
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:51,400
probably 10 pounds of sour the first

1245
00:45:49,719 --> 00:45:53,598
time I grew it outdoors and my friends

1246
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:56,519
that saw that Harvest and would like if

1247
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:58,599
they smoked this sour in that bag they

1248
00:45:56,519 --> 00:46:01,039
always always say that first one was the

1249
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:03,680
one I was up on Summit in Santa Cruz I

1250
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:05,599
lived like 50 feet into Santa Cruz

1251
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:07,639
County if I went on to the other side of

1252
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:10,240
my street I was in Santa Clara County oh

1253
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:13,639
wow and I was half of a mile from

1254
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:16,838
Highway 17 and that sour and all the

1255
00:46:13,639 --> 00:46:18,358
herb I grew up there was some of the

1256
00:46:16,838 --> 00:46:20,318
best I mean my father-in-law was grown

1257
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:22,679
in Las Gattis about you know probably

1258
00:46:20,318 --> 00:46:25,679
two miles as the crow flies I think even

1259
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:27,118
at the same time yeah and a lot of his

1260
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:28,358
friends a lot of the people I've met met

1261
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:30,640
that know him are like you know that

1262
00:46:28,358 --> 00:46:33,719
weed that you were growing in L Gattis

1263
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:37,199
was like super super dank you know and I

1264
00:46:33,719 --> 00:46:40,039
feel like that area that pocket not even

1265
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:43,239
like coros because it's drier but that

1266
00:46:40,039 --> 00:46:45,159
like Summit pocket the southern end of

1267
00:46:43,239 --> 00:46:46,598
of Summit road like it gets just enough

1268
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:48,159
moisture my landlord when I moved in

1269
00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:50,000
he's like oh you're growing weed he was

1270
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:51,838
all upset at first he's like oh he's

1271
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,920
like this is such a a great spot the the

1272
00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:55,960
fog comes in it kisses it and then it

1273
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,559
disappears by 9:00 in the morning right

1274
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,920
so I didn't deal with as much mold but

1275
00:46:57,559 --> 00:47:01,119
that little bit of humidity I mean that

1276
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:02,480
sour was just like I made a name for

1277
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,680
myself with that sour you know it was

1278
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:07,119
like that first batch I kept growing it

1279
00:47:04,679 --> 00:47:08,719
um it kept coming out relatively similar

1280
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:10,640
yeah and I feel like just having that

1281
00:47:08,719 --> 00:47:13,639
consistency you know so then I started

1282
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:16,639
meeting other guys that were a part of

1283
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:19,639
that crew that I got my sour from and

1284
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:21,480
then I started seeing other sour from

1285
00:47:19,639 --> 00:47:23,598
the guys in that crew and kind of going

1286
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:26,318
like oh okay this is what you know the

1287
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:28,720
the the subtleties and then I'd be like

1288
00:47:26,318 --> 00:47:30,000
yo this the sour is like the Dank you

1289
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:32,358
know and they started taking notes of

1290
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,039
like how long they flowed it for you

1291
00:47:32,358 --> 00:47:37,519
know because people are like oh the sour

1292
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:41,318
is like this and it takes this many days

1293
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:44,920
well my most recent sour Harvest was 56

1294
00:47:41,318 --> 00:47:47,480
days my last one two months ago was 70

1295
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:48,838
something days yeah this most recent

1296
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:51,199
batch is going to be better than the one

1297
00:47:48,838 --> 00:47:53,599
before so to say that like you know what

1298
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:55,919
something is how long it flowers for

1299
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:57,318
what the flower structure should be like

1300
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,920
is maybe a little little bit more

1301
00:47:57,318 --> 00:48:01,440
limited than somebody that has a lot of

1302
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,838
experience growing that variety and

1303
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,599
maybe has tried different things to

1304
00:48:03,838 --> 00:48:08,159
manipulate it to do different things you

1305
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:10,318
know to get like that area sour because

1306
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:12,679
it can be a little stinkier than like

1307
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:14,639
the super dense sour right well indoor I

1308
00:48:12,679 --> 00:48:16,558
think there's a lot of reliability and a

1309
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:18,838
lot of consistency and then you start

1310
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:20,640
moving towards like green Greenhouse

1311
00:48:18,838 --> 00:48:23,440
whether it's mix light or whether it's

1312
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:25,838
straight Greenhouse or outdoor each step

1313
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:28,880
has a lot more variables and things that

1314
00:48:25,838 --> 00:48:30,440
can change conditions right with indoor

1315
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,680
I feel like there's a lot of repetition

1316
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:33,318
you're doing the same thing over and

1317
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:35,679
over and getting a very similar result

1318
00:48:33,318 --> 00:48:37,639
at the end whereas Greenhouse you can

1319
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:39,759
try but like even with Greenhouse if

1320
00:48:37,639 --> 00:48:42,000
you're relying on the sun you're getting

1321
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,720
different amounts of light throughout

1322
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,280
the year so you're ppfd is going to be

1323
00:48:43,719 --> 00:48:50,199
different yeah um that one variable

1324
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:51,680
alone also just the the natural humidity

1325
00:48:50,199 --> 00:48:54,000
which you can control humidity to a

1326
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:57,838
degree in a greenhouse but there's so

1327
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,960
many little things that change

1328
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:00,480
and then you go outdoor and it's

1329
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:03,400
completely different so outdoor is more

1330
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:05,159
like wine you got one rip a year and

1331
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:07,680
from one year to the next you see it

1332
00:49:05,159 --> 00:49:09,679
different and I love that I love seeing

1333
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:11,078
waiting to see what what's new what's

1334
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:13,519
how's this year is going to turn out how

1335
00:49:11,079 --> 00:49:15,559
much rain did we have how much how much

1336
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:17,358
did the environment affect it and what

1337
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:19,480
did it what did it do yeah and I think

1338
00:49:17,358 --> 00:49:21,279
as Growers you know not necessarily as

1339
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:24,920
much for the consumers but as Growers we

1340
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:27,200
go oh you remember 2005 or whatever that

1341
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:28,760
year was like that was a great year like

1342
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:30,358
this year is going to go down as a great

1343
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:32,359
year you know we're having 100 degree

1344
00:49:30,358 --> 00:49:35,239
temperatures in October I personally

1345
00:49:32,358 --> 00:49:36,719
have never had a 100 degree October it's

1346
00:49:35,239 --> 00:49:38,639
wild so we're going to see a different

1347
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:41,519
outcome so we're going to remember I

1348
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:45,358
mean I remember it was like 2016 there

1349
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:47,599
was like a stretch of like 95 days

1350
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:49,159
temperatures in September and I was like

1351
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:50,480
wow like I don't remember this happening

1352
00:49:49,159 --> 00:49:52,639
you know since I've been growing so I

1353
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:54,760
think we have these markers in weather

1354
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:57,239
that produce different outcomes well I

1355
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:58,640
think this year I'm seeing a lot of

1356
00:49:57,239 --> 00:50:00,439
a lot of the different genetics a lot of

1357
00:49:58,639 --> 00:50:02,279
different cultivars out there finish

1358
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:04,358
earlier uh and I'm sure that's

1359
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:06,798
attributed to the hot days I you know I

1360
00:50:04,358 --> 00:50:08,279
think that's one of the attributes uh

1361
00:50:06,798 --> 00:50:10,199
I'm seeing stuff that I wouldn't expect

1362
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:12,040
to be early finishers and we got guys

1363
00:50:10,199 --> 00:50:13,719
when we were at canopis showing me buds

1364
00:50:12,039 --> 00:50:15,798
of finished products and I'm like wow

1365
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:17,480
from From My Seats I was like that's

1366
00:50:15,798 --> 00:50:20,039
freaking cool I never expected that to

1367
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:22,559
be an early finisher and it finished in

1368
00:50:20,039 --> 00:50:24,000
midt yeah it's interesting how weather

1369
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:25,760
weather affects all that and that's why

1370
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,719
outdoor growing is so difficult you know

1371
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,280
when I was doing indoor it was like we

1372
00:50:27,719 --> 00:50:31,838
were doing the same thing on the same

1373
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:34,040
day every day it was repeatable it was

1374
00:50:31,838 --> 00:50:36,358
uh that's really good by the way I know

1375
00:50:34,039 --> 00:50:37,639
I'm like I'm like I took like two hits

1376
00:50:36,358 --> 00:50:38,838
and I'm really high yeah I did the same

1377
00:50:37,639 --> 00:50:40,759
thing I took two hits because I want to

1378
00:50:38,838 --> 00:50:43,119
see where I go with it and I'm like I

1379
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:45,559
feel really good I feel like I'm

1380
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:48,400
definitely lifted but I feel

1381
00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:50,119
very communicative I guess is the right

1382
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,160
word but I feel like I'm you know

1383
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:53,760
sometimes if I get too high like I have

1384
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:56,159
to think about stuff and I feel like it

1385
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,839
it just flows so you know and there's a

1386
00:50:56,159 --> 00:51:00,159
handful of things that I like to smoke

1387
00:50:57,838 --> 00:51:02,039
that that do that and some of this stuff

1388
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:03,798
man it'll get me so high on a show where

1389
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:06,759
I'm like I start talking about just

1390
00:51:03,798 --> 00:51:08,039
random stuff instead of staying focused

1391
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:09,760
right and that's the cool thing about

1392
00:51:08,039 --> 00:51:12,239
the pearls is it does get you high but

1393
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:14,559
it's like a focused High you know for me

1394
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:16,118
it's like a I don't know I find it's

1395
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,839
like in the front of my face in the

1396
00:51:16,119 --> 00:51:20,440
front of my head and I find myself going

1397
00:51:17,838 --> 00:51:23,199
like damn I'm [ __ ] high yeah but it's

1398
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:24,559
in this really like not a racy way yeah

1399
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:26,838
you know I think sometimes like with the

1400
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:28,240
African Haze that's more of that kind of

1401
00:51:26,838 --> 00:51:30,558
like racy side of the high where you're

1402
00:51:28,239 --> 00:51:32,159
like feeling that intensity yeah and

1403
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:35,559
that's where sometimes for me the kind

1404
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:37,440
of like um I can kind of like just go

1405
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:39,359
know somewhere else with it right yeah

1406
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:41,079
it's a trip the African Haze you gave me

1407
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:45,199
was really special too but it was pretty

1408
00:51:41,079 --> 00:51:46,559
strong it is I mean I find myself I mean

1409
00:51:45,199 --> 00:51:48,199
what we both took a couple hits and

1410
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:50,480
we're talking about how high we are yeah

1411
00:51:48,199 --> 00:51:52,519
you know I mean to me that's the marker

1412
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,159
I got like joints like this and I'm like

1413
00:51:52,519 --> 00:51:57,280
you know and I feel like I could smoke

1414
00:51:54,159 --> 00:52:00,598
this whole thing and I probably would be

1415
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:02,519
about the same level of high but

1416
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:05,920
different different effect I've tried to

1417
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:08,639
really be like humble in my judging of

1418
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:11,559
the weed that I get yeah um because I

1419
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:15,400
feel like I'm super lucky I'm super

1420
00:52:11,559 --> 00:52:18,680
blessed to have been kind of marry into

1421
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:22,318
a family that like has a such a a wide

1422
00:52:18,679 --> 00:52:23,759
variety yeah and I've been turned onto

1423
00:52:22,318 --> 00:52:25,679
something that I normally wouldn't have

1424
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:28,599
ever found highs that I would have never

1425
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:29,960
experienced mhm that I find myself

1426
00:52:28,599 --> 00:52:33,720
enjoying so

1427
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:35,240
much I'm like I just don't really smoke

1428
00:52:33,719 --> 00:52:38,000
the other end of the spectrum anymore

1429
00:52:35,239 --> 00:52:40,719
because I like it so much that I don't

1430
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:44,079
ever want to go back to that totally but

1431
00:52:40,719 --> 00:52:46,318
I try to be objective I try to check

1432
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:48,680
things out so I can check myself you

1433
00:52:46,318 --> 00:52:50,199
know so yeah people give me weed

1434
00:52:48,679 --> 00:52:52,519
sometimes you know one of my homies like

1435
00:52:50,199 --> 00:52:55,399
he grows killer killer outdoor some of

1436
00:52:52,519 --> 00:52:57,639
the best outdoor mhm you know I picked

1437
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:59,200
like three or four of his best that he

1438
00:52:57,639 --> 00:53:00,759
did one year rolled up a whole entire

1439
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:02,679
joint of it smoked the whole entire

1440
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,880
thing with my Dome this is you know I

1441
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:06,078
don't know how long ago a couple months

1442
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:09,160
back and it was like I was just waiting

1443
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:11,640
to get high yeah and it's really good

1444
00:53:09,159 --> 00:53:14,078
weed but it didn't get me high you know

1445
00:53:11,639 --> 00:53:15,440
and I know that's partially due now to

1446
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:16,599
smoking things like the pearls or the

1447
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,720
African Haze where it's like I'm

1448
00:53:16,599 --> 00:53:20,760
expecting to get high for a really long

1449
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:22,318
time in an intense way that people were

1450
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:25,359
like yo what did you just smoke cuz

1451
00:53:22,318 --> 00:53:27,719
you're like buzzing you know and so a

1452
00:53:25,358 --> 00:53:29,880
lot of the weed I smoked now I'm just

1453
00:53:27,719 --> 00:53:31,879
kind of sitting there waiting for

1454
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:33,920
something to happen and if something

1455
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:35,480
happens it's like this lethargic feeling

1456
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:38,000
that comes over me for a short amount of

1457
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:40,119
time then afterwards I'm kind of like H

1458
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,119
what are your thoughts on Skittles

1459
00:53:40,119 --> 00:53:44,798
everybody's gonna laugh at me for this

1460
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:47,838
um I couldn't pick Skittles out of a bag

1461
00:53:44,798 --> 00:53:51,440
of 20 different varieties yeah I was

1462
00:53:47,838 --> 00:53:54,279
growing the sour heavy up until

1463
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:55,838
2015 left California started growing for

1464
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:58,000
another for a company in Washington

1465
00:53:55,838 --> 00:53:59,480
right as the SK Skittles hit yeah when I

1466
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,280
came back I was working for other people

1467
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:02,880
that weren't growing the Skittles when I

1468
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,760
started doing my own thing the sour was

1469
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:07,240
the first thing I got back so I believe

1470
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,640
like I've grown the Dosey dough which I

1471
00:54:07,239 --> 00:54:10,759
think has Skittles in it and I always

1472
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:14,440
hear people talk about no Dosey dough

1473
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:16,240
times Skittles is moonbo okay but yes

1474
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:18,280
Dosey Do is its own thing I really like

1475
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:21,639
Dosey Do I mean everything that I've

1476
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:23,920
smelled fits into 1.5 categories and I

1477
00:54:21,639 --> 00:54:25,838
say 1.5 because it all fits in the same

1478
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:27,639
category and then there's some stuff

1479
00:54:25,838 --> 00:54:29,239
that I've SM that's like just barely

1480
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:31,798
outside of the category for me but I'm

1481
00:54:29,239 --> 00:54:34,078
just like it's not far enough away to

1482
00:54:31,798 --> 00:54:36,400
get me into the zone of like the African

1483
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:38,160
Haze has a really distinct smell even

1484
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:40,798
for hazes yeah you know it doesn't smell

1485
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:42,159
like a traditional Haze so right I I try

1486
00:54:40,798 --> 00:54:45,000
like I said I try to be humble and I try

1487
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:46,679
to be objective and bias and still know

1488
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,639
that there's other great weed out there

1489
00:54:46,679 --> 00:54:50,000
that can get me super high yeah it's

1490
00:54:48,639 --> 00:54:52,039
just not what I prefer to smoke these

1491
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,679
days yeah you

1492
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:57,480
know you know my brother he was a really

1493
00:54:55,679 --> 00:54:59,879
good grower out the gate and I was

1494
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:01,960
really not a great grower and so slowly

1495
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:03,200
over time I didn't even know that I

1496
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:05,240
wasn't a good grer I thought I was a

1497
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:06,679
good grower and I think a lot of people

1498
00:55:05,239 --> 00:55:08,598
don't even know because they haven't

1499
00:55:06,679 --> 00:55:12,798
grown long enough to understand and this

1500
00:55:08,599 --> 00:55:15,640
is you know the the 90s uh early 90s and

1501
00:55:12,798 --> 00:55:18,559
from the early 90s to the 2000s I

1502
00:55:15,639 --> 00:55:20,798
learned what good flower was and

1503
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:22,480
even I still feel like I'm learning what

1504
00:55:20,798 --> 00:55:25,159
good flower is and it's constantly the

1505
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:26,920
the needles changing right and so I'm

1506
00:55:25,159 --> 00:55:28,519
having to re-evaluate and look back at

1507
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:30,960
stuff like this I really like smoking

1508
00:55:28,519 --> 00:55:32,318
this for the flavor yeah right and so I

1509
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,720
can smoke a whole joint of this I can

1510
00:55:32,318 --> 00:55:36,679
just sit back and smoke a big joint and

1511
00:55:34,719 --> 00:55:40,239
it might take me 45 minutes to smoke one

1512
00:55:36,679 --> 00:55:41,639
of these joints like this right and I

1513
00:55:40,239 --> 00:55:44,479
enjoy

1514
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:45,719
that uh meditation right and it's almost

1515
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,880
like a meditation for me where I'm

1516
00:55:45,719 --> 00:55:49,358
sitting and smoking and just

1517
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:52,079
contemplating maybe contemplating my day

1518
00:55:49,358 --> 00:55:53,838
maybe contemplating how much I'm you

1519
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:55,599
know enjoying life right now or how

1520
00:55:53,838 --> 00:55:57,358
lucky I am to be alive but I feel like

1521
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:58,559
some of those things where some of the

1522
00:55:57,358 --> 00:56:00,960
stuff you can smoke and you could just

1523
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:03,680
sit there and do it I do enjoy the smoke

1524
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:05,679
side of it too totally I mean I that's

1525
00:56:03,679 --> 00:56:08,239
you know it's the whole enchilada right

1526
00:56:05,679 --> 00:56:10,480
you know break it up smoke it sit there

1527
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:13,000
get high think about it think about some

1528
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:15,358
other stuff um you know and it's that

1529
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,159
kind of the the final part of the

1530
00:56:15,358 --> 00:56:18,519
process from growing it you know

1531
00:56:17,159 --> 00:56:20,798
cracking the seed whatever planting the

1532
00:56:18,519 --> 00:56:22,838
Clone to like breaking it up and really

1533
00:56:20,798 --> 00:56:25,079
get into like what are your what do your

1534
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:27,358
fingers feel like you know how does it

1535
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:29,480
roll uh you know my father-in-law has

1536
00:56:27,358 --> 00:56:31,480
this like crazy criteria if the weed

1537
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:34,199
falls out of the paper when he's rolling

1538
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:35,838
it it's not good weed wow he's like got

1539
00:56:34,199 --> 00:56:37,519
he'll like the Skittles then he's got

1540
00:56:35,838 --> 00:56:40,880
that far so that Skittles reminds me of

1541
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:43,719
the mango cush yeah um the Sunday driver

1542
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:45,760
reminds me of that the I'm just going to

1543
00:56:43,719 --> 00:56:48,480
Rattle them all off because it's

1544
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:53,079
interesting to me the um what is it this

1545
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:54,760
DNA has a sour banana sherbet yeah so we

1546
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:57,599
got the Sunday driver the sour banana

1547
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:59,119
sherbet all remind me of the mango cush

1548
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:03,000
that I used to get from these dudes that

1549
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:05,280
had the sour yeah um not to the tea but

1550
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,358
that's what I go back to so that fuess

1551
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,559
yeah and there's fru there's a little

1552
00:57:06,358 --> 00:57:11,239
bit of gas but this is a special one

1553
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:14,680
because they harvest on day 53 okay if

1554
00:57:11,239 --> 00:57:17,798
you go to day 61 or 62 or 63 it ends up

1555
00:57:14,679 --> 00:57:19,838
being much gassier much less it's not

1556
00:57:17,798 --> 00:57:21,358
fruit forward this when you break it up

1557
00:57:19,838 --> 00:57:23,440
you get like when I'm rolling I smell

1558
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:25,480
fresh cantaloupe you know and I love

1559
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,200
stuff that's unique like that where I'm

1560
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:29,599
like oh it smells like this or it smells

1561
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:31,719
like that I mean I love complexity and I

1562
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:33,838
feel like this has the right amount of

1563
00:57:31,719 --> 00:57:35,519
complexity for something unique it

1564
00:57:33,838 --> 00:57:36,759
doesn't it's not the strongest it's

1565
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:39,599
definitely not the stuff where you're

1566
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:41,680
like wow the effect was just amazing it

1567
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:43,079
does it can get you high but it's a

1568
00:57:41,679 --> 00:57:45,798
different kind it's more of a relax kind

1569
00:57:43,079 --> 00:57:47,440
of like white Thorn uh White Thorn's its

1570
00:57:45,798 --> 00:57:49,199
own thing too that has I feel like white

1571
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:51,679
Thorn will get you high but it's more

1572
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:53,118
like Johnny said it best it's like

1573
00:57:51,679 --> 00:57:54,960
getting hugged from your ancestors when

1574
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:56,599
you smoke it and every time I smoke it I

1575
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:58,039
think that you know I mean like it's

1576
00:57:56,599 --> 00:58:00,119
funny when somebody says something like

1577
00:57:58,039 --> 00:58:01,880
that and it triggers this feeling or

1578
00:58:00,119 --> 00:58:04,000
this thought like when I smoke it and I

1579
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:05,240
don't know if it's because he said it or

1580
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,119
right because that's how it makes you

1581
00:58:05,239 --> 00:58:10,519
feel but it's probably a combination of

1582
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:13,000
both um and speaking of white Thorn Rose

1583
00:58:10,519 --> 00:58:15,559
Johnny and Jason for they were on the

1584
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:18,280
podcast together Jason from Ridgeland

1585
00:58:15,559 --> 00:58:21,559
and that's another one where Terr is so

1586
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:23,160
specific and light and elevation because

1587
00:58:21,559 --> 00:58:24,640
Johnny gave Jason the cut of the white

1588
00:58:23,159 --> 00:58:26,879
Thorn but it doesn't grow the same on

1589
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:28,239
his property it was selected and own you

1590
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:30,838
know and Johnny's been working for over

1591
00:58:28,239 --> 00:58:32,199
30 years on that property and then he

1592
00:58:30,838 --> 00:58:36,838
gives the cut to Jason and it doesn't

1593
00:58:32,199 --> 00:58:40,239
grow nearly as good yep and so Terre and

1594
00:58:36,838 --> 00:58:42,159
you know climate and environment is so

1595
00:58:40,239 --> 00:58:43,519
important to different things and and

1596
00:58:42,159 --> 00:58:45,038
what performs the best you have to

1597
00:58:43,519 --> 00:58:46,318
really try it out yeah in a few

1598
00:58:45,039 --> 00:58:47,680
different ways you got to kind of like

1599
00:58:46,318 --> 00:58:49,519
put it through the put it through the

1600
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:51,798
test to see you know is it good indoor

1601
00:58:49,519 --> 00:58:53,440
strain yeah is a good outdoor strain you

1602
00:58:51,798 --> 00:58:54,838
know because some strains can be the

1603
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,760
all-in-one and some of them are just

1604
00:58:54,838 --> 00:58:58,199
like like the perss back in the day you

1605
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:00,960
did not want to grow that Outdoors you

1606
00:58:58,199 --> 00:59:02,159
know I never saw perss that really never

1607
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:04,280
met anybody that was like oh I love

1608
00:59:02,159 --> 00:59:05,719
outdoor perss you know it was it was a

1609
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:06,880
really good indoor train I never even

1610
00:59:05,719 --> 00:59:09,078
thought about that but you're right I

1611
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:11,280
all the pretty I mean I saw some other

1612
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:15,480
purple stuff that was good outside but

1613
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:17,160
not not the GDP or the perss um yeah

1614
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:18,679
blackberry kush was another one where it

1615
00:59:17,159 --> 00:59:20,598
looked beautiful but it didn't get me

1616
00:59:18,679 --> 00:59:23,679
high at all I think we had some tested a

1617
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:26,240
while back and it tested at 8% THC the

1618
00:59:23,679 --> 00:59:27,639
Blackberry Kush I remember that one I

1619
00:59:26,239 --> 00:59:29,879
remember that I thought that was going

1620
00:59:27,639 --> 00:59:31,798
to like take over it was like really

1621
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:34,039
white and frosty but had these like

1622
00:59:31,798 --> 00:59:36,079
purple and like Maroon kind of Hues to

1623
00:59:34,039 --> 00:59:37,880
it on the inside of it looked crazy as a

1624
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:40,039
plant too it would Bush out and it would

1625
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:41,358
get tall they I saw some big Blackberry

1626
00:59:40,039 --> 00:59:43,880
fish plants and they would get really

1627
00:59:41,358 --> 00:59:45,960
purple and really Frosty but then it was

1628
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:49,200
never the stuff we had was never strong

1629
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:51,798
it was always like borderline

1630
00:59:49,199 --> 00:59:53,639
prenda CBD yeah I think there's a lot of

1631
00:59:51,798 --> 00:59:55,159
CBD on the market right now that people

1632
00:59:53,639 --> 00:59:57,480
are passing off as I mean not that

1633
00:59:55,159 --> 01:00:00,199
they're in intally growing CBD flour

1634
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:02,280
right but I feel like some of this flour

1635
01:00:00,199 --> 01:00:03,719
is reminiscent of CBD you know it's like

1636
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:06,798
you should be able to take a few hits of

1637
01:00:03,719 --> 01:00:09,879
something and feel an effect yeah and if

1638
01:00:06,798 --> 01:00:11,239
you don't then you know maybe like

1639
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:13,200
unless it's creeper then you feel an

1640
01:00:11,239 --> 01:00:14,679
effect 15 minutes later and some of the

1641
01:00:13,199 --> 01:00:17,038
stuff you've given me has done that

1642
01:00:14,679 --> 01:00:18,639
where you get that creeper effect where

1643
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:19,960
you we we always used to call it creeper

1644
01:00:18,639 --> 01:00:22,159
Bud where you smoke it and then you're

1645
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:23,760
not really high for about 10 to 15

1646
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:26,519
minutes and then you're like oh [ __ ] and

1647
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:28,480
you it's harder to control the effect as

1648
01:00:26,519 --> 01:00:30,480
much but that's good too I mean I like

1649
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:33,358
those kind of I feel like those are like

1650
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:36,000
weekend strains just weekend

1651
01:00:33,358 --> 01:00:39,000
varieties and uh yeah there's even like

1652
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:41,079
a creeper pheno of

1653
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,798
like like my father-in-law sent me a

1654
01:00:41,079 --> 01:00:45,119
picture the other day and it was like a

1655
01:00:42,798 --> 01:00:48,239
creeper feno where it like grows wide

1656
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:50,079
yeah and so out of all the varieties

1657
01:00:48,239 --> 01:00:52,439
that he's grown you know he really likes

1658
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:54,519
the tie he he's he thinks that like a

1659
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:57,760
lot of the more psychedelic type stuff

1660
01:00:54,519 --> 01:01:01,318
comes from the Asian regions um and then

1661
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:03,480
he was always like be on the lookout for

1662
01:01:01,318 --> 01:01:05,558
the ones that grow sideways like real

1663
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:06,920
long narrow branches the the creeper

1664
01:01:05,559 --> 01:01:08,920
ones that grow sideways because he's

1665
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:11,358
like it's kind of how the pearls are

1666
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:14,000
yeah they just like go everywhere they

1667
01:01:11,358 --> 01:01:17,038
Vine out yeah yeah um and it's you know

1668
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,440
and it's it's a pretty good smoke nice

1669
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:20,680
yeah so what do you think about this

1670
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:23,798
statement

1671
01:01:20,679 --> 01:01:25,919
that the high the length of the high is

1672
01:01:23,798 --> 01:01:27,318
is in comparison to the length of the

1673
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:28,960
the flowering time I've heard that

1674
01:01:27,318 --> 01:01:30,880
before I'd love to have your

1675
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:33,039
father-in-law's opinion on that because

1676
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:35,519
I I believe that I've seen that like

1677
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:37,000
some of the longer like 16 18 weeks

1678
01:01:35,519 --> 01:01:39,038
stuff I feel like you some of those

1679
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:42,358
bries that finish in 16 to 18 weeks when

1680
01:01:39,039 --> 01:01:43,760
you smoke them the high is super like

1681
01:01:42,358 --> 01:01:46,719
you can get a three-hour High out of

1682
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:49,280
some of those I think that's 100%

1683
01:01:46,719 --> 01:01:52,598
accurate yeah um it's been my experience

1684
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:55,960
with them you know I've grown 100 120

1685
01:01:52,599 --> 01:01:57,119
day varieties uh he's grown 22 weeks I

1686
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:59,318
don't know how many days that is but

1687
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:01,358
it's way too long so wild but I think I

1688
01:01:59,318 --> 01:02:04,199
kind of mentioned that earlier and um

1689
01:02:01,358 --> 01:02:05,358
you know I get a lot of I get a lot of

1690
01:02:04,199 --> 01:02:07,159
this from him but it's like it's

1691
01:02:05,358 --> 01:02:10,519
validated by like the stuff that I see

1692
01:02:07,159 --> 01:02:12,159
also right um like those pearls you know

1693
01:02:10,519 --> 01:02:14,038
is definitely one of the longest

1694
01:02:12,159 --> 01:02:17,719
flowering varieties that we continually

1695
01:02:14,039 --> 01:02:20,240
grow yeah um and it seems like the

1696
01:02:17,719 --> 01:02:24,318
longer the flowering time the longer the

1697
01:02:20,239 --> 01:02:27,278
highas um the African Haze 11 the pearls

1698
01:02:24,318 --> 01:02:29,838
they're things that you know can have an

1699
01:02:27,278 --> 01:02:33,719
hourong effect just off of a h a few

1700
01:02:29,838 --> 01:02:35,400
hits yeah so I really think that you

1701
01:02:33,719 --> 01:02:37,038
know there there's something to that

1702
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:39,440
correlation with the how long it takes

1703
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:42,079
to flower versus how long you stay high

1704
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:45,119
for right um

1705
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:47,640
and I'm just starting to see that he's

1706
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:50,240
you know he's been grown for a long time

1707
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:52,239
and I don't think really had anybody

1708
01:02:50,239 --> 01:02:54,038
that's like done the back and forth that

1709
01:02:52,239 --> 01:02:55,639
I have with him about these long flying

1710
01:02:54,039 --> 01:02:56,440
varieties because nobody's grown them so

1711
01:02:55,639 --> 01:02:58,358
like

1712
01:02:56,440 --> 01:03:00,000
you know my younger self even five years

1713
01:02:58,358 --> 01:03:02,318
ago I wasn't having the conversations

1714
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,838
with him them that I am now yeah and

1715
01:03:02,318 --> 01:03:05,318
he's always been like you just got to

1716
01:03:03,838 --> 01:03:06,639
grow it just grow it just grow it and I

1717
01:03:05,318 --> 01:03:08,278
met someone recently they're like yeah

1718
01:03:06,639 --> 01:03:09,838
you know we're trying to like figure out

1719
01:03:08,278 --> 01:03:11,599
a way to like reincorporate these like

1720
01:03:09,838 --> 01:03:14,119
long flowering varieties back into the

1721
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:15,760
culture and I was like who's we and he

1722
01:03:14,119 --> 01:03:17,480
was like just everybody in the community

1723
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:19,680
and I was like well you just got to do

1724
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:21,119
it you know like and that's what he's

1725
01:03:19,679 --> 01:03:23,159
been tell me you just got to grow them

1726
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:25,798
you just got to plant the seede you just

1727
01:03:23,159 --> 01:03:28,038
but it takes longer so it's this like

1728
01:03:25,798 --> 01:03:30,599
it's more daunting it's there's not as

1729
01:03:28,039 --> 01:03:32,799
many rewards you know you pop some seeds

1730
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:34,440
and he got the one out of the 10 out of

1731
01:03:32,798 --> 01:03:36,719
the Destroyer but that one was

1732
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:40,000
definitely worth the 10 and and like he

1733
01:03:36,719 --> 01:03:41,399
said like not all Pearl fenos are good

1734
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,480
you know like some of them just aren't

1735
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:44,440
worth growing some of them are

1736
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:45,798
exceptional so I think the amount of

1737
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:48,400
people that are going to be able to

1738
01:03:45,798 --> 01:03:50,960
speak to that are very few I think he

1739
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:52,880
would be a very good starting point for

1740
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,519
people to start to look at like okay

1741
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:57,480
this is a dude that's been smoking for

1742
01:03:54,519 --> 01:04:01,159
60 56 years he's been growing for that

1743
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:03,079
long he's still smoking and he's still

1744
01:04:01,159 --> 01:04:06,480
finding things that get him high in

1745
01:04:03,079 --> 01:04:08,400
different ways but I don't meet too many

1746
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:10,159
other 70 year olds that are like yo I

1747
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:13,240
just pulled out a 20 weaker here's a

1748
01:04:10,159 --> 01:04:15,920
joint you know and it's been like that I

1749
01:04:13,239 --> 01:04:17,759
mean ever since I've met him 12 years he

1750
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:20,358
has not slowed down no we got to get him

1751
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:24,480
on the show dude we got to get him on

1752
01:04:20,358 --> 01:04:27,920
the show to to lay a good framework for

1753
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:30,760
what I feel is about to happen with this

1754
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:32,920
whole long flowering thing because once

1755
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:34,760
people have access to this once they can

1756
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:38,960
feel how me and you are feeling right

1757
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:41,039
now yeah agreed they're going to want it

1758
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:43,119
um and they're going to want it to a

1759
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:44,880
point where it's going to be like that's

1760
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:46,318
all I want you know because I've had a

1761
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,880
few people that I've like given enough

1762
01:04:46,318 --> 01:04:50,480
herb for them to smoke for a few days

1763
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:53,119
and they're like yo like you know I can

1764
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:56,639
name a few people um and it's very

1765
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:58,519
enjoyable once there's the access to it

1766
01:04:56,639 --> 01:05:00,598
that's when it's going to hit in the bay

1767
01:04:58,519 --> 01:05:03,358
there's no access right so you I see it

1768
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:05,760
way more up in humbled and Mendo and as

1769
01:05:03,358 --> 01:05:07,440
you get the bay it's all this one thing

1770
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:08,760
now there is a company in the bay and I

1771
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,599
don't know their names and I'd love to

1772
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:12,960
have them on the show too but they're

1773
01:05:10,599 --> 01:05:14,440
exclusively growing sativas I've I've

1774
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:16,358
heard about them from a couple people

1775
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:17,720
but I don't remember the brand name okay

1776
01:05:16,358 --> 01:05:20,159
and I would love to have you know it's

1777
01:05:17,719 --> 01:05:21,558
like obviously accessibility is the most

1778
01:05:20,159 --> 01:05:23,920
important part we're lucky to have the

1779
01:05:21,559 --> 01:05:26,440
access that we have but like it's really

1780
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:29,559
shifted away in the bay from anything

1781
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:31,760
sativa and you might find a dispensary

1782
01:05:29,559 --> 01:05:33,880
that has one or two options or a few

1783
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:36,359
options right but they're in my opinion

1784
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:38,680
I haven't seen a lot of good options Haw

1785
01:05:36,358 --> 01:05:40,798
spark has some good stuff I'm always apt

1786
01:05:38,679 --> 01:05:43,519
to like look at a menu look at their

1787
01:05:40,798 --> 01:05:44,838
sativas and then kind of be like you

1788
01:05:43,519 --> 01:05:46,719
know and then I ask what makes it a

1789
01:05:44,838 --> 01:05:48,880
sativa you know because I'm trying to

1790
01:05:46,719 --> 01:05:50,719
understand because I have a company that

1791
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:53,240
specializes in growing these long

1792
01:05:50,719 --> 01:05:54,919
flowering or these sativa varieties sure

1793
01:05:53,239 --> 01:05:57,078
I want to get somebody else's opinion I

1794
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:59,720
want to get somebody else's gauge of

1795
01:05:57,079 --> 01:06:01,359
what they think somebody replied to me

1796
01:05:59,719 --> 01:06:03,759
and said the terpinolene is what makes

1797
01:06:01,358 --> 01:06:04,960
it a sativa and I said okay interesting

1798
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:08,880
you know that's an interesting thought

1799
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:11,358
on it which I could maybe say yeah there

1800
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:13,358
a lot of varieties that most people have

1801
01:06:11,358 --> 01:06:16,358
experienced that have been called

1802
01:06:13,358 --> 01:06:19,239
sativas do have a terpinolene dominant

1803
01:06:16,358 --> 01:06:22,000
profile in the US for sure but those

1804
01:06:19,239 --> 01:06:24,358
aren't what I would consider you would

1805
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:28,239
consider or my father-in-law would

1806
01:06:24,358 --> 01:06:30,000
consider a sativa right and so trying to

1807
01:06:28,239 --> 01:06:33,919
respectfully

1808
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:36,920
distinguish between a jack a blue dream

1809
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:39,200
a sour a train wreck yeah and most of

1810
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:40,838
these things pearls those are hybrids

1811
01:06:39,199 --> 01:06:44,919
those are hybrids that might lean a

1812
01:06:40,838 --> 01:06:47,798
little bit towards sativa but those

1813
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:49,159
aren't necessarily really on the sativa

1814
01:06:47,798 --> 01:06:51,639
Spectrum especially you know like blue

1815
01:06:49,159 --> 01:06:54,879
dream is great but that's not a really t

1816
01:06:51,639 --> 01:06:58,078
terpinolene dominant variety either no

1817
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:59,920
it just it has the the traits of the

1818
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:02,920
shorter flowering Inda in terms of the

1819
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:05,358
smell but it's got that Vigor and Bud

1820
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:08,400
size totally and just girth of that

1821
01:07:05,358 --> 01:07:10,159
original Haze um oh even the leaves

1822
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:11,400
right it has a thinner Leaf it's not the

1823
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:13,960
thinnest leaf in the world but it does

1824
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:16,440
have a thinner leaf and I think you know

1825
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:18,599
I've seen some nl5 Haze crosses right

1826
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:20,119
people call so you got the nl5 haze and

1827
01:07:18,599 --> 01:07:22,079
then you cross that with something else

1828
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:23,920
I love no5 Haze by the way Fort Collins

1829
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:26,880
cough one of my favorite all-time

1830
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:28,559
favorites I love the effect and so I see

1831
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:31,599
like you cross that with something

1832
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:32,960
that's what's obviously indic a dominant

1833
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:33,798
yeah so now how much Haze do we have

1834
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:37,278
left in

1835
01:07:33,798 --> 01:07:38,798
that not a lot 25% it depends I mean

1836
01:07:37,278 --> 01:07:39,920
with genetic recombination it's

1837
01:07:38,798 --> 01:07:43,400
depending on the traits you're looking

1838
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:46,599
at right right but if you take a 50%

1839
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:50,838
indicia yeah and a and a and a 50 and a

1840
01:07:46,599 --> 01:07:53,400
5050 sure what is that 50% of the other

1841
01:07:50,838 --> 01:07:56,880
two go down to and then to call that a

1842
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:59,880
sativa yeah to me to me is misleading

1843
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:03,798
because now of my what I've learned um

1844
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:05,240
so trying to navigate those terms I

1845
01:08:03,798 --> 01:08:07,000
think that's why we've landed on Long

1846
01:08:05,239 --> 01:08:09,118
flowering varieties because it lends

1847
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:11,318
itself to like oh it's I do like that

1848
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:12,278
term a lot better actually um I feel

1849
01:08:11,318 --> 01:08:15,719
it's more

1850
01:08:12,278 --> 01:08:18,880
descriptive of the the growth patterns

1851
01:08:15,719 --> 01:08:20,318
of of everything about it right and so

1852
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:22,079
then looking at what people call a

1853
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:24,239
sativa and I go and I ask I say what's

1854
01:08:22,079 --> 01:08:26,559
ativa and they point me to something

1855
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:27,798
that has a lot of character istics of

1856
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:30,880
something that looks like a shorter

1857
01:08:27,798 --> 01:08:33,679
flowering variety and so I go okay

1858
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:35,480
that's cool like I see OG Kush labeled

1859
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:38,000
as a sativa sometimes in dispensaries

1860
01:08:35,479 --> 01:08:40,079
and it's like I mean there's a lot of

1861
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,000
stuff that I feel like is mislabeled and

1862
01:08:40,079 --> 01:08:44,798
it's so complicated because using

1863
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,439
indicia sativa hybrid is just so General

1864
01:08:44,798 --> 01:08:49,560
yeah right and then even if we just

1865
01:08:46,439 --> 01:08:51,639
started talking about uh tpine profiles

1866
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:53,679
that would be even better in my opinion

1867
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:55,640
but I love the long flowering aspect it

1868
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:57,960
really distinguishes it and makes it

1869
01:08:55,640 --> 01:09:01,400
very specific to stuff that flowers long

1870
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:04,640
because I have some gelato times Mexican

1871
01:09:01,399 --> 01:09:07,719
Haze that's like a you know less than 60

1872
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:10,000
days that's awesome I mean to if you can

1873
01:09:07,719 --> 01:09:11,520
get the effect of a haze in in that

1874
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,479
short of flowering time I mean that's

1875
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:16,440
like the golden ticket yeah you know

1876
01:09:13,479 --> 01:09:19,079
because like the African Haze 11 is in

1877
01:09:16,439 --> 01:09:21,678
flavor and and smell is nothing like the

1878
01:09:19,079 --> 01:09:23,838
Band-Aid Haze the Band-Aid Haze is more

1879
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:25,440
of that like traditional Haze smell

1880
01:09:23,838 --> 01:09:26,920
right I don't think tur profiles are

1881
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:28,879
really going to do it I think it's a

1882
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:30,158
better conversation though because uh

1883
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:32,279
you know especially if you're trying to

1884
01:09:30,158 --> 01:09:34,399
sell flour and you're trying to describe

1885
01:09:32,279 --> 01:09:36,600
effect a lot of times flavor and effect

1886
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:39,079
can go similar if we're talking about

1887
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:43,319
like the citrusy varieties as opposed to

1888
01:09:39,079 --> 01:09:45,000
the gassy funky or GMO even I feel like

1889
01:09:43,319 --> 01:09:47,440
those can kind of describe a fact a

1890
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,119
little bit but even you know tpin we

1891
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:50,919
talk about flavorant I don't know if you

1892
01:09:49,119 --> 01:09:53,158
know abstract Tech and their their

1893
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:56,399
abstract Tech and their white papers

1894
01:09:53,158 --> 01:09:58,519
that they wrote but they go into uh

1895
01:09:56,399 --> 01:10:02,799
talking about flavorants and flavorants

1896
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:04,840
are like THS sulfur compounds all these

1897
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:07,159
things that weren't traditionally

1898
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:09,319
discussed in the conversation with tpin

1899
01:10:07,158 --> 01:10:12,799
that actually have a lot more to do with

1900
01:10:09,319 --> 01:10:18,000
the the aroma and this The Taste than

1901
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:20,079
the actual Turin so in about 2013

1902
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:23,399
2014 I

1903
01:10:20,079 --> 01:10:26,279
was I was like what is what nutrient is

1904
01:10:23,399 --> 01:10:29,319
most responsible for flavoring smell

1905
01:10:26,279 --> 01:10:33,359
right so boom looked it up magnesium

1906
01:10:29,319 --> 01:10:34,880
yeah or sorry sulfur so an easy form of

1907
01:10:33,359 --> 01:10:37,799
sulfur is magnesium sulfate that's why I

1908
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:39,640
said that so sulfur is most responsible

1909
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:42,760
for flavor turpine and all that so I

1910
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:45,400
started going hard on magnesium sulfate

1911
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:47,000
on sulfur because yeah that's what the

1912
01:10:45,399 --> 01:10:49,439
plant wants to like produce those turps

1913
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,000
and so now and I think we recently saw a

1914
01:10:49,439 --> 01:10:53,839
paper that came out and said these

1915
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:55,719
things about sulfur being that compound

1916
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:57,760
that's responsible for the skunk Aroma

1917
01:10:55,719 --> 01:10:59,119
in the sour right and my homie sent me a

1918
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:01,199
message he was like yo he's like you

1919
01:10:59,119 --> 01:11:03,279
were right all along you know cuz I just

1920
01:11:01,198 --> 01:11:04,879
started doing it out of like nobody

1921
01:11:03,279 --> 01:11:07,319
really like talked about it then I I

1922
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:09,800
went to work for a company and my buddy

1923
01:11:07,319 --> 01:11:12,679
had a the respect of the owners and so

1924
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:15,760
he was like yo like let's try to

1925
01:11:12,679 --> 01:11:17,480
incorporate some sulfur into the feeding

1926
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:19,000
schedule and now I think it's you know a

1927
01:11:17,479 --> 01:11:20,959
little more common that people are using

1928
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:23,520
sulfer as something to try and enhance

1929
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:25,560
that even Botanicare started their Suite

1930
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:27,400
which is just magnesium sulfate totally

1931
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:29,120
you know I do like that product I've

1932
01:11:27,399 --> 01:11:30,719
used that product I mean I used to use

1933
01:11:29,119 --> 01:11:32,880
that product I don't use it anymore but

1934
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:35,640
I used it for a long time yeah um so

1935
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:37,560
yeah all that stuff you know goes into

1936
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:39,760
and I mean even the sour or like I grew

1937
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:42,120
some Band-Aid outdoor a couple years ago

1938
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:44,039
and it looked like crap and it was crap

1939
01:11:42,119 --> 01:11:46,920
but it still got me higher than

1940
01:11:44,039 --> 01:11:49,880
everything else that I had so it looked

1941
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:51,319
like crap it had a low oil content it

1942
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:52,719
didn't have a lot of Crystal on it but

1943
01:11:51,319 --> 01:11:54,960
it was getting me higher than everything

1944
01:11:52,719 --> 01:11:56,399
else yeah so I'm still trying to figure

1945
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:58,279
out how is that possible you know

1946
01:11:56,399 --> 01:11:59,799
because it's such a complex plant and

1947
01:11:58,279 --> 01:12:02,599
we're still learning about it that

1948
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:04,560
there's got to be something else besides

1949
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:07,039
everything else that we've discovered

1950
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:08,520
that would allow an everyday smoker to

1951
01:12:07,039 --> 01:12:11,479
smoke that at the end of the day and

1952
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:13,199
take one hit and get so high that like

1953
01:12:11,479 --> 01:12:14,879
sometimes you like even recently I was

1954
01:12:13,198 --> 01:12:17,559
out somewhere and I smoked a half a

1955
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:19,199
joint of that and I almost got too high

1956
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:21,159
and I mean when I say too high where I'm

1957
01:12:19,198 --> 01:12:23,759
like I'm about to trip out you know it's

1958
01:12:21,158 --> 01:12:25,799
the only variety out there that makes me

1959
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:28,360
feel like that well I have way that we

1960
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:30,560
can sneak it into the world to where

1961
01:12:28,359 --> 01:12:32,839
where they don't have to see what the

1962
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:35,159
flower looks like and pre-rolls I know

1963
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:36,920
that pre pre-rolls right here I think

1964
01:12:35,158 --> 01:12:38,839
pre-rolls I've always believed in

1965
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:40,279
pre-rolls because I feel like we're

1966
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:42,239
we're in a world of convenience where

1967
01:12:40,279 --> 01:12:44,679
people want something convenient and if

1968
01:12:42,238 --> 01:12:46,439
you can take away the way that it looks

1969
01:12:44,679 --> 01:12:47,920
and you can just provide them with a

1970
01:12:46,439 --> 01:12:50,119
description of the effect and how they

1971
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:51,719
it's going to make them feel good and

1972
01:12:50,119 --> 01:12:52,719
they smoke it and they get that they're

1973
01:12:51,719 --> 01:12:53,840
going to want to they're going to

1974
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:56,600
gravitate towards that they're going to

1975
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:59,279
want to revisit that and uh I think

1976
01:12:56,600 --> 01:13:01,000
pre-rolls are the best in a lot of ways

1977
01:12:59,279 --> 01:13:02,399
I think as long as you can get them

1978
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,238
fresh and they don't sit on the shelf

1979
01:13:02,399 --> 01:13:06,559
for six months I think pre-rolls are

1980
01:13:04,238 --> 01:13:09,718
fantastic yeah they're a great way to

1981
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:13,039
Showcase sativa type flowers that may

1982
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:16,079
not look super appealing from a visual

1983
01:13:13,039 --> 01:13:18,079
standpoint but we got to get people past

1984
01:13:16,079 --> 01:13:20,279
that and you're right pre-rolls are a

1985
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:22,158
great way to get people past that they

1986
01:13:20,279 --> 01:13:23,519
can have the experience the effect and

1987
01:13:22,158 --> 01:13:25,559
then they're going to be more receptive

1988
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:28,080
to looking at the flower and thinking

1989
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:30,239
damn that's what's getting me so high

1990
01:13:28,079 --> 01:13:33,079
yeah and I hope we get to a point as a

1991
01:13:30,238 --> 01:13:34,919
culture where we look at stuff like this

1992
01:13:33,079 --> 01:13:36,840
and we're like damn I can't wait to see

1993
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:40,840
how that's going to make me feel right

1994
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:43,279
not this prejudgment of looks like

1995
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:45,159
oregano you K me I mean I think a lot of

1996
01:13:43,279 --> 01:13:47,960
people the first thing that would come

1997
01:13:45,158 --> 01:13:50,000
to mind is that that doesn't look like

1998
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:52,800
weed I mean how do you feel right now I

1999
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:55,238
feel great I feel good I feel uplifted I

2000
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:57,360
feel energetic I feel like I could go

2001
01:13:55,238 --> 01:13:59,959
exercise that's for sure but I I feel

2002
01:13:57,359 --> 01:14:01,439
great I feel like uh I smoke just the

2003
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:04,920
right amount to where we're having an

2004
01:14:01,439 --> 01:14:06,319
amazing conversation and time just I I

2005
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:08,560
feel like there's this thing and I get

2006
01:14:06,319 --> 01:14:11,238
it from micro doing mushrooms and also

2007
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:15,239
from smoking the right amount of weed of

2008
01:14:11,238 --> 01:14:17,198
the right cultivar where I don't have

2009
01:14:15,238 --> 01:14:18,879
the like there's this connection between

2010
01:14:17,198 --> 01:14:20,919
when I when I talk and when I have to

2011
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:22,920
think about stuff and it just sometimes

2012
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:24,639
flows and it'll like when I exercise I'm

2013
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:26,199
not thinking about it I'm just doing it

2014
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:29,279
and there's handful of things that can

2015
01:14:26,198 --> 01:14:30,719
get me into that that mode and and you

2016
01:14:29,279 --> 01:14:32,359
know this is definitely one of them it's

2017
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:33,800
like I feel like I could pretty much do

2018
01:14:32,359 --> 01:14:36,000
anything on this and have a great time

2019
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:37,520
doing it yeah yeah I like to tell you it

2020
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,119
just makes you feel great you know I

2021
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:41,400
mean that's really one of the I best

2022
01:14:40,119 --> 01:14:42,719
ways to describe it you know because

2023
01:14:41,399 --> 01:14:44,839
it's making you feel all these different

2024
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:46,480
ways all which are just great yeah you

2025
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:49,840
know the

2026
01:14:46,479 --> 01:14:53,279
aeno is 16 weeks unfortunately because

2027
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:55,400
it's the best one um but I recently got

2028
01:14:53,279 --> 01:14:57,158
into a new greenhouse and and we were

2029
01:14:55,399 --> 01:14:58,960
doing some planting my father-in-law was

2030
01:14:57,158 --> 01:15:00,559
there it was pretty cool like he got to

2031
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:02,840
come in and water the first set of

2032
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:04,800
transplants on a greenhouse that was

2033
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:07,000
like kind of you know first try with all

2034
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:08,560
these genetics and I smoked some of the

2035
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,760
A and I was just like D I was like

2036
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:13,039
running through the greenhouse like

2037
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:14,760
flapping my arms yeah you know I mean

2038
01:15:13,039 --> 01:15:16,800
it's like going on a Magic Carpet Ride

2039
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:18,679
you know um and it's like it takes you

2040
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:21,520
somewhere you know and and I think part

2041
01:15:18,679 --> 01:15:24,079
of what what I'm trying to do is bring

2042
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:26,440
people back to like when your uncles

2043
01:15:24,079 --> 01:15:28,840
your aunts your mom and dad used to talk

2044
01:15:26,439 --> 01:15:30,919
about smoking weed back in the 60s and

2045
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:32,600
70s and how good it made him feel you

2046
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:33,880
don't ever hear him talk about like oh I

2047
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:35,400
used to smoke all this weed and like

2048
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:37,480
fall asleep it's always like we used to

2049
01:15:35,399 --> 01:15:40,599
giggle we used to have a good time we to

2050
01:15:37,479 --> 01:15:42,359
go out and do stuff yeah for sure yeah I

2051
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:44,000
want to I want people to have that

2052
01:15:42,359 --> 01:15:46,039
experience you know and to like kind of

2053
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:48,079
take it back to that I know a lot of old

2054
01:15:46,039 --> 01:15:50,359
school people that don't smoke anymore

2055
01:15:48,079 --> 01:15:52,880
anymore because the weed is too strong

2056
01:15:50,359 --> 01:15:54,079
and uh it's strong and pro and they

2057
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:56,079
probably think it's too strong but maybe

2058
01:15:54,079 --> 01:15:57,719
it's just strong in a different way

2059
01:15:56,079 --> 01:15:59,439
maybe they like the stuff that was more

2060
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:01,359
uplifting and not the stuff that was so

2061
01:15:59,439 --> 01:16:04,039
narcotic but I think there's probably a

2062
01:16:01,359 --> 01:16:05,319
lot of Truth to that yeah and I even for

2063
01:16:04,039 --> 01:16:07,238
younger people you know it's like you

2064
01:16:05,319 --> 01:16:09,319
may say oh like my grandpa used to smoke

2065
01:16:07,238 --> 01:16:11,879
that [ __ ] back in the day and it's like

2066
01:16:09,319 --> 01:16:14,279
for good reason and I think it's also

2067
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:17,000
going to be appealing to Young

2068
01:16:14,279 --> 01:16:19,800
professionals young Entre entrepreneurs

2069
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Athletic kids I mean I have uh of a

2070
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:23,960
family member they're Engineers they

2071
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,960

2072
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:27,639

2075
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:34,359
20s early 30s yeah so I think it's going

2076
01:16:32,198 --> 01:16:36,119
to go past like oh this is like you know

2077
01:16:34,359 --> 01:16:38,158
this is my father-in-law on the shirt

2078
01:16:36,119 --> 01:16:40,679
Tony budo it's kind of an old school

2079
01:16:38,158 --> 01:16:43,399

01:16:49,119 --> 01:16:52,760
of generations and be like dude my great

2085
01:16:51,119 --> 01:16:54,359
grandparents were smoking on that [ __ ]

2086
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:57,119
that made them feel good and then all of

2087
01:16:54,359 --> 01:16:58,559
a sudden this like weird like Divergence

2088
01:16:57,119 --> 01:17:00,800
came and people kind of like took this

2089
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:02,320
Sid step like you know who Tom Hill is

2090
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:04,360
of course good friend of my

2091
01:17:02,319 --> 01:17:07,519
father-in-law and he sent me a message

2092
01:17:04,359 --> 01:17:09,839
one day um and he was just like yo he's

2093
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:12,800
like Tony Tony got off track with those

2094
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:14,639
OG ladies you know um and and now he's

2095
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:17,560
kind of like back on track and like for

2096
01:17:14,639 --> 01:17:19,239
the record Tony never fell off he just

2097
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:21,400
maybe went a little bit more of a

2098
01:17:19,238 --> 01:17:23,559
direction than Tom did yeah in like

2099
01:17:21,399 --> 01:17:25,359
sticking with these crazy 20 weers and

2100
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:27,840
so I feel like it's going to be comes

2101
01:17:25,359 --> 01:17:29,679
something that's appealing to everybody

2102
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:31,840
because the effect the way it makes you

2103
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:35,000
feel the creativity the problem solving

2104
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:36,920
aspects the performance enhancing um I

2105
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,520
mean the Band-Aid Haze is a great

2106
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:40,199
anti-depressant like I just heard

2107
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:42,840
somebody talking recently about like

2108
01:17:40,198 --> 01:17:44,839
there's no medicine yeah anymore the

2109
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:46,560
Band-Aid Haze is an anti-depressant dude

2110
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:48,719
if you were get that you memory recall

2111
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:50,320
is what I was trying to think of but I

2112
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:51,480
like the memory recall aspect of it

2113
01:17:50,319 --> 01:17:54,399
because then you don't have to think you

2114
01:17:51,479 --> 01:17:55,638
can just flow and that flow you know it

2115
01:17:54,399 --> 01:17:57,638
makes you feel comfortable when you're

2116
01:17:55,639 --> 01:17:59,639
in conversations a lot and and stuff

2117
01:17:57,639 --> 01:18:01,560
like that I feel like there's so many

2118
01:17:59,639 --> 01:18:03,239
benefits to it and somebody said that

2119
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:04,679
the other day one of my buddies I think

2120
01:18:03,238 --> 01:18:07,599
Danny was smoking he was just like you

2121
01:18:04,679 --> 01:18:10,359
know I don't forget as much yeah and I

2122
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:12,199
was like a light went off because I've

2123
01:18:10,359 --> 01:18:14,839
been on this sativa kick for a couple

2124
01:18:12,198 --> 01:18:18,000
years now like really only smoking long

2125
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:19,880
fling varieties right and like I said a

2126
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,800
light went off I was like when I smoke

2127
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:24,840
even the sour I'm forgetting all kinds

2128
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:26,639
of stuff like my homie Danny from GW he

2129
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:28,319
every time he's just like I feel focused

2130
01:18:26,639 --> 01:18:29,719
he's like he's like I'm dangerous with

2131
01:18:28,319 --> 01:18:32,119
this weed he's like I feel like I could

2132
01:18:29,719 --> 01:18:34,158
do anything I have a laser sharp Clarity

2133
01:18:32,119 --> 01:18:37,198
yeah and it made me realize that my

2134
01:18:34,158 --> 01:18:39,238
memory recall has gotten better with

2135
01:18:37,198 --> 01:18:40,799
smoking these types of varieties so I

2136
01:18:39,238 --> 01:18:43,678
really believe people will find that

2137
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:45,639
there's a lot of benefits to it not just

2138
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:47,920
the how long the high get you know lasts

2139
01:18:45,639 --> 01:18:50,039
for how high it gets you but there's all

2140
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:52,840
these psychological factors that go into

2141
01:18:50,039 --> 01:18:55,039
it right that went harnessed the tech

2142
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:56,800
world is going to be like yo we want you

2143
01:18:55,039 --> 01:18:59,039

2144
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:01,199
this hay [ __ ] from budo because it's

2145
01:18:59,039 --> 01:19:03,880
like the two ends of the like Focus

2146
01:19:01,198 --> 01:19:06,719

2147

that PE like some of the biggest

2149
01:19:08,158 --> 01:19:11,759
companies in the world I me even Steve

2150
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:13,840
Jobs has reported to have kind of gotten

2151
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:15,719
a lot of these ideas for Apple after

2152
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:17,840
tripping on l a few times you know and I

2153
01:19:15,719 --> 01:19:20,359
could totally see it for sure you know

2154
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:22,480
Visionary yeah I mean and that can open

2155
01:19:20,359 --> 01:19:24,198
up parts of your brain that you didn't

2156
01:19:22,479 --> 01:19:25,879
have open before for sure and give you

2157
01:19:24,198 --> 01:19:27,759
perspective and I mean life is all about

2158
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:29,400
perspective anyway feel like we have

2159
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:32,719
these lenses that go over our eyes every

2160
01:19:29,399 --> 01:19:34,799
time we experience anything uh and

2161
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:36,480
everything and to be able to pull some

2162
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:37,679
of those lenses off and to see the world

2163
01:19:36,479 --> 01:19:41,198
from a different

2164
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:44,119
perspective really puts the the grander

2165
01:19:41,198 --> 01:19:46,439
scheme and all these other things into

2166
01:19:44,119 --> 01:19:47,800
perspective um you know I feel like it's

2167
01:19:46,439 --> 01:19:49,119
it's always great to see something from

2168
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:51,079
a different perspective and some people

2169
01:19:49,119 --> 01:19:52,760
just do it naturally and other people

2170
01:19:51,079 --> 01:19:55,479
they need they need that assistance

2171
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:57,199
whether it's l or whether it's smoking a

2172
01:19:55,479 --> 01:19:59,158
little bit of really good stuff or

2173
01:19:57,198 --> 01:20:01,119
whatever yeah and you can get that with

2174
01:19:59,158 --> 01:20:02,359
anything you know I'm I'm real heavy on

2175
01:20:01,119 --> 01:20:04,800
the long flowering stuff because that's

2176
01:20:02,359 --> 01:20:07,559
what I like you know it's like it's like

2177
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:10,520
Tony says you know it's all good just

2178
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:12,719
different you know I believe that even

2179
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:15,080
like the the worst grown weed you could

2180
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:16,719
ever imagine like sprayed with with the

2181
01:20:15,079 --> 01:20:19,319
worst chemicals the most dangerous

2182
01:20:16,719 --> 01:20:21,158
harmful chemicals can still save and

2183
01:20:19,319 --> 01:20:24,079
change somebody's life so I'm not

2184
01:20:21,158 --> 01:20:27,279
promoting to grow anything like that but

2185
01:20:24,079 --> 01:20:29,439
I believe plant is so powerful that even

2186
01:20:27,279 --> 01:20:32,679
if you try and make it into this toxic

2187
01:20:29,439 --> 01:20:34,839
thing yeah it has this innate ability to

2188
01:20:32,679 --> 01:20:37,440
bring out the good in it itself and

2189
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:38,840
reveal to you something that is amazing

2190
01:20:37,439 --> 01:20:40,519
out of something that somebody else

2191
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:42,239
didn't give a [ __ ] about and was

2192
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:44,159
treating as a dollar sign to the extent

2193
01:20:42,238 --> 01:20:46,799
that they were willing we used to smoke

2194
01:20:44,158 --> 01:20:48,839
Mexican a lot of that Mexican brick weed

2195
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:49,719
you know and that still had its I mean

2196
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:51,800
it would give you a headache if you

2197
01:20:49,719 --> 01:20:53,480
smoke too much but it still had a spin

2198
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:55,159
but that was really good weed just not

2199
01:20:53,479 --> 01:20:56,718
cured in process really

2200
01:20:55,158 --> 01:20:59,479
you know Mexican weed is some of the

2201
01:20:56,719 --> 01:21:01,800
like the strongest weed out there and

2202
01:20:59,479 --> 01:21:04,119
you get a good batch of Mexican in

2203
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:06,600
Mexico right off the vine like we do

2204
01:21:04,119 --> 01:21:07,920
everywhere else in the world yeah I mean

2205
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:10,679
you know like the pearls we put the

2206
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:12,440
pearls in somewhat of a a loose brick

2207
01:21:10,679 --> 01:21:14,719
yeah you know it's like highgrade brick

2208
01:21:12,439 --> 01:21:17,000
weed yeah you know somebody could really

2209
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:19,079
say that and I mean when I look at it

2210
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,880
first time I was just like what the [ __ ]

2211

2222
01:21:42,198 --> 01:21:48,559
and potential I mean I I feel like I I'm

2223
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:51,679
a I'm in it for the long game and I

2224
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:53,199
realize how much is actually ahead of me

2225
01:21:51,679 --> 01:21:54,600
with the rest of my life to be able to

2226
01:21:53,198 --> 01:21:58,678
do some of this stuff and it really

2227
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:59,880
really is a a a commitment to the plant

2228
01:21:58,679 --> 01:22:01,960
a commitment to yourself and a

2229
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:03,960
commitment to the plant and it's

2230
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:05,560
something that takes a lifetime right a

2231
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:06,840
lot of this stuff we talk about what we

2232
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:09,480
can do in five years and that's great

2233
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:11,560
but like to really make a difference it

2234
01:22:09,479 --> 01:22:13,399
could take a lifetime this is a

2235
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:14,840
lifetimes worth of searching for Tony

2236
01:22:13,399 --> 01:22:16,479
yeah and now he's made a difference in

2237
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:17,840
my life and it's made difference in

2238
01:22:16,479 --> 01:22:19,479
other people's lives and he didn't breed

2239
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:22,000
this right he just stumbled upon it from

2240
01:22:19,479 --> 01:22:23,519
the sea that he pop but you know but

2241
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:25,359
we're all in the shoulders of giants at

2242
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:27,840
the same time including ining him right

2243
01:22:25,359 --> 01:22:31,319
so somebody else did some work he found

2244
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:32,880
it now you have the opportunity to

2245
01:22:31,319 --> 01:22:34,559
really be able to pass this on to

2246
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:36,840
somebody else someday and I feel like

2247
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:39,880
that's the beauty of the plant it is you

2248
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:43,039
know and I feel like for me I always

2249
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:44,560
like to share you know I I had my first

2250
01:22:43,039 --> 01:22:47,279
my first PL I harvested because I

2251
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:50,039
couldn't afford to buy wheed yeah and

2252
01:22:47,279 --> 01:22:51,519
so hey got some weed cool shared it with

2253
01:22:50,039 --> 01:22:53,439
my friends and then you know I kind of

2254
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:54,719
continued to grow and I found that that

2255
01:22:53,439 --> 01:22:57,519
was one of the things that I really

2256
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:59,600
enjoyed was sharing herb yeah because I

2257
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:01,600
knew how profound of an effect it could

2258
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:03,639
have on somebody's life so I knew that

2259
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:05,719
if I could give enough weed to one

2260
01:23:03,639 --> 01:23:07,840
person yeah that weed would end up in

2261
01:23:05,719 --> 01:23:11,198
two or three people's hands yeah so I

2262
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:13,159
could affect a few people with one share

2263
01:23:11,198 --> 01:23:15,279
and then now we get the person that I

2264
01:23:13,158 --> 01:23:16,879
shared it with is having an experience

2265
01:23:15,279 --> 01:23:19,279
with the next person down the line so

2266
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:21,279
you talk about like five six maybe 10

2267
01:23:19,279 --> 01:23:22,759
people having hopefully a positive

2268
01:23:21,279 --> 01:23:25,119
experience off of the few nugs that I

2269
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:26,679
shared with them right and to me

2270
01:23:25,119 --> 01:23:28,439
that is like if you're going to be

2271
01:23:26,679 --> 01:23:30,119
growing a lot of herb and you're doing

2272
01:23:28,439 --> 01:23:32,198
it as a living please give them some

2273
01:23:30,119 --> 01:23:34,039
Away share it with other people that

2274
01:23:32,198 --> 01:23:36,519
don't have a lot of it share it with

2275
01:23:34,039 --> 01:23:39,000
your friends that maybe have a tighter

2276
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:40,920
budget you know um share it with people

2277
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,639
that need it and and get into their

2278
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:44,279
hands and I feel like that has been

2279
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:46,039
something that I've really enjoyed out

2280
01:23:44,279 --> 01:23:49,679
of all of it is being able to share I

2281
01:23:46,039 --> 01:23:51,238
agree and I feel like when like like for

2282
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:53,800
me from a breeding perspective like

2283
01:23:51,238 --> 01:23:55,359
where I've taken and crossed two things

2284
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:57,480
whether I created the parents or not but

2285
01:23:55,359 --> 01:23:59,119
where I've crossed two things I've grown

2286
01:23:57,479 --> 01:24:00,279
that out I have the finished product and

2287
01:23:59,119 --> 01:24:02,198
I'm able to share it with people it's

2288
01:24:00,279 --> 01:24:03,840
like you're sharing part of yourself

2289
01:24:02,198 --> 01:24:04,799
right and that's that's the beauty and

2290
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:07,039
they're like you know and they're

2291
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:08,719
getting to experience a part of you

2292
01:24:07,039 --> 01:24:10,639
right and then when I get other people

2293
01:24:08,719 --> 01:24:11,960
that grow out my seeds there's just

2294
01:24:10,639 --> 01:24:14,239
another amazing feeling where you're

2295
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:16,520
like I got to smoke some of my flour

2296
01:24:14,238 --> 01:24:19,279
that somebody else imparted part of them

2297
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:21,000
into and you know I'm that's why the

2298
01:24:19,279 --> 01:24:23,880
plan is so beautiful because it all it

2299
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:25,520
brings us together in such a unique way

2300
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:26,960
you know food can bring us together in a

2301
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:29,080
great way too if you're a chef you cook

2302
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:31,000
some stuff or if you grew vegetables

2303
01:24:29,079 --> 01:24:33,198
it's kind of similar but it's really

2304
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:36,479
amazing like the full circle that goes

2305
01:24:33,198 --> 01:24:38,678
on with cannabis yeah there's a lot of

2306
01:24:36,479 --> 01:24:41,158
amazing totally different things that

2307
01:24:38,679 --> 01:24:45,079
stem from the one interaction I mean

2308
01:24:41,158 --> 01:24:47,198
like with the sour you know um the chem

2309
01:24:45,079 --> 01:24:48,880
you know that one interaction or maybe

2310
01:24:47,198 --> 01:24:50,479
whatever however many few interactions

2311
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:51,800
it was we talk about the butterfly

2312
01:24:50,479 --> 01:24:54,039
effect you know what I mean and that

2313
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:56,239
like that one interaction had it not

2314
01:24:54,039 --> 01:25:01,118
happened like that who knows where it'd

2315
01:24:56,238 --> 01:25:03,799
be with you you know and all these these

2316
01:25:01,118 --> 01:25:05,920
amazing coincidences potentially I guess

2317
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:07,600
we can call them but like it depends on

2318
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:09,560
how you look at life too well it's like

2319
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:14,440
when we met you know I had recognized

2320
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:16,840
you and uh I had no intentions yeah when

2321
01:25:14,439 --> 01:25:19,799
I approached you other than like I know

2322
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:21,639
you like weed yeah and we had a

2323
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:24,840
conversation and and it kind of led us

2324
01:25:21,639 --> 01:25:26,880
to this you know um and so so I think

2325
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:28,920
there's that type of opportunity with

2326
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:31,639
every conversation and I've been seeing

2327
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:33,639
that a lot lately um because I set out

2328
01:25:31,639 --> 01:25:35,920
on this journey to bring these long

2329
01:25:33,639 --> 01:25:37,279
flowering varieties to the market 12

2330
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:38,399
years ago when I first met my

2331
01:25:37,279 --> 01:25:40,000
father-in-law and I was like dude this

2332
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:42,839
is the only way to do it you can't do it

2333
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:45,719
indoor even though we both now have now

2334
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:47,239
it's been you know really recent that

2335
01:25:45,719 --> 01:25:48,480
I've kind of like really put it out

2336
01:25:47,238 --> 01:25:50,839
there that this is what I'm doing this

2337
01:25:48,479 --> 01:25:52,839
is who I am this is what I'm all about

2338
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:55,560
and I don't know if it's because I've

2339
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:57,319
been preparing for so many years you

2340
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:59,400
know like on a I mean I worked on the

2341
01:25:57,319 --> 01:26:01,519
name of the company for two and a half

2342
01:25:59,399 --> 01:26:04,319
years you know I got a trade mic lawyer

2343
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:07,560
and he was just like he said yes to this

2344
01:26:04,319 --> 01:26:10,319
one and no to the other ones and so

2345
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:11,520
because you can protect it right and you

2346
01:26:10,319 --> 01:26:13,399
know other people might say oh that's a

2347
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:14,880
waste of money X Y and Z but I'm not

2348
01:26:13,399 --> 01:26:17,039
going to let anybody tell me that I

2349
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:19,000
can't use this I probably I don't give a

2350
01:26:17,039 --> 01:26:20,238
[ __ ] somebody tries to use my name like

2351
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:22,319
everybody's going to know who the real

2352
01:26:20,238 --> 01:26:23,678
budo is that's my father-in-law Tony

2353
01:26:22,319 --> 01:26:25,479
that's who this is all about but this is

2354
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:26,679
the brand that started together but

2355
01:26:25,479 --> 01:26:28,118
nobody else is going to tell me I don't

2356
01:26:26,679 --> 01:26:29,279
have the right to use this word and

2357
01:26:28,118 --> 01:26:31,799
that's a powerful thing when we're

2358
01:26:29,279 --> 01:26:34,479
talking about protecting our genetics

2359
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:36,880
you know because the uh the loss of

2360
01:26:34,479 --> 01:26:39,000
ability to operate could put a business

2361
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:40,679
out of business yeah and so if you have

2362
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:44,439
genetics that you are holding that are

2363
01:26:40,679 --> 01:26:46,719
special to you or need to be saved your

2364
01:26:44,439 --> 01:26:48,678
loss of ability to operate can now make

2365
01:26:46,719 --> 01:26:50,840
all that disappear and we've all spent a

2366
01:26:48,679 --> 01:26:53,000
lifetime building up whatever we've

2367
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:55,039
built up and I'm not going to let

2368
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,560
anybody or anything

2369
01:26:55,039 --> 01:26:58,840
jeopardize that you know my wife's a

2370
01:26:56,560 --> 01:27:00,440
weed attorney she's like here's your box

2371
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:02,920
don't go outside of it if you go outside

2372
01:27:00,439 --> 01:27:04,319
of that box we're liable to ask for

2373
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:06,639
trouble great having a lawyer in the

2374
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:08,399
family it is man it's funny though

2375
01:27:06,639 --> 01:27:09,719
because in the 215 days like when we got

2376
01:27:08,399 --> 01:27:11,319
together I was like oh everybody's like

2377

2378

01:27:12,679 --> 01:27:16,279
thought I was going to be able to do

2380
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:18,320
whatever I wanted yeah it was the exact

2381
01:27:16,279 --> 01:27:20,079
opposite she was just like well if you

2382
01:27:18,319 --> 01:27:23,000
do it like this then when you go to

2383
01:27:20,079 --> 01:27:24,920
court then I can cover your ass but if

2384
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:26,639
you don't then here's going to be our

2385
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:28,000
problem so I just looked at it like this

2386
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:29,600
is kind of a common sensing if I'm going

2387
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,760
to be doing it I might as well do it in

2388
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:33,840
a way and she has an amazing track

2389
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:36,119
record for getting people out of trouble

2390
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:38,039
even people that hadn't kind of followed

2391
01:27:36,118 --> 01:27:39,559
the guidelines I mean she's gotten

2392
01:27:38,039 --> 01:27:41,560
pretty much every time she's had a case

2393
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:44,520
like it's gone in the client's favor you

2394
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:46,080
know um so I was like I better just take

2395
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:47,760
if there's one thing I've learned listen

2396
01:27:46,079 --> 01:27:49,198
to your lawyer take your lawyer's advice

2397
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:50,800
like whatever they tell you to do

2398
01:27:49,198 --> 01:27:51,839
they're if they're a good one they're

2399
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:53,679
just trying to look after and you

2400
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:55,360
protect you so yeah I was like oh I

2401
01:27:53,679 --> 01:27:59,319
can't do all this crazy stuff that kind

2402
01:27:55,359 --> 01:28:00,920
of sucks but it kept me in line it

2403
01:27:59,319 --> 01:28:02,920
probably prohibited me from doing a lot

2404
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:05,158
of stupid stuff right and it gave you

2405
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:07,880
guidelines to operate by that that made

2406
01:28:05,158 --> 01:28:09,599
sense for everybody and now I'm an

2407
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:11,520
expert Court witness so it kind of like

2408
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:14,000
comes full circle of like understanding

2409
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:15,760
these things being like you know knowing

2410
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:17,319
laws being able to interpret them and

2411
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:20,239
just you know kind of being a little bit

2412
01:28:17,319 --> 01:28:23,359
in that world also right um so yeah it's

2413
01:28:20,238 --> 01:28:25,000
it's definitely been a crazy Journey um

2414
01:28:23,359 --> 01:28:27,158
but I think really really from a

2415
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:29,399
breeding standpoint you know the AF or

2416
01:28:27,158 --> 01:28:31,359
the Bubba cush original Haze it's a

2417
01:28:29,399 --> 01:28:34,000
great hybrid you know it's a real solid

2418
01:28:31,359 --> 01:28:35,960
50/50 and so being able to take those

2419
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,880
things and match them up with something

2420
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:39,719
new that's where there's going to be

2421
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:42,639
some really awesome magic and we're

2422
01:28:39,719 --> 01:28:45,239
going to see some really good

2423
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:47,239
traditional looking weed that has a

2424
01:28:45,238 --> 01:28:49,959
totally different profile and maybe we

2425
01:28:47,238 --> 01:28:52,399
can get out of this predominant turp

2426
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:54,960
this dominant gene that keeps on

2427
01:28:52,399 --> 01:28:56,839
infiltrating all the different crosses

2428
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:59,600
and get some other stuff in there and

2429
01:28:56,840 --> 01:29:01,560
kind of start a new chapter in like okay

2430
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:03,320
well we we got it to tweak a little bit

2431
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:05,199
and now it's like when the cookies hit

2432
01:29:03,319 --> 01:29:07,479
they hit a profile that nobody had

2433
01:29:05,198 --> 01:29:09,479
really ever seen yeah and so it like it

2434
01:29:07,479 --> 01:29:11,118
changed a lot of stuff and it and it and

2435
01:29:09,479 --> 01:29:12,559
it took everything in a totally

2436
01:29:11,118 --> 01:29:14,719
different direction right you know and

2437
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:17,639
we're going to see that happen time and

2438
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:19,079
time again it's just when you know how

2439
01:29:17,639 --> 01:29:21,400
many times it's going to repeat itself

2440
01:29:19,079 --> 01:29:22,920
in every 10 years I mean we're on

2441
01:29:21,399 --> 01:29:25,319
thousands of years of this cannabis

2442
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:28,880
stuff you know and in the last 30 years

2443
01:29:25,319 --> 01:29:31,840
we've had a handful of those OG sour

2444
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:34,239
cookies train wreck you know those types

2445
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:36,880
of things that have left a longlasting

2446
01:29:34,238 --> 01:29:38,359
impression with all of the generations

2447
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:40,359
right all the generations know cookie

2448
01:29:38,359 --> 01:29:42,920
sour and train wre you know so it's

2449
01:29:40,359 --> 01:29:44,920
going to change again and people like

2450
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:46,440
you like my father-in-law that have been

2451
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:48,800
you know going this direction that

2452
01:29:46,439 --> 01:29:50,799
direction when we kind of come together

2453
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:53,000
and we fuse those two

2454
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:56,079
together that's where the Magic's at you

2455
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:58,679
know yeah there's potential for some

2456
01:29:56,079 --> 01:30:02,279
really cool things to happen you I feel

2457
01:29:58,679 --> 01:30:05,039
like the the more the more people you

2458
01:30:02,279 --> 01:30:07,118
have that are skilled and are really

2459
01:30:05,039 --> 01:30:09,079
strong with their skill set that's

2460
01:30:07,118 --> 01:30:10,839
different from the other partner skill

2461
01:30:09,079 --> 01:30:13,760
set or the other people it always

2462
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:15,760
complements the group and I feel like

2463
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:17,360
especially two people going two

2464
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:18,719
directions if you can put two people

2465
01:30:17,359 --> 01:30:20,399
going two different directions that are

2466
01:30:18,719 --> 01:30:22,359
on the same path and you have those

2467
01:30:20,399 --> 01:30:24,519
Collide then you have this amazing

2468
01:30:22,359 --> 01:30:26,079
opportunity for really cool things to

2469
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:27,520
happen yeah that was kind of like when I

2470
01:30:26,079 --> 01:30:30,000
was growing the sour you know my buddy

2471
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:32,679
was doing it more you know synthetic I

2472
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,880
was doing it more organic yeah and we

2473
01:30:32,679 --> 01:30:37,760
were growing other stuff at the same

2474
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:39,118
time but he had a spot I had a spot he

2475
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:41,440
had another spot I had another spot we

2476
01:30:39,118 --> 01:30:43,079
had a spot together so we had five spots

2477
01:30:41,439 --> 01:30:44,158
and we were just like and we saw we were

2478
01:30:43,079 --> 01:30:45,079
at each other's house all the time we

2479
01:30:44,158 --> 01:30:47,279
were at each other's spots we were

2480
01:30:45,079 --> 01:30:49,238
helping each other out and so we didn't

2481
01:30:47,279 --> 01:30:50,519
even get a chance to include the ego

2482
01:30:49,238 --> 01:30:52,479
because it was just like we see what's

2483
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:54,360
going on at each spot and really we both

2484
01:30:52,479 --> 01:30:58,000
just wanted good weed right but it

2485
01:30:54,359 --> 01:31:00,759
allowed us to really like see the

2486
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:02,840
differences you know so we knew that the

2487
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:04,480
way that he was growing the sour was

2488
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:06,520
different in a way that I was growing

2489
01:31:04,479 --> 01:31:08,638
the sour and we both liked the way that

2490
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:11,360
that I was doing it and I grew the sour

2491
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:14,440
for long enough over and over and over

2492
01:31:11,359 --> 01:31:15,880
to learn how to grow weed in general and

2493
01:31:14,439 --> 01:31:17,319
that's would be my advice to anybody

2494
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:19,319
that's just starting out just take one

2495
01:31:17,319 --> 01:31:21,679
genetic and grow it 10 times because

2496
01:31:19,319 --> 01:31:23,920
you're going to be able to identify a

2497
01:31:21,679 --> 01:31:25,399
nutrient deficiency after those mult

2498
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:27,239
multiple times of growing it as opposed

2499
01:31:25,399 --> 01:31:29,279
to well maybe what you're seeing in

2500
01:31:27,238 --> 01:31:31,319
another plant isn't a nutrient

2501
01:31:29,279 --> 01:31:34,439
deficiency maybe that's its signal for

2502
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:36,279
over or underwatering or X Y or Z so if

2503
01:31:34,439 --> 01:31:38,559
you really want to be good at growing

2504
01:31:36,279 --> 01:31:40,439
grow the same plant for a couple years

2505
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:43,440
and try and harvest it as many times as

2506
01:31:40,439 --> 01:31:45,238
you can yeah I grew the sour still I

2507
01:31:43,439 --> 01:31:47,479
mean I've been growing it since 2001 so

2508
01:31:45,238 --> 01:31:50,599
we're on 23

2509
01:31:47,479 --> 01:31:53,238
years that I've been trying to like play

2510
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:55,199
with it and it's pretty amazing you know

2511
01:31:53,238 --> 01:31:56,839
it's pretty amazing that long with the

2512
01:31:55,198 --> 01:31:58,399
same thing I mean I've lost the hour six

2513
01:31:56,840 --> 01:32:02,159
times and had to go back up to

2514
01:31:58,399 --> 01:32:04,759
Washington to my family up there and get

2515
01:32:02,158 --> 01:32:07,359
it back six different times because we

2516
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:09,400
had a hard time keeping stuff alive yeah

2517
01:32:07,359 --> 01:32:12,519
I've gone to Great Lengths to keep it

2518
01:32:09,399 --> 01:32:16,359
around um I've really put trust in a few

2519
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:18,080
people to keep it around um you know I

2520
01:32:16,359 --> 01:32:21,039
would call my buddy every six months and

2521
01:32:18,079 --> 01:32:22,639
be like do you still have it and I would

2522
01:32:21,039 --> 01:32:25,238
for a couple of days I would start to

2523
01:32:22,639 --> 01:32:27,039
stress really really hard when it was

2524
01:32:25,238 --> 01:32:29,079
out of my possession

2525
01:32:27,039 --> 01:32:31,319
because at a certain point people just

2526
01:32:29,079 --> 01:32:32,719
stopped growing it you know um that's

2527
01:32:31,319 --> 01:32:34,559
what happened in Washington eventually

2528
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:36,880
they stopped growing it right that's why

2529
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:38,320
I don't have that exact sourer cutmore

2530
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:39,639
and so I would get really stressed I'd

2531
01:32:38,319 --> 01:32:41,960
call my buddy all right cool you got it

2532
01:32:39,639 --> 01:32:43,679
and then it was like as soon it was like

2533
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:45,079
the day that I could get it back in my

2534
01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:47,880
possession and I could do it without

2535
01:32:45,079 --> 01:32:49,840
having a landlord messing anything up

2536
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:52,199
boom I was like I need that back and

2537
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:54,039
then I started growing it under LEDs and

2538
01:32:52,198 --> 01:32:57,158
it was not the sour that I remember from

2539
01:32:54,039 --> 01:33:00,560
the HPS that all my homies had grown the

2540
01:32:57,158 --> 01:33:02,679
outdoor I had grown um and so I gave up

2541
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:04,400
on it I like literally and that was

2542
01:33:02,679 --> 01:33:05,600
honestly was interesting time me though

2543
01:33:04,399 --> 01:33:07,319
that was about the time I started

2544
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:09,520
growing the hazes and the long flowering

2545
01:33:07,319 --> 01:33:11,279
stuff it kind of like filled that void

2546
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:13,679
for me because I would have been jazzed

2547
01:33:11,279 --> 01:33:15,079
for like four or five years I was like

2548
01:33:13,679 --> 01:33:16,760
you know I finally get my chance to grow

2549
01:33:15,079 --> 01:33:18,639
the sour again it didn't come out that

2550
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:20,520
great and I was like man I was bummed

2551
01:33:18,639 --> 01:33:22,400
you know this is something that like you

2552
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:24,239
know people used to call me Diesel Dave

2553
01:33:22,399 --> 01:33:27,198
when I would like take into this one to

2554
01:33:24,238 --> 01:33:29,279
you know um and I had this like really

2555
01:33:27,198 --> 01:33:31,799
strong connection with the plant and I

2556
01:33:29,279 --> 01:33:33,800
was really let down and then I gave it

2557
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:37,360
to a buddy and he grew it out last year

2558
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:39,440
Outdoors out in Mendo and I was like yes

2559
01:33:37,359 --> 01:33:43,158
it still has it like you know because

2560
01:33:39,439 --> 01:33:46,039
you what you smelled what I what I knew

2561
01:33:43,158 --> 01:33:48,759
you were going to smell was very

2562
01:33:46,039 --> 01:33:50,560
particular yeah and when you smell that

2563
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:52,119
you're just like f yeah it's there I got

2564
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:54,199
it exact you know and when it's not

2565
01:33:52,118 --> 01:33:57,359
there you're just kind of like it's like

2566
01:33:54,198 --> 01:33:59,719
I was a serious bummer yeah um and so I

2567
01:33:57,359 --> 01:34:00,920
saw it last year and I was like cuz I

2568
01:33:59,719 --> 01:34:02,760
hadn't grown it for like five years

2569
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:05,039
myself and i' given it to a few people

2570
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:06,440
that had tried it out um you know some

2571
01:34:05,039 --> 01:34:07,880
of my friends that had seen it grow when

2572
01:34:06,439 --> 01:34:09,399
I was growing down in Santa Cruz and so

2573
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:11,639
I was like all right I'm G to try it

2574
01:34:09,399 --> 01:34:13,359
again and uh you know thankfully it came

2575
01:34:11,639 --> 01:34:15,118
out good enough to run a second time and

2576
01:34:13,359 --> 01:34:17,439
now I'm definitely gonna be running

2577
01:34:15,118 --> 01:34:19,359
quite a bit more of it as I kind of get

2578
01:34:17,439 --> 01:34:22,919
back into the swing of things it's funny

2579
01:34:19,359 --> 01:34:25,000
because with sour before I saw your sour

2580
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:27,600
I was kind of second guessing my own

2581
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:29,198
memory and and thinking did I really

2582
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:31,199
remember it right because so many people

2583
01:34:29,198 --> 01:34:32,719
have been giving me sour I got some from

2584
01:34:31,198 --> 01:34:34,960
some really reputable people that have

2585
01:34:32,719 --> 01:34:37,079
been on the show that gave me you know

2586
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:39,880
nice flow but not the sour that I

2587
01:34:37,079 --> 01:34:42,279
remember so in my the back of my mind

2588
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:45,199
for the last at least the last year I've

2589
01:34:42,279 --> 01:34:47,559
been like was my mind playing tricks on

2590
01:34:45,198 --> 01:34:49,198
me right and turns out obviously it

2591
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:50,840
wasn't but it's great having that

2592
01:34:49,198 --> 01:34:52,359
reinforcement because there's things

2593
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:53,880
like cat piss that I haven't seen in so

2594
01:34:52,359 --> 01:34:56,158
long and I believe that's probably still

2595
01:34:53,880 --> 01:34:57,840
out there with the right person I just

2596
01:34:56,158 --> 01:34:59,158
haven't found the cat piss that I

2597
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:01,000
remember there's a lot of people with

2598
01:34:59,158 --> 01:35:02,519
cat piss but it's not necessarily the

2599
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:04,279
cat piss that I remember and maybe it's

2600
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:06,199
named something different exactly or

2601
01:35:04,279 --> 01:35:08,399
maybe it was never ciss but it has that

2602
01:35:06,198 --> 01:35:10,599
same turp Pro profile because there's

2603
01:35:08,399 --> 01:35:13,118
been a few varieties like um that

2604
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:15,639
Skittles you showed me the Mango Kush

2605
01:35:13,118 --> 01:35:18,238
and the sour banana sherbet all have

2606
01:35:15,639 --> 01:35:20,400
that similar kind of dominant turp right

2607
01:35:18,238 --> 01:35:22,559
three different names um you know

2608
01:35:20,399 --> 01:35:24,519
there's another some other genetics out

2609
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:28,000
there uh

2610
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:30,760
that it's the root beer from mean jeene

2611
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:34,158
um I oddly enough within a few month

2612
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:36,239
time frame saw two other genetics

2613
01:35:34,158 --> 01:35:38,839
totally unrelated some of them from out

2614
01:35:36,238 --> 01:35:40,279
of the state that have that same profile

2615
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:41,760
wow you know from people that didn't

2616
01:35:40,279 --> 01:35:44,319
even know each other or didn't even know

2617
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:45,760
that there was multiple varieties of

2618
01:35:44,319 --> 01:35:47,279
herb out there that had that same tur

2619
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:48,719
profile yeah I really like the black

2620
01:35:47,279 --> 01:35:52,198
lime reserve the number three and the

2621
01:35:48,719 --> 01:35:54,079
number five from Jackson yeah mean jeene

2622
01:35:52,198 --> 01:35:55,759
freeorn gotta love the the Freeborn

2623
01:35:54,079 --> 01:35:57,319
stuff he's one of my favorite breeders

2624
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:59,679
yeah he's awesome let's smoke some of

2625
01:35:57,319 --> 01:36:01,359
this sour before yeah so you brought a

2626
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:03,279
little present right here in this paper

2627
01:36:01,359 --> 01:36:08,319
bag yeah it's really

2628
01:36:03,279 --> 01:36:09,279
fresh um but you know um I didn't know I

2629
01:36:08,319 --> 01:36:10,719
love it this is a little different

2630
01:36:09,279 --> 01:36:13,599
structure than the last

2631
01:36:10,719 --> 01:36:16,039
stuff but this is real Sour like this is

2632
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:18,960
even better of a nose than last time

2633
01:36:16,039 --> 01:36:21,118
like that is and it's a little denser um

2634
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:23,239
and it's not really this maybe the other

2635
01:36:21,118 --> 01:36:26,839
buds are different but it's not foxed

2636
01:36:23,238 --> 01:36:29,319
quite Fox tailed as the last so I'm

2637
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:31,159
going to be I'm gonna be honest in an

2638
01:36:29,319 --> 01:36:32,719
attempt to hope that someone else

2639
01:36:31,158 --> 01:36:34,759
doesn't make a similar mistake that I

2640
01:36:32,719 --> 01:36:37,840
did and I'm not going to go into a lot

2641
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:40,119
of the details but the last batch had a

2642
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:43,159
lot of pottassium yeah and what I

2643
01:36:40,118 --> 01:36:45,079
learned about potassium too late is that

2644
01:36:43,158 --> 01:36:48,238
it can have some negative effects on bud

2645
01:36:45,079 --> 01:36:50,639
formation yeah and so that last round

2646
01:36:48,238 --> 01:36:53,118
really didn't like fill out or do what

2647
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:55,159
it normally does it was like totally

2648
01:36:53,118 --> 01:36:56,880
weird so that one is a little bit more

2649
01:36:55,158 --> 01:36:59,279
representative of the typical bud

2650
01:36:56,880 --> 01:37:01,239
structure yeah um you know those ones

2651
01:36:59,279 --> 01:37:03,118
got bigger you know they kind of get

2652
01:37:01,238 --> 01:37:06,759
that those like big wide classic sour

2653
01:37:03,118 --> 01:37:08,599
buds yeah um but this location has a lot

2654
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:10,440
of sun you know it's up on top of a hill

2655
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:13,719
so it gets sun up to sundown I mean it's

2656
01:37:10,439 --> 01:37:15,238
like you know Sun's doing sideways [ __ ]

2657
01:37:13,719 --> 01:37:17,560
and so you're going to see it lean a

2658
01:37:15,238 --> 01:37:19,638
little bit more towards the den size but

2659
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:21,560
not as dense as like the Bubba cush

2660
01:37:19,639 --> 01:37:24,840
original Haze you know so I think

2661
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:27,719
there's those variations of most sour

2662
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:29,279
isn't getting a ton of unobstructed

2663
01:37:27,719 --> 01:37:30,920
light at the end of the year you know

2664
01:37:29,279 --> 01:37:32,840
I've grown in spots where it got less

2665
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:35,039
light and more light and I saw fluffier

2666
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:37,679
versus dense I love the southern facing

2667
01:37:35,039 --> 01:37:38,800
hillsides that get real good good light

2668
01:37:37,679 --> 01:37:40,560
you know and I think that's that was

2669
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:43,560
cazadera that's why it was so special it

2670
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:46,000
was Southern facing and it did get a

2671
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:47,960
little bit it was like it didn't get a

2672
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:49,960
lot of fog but it definitely would get a

2673
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:52,599
little bit more humidity and it wasn't

2674
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:55,760
nearly as hot as more Inland and so for

2675
01:37:52,599 --> 01:37:57,480
the sour always had the the best nose

2676
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:59,280
that was growing that growing up that

2677
01:37:57,479 --> 01:38:01,919
was where we used to get it and it was

2678
01:37:59,279 --> 01:38:05,238
amazing so but the flavor of this you

2679
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:08,399
know I'm sure the will have to smoke it

2680
01:38:05,238 --> 01:38:10,919
I mean that's that's special so yeah

2681
01:38:08,399 --> 01:38:13,198
with all these L I have 70 L race

2682
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:14,960
varieties and then I have more from Dave

2683
01:38:13,198 --> 01:38:19,238
mesford that I want a feno hunt and he

2684
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:22,679
has some Nigerian black cross with uh

2685
01:38:19,238 --> 01:38:24,359
Blue 13 which is uh the the blueberry

2686
01:38:22,679 --> 01:38:27,560
Haze times

2687
01:38:24,359 --> 01:38:28,960
jre's uh Louis the 13th okay and I think

2688
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:30,159
there's some really special stuff so

2689
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:31,880
we'll have to go through all this stuff

2690
01:38:30,158 --> 01:38:33,719
and figure out what you're I mean

2691
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:35,679
there's just so much so it's like okay

2692
01:38:33,719 --> 01:38:37,840
well we got to pick and choose the

2693
01:38:35,679 --> 01:38:39,880
starting point yeah and I mean you know

2694
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:41,520
it's time and space that really as you

2695
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:44,319
know that depicts everything but I think

2696
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:47,080
there's there's a very good reason to

2697
01:38:44,319 --> 01:38:49,158
dedicate time and space towards pulling

2698
01:38:47,079 --> 01:38:51,399
out some of these longer flowering

2699
01:38:49,158 --> 01:38:54,439
varieties keeping them separated and

2700
01:38:51,399 --> 01:38:56,198
then remix them into new stuff yeah um

2701
01:38:54,439 --> 01:38:57,919
and then being able to say like I got

2702
01:38:56,198 --> 01:39:00,719
two new things right you know I think

2703
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:02,039
that's a a big advantage in the market

2704
01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:04,079
um and

2705
01:39:02,039 --> 01:39:05,359
then yeah doing that work you know

2706
01:39:04,079 --> 01:39:07,279
because it's like you talk about normal

2707
01:39:05,359 --> 01:39:08,639
breeding projects how it can take you

2708
01:39:07,279 --> 01:39:11,439
know you flower plant out two months

2709
01:39:08,639 --> 01:39:13,960
later you make your selection well you

2710
01:39:11,439 --> 01:39:15,079
know four months goes by and you get

2711
01:39:13,960 --> 01:39:18,520
maybe

2712
01:39:15,079 --> 01:39:20,479
two breeding projects in a year because

2713
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:21,480
of the amount of time it takes to flower

2714
01:39:20,479 --> 01:39:24,559
yeah you

2715
01:39:21,479 --> 01:39:27,238
know that can really

2716
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:31,480
really slow the amount of progress you

2717
01:39:27,238 --> 01:39:34,000
can make and it can also be um

2718
01:39:31,479 --> 01:39:35,479
discouraging when you wait 20 weeks and

2719
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:37,520
you don't get something worth keeping

2720
01:39:35,479 --> 01:39:39,238
you know a lot of the guys that are

2721
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:41,639
still growing these long flowering

2722
01:39:39,238 --> 01:39:43,198
varieties seem to be like older retired

2723
01:39:41,639 --> 01:39:45,000
dudes you know and they're doing it

2724
01:39:43,198 --> 01:39:47,519
because they love the smoke and it's

2725
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:49,399
like how do you how do you take

2726
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:50,880
something that takes 16 to 20 weeks

2727
01:39:49,399 --> 01:39:52,638
that's like so good that you have to

2728
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:54,118
share it with everybody right how do you

2729
01:39:52,639 --> 01:39:56,400
bring that out how put that out in the

2730
01:39:54,118 --> 01:39:59,238
market you know it's like my Band-Aid

2731
01:39:56,399 --> 01:40:01,598
Haze has seven more weeks to go you know

2732
01:39:59,238 --> 01:40:03,158
it's a week nine yeah it's not going to

2733
01:40:01,599 --> 01:40:04,639
be done until the end of November and I

2734
01:40:03,158 --> 01:40:06,519
started flowering in the beginning of

2735
01:40:04,639 --> 01:40:09,199
August you know you want to breed with

2736
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:11,159
something like that it takes a whole

2737
01:40:09,198 --> 01:40:12,598
another level of passion and dedication

2738
01:40:11,158 --> 01:40:16,759
and I think that's why a lot of people

2739
01:40:12,599 --> 01:40:19,840
aren't doing it but um you know it's

2740
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:22,119
like I we're here to deal with the plant

2741
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:23,520
I feel like I'm here to to to do this

2742
01:40:22,118 --> 01:40:25,679
long flowering thing and try try and

2743
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:27,440
bring it to you know the the older

2744
01:40:25,679 --> 01:40:29,679
Generations the younger generations to

2745
01:40:27,439 --> 01:40:31,799
us everybody you know yeah oh it's

2746
01:40:29,679 --> 01:40:35,399
really cool and I feel like I I love

2747
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:38,360
Innovation within the pl even if it's

2748
01:40:35,399 --> 01:40:39,879
going backwards in a sense I feel like

2749
01:40:38,359 --> 01:40:41,598
sometimes we have to go backwards to go

2750
01:40:39,880 --> 01:40:43,440
forwards you know there's so many things

2751
01:40:41,599 --> 01:40:44,319
that are counterintuitive and I think a

2752
01:40:43,439 --> 01:40:46,759
lot of

2753
01:40:44,319 --> 01:40:48,639
people think they know what they like

2754
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:50,480
until they've experienced something

2755
01:40:48,639 --> 01:40:53,599
that's outside the box that they really

2756
01:40:50,479 --> 01:40:55,399
enjoy yeah you got to be open-minded you

2757
01:40:53,599 --> 01:40:57,159
got to take the ego sometimes the ego

2758
01:40:55,399 --> 01:40:59,319
just has to go away for a little bit so

2759
01:40:57,158 --> 01:41:02,479
you can try something that's different

2760
01:40:59,319 --> 01:41:03,880
that maybe you know and I feel like a

2761
01:41:02,479 --> 01:41:06,519
there's a lot of ego out there too

2762
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:08,079
especially with Growers and people who

2763
01:41:06,520 --> 01:41:10,320
they believe they're connoisseurs they

2764
01:41:08,079 --> 01:41:13,760
know everything about it and then they

2765
01:41:10,319 --> 01:41:15,679
would look at this and you know probably

2766
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:18,000
give give it a thumbs down before even

2767
01:41:15,679 --> 01:41:19,440
trying it that's why the pre-rolls are

2768
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:21,118
so perfect I thought I knew a lot about

2769
01:41:19,439 --> 01:41:23,839
weed until I smoke this you know I've

2770
01:41:21,118 --> 01:41:26,598
been smoking for you know since 99 I've

2771
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:28,719
been growing since 2001 totally um and

2772
01:41:26,599 --> 01:41:30,960
I've had you know had a lot of harvest

2773
01:41:28,719 --> 01:41:32,800
too I think there's a sometimes I like

2774
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:34,560
in my own ego I guess makes a

2775
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:36,679
distinction between like growing for 20

2776
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:37,840
years versus how many Harvest you had

2777
01:41:36,679 --> 01:41:39,079
right because when you're cranking out

2778
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:40,800
you know like nowadays like some

2779
01:41:39,079 --> 01:41:42,920
companies are they're harvesting 100

2780
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:45,000
pounds every three days like you learn a

2781
01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:47,719
lot quick so you could take a five-year

2782
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:49,319
grower could actually be way way way way

2783
01:41:47,719 --> 01:41:50,359
more skilled than a 20-year grower just

2784
01:41:49,319 --> 01:41:52,719
because they've been harvesting every

2785
01:41:50,359 --> 01:41:54,598
three days for five years it's a lot of

2786
01:41:52,719 --> 01:41:56,079
insight knowledge in a very short amount

2787
01:41:54,599 --> 01:41:58,039
of time you can learn a lot of knowledge

2788
01:41:56,079 --> 01:41:59,840
but a lot of stuff is super automated

2789
01:41:58,039 --> 01:42:02,279
too so sometimes you might miss the

2790
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:04,119
nuances of of growing Boutique flower

2791
01:42:02,279 --> 01:42:07,800
where it's like it becomes a commodity

2792
01:42:04,118 --> 01:42:10,279
and so you're growing at such scale

2793
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:11,760
that I think when you're growing at

2794
01:42:10,279 --> 01:42:12,519
scale you have to grow you have to look

2795
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:14,480
at it

2796
01:42:12,520 --> 01:42:15,920
differently uh whereas if you're growing

2797
01:42:14,479 --> 01:42:17,799
Boutique flower you can really get to

2798
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:19,440
know a cultivar growing it over and over

2799
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:21,560
and over on a small scale you can do

2800
01:42:19,439 --> 01:42:24,118
that with a large scale too and I think

2801
01:42:21,560 --> 01:42:26,119
that's still like Tri and air at a

2802
01:42:24,118 --> 01:42:28,039
larger scale but but when you're handw

2803
01:42:26,118 --> 01:42:29,319
watering and you're looking at a plan

2804
01:42:28,039 --> 01:42:31,238
every day there's something special

2805
01:42:29,319 --> 01:42:34,399
about that too that you get a different

2806
01:42:31,238 --> 01:42:36,399
experience of growing at scale totally I

2807
01:42:34,399 --> 01:42:39,319
agree I mean the difference

2808
01:42:36,399 --> 01:42:42,198
between having to make sure that a 500

2809
01:42:39,319 --> 01:42:44,279
life facility is producing enough weed

2810
01:42:42,198 --> 01:42:48,559
so that the facility can stay open is

2811
01:42:44,279 --> 01:42:51,118
different than growing weed that

2812
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:53,760
like you want to show to someone you

2813
01:42:51,118 --> 01:42:55,880
really expect that you think likes good

2814
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:57,599
weed yeah um and that that was always

2815
01:42:55,880 --> 01:42:58,800
the challenge for me was you know cuz I

2816
01:42:57,599 --> 01:43:00,520
had an instance where I was growing

2817
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:02,360
Gorilla Glue for a company in a 400

2818
01:43:00,520 --> 01:43:04,239
light facility yeah somebody that had a

2819
01:43:02,359 --> 01:43:05,719
four lighter brought their Gorilla Glue

2820
01:43:04,238 --> 01:43:08,118
and I wanted to take it to work and be

2821
01:43:05,719 --> 01:43:09,439
like guys like this is what we need to

2822
01:43:08,118 --> 01:43:10,719
be going for you know and there were

2823
01:43:09,439 --> 01:43:13,279
things that that company was doing that

2824
01:43:10,719 --> 01:43:15,480
we kind of switched up um that improved

2825
01:43:13,279 --> 01:43:17,238
you know the quality a little bit um but

2826
01:43:15,479 --> 01:43:19,039
it's hard I mean we grew good it was

2827
01:43:17,238 --> 01:43:20,519
good herb but was it the kind of stuff

2828
01:43:19,039 --> 01:43:22,639
that I grew at home

2829
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:24,440
no I think we could have gotten a little

2830
01:43:22,639 --> 01:43:25,920
bit better had we not done certain

2831
01:43:24,439 --> 01:43:27,638
things that they were doing they were

2832
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:30,118
really worried about failing tests and

2833
01:43:27,639 --> 01:43:32,520
so we were spraying um oxidate at the

2834
01:43:30,118 --> 01:43:35,519
end of like the day of harvest wow and

2835
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:37,400
then kill off any mold basically yep and

2836
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:38,800
we stopped spraying it and I was like we

2837
01:43:37,399 --> 01:43:40,879
had this one variety that just didn't

2838
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:44,000
taste very good and then after the

2839
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:45,599
Harvest after we stopped spraying I was

2840
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:47,560
like dude this stuff has some flavor to

2841
01:43:45,599 --> 01:43:49,279
it you know and we're not failing test

2842
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:52,320
like just stop this I prefer not spray

2843
01:43:49,279 --> 01:43:54,000
at all and so grandm I mean that's

2844
01:43:52,319 --> 01:43:55,439
obviously the best right like if you can

2845
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:58,000
not spray at all and like even my

2846
01:43:55,439 --> 01:44:02,519
outdoor at home I'd rather deal with

2847
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:03,960
picking out uh caterpillars by hand then

2848
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:05,800
spraying them with anything even though

2849
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:07,359
it's for seed I'm GNA get a little bit

2850
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:09,079
of hash out of it you know I do this

2851
01:44:07,359 --> 01:44:11,158
little seed crop at home every year

2852
01:44:09,079 --> 01:44:13,880
couple years back I did huge seed crop

2853
01:44:11,158 --> 01:44:17,598
but Grandmaster lighting has these uh

2854
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:20,159
new UVC lights bug lights and I'm super

2855
01:44:17,599 --> 01:44:22,520
excited about testing them out and

2856
01:44:20,158 --> 01:44:23,960
basically so you don't have to spray uh

2857
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:25,360
we're running a couple of my friends

2858
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:27,239
facilities we don't have bugs here

2859
01:44:25,359 --> 01:44:29,679
because we're a closed circuit right but

2860
01:44:27,238 --> 01:44:32,638
still as a redundancy and in between

2861
01:44:29,679 --> 01:44:34,719
rounds and just to be safe they have

2862
01:44:32,639 --> 01:44:37,560
these UVC bug lights and I'm really

2863
01:44:34,719 --> 01:44:39,679
curious as to how they work with all my

2864
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:41,320
friends and you know it's they're new on

2865
01:44:39,679 --> 01:44:45,000
the market they're available and they're

2866
01:44:41,319 --> 01:44:47,559
very affordable and to be able to not

2867
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:49,520
spray anything makes makes the most

2868
01:44:47,560 --> 01:44:51,719
sense to me if I could if if I could

2869
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:53,599
grow and I was a cultivator and I was

2870
01:44:51,719 --> 01:44:55,880
you know I was growing throwing lot a

2871
01:44:53,599 --> 01:44:58,440
lot of lights I would want a product

2872
01:44:55,880 --> 01:44:59,719
that could prevent me or at least assist

2873
01:44:58,439 --> 01:45:02,118
me in the

2874
01:44:59,719 --> 01:45:03,800
IPM uh model to where you're not

2875
01:45:02,118 --> 01:45:05,920
spraying stuff all the time and there's

2876
01:45:03,800 --> 01:45:07,880
not the rotation because a lot of guys

2877
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:09,079
they rotate through stuff so that they

2878
01:45:07,880 --> 01:45:10,800
don't have problems they're being

2879
01:45:09,079 --> 01:45:12,719
preventative and I like preventative but

2880
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:14,960
if you were able to do it without

2881
01:45:12,719 --> 01:45:18,158
spraying that'd be the best yeah I've

2882
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:20,920
gotten on this uh this new uh bug

2883
01:45:18,158 --> 01:45:23,638
identification system that I really like

2884
01:45:20,920 --> 01:45:27,440
cuz it speeds up the amount of time that

2885
01:45:23,639 --> 01:45:29,239
you can find a bug in the room y um you

2886
01:45:27,439 --> 01:45:32,479
know I've got a smaller Greenhouse so I

2887
01:45:29,238 --> 01:45:34,198
still walk every aisle at least three

2888
01:45:32,479 --> 01:45:36,799
times a week yeah you know and I do a

2889
01:45:34,198 --> 01:45:38,479
pretty hard stare um sure you know I've

2890
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:41,039
had a couple things pop up that were

2891
01:45:38,479 --> 01:45:44,399
like small little issues uh nutrient

2892
01:45:41,039 --> 01:45:46,960
wise right they can detect also um and

2893
01:45:44,399 --> 01:45:48,799
so it'll basically notify you through

2894
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:51,000
this camera that has AI like hey you got

2895
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:53,440
a nutrient deficiency what's the name of

2896
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:56,399
it um the company that I'm working with

2897
01:45:53,439 --> 01:45:58,559
is called formada nice and they're kind

2898
01:45:56,399 --> 01:46:00,598
of I think they're based out of Israel

2899
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:01,920
um and yeah like I said I mean it'll you

2900
01:46:00,599 --> 01:46:04,199
know if you got spidermites it'll

2901
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:06,440
identify the spidermite send you a

2902
01:46:04,198 --> 01:46:08,279
notification and then you can like make

2903
01:46:06,439 --> 01:46:10,799
you know a change accordingly it'll show

2904
01:46:08,279 --> 01:46:12,479
you a graph it'll shoot yeah I mean I

2905
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:15,679
can look at my greenhouse and it'll

2906
01:46:12,479 --> 01:46:18,439
pinpoint the plant that the issue is at

2907
01:46:15,679 --> 01:46:20,440
and so really and I think they've been

2908
01:46:18,439 --> 01:46:21,598
using this technology for a while uh I

2909
01:46:20,439 --> 01:46:23,039
remember back in the day I heard like

2910
01:46:21,599 --> 01:46:26,360
you could there's a company that could

2911
01:46:23,039 --> 01:46:28,319
find uh one specific plant in the Amazon

2912
01:46:26,359 --> 01:46:29,559
with this like detection system right

2913
01:46:28,319 --> 01:46:32,679
and I think that's what they do is they

2914
01:46:29,560 --> 01:46:35,440
get like the the the footprint you know

2915
01:46:32,679 --> 01:46:37,560
of a spidermite the footprint of an aid

2916
01:46:35,439 --> 01:46:39,118
or whatever right they see the damage it

2917
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:41,920
makes and they can just like hone in on

2918
01:46:39,118 --> 01:46:44,079
it and identify it and it's you know

2919
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:45,800
it's down to like it'll be it'll show

2920
01:46:44,079 --> 01:46:47,719
you everywhere it's at so yeah if you

2921
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:50,000
have one plant that is starting a

2922
01:46:47,719 --> 01:46:52,239
nitrogen deficiency it's going to Ping

2923
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:54,479
for that one plant wow and it'll show

2924
01:46:52,238 --> 01:46:56,799
you EXA where it's at and then if you

2925
01:46:54,479 --> 01:46:58,559
have a you know large cultivation site

2926
01:46:56,800 --> 01:47:01,239
and maybe you can't have people walking

2927
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:02,960
up and down the rows yeah or whatever

2928
01:47:01,238 --> 01:47:04,238
this is something that you just boom it

2929
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:06,599
and it's you know it's pretty quick to

2930
01:47:04,238 --> 01:47:07,519
identify it um I can't wait till they

2931
01:47:06,599 --> 01:47:10,279
can

2932
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:11,920
identify uh I I think using ethylene

2933
01:47:10,279 --> 01:47:13,559
they'll be able to identify Herms very

2934
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:15,079
easily if they haven't done it already

2935
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:17,560
I've heard about trials being done with

2936
01:47:15,079 --> 01:47:19,840
infrared and some other tech technology

2937
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:22,960
so I asked this company I was like can

2938
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:24,960
you detect male flowers from aphrodites

2939
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:27,079
with this software because if you can

2940
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:29,359
that'll be a game Cher for breeders and

2941
01:47:27,079 --> 01:47:31,800
they said it's a different camera um you

2942
01:47:29,359 --> 01:47:33,319
know they the the camera they have is

2943
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:34,920
they chose for a specific reason it

2944
01:47:33,319 --> 01:47:37,000
works for a lot of applications and it's

2945
01:47:34,920 --> 01:47:38,639
scalable right there's other things that

2946
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,920
you could do maybe with other cameras

2947
01:47:38,639 --> 01:47:42,400
that might be outside of the scope of

2948
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:44,560
their focus infrared drones let's do it

2949
01:47:42,399 --> 01:47:46,399
I'm excited but yeah so yeah you can put

2950
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:48,239
these cameras on a field mount in an

2951
01:47:46,399 --> 01:47:50,238
outdoor spot and just put it on a post

2952
01:47:48,238 --> 01:47:53,039
so you can do indoors Outdoors green

2953
01:47:50,238 --> 01:47:55,359
houses um it's pretty cool you know good

2954
01:47:53,039 --> 01:47:58,279
sour good sour it's fresh it's like

2955
01:47:55,359 --> 01:48:00,439
super fresh still has the sour taste but

2956
01:47:58,279 --> 01:48:02,039
it's super Super Fresh I feel like I and

2957
01:48:00,439 --> 01:48:04,238
I still like the Skittles when I got it

2958
01:48:02,039 --> 01:48:05,679
the other day I Still Smoked it Super

2959
01:48:04,238 --> 01:48:07,879
Fresh just because I love the flavor but

2960
01:48:05,679 --> 01:48:09,760
this one it's like I really want to cure

2961
01:48:07,880 --> 01:48:13,400
that out for another week put them in

2962
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:14,960
some tur blocks and let them go I did I

2963
01:48:13,399 --> 01:48:16,559
did I give you turp blocks last time

2964
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:18,800
yeah did you try those out at all for

2965
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:20,480
curing um you know I haven't cuz it's

2966
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:23,039
kind of been in between but I have them

2967
01:48:20,479 --> 01:48:24,678
now yeah and I got some freshy it's

2968
01:48:23,039 --> 01:48:26,960
great to do side by sides too put some

2969
01:48:24,679 --> 01:48:28,760
in a a jar put them in a mason jar put

2970
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:30,520
them in a turkey bag put some in the tur

2971
01:48:28,760 --> 01:48:32,039
lock and then really do side by sides

2972
01:48:30,520 --> 01:48:33,920
and take a little butt out and smoke it

2973
01:48:32,039 --> 01:48:36,118
like once a week and you'll really be

2974
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:38,158
able to see the difference of okay I I

2975
01:48:36,118 --> 01:48:39,960
feel like the turkey bag goes first then

2976
01:48:38,158 --> 01:48:42,359
it's the Mason jar and then it's the

2977
01:48:39,960 --> 01:48:43,960
turp blck I'm well I got a fresh bat of

2978
01:48:42,359 --> 01:48:45,759
sour I'm gonna have to try it out nice

2979
01:48:43,960 --> 01:48:48,279
but yeah that stuff um you know wasn't

2980
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:50,320
even really snapping on the stem i'

2981
01:48:48,279 --> 01:48:52,279
probably let it go you know another five

2982
01:48:50,319 --> 01:48:55,479
or six days before I even like take it

2983
01:48:52,279 --> 01:48:58,840
off but yeah yeah um you know one of my

2984
01:48:55,479 --> 01:49:01,198
measures of good sour is it when it

2985
01:48:58,840 --> 01:49:02,840
burns it should taste like good sour

2986
01:49:01,198 --> 01:49:04,678
even if it's two days after it's been

2987
01:49:02,840 --> 01:49:07,319
harvested you know it should have that

2988
01:49:04,679 --> 01:49:08,960
dank sour smell the whole entire way

2989
01:49:07,319 --> 01:49:12,079
through drying and if you can smoke it

2990
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:13,920
at day five when it's obviously not

2991
01:49:12,079 --> 01:49:16,439
ready to be smoked and it still tastes

2992
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:19,000
balm yeah and sour is a real greasy one

2993
01:49:16,439 --> 01:49:21,158
anyway so like it's sometimes when it's

2994
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:23,439
grown perfectly it doesn't feel like

2995
01:49:21,158 --> 01:49:25,479
it's dry cuz it's so greasy

2996
01:49:23,439 --> 01:49:29,079
and then uh you know you can still smoke

2997
01:49:25,479 --> 01:49:33,079
it it's amazing yeah yeah uh I like to

2998
01:49:29,079 --> 01:49:34,319
say uh squishy squishy Bud Snappy stem

2999
01:49:33,079 --> 01:49:36,238
yeah you know that's like that's what

3000
01:49:34,319 --> 01:49:38,279
you want you know you can just crack

3001
01:49:36,238 --> 01:49:40,399
that stem and it's like just bounces

3002
01:49:38,279 --> 01:49:43,079
back to where the bud was yeah I love

3003
01:49:40,399 --> 01:49:45,198
that well so if people are trying to

3004
01:49:43,079 --> 01:49:48,279
find out more about you or they want to

3005
01:49:45,198 --> 01:49:50,879
buy some of your flour where can they go

3006
01:49:48,279 --> 01:49:52,840
um you can check me out on Instagram

3007
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:57,159
head grower

3008
01:49:52,840 --> 01:50:00,000
uh you can check out budo humble on

3009
01:49:57,158 --> 01:50:02,319
Instagram and uh that's where we have a

3010
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:04,520
lot of the flowers showcased and then

3011
01:50:02,319 --> 01:50:06,198
we're about to launch the brand budo

3012
