108
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,158

132

154
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,120
happen well let's dive into some of

155
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:40,159
these

156
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,160
flavors let's start out with this first

157
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,160
one it's a little bit smaller but I

158
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:48,080
figure we could talk about what what we

159
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,560
going talk drip we can talk about White

160
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:53,639
Ash and we can talk about

161
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,800
flavor and we can talk about the refire

162
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:59,360
because to me those are all important

163
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,120

204
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:50,478
little bit more difficult for me to put

two so question for you when it comes to

223
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,280
Quality

224
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:35,080
what do you think are the most important

225
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:37,240
things with flour with flour pulling it

226
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:41,719
right knowing when the time is right to

227
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:44,560
pull it you know get it down cheering it

228
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:46,519
some dumbass important you know

229
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:49,559
obviously I've seen people with amazing

230
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:51,919
flour that [ __ ] up the Cure so many

231
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:53,479
times so many times I feel like that's

232
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:54,599
one of the biggest problems out there is

233
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,200
people don't know how to cure it right

234
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:00,200
is it is and these dudes are pretty I

235
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,360
mean when we first started like some of

236
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,360
our team was like amazing grown great

237
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,440
amazing weed and we just weren't curing

238
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:09,000
it the right way and you got to get over

239
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,279
that little hurdle and sometimes it

240
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,600
takes you know a little wind out your

241
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:14,600
sales because you're thinking your [ __ ]

242
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,720
is looking amazing but yo you got to get

243
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,240
it cured right but we've corrected that

244
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,200
are you talking about like on the

245
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,519
surface

246
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,200
wise yeah yeah like so if you're looking

247
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,278
at flowers I'm looking at tree gotta got

248
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,800

249
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:29,958
some amazing candy or whatever I'm

250
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:33,359
looking for at the time right now what's

251
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:36,518
the number one checkbox is that candy

252
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:41,480
smell I believe yeah I believe flavor

253
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:44,120
yeah nose looks you know Ash color Oil

254
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:46,240
ring yeah Oil ring is an interesting one

255
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,959
it used to not be a qualifier but and

256
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,799
same thing with white ash and I wasn't

257
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:54,078
sold on the White Ash until the last

258
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:57,120
like year and a little bit I'm still I

259
00:09:54,078 --> 00:09:59,879
leaning into it like it's a serious

260
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,320
thing like white ash means

261
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:04,759
quity weed and all that buto let me tell

262
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,399
you there's been multiple times where

263
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:09,879
the joint is rolled a certain way and

264
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:12,039
it's just not burning a certain way yeah

265
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:14,919
and it's not as white as you would

266
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:17,240
probably expect it or want it to be

267
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:20,519
purple purple doesn't get his white ash

268
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:22,159
typically and someone else will come and

269
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,560
bar it up real

270
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:27,039
nice and the [ __ ] will just burn

271
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:28,759
perfectly and have [ __ ] white ash you

272
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:29,719
know what I mean so I mean there's a lot

273
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:32,278
of

274
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,320
variables into making this [ __ ] burn

275
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:36,159
right for sure but I believe yeah for

276
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,920
the most part if you got some [ __ ]

277
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:40,319
dumbass white assh you're doing

278
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:42,319
something right yeah and I mean I think

279
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,240
that certain certain genetics certain

280
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,519
flavors they don't get white ash just

281
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,200
part of it I think or or people struggle

282
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,000
to get it or every once in a while it

283
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,560
comes out perfect same thing like

284
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,240
Skittles it doesn't always drip but when

285
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:57,278
it does it's like [ __ ] I really like

286
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,600
Skittles you you're a big fan of

287
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:02,039

flower in California in my

319
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:20,159

320
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,839
of the big companies you guys grow the

321
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:23,278

style I have not yeah that's the new new

437
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:21,360
we got I've seen uh the humidity gel

438
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:23,759
packs that people throwing in there so I

439
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,918
got this cut of super silver haze ciss

440
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:27,759
you probably saw that from SF Cana Super

441
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,720
Silver Haze cap it was labeled Super

442
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:33,359
Silver Haze cap and it wasn't very super

443
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:36,079
silver his and it wasn't ciss the lab

444
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:39,479
that it was SSH I think they put it out

445
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:40,558
as SSH but uh you guys check that out so

446
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,839
that's

447
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:49,038
infused with the TPS it was uh that's

448
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:51,519
the candy gas he hold on you just said

449
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:53,400
it's a [ __ ] pouch uhuh that you

450
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:56,400
sprinkle on tree no you don't sprinkle

451
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,640
it on you put this pouch in your pound

452
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,600
okay right for four to six hours hours

453
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,520
or 24 hours or whatever you want to do

454
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:04,519
[ __ ] soak it up soaks it up it soaks

455
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:07,319
it right up and then you get it into the

456
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:09,879
into the joints which I think is uh now

457
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:12,319
is that sprayed I mean like is it sort

458
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:14,480
of like I mean it's comparable to spray

459
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:16,359
sprayed isn't real turp sprayed is like

460
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,759
I mean not always it could be I guess

461
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:20,079
but like these are cannabis derve tpin

462
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:21,919
there's an interesting story we're GNA

463
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:23,720
get the guy on the show that does them I

464
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,960
was like so but they're real cannabis

465
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,279
tping it's not like they're putting

466
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,480
orange or watermelon or any of these

467
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:32,960
okay you know these other tpin they're

468
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:35,839
putting actual uh TPS from flour TPS

469
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,200
from Cannabis flow

470
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:40,879
correct okay

471
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,840
so I don't know how I feel about that

472
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,720
yeah I mean because it's too scientific

473
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:49,399
for me and it's like comparable it's

474
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:51,919
really comparable to [ __ ] spray turps

475
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:54,159
you know what I mean well either way

476
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,919
it's it's not was grown in the garden

477
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:58,559
yeah either way it wasn't part of your

478
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:01,280
[ __ ] batch until you [ __ ] set this

479
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:03,918
little patch in your [ __ ] and it soaked

480
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:05,279
it up through the [ __ ] the first half

481
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,120
actually tastes pretty good of the joint

482
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:08,599
too like but then the second half it's

483
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:10,479
like you got them all rolled up look at

484
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:12,678
me I'm here about to light this [ __ ] too

485
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,319
yeah go ahead get the flavor it's real

486
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:18,320
interesting that is an SF can of product

487
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:19,798
minus the infused turps oh wow but uh

488
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:20,918
it's real interesting so the first I

489
00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:24,000
mean you get to experience it I don't

490
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:25,400
even have to tell you this is amazing

491
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,480
all right let me try this [ __ ] you know

492
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,880
I got to try everything once but people

493
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,200
have beeny

494
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,960
weed for the long time you know what I

495
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:35,840
mean like if you say I would smoke

496
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:38,679
sprayed TPS sprayed tped weed you're out

497
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:41,678
of your mind but let me try some of this

498
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:44,000
soaked up TPS it's like TPS on

499
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,360
turps and I wasn't super impressed with

500
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,798
the turps on that flower so I figured

501
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:49,038
let's Infuse some and see what these

502
00:19:47,798 --> 00:19:51,359
things do they're talking about real

503
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:54,038
cannabis turps it's

504
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:56,359
okay it's got a taste to it though for

505
00:19:54,038 --> 00:19:57,240
there's a taste there is a taste that

506
00:19:56,359 --> 00:20:01,000
it's

507
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:03,558
like I've tasted it before and I put the

508
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,640
joint out

509
00:20:03,558 --> 00:20:08,798
immediately but we tried it I tasted it

510
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,080
it was wasn't hella bad but it's that

511
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:11,359
taste you know what I mean yeah yeah

512
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:15,119
that's sort of what I was going going

513
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:17,759
for like I'll yeah we'll go right here

514
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:17,759
take a couple of

515
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,960
rips

516
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:32,959
you it tastes

517
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,640
interesting I don't know doesn't taste

518
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,440
natural it doesn't taste natural though

519
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,600
no it doesn't I mean I think when you

520
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,720
get so used to having good flour that

521
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:42,279
anything that's like even the fake stuff

522
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,240
I don't want to smoke stuff that's that

523
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:45,879
[ __ ] that rubs up on you in a strip

524
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,240
club who's dancing for you and she rubs

525
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:51,320
her [ __ ] tits on your face and you're

526
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,640
like damn these tits are hard as [ __ ]

527
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:56,720
you know what I'm saying [ __ ] is fake

528
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:59,000
it's not natural fat ass is fake as [ __ ]

529
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,440
yeah I mean implants are turn reversed

530
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,558
the funny thing is is when you get past

531
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:05,200
the halfway point it still tastes like

532
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:07,240
that all the way down until it but like

533
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,679
you know how with Skittles Skittles

534
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,679
Taste like Skittles but it it tastes

535
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:12,080
like if you smoke a whole joint of

536
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,840
Skittles it gets more intense yeah going

537
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:16,359
down but it's real natural all the way

538
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:18,720
down this stuff is like you could

539
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:21,158
tell and maybe if you match the right

540
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,600
TPS with like let's say you put Skittles

541
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:25,799
TPS back on Skittles yeah that would be

542
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:27,000
cool that might be interesting it' be

543
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:29,400
worth trying you know but like when

544
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,159
you're taking two different flow maybe

545
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:34,960
and it you know and it's worth a [ __ ]

546
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,440
worth a try right but yeah maybe that's

547
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,919
the problem is that people are just

548
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,798
putting different TPS on other turpy

549
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:42,000
weed and there's this weird flavor

550
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:43,480
that's coming off it that people know

551
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,240
that are like hold on man this [ __ ] is

552
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,759
sprayed or you soak this [ __ ] up with a

553
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,000
little pouch that James La was telling

554
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:52,359
me about I'm always so it's it's funny

555
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,798
with different things like sprayed weed

556
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:58,959
or moon rocks or we we had you know what

557
00:21:55,798 --> 00:22:01,200
is it the Snowballs now snow

558
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,159
I'm curious I'm always curious right

559
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,519
yeah but but besides being curious like

560
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,880
it's worth trying once and then it's

561
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:09,359
like no I don't know man I tried we us

562
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,720
to do every kind of dab we could

563
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:14,599
possibly do back in the day too yeah

564
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,319
shout out to snowballs I mean my boy

565
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:19,519
Zach and all them cast you know what I'm

566
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:21,720
saying yeah I mean it's we smoked the

567
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:25,359
whole Marty missile of the Snowballs oh

568
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:29,038
my God ly in Vegas Jesus and let me tell

569
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:30,918
you [ __ ] where dying

570
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:32,839
it wasn't bad weed I mean it was just

571
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:34,919
[ __ ] harsh you know the H snowballs

572
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:36,918
and [ __ ] right they used the thca

573
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:39,600
pattern they rolled the flower in it

574
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:41,120
yeah and make it stronger and you know

575
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:42,798
but there's a way for that so there I

576
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:45,599
mean you know whether you like it or you

577
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:47,440
don't like there's a lane for that like

578
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:49,240
AB it's all about being creative in this

579
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:53,278
industry like yeah I mean think about it

580
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:55,759
I put a bag next to another bag and

581
00:22:53,278 --> 00:22:58,400
separated two AES in one bag and you

582
00:22:55,759 --> 00:23:00,599
know it's not like rocket science or

583
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,798
anything like that is yo but it's

584
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:04,719
creative and it's kind of like the

585
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,639
Cannabis industry is so much room for

586
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,480
like creativity and growth you know what

587
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,159
I'm saying yeah so you can almost do

588
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,960
anything but make it creative and it

589
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,520
might work out but if you're spraying

590
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:17,798
your weed jump off a

591
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:21,440
cliff if you're spraying it with non

592
00:23:17,798 --> 00:23:24,599
Canabis tpes yeah we still got one more

593
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,960
of these to roll or smoke all right and

594
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:28,678
then you're what are you rolling up over

595
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:31,480
there roll this [ __ ]

596
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:34,880
roll up this [ __ ] cream Leaf

597
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:37,319

598
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,278

600
00:23:39,278 --> 00:23:43,839
little light on them and everything SF

601
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:46,120
can rolling tray

602
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:47,278
though it's been used and abused but

603
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:50,158
it's a good rolling

604
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:52,359
tray seems like it with the flower Mill

605
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,000
shout out to Brent flower Mill man yep

606
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:55,879
he makes a great product what do you

607
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,519
think the futures or the future of

608
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:00,120
events are I don't know a lot of people

609
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:02,440
are [ __ ] kind of had it with LA

610
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:04,359
events shout out to all the LA events so

611
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,558
I know there's a [ __ ] Bunch Every

612
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:09,719
week I'm just saying like what I've

613
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:12,519
heard is it's too much of the same event

614
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:15,480
going on yeah like there's not enough

615
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:17,480
thought that's why I guess lyy is and

616
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,798
not to blow not to blow my own horn I'm

617
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:22,278
just saying like we really try to come

618
00:24:19,798 --> 00:24:25,119
with something different for ly that we

619
00:24:22,278 --> 00:24:28,839
usually see at your you know your usual

620
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:32,519
events just like [ __ ]

621
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:34,119
oil wrestling and you know topless

622
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:37,720
rollers

623
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:39,879
and um you name

624
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:42,079
it it's about making it more of an

625
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:44,480
experience I like it yeah dope

626
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:46,759
experience I do like the bracket the

627
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,360
bracket events where they can have multi

628
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:49,798
bit of I I think that's pretty cool too

629
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:51,319
and I think that's only you're doing one

630
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:53,000
I think that that's why the versus [ __ ]

631
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:58,240
is going to work yeah and we might even

632
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:00,319
tie in uh tie in a local fighter and I

633
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,599
don't mean like anybody training I mean

634
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:06,599
like a Joe Schmo who

635
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:09,439
loves SF Cana who's like yeah I'll

636
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:11,278
[ __ ] go three rounds for SF can and

637
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,960
rep SF canana and we'll do like an open

638
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:14,640
registry I'll have all the brands that

639
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,440
are signing up do an open registry

640
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,840
because their deck will pay for their

641
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:22,240
[ __ ] fighter check this out

642
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:25,119
though and everybody that is number four

643
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,120
what number four all

644
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,679

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,638
yeah good stuff though good genetics I

807
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,480
like the flavor

808
00:32:27,638 --> 00:32:32,839
yeah yeah for sure for sure we done

809
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,599
[ __ ] made that [ __ ] pop off too in

810
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:35,720
our

811
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:37,959
cultivation yeah so when is greenweed

812
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:40,240
coming back green weed is coming back

813
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:42,880
it's already damn near back keep it real

814
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,558
good yeah that's that's my I I feel like

815
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,278
it's making a comeback it's not quite

816
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:49,359
there yet yeah but it's on the cusp get

817
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:51,558
some good ogs out there get some Sour

818
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:52,839
Diesel get some good flavor I mean

819
00:32:51,558 --> 00:32:55,038
Skittles doesn't always have color

820
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:56,678
Skittles is amazing I mean that's the

821
00:32:55,038 --> 00:32:59,638
top top shelf right now pretty much what

822
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:03,080
do you think a temperature of a good

823
00:32:59,638 --> 00:33:07,638
cultivation flower room a flower room

824
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:10,558
yeah uh around 82 degrees around 82

825
00:33:07,638 --> 00:33:11,879
degrees Yeah but it depends on like if

826
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:13,480
you're going for flower and it depends

827
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:17,639
on like nighttime temps and other things

828
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:21,038
like that you know so I think like your

829
00:33:17,638 --> 00:33:23,000
grower he he gets it real cold and

830
00:33:21,038 --> 00:33:25,119
crushes you guys have some of the most

831
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,960
purple flower too yeah he definitely

832
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:28,959
crushes crushes

833
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:37,319
I'm think no what I'm thinking is what

834
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:39,439
I'm thinking is like 82 you said yeah

835
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:42,638
yeah what point do you think it starts

836
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:45,399
turning color like a

837
00:33:42,638 --> 00:33:47,359
65 it depends on the cultivar so some

838
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:49,359
cultivars start turning purple really

839
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:53,119
early on and other ones much later on

840
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:55,719
and some are right at the end and like

841
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:58,199
that but uh it's interesting what you

842
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:01,440
can do with getting getting purple flour

843
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:03,919
and how it's such a qualifier right now

844
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:06,038
as far as like it's worth more money to

845
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:08,159
have it purple if you had the same thing

846
00:34:06,038 --> 00:34:09,599
it tasted better green and you had

847
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,639
better color and more bag appeel you

848
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,879
probably get more money for it right now

849
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:18,399
you know who's a green weed

850
00:34:13,878 --> 00:34:20,639
Advocate Adam ill what Adam ill my boy

851

870
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:06,639
like you know this book weighs a

871
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:07,960
kilo also one something pounds so it's

872
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:11,319
about a

873
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:12,880
kilo you throw that [ __ ] literally [ __ ]

874
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,079
someone up with it yeah that's what we

875
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,880
were talking about earlier oh you don't

876
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:19,599
like weed [ __ ] hit him with a book

877
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:21,720
hit him with a book put it in

878
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:24,640
pillowcase

879
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:25,879
[ __ ] you [ __ ] smacked the [ __ ] out

880
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:28,039
somebody in the pillowcase but it's got

881
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:31,519
that soft soft touch so it's like an

882
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:33,759
Apple box I really like that feel who uh

883
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:34,838
who decided that I mean when did you

884
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,000
decide you was going to come out with a

885
00:35:34,838 --> 00:35:42,440
book so I've been working on this book

886
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:45,000
for five years uh and the last year like

887
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:46,720
since one year ago almost exactly yeah

888
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,760
I've been heavily focused on getting

889
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:52,879
this done it took a lot of time and

890
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:55,960
energy and and everything else and

891
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,680
patience and learning how to screw it up

892
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:00,280
but I wrote the book five times before I

893
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:03,159
wrote the final draft of it the final

894
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:05,079
not not the final final draft but my my

895
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:09,799
first draft that I gave to my new editor

896
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:11,640
which was five versions in so it was a

897
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,920
interesting process man a lot more

898
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:16,118
complicated than I ever would have

899
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,039
thought like WR WR writing a book what

900
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:20,920
this book took knowing now compared to

901
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:22,400
what I knew five years ago is a whole

902
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,000
different thing like I was like oh you

903
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,680
just write a book dude like you got good

904
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,358
information then you get someone to go

905
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:30,480
take the photos and that's done you know

906
00:36:28,358 --> 00:36:33,119
in my head but really that's not it it's

907
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:36,760
way more in depth you gotta have a good

908
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:39,240
vision for it dude Angela Baka who did

909
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:41,040
the editing she basically helped

910
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:42,559
organize me she was up at 400 am and I

911
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:44,679
was up at 5: am working on the book for

912
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:47,400
the last

913
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:49,159
year um yeah we start we she started

914
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:51,000
working a little bit later but like she

915
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:53,358
would be she'd have questions every day

916
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,239
like do this this is needs needs to be

917
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:57,639
fixed or this needs to be Rewritten or

918
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:59,199
this needs to be this and

919
00:36:57,639 --> 00:37:01,920
so

920
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:03,239
by five o'clock I'd be working on it and

921
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,838
I'd be done as quickly as I could

922
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:06,559
sometimes it' take me an hour sometimes

923
00:37:04,838 --> 00:37:09,199
it take me four hours sometimes it' take

924
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:11,039
me four hours and then before but

925
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:13,039
typically in one day I'd do whatever she

926
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:14,599
needed me to do for that day right and

927
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:16,039
you know I don't think she she expected

928
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:17,680
me to do it in a day you know we got the

929
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:20,199
book done really fast it's rare that

930
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:22,919
people could work together and get a

931
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:25,439
book done in the short time that we have

932
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,358
so do you ever get Riders block I do

933
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,960

up every time and the thing is is like

1007
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:18,960
there's that Philosophy from jiujitsu is

1008

like fall down seven stand up eight and

1009
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,039
that that goes across the board I mean

1010
00:40:20,838 --> 00:40:25,159
you can apply that to everything we get

1011
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:27,440
knocked down in life times are tough for

1012
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:29,879
some people but you just got to get up

1013
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,838
and keep fighting big

1014
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:34,000
facts don't be a quitter so what do you

1015
00:40:32,838 --> 00:40:35,358
think the biggest problem with the

1016
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,760
industry right now what do you think

1017
00:40:35,358 --> 00:40:40,960
people are missing the most that are in

1018
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:42,960
the industry what are they missing to be

1019
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,720
successful what what's your take on that

1020
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,358
first let's ask you me I think quality I

1021
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:50,279
think quality is missing the most I

1022
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:53,679
think that quality has come up since

1023
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:55,359
wreck in from where it was cuz initially

1024
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:57,239
it was terrible and now it's gotten

1025
00:40:55,358 --> 00:41:00,039
better it still has a long ways to go

1026
00:40:57,239 --> 00:41:02,000
cuz you know I feel like well there's

1027
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:03,199
only a hand handful of good cultivators

1028
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,880
right so like at the end of the day

1029
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:07,439
there's only so much good weed out there

1030
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,318
like the one not even 1% but like the

1031
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,159
0.1% the stuff that I like the stuff

1032
00:41:09,318 --> 00:41:13,800
that you like there's not a lot of that

1033
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:17,358
on the market be great if there was

1034
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:18,560
more uh or would there or would be I

1035
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:20,318
don't know if there could be more

1036
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:22,440
because it's like you you have the the

1037
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:24,480
cream at the very top and it's like if

1038
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:27,159
there's going to be more then prices

1039
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,358
will probably go down you know yeah

1040
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:29,879
maybe there should be less there should

1041
00:41:28,358 --> 00:41:31,400
be less there should be less yeah

1042
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:33,880
because prices it'd be great if prices

1043
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,519
went back up yeah we need prices up well

1044
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:38,160
and prices haven't changed on the

1045
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:39,639
streets or in the shops you know what I

1046
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:42,399
mean like the problem with dropping

1047
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:44,358
prices is now it always got to be that

1048
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,519
price people don't know nothing about

1049
00:41:44,358 --> 00:41:49,480
fluctuation I think like okay if it's

1050
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:51,639
dropped to 18 or

1051
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:53,559
19 there's always going to be NorCal

1052
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:55,239
Nemos

1053
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:58,239

did you start

1083
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:12,879
smoking uh the weed growing up

1084
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:15,720
was pretty [ __ ] good

1085
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:17,480
considering San Francisco you in the Bay

1086
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:19,759
Area so like I grew up in the bay I

1087
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:22,039
didn't grew up in San Francisco but hey

1088
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,680
I mean a my tolerance is

1089
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:27,639
way [ __ ] smaller than it was right

1090
00:43:24,679 --> 00:43:30,239
now right so well it definitely was less

1091
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:32,279
quality at C at some point early on when

1092
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:34,318
I started smoking and then it only got

1093
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:35,839
better and there was droughts when we

1094
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:38,159
were younger all kinds of stuff there

1095
00:43:35,838 --> 00:43:40,078
was time where you couldn't get anything

1096
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:44,358
there was definitely those once in a

1097
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:47,519

1109
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:18,079

get it and it would still be wet so you

1118
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:37,719
buy a 3.5 gram eth and it would shrink

1119
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:39,838
down like you'd lose more than half a

1120

people you know there's all these

1350

got to rotate it a little bit but yeah I

1661
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:31,359
mean we had Papa Murphy's growing up

whatever Papa Murphy yeah take and bake

1664
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:39,318
I had a couple of those I feel like it's

1665
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:42,039
better nowadays than it used to be back

1666
01:06:39,318 --> 01:06:43,440
in the days so when I was a kid we used

1667
01:06:42,039 --> 01:06:44,760
to get this guy who worked a Round Table

1668
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,159
Pizza I'm not going to shout his name

1669
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:47,799
out because he might not like it but he

1670
01:06:46,159 --> 01:06:49,519
used to put mushrooms on our pizza let's

1671
01:06:47,798 --> 01:06:51,719
set it out what's his name I don't even

1672
01:06:49,519 --> 01:06:53,639
remember but yeah so we put it on the

1673
01:06:51,719 --> 01:06:55,838
pizza the mushrooms and then it was like

1674
01:06:53,639 --> 01:06:57,798
pizza roulette uhhuh some of us got

1675
01:06:55,838 --> 01:06:59,798
really high people didn't get as high

1676
01:06:57,798 --> 01:07:01,880
but like oh nice good stuff yeah we'd

1677
01:06:59,798 --> 01:07:06,119
split the pizza evenly between everybody

1678
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:08,640
and sick good stuff ways to get high

1679
01:07:06,119 --> 01:07:11,599
with mushrooms is there a brand that is

1680
01:07:08,639 --> 01:07:15,480
kind of like this [ __ ] could be

1681
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:16,760
better much hype everybody everybody

1682
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:18,480
here's the thing like I feel like we

1683
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:20,400
need more of a farm to table program

1684
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:22,159
where you get stuff fresher cuz I'll get

1685
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:24,000
stuff from really reputable Brands and I

1686
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:25,879
think the flour was good but then it

1687
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,838
went past his expiration Point that's

1688
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:31,160
why it's got to move fast yeah but uh

1689
01:07:27,838 --> 01:07:33,000
also there was a way to track it you

1690
01:07:31,159 --> 01:07:34,838
know after it gets us to a certain point

1691
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,119
you don't want to smoke it you know

1692
01:07:34,838 --> 01:07:37,318
there's like a certain point but that

1693
01:07:36,119 --> 01:07:40,200
doesn't mean that

1694
01:07:37,318 --> 01:07:41,880
it's yeah that happens with every brand

1695
01:07:40,199 --> 01:07:43,838
yeah so that's more of the industry

1696
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:46,559
industry problem than a brand problem

1697
01:07:43,838 --> 01:07:48,159
but it's still a problem yeah I mean

1698
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:50,240
there's there's a lot of problems with

1699
01:07:48,159 --> 01:07:52,960
the Cannabis industry as it is right now

1700
01:07:50,239 --> 01:07:54,639
