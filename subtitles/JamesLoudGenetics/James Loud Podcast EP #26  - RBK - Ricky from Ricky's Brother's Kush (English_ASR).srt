are

22
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:55,558
legendary uh and I I really want to get

23
00:00:53,558 --> 00:00:57,519
to the bottom of how it all started with

24
00:00:55,558 --> 00:01:00,238
you when did you start smoking let's

25
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,280
start there wow okay and and and there's

26
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:06,079
some stuff to this story that I've never

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,439
told which I will uh because I only

28
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:11,319
recently found out about some of the

29
00:01:08,438 --> 00:01:13,079
background to the genetic itself but uh

30
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:16,599
basically I started smoking in seventh

31
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:18,200
grade um and I'm 55 now so that kind of

32
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:22,239
gives you an idea of how long I've been

33
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:25,159
smoking so that was 81 uh yeah 80 well

34
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:27,478
yeah 81 82 nice and I'll never forget

35
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:29,640
the first time I smoked it put me on my

36
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:31,719
ass I didn't know where I was I was like

37
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,920
what the the [ __ ] was this and we used

38
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:37,239
to go underneath this was a first year

39
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,680
of uh junior high school so we used to

40
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:41,158
go underneath the cafeteria and smoke

41
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,640
and all the smoke would go up into the

42
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,880
cafeteria and the people working could

43
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,399
smell it and stuff but they didn't know

44
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:48,920
where it was coming from because we were

45
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:51,399
underneath the school cafeteria anyway

46
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,960
um I always I enjoyed it after that I

47
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:54,280
got used to it the paranoia never really

48
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:55,679
hit me you know people would always say

49
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,439
oh the first time I smoked it I got

50
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,799
paranoid blah blah blah blah and that

51
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:03,118
never happened to me I just felt in

52
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:05,118
incredibly slow and I kind of liked that

53
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:06,920
feeling you know it kind of relaxed me

54
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:08,479
but I was like Colombian you know I

55
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,959
think was the first thing I ever wow

56
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,080
Colombia is typically known for its

57
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,680
strength yeah it was it was really

58
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,280
strong it wasn't you know the one thing

59
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,760
that was funny is I don't recall it

60
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,080
being smooth at all I recall it being

61
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:22,919
incredibly harsh huh um but that's what

62
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,440
we started with we used to get it from

63
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:25,839
this guy named George we used to call

64
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:28,639
him lumbo George because that's all he

65
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,120
used to have was Colombian yeah and uh

66
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:32,399
that was the first thing I smoked and

67
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,080
then I remember someone had some

68
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,039
chocolate tie and I was like oh what's

69
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,680
that and you know little by little I

70
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:39,840
started discovering that there were

71
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,280
other strains of and where was this this

72
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,479
was in Marina del Reay junior high

73
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,560
school and down in Los Angeles awesome

74
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:48,318
and um I maintained the smoking pretty

75
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,840
much from that point all the way through

76
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:54,238
high school and then I ended up in the

77
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,360
Army and I stayed in the Army for 10

78
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,280
years from 1986 to

79
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,319
1996 and I didn't really smoke then you

80
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,039
during that time time period you

81
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:03,479
obviously really couldn't get away with

82
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:06,359
it because the military would you know

83
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:10,280
drug test you and stuff so I I pretty

84
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:13,319
much had stopped and then once I got out

85
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:17,598
uh I was reintroduced to the new flavors

86
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:21,280
that were now existing in the 90s and

87
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:23,719
um I continued to smoke and then I

88
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,439
started working in the music industry I

89
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:27,359
started working for the band Suicidal

90
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,878
Tendencies wow and they didn't really

91
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,920
smoke none of those guys in the band

92
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:33,158
really really did any anything but I

93
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:35,399
still maintained it and then from there

94
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:37,438
I graduated to working for Snoop Dogg

95
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,920
and I started working with him in

96
00:03:37,438 --> 00:03:43,799
2000 and that's when my smoking really

97
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:46,399
went through the roof like that guy wow

98
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:50,280
he smokes a lot it down yeah and he

99
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,760
loves it and it then I really started to

100
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:57,799
get into it and that's how I came across

101
00:03:52,759 --> 00:04:00,479
this beautiful plant the the 98 Kush my

102
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:02,438
brother um was growing it when I first

103
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,840
started working for Snoop in 2000 he had

104
00:04:02,438 --> 00:04:06,438
still been growing it and Snoop had

105
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,759
asked me hey can you get any bud I'm

106
00:04:06,438 --> 00:04:10,598
like yeah from my brother so I brought

107
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:13,000
some to him and he was like oh this is

108
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:14,719
amazing I love this can you get more

109
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,680
yeah I can get more and he says good

110
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:18,560
bring it on tour and I was his Road

111
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:22,639
manager so I would bring a couple of

112
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:25,079
pounds but it would um go really quick a

113
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,639
pound how fast literally I would say we'

114
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:29,918
go through a pound at least in a week

115
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:32,038
but it's and then now you know this is

116
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:34,560
not all Snoop smoking it to the head

117
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:37,279
right you know his typical day would be

118
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,360
like you know I'll roll a blunt and

119
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:41,038
he'll smoke it and while he's smoking it

120
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,038
he's rolling up another one and he takes

121
00:04:41,038 --> 00:04:44,639
the one that he's just L passes it and

122
00:04:43,038 --> 00:04:46,879
it kind of goes around the corner and

123
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,560
you know now everybody's smoking so it

124
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:54,000
went quickly because he shared the

125
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:55,839
wealth from this experience came uh you

126
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,639
know I need to get more and I'm like

127
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:00,638
well we're in freaking Oklahoma how am I

128
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,000
supposed to get it here

129
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:07,519
so I met Adam Dunn of all people of

130
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,759
course yeah and he was I I immediately

131
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:11,079
called him and said hey bro can you do

132
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,879
me a favor uh I'm going to give you this

133
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:14,879
genetic if you can kind of like

134
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:17,120
strategically place it in a few areas

135
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,120
across the country for me and grow it

136
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,478
out this would be really helpful so then

137
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,038
I I'm never running out and so he did he

138
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:25,120
put it in a few different spots and

139
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:28,719
actually took it to Europe so it was in

140
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,478
Amsterdam for a little while and um we

141
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,919
just kept it going for the entire run

142
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,038
that I was with Snoop I'd always have a

143
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:36,719
little bit here and there and I I met AJ

144
00:05:34,038 --> 00:05:40,000
Sour Diesel uh in that process and he

145
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,160
was growing it for me and so it was it

146
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,839
was good it was a good situation now the

147
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,039
funny thing is is a couple years into

148
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:49,758
this let's

149
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:52,399
say 2002 2003 I suppose

150
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,960
um everyone had lost the genetic

151
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:58,000
including my brother wow and I'm not a

152
00:05:54,959 --> 00:06:00,079
grower I'm just one that I you know I I

153
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,240
was responsible for sourcing the weed so

154
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:05,359
I became kind of a connoisseur and uh

155
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,240
fortunately for Adam you know keeping it

156
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:12,919
alive we had it and my brother was

157
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:16,000
growing it um with uh wonderbrett yeah

158
00:06:12,918 --> 00:06:18,680
and he was growing it with uh Kenji um

159
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,918
from Dr Green Thum totally and um

160
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,800
obviously Josh D Josh D so it's all the

161
00:06:20,918 --> 00:06:27,680
same it's all the same and apparently

162
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:29,478
they had all lost it as well yeah um and

163
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,560
I never really said anything to any

164
00:06:29,478 --> 00:06:34,079
anyone and I only found out that those

165
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,720
three guys had it recently when I was

166
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:38,439
talking to my brother about it I said

167
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:41,400
hey you know what where did you get this

168
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:42,360
from and it turns out that he had got it

169
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:45,598
from

170
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,840
Wonderbread um they did a deal where my

171
00:06:45,598 --> 00:06:50,038
brother worked on his place doing some

172
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:52,399
electrical work and the deal was is hey

173
00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:54,240
you I'll do your electrical work you you

174
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:55,878
give me the cut and that's kind of how

175
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,319
my brother ended up with it and when

176
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:00,000
before my brother gave it to me he said

177
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,960
hey bro you know

178
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,759
I'm not supposed to give this to

179
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:06,318
anybody right but I'll Trust you that

180
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:08,479
you're not going to like put it on the

181
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,560
market or do anything with it I said n

182
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:12,800
that I got a job I don't not not

183
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,000
interested in doing that you know right

184
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,439
anyway that's kind of how it all came

185
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,800
about and then recently when I found out

186
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,319
the whole story I actually went back to

187
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,000
wonder Brett and I went to Josh and I

188
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:26,598
went to Kenji and I gave it back so now

189
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,800
they have they have it nice yeah I felt

190
00:07:26,598 --> 00:07:32,519
it was important that the guys who

191
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,439
started all had it but in the process of

192
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:37,279
of getting it to Adam he had asked me he

193
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:38,719
says what is it I said it's Kush he says

194
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:40,598
well kind of kush I said [ __ ] I don't

195
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,479
know it's like really good all I know is

196
00:07:40,598 --> 00:07:44,680
it sells for like six to 8,000 a pound

197
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:45,959
right now so yeah you know he's all well

198
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,959
where did you get it I said I got it

199
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:49,239
from my

200
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:52,439
brother he named it Ricky's brother's

201
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,000
Kush he coined the term sounds like Adam

202
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:55,439
he's so good at marketing you know he's

203
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,560
we have a collaboration together he's

204
00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:01,719
just he's insane so it was like you know

205
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,720
uh couple years ago he said Rick you

206
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,720
know we we're still the only ones that I

207
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:09,840
know of that currently have this cut we

208
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,720
should start a brand and I was like okay

209
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,279
what do I need to do and then we kind of

210
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,000
talked it out and figured out that there

211
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:18,359
was a story behind it that we could

212
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,279
Market it in such a way and so I started

213
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,080
to do something here in California I was

214
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:24,598
working with a guys who had a place

215
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:26,120
called Funkadelic Farms yeah but a

216
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:28,399
couple years ago when they had those big

217
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:31,120
fires in the Santa Rosa area and stuff

218
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:33,759
the farm went up and smoke so a lot of

219
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,719
farms yeah so that kind of like held me

220
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:37,038
up and I was like oh crap all right well

221
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:39,120
let's see what if I could do something

222
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:41,120
else with someone else and I worked out

223
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,759
another deal with a company down in La

224
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,799
uh I won't name their name because they

225
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:47,240
pissed me off and we ended up like in a

226
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:49,799
really bad situation they were just

227
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:52,120
trying to steal the genetic ultimately

228
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:54,079
but I discovered some things about the

229
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,919
industry you know and building the brand

230
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,399
and stuff you really can't come out the

231
00:08:56,919 --> 00:09:01,759
the shoot with just one thing on one

232
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:03,399
skew and really kind of do something

233
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:06,200
successful you really kind of like have

234
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:09,120
to breed with it and do other things and

235
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,240
cultivate So Adam and I had discussed it

236
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,560
and he started making crosses with it

237
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,000
and started doing other things so now

238
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:16,679
we're ramping up so in Michigan I'm

239
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,919
actually launching Ricky's California

240
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:21,278
Originals with several different uh

241
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:25,039
mutations of this when you're going MSO

242
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:26,958
too I heard uh we're going to try I mean

243
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:29,240
like that's the the ultimate goal is to

244
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:31,958
try to get it into various places and

245
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:34,360
and working under a bigger umbrella um

246
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:36,039
so I'm excited cuz now I know the ins

247
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,680
and outs of what's going on who to look

248
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:40,919
for who not to look for uh what you know

249
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:44,599
how to promote something how to like

250
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:46,919
really uh what would you say curate

251
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,800
properly what people really want I mean

252
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:50,679
because I consider this like a you know

253
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:53,479
it's a top tier butt in my opinion you

254
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:56,039
know it really is and in my opinion it

255
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,959
will always come back I feel like OG is

256
00:09:56,039 --> 00:10:00,679
a staple that will always be popular it

257
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,518
it it's just you know sometimes it'll be

258
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:04,039
the most popular thing and other times

259
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:06,240
it won't be quite as popular and we

260
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:08,039
forget I think it's hard to grow I think

261
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,399
it you know some people may get it to

262
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:12,759
yield I never had success getting OG

263
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,480
Kush to yield very well right and so

264
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:16,159
that's that's one of the challenges but

265
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,120
and now purple bud is important

266
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:20,719
everybody wants purple bud I you know

267
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,759
it's not that I'm not a fan I'm a fan of

268
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,480
all of it but OG Kush definitely has a

269
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:29,679
place in my heart and you know a lot of

270
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,159
other people it's just one of those

271
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:32,639
things that it's it's going to make it

272
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:34,399
come back same thing with sour I feel

273
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:37,360
like sour is another challenging plant

274
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:40,240
to grow it has a longer flowering cycle

275
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,839
so question for you the name OG Kush

276
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,200
what's your opinion there's so many

277
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,680
different opinions on where it started

278
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,879
what's your Insight on the fact um

279
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:52,679
actually you know it's funny I I heard

280
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:54,399
uh Kenji talking about that um I don't

281
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:57,719
remember the specifics of it but I don't

282
00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:00,559
think they used OG as like what was it

283
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:02,040
Ocean Grown or organic

284
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,638
like there was all these things that

285
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:05,838
people were saying but it really just

286
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:08,839
comes down to like it's the original

287
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:11,000
it's this is the one that started it so

288
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:12,519
uh that's how I always looked at it is

289
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,120
that it just meant that it was the

290
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:17,799
original um everything you mentioned too

291
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,919
in terms of like how it's grown who's

292
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:23,240
growing it like the various levels of it

293
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:25,479
like the gentleman that grew this um

294
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,360
they have a company called uh third eye

295
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,959
Organics yeah and they do everything in

296
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,720
living soil and you know they grow it to

297
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:35,838
a level that I really hadn't seen in a

298
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,600
long long time in terms of the quality

299
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,680
and stuff like that I've seen other

300
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,399
people grow it and I'm like dude this

301
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:43,879
isn't Kush this is mush this is terrible

302
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,320
like yeah if you don't grow it right and

303
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:49,000
it's a finicky plant extremely from what

304
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,399
I see yeah and and as far as like if you

305
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,919
don't grow it really well it doesn't

306
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,159
come out great it doesn't come out with

307
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:56,799
the chps quite as perfect you could hit

308
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:58,679
it one time and get a perfect 10 and it

309
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:01,439
checks all the boxes and then the next

310
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:02,519
time you grow it's not quite as good uh

311
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,040
and you know there's some people that

312
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:07,000
perfected it but I think a lot of people

313
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:08,719
back in the day grew one specific flavor

314
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,360
for a long time and now everyone wants

315
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,800
to grow this this round this this round

316
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,680
and then you know they they quit

317
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:16,958
perfecting those individual flavors and

318
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:18,679
so you're not seeing a ton of good OG

319
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:20,958
cush around I mean Brian from vital gave

320
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:23,000
me some a while back that he's kept the

321
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:25,239
Clone alive for a really long time and

322
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,600
it was really piny it was delicious and

323
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,120
that's the thing with OG is it's got

324
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,560
that Pine see that's the that's what

325
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,959
love about it to me it's like a fine

326
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:38,239
cigar yeah when you have that like pinea

327
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:41,518
old school flavor smell like that to me

328
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,639
is it I I'm not a fan of you know uh ice

329
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,879
cream cake and all these other things

330
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:47,839
even gelato I'm not really a fan of you

331
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:50,958
know I'm like if I want something to be

332
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,560
sweet like that or like I I I'll go eat

333
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,559
a bowl of cereal or something I don't

334
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:57,319
want my weed to be that way I want it to

335
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:59,679
be that Pine that that taste and I did

336
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:02,440
notice this huge transend

337
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:03,838
of uh you know all the people wanting

338
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,760
color and I don't I I don't really

339
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,160
personally get it you know I have tried

340
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:10,439
some of it that's pretty good um I did

341
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:13,399
try a really really great cut of the

342
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,360
original blueberry that was just amazing

343
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:16,039
so it's funny because there's an

344
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,199
original blueberry from Oregon and then

345
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:20,198
there's DJ shorts blueberry and they get

346
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:22,278
interchanged and one is a sativa and one

347
00:13:20,198 --> 00:13:23,439
is an indicia and I like both of them

348
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:26,159
for different

349
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,160
reasons um you know and I grew the

350
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:29,679
original back in the day in my garage in

351
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:31,919
the '90s

352
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:34,039
um and it was it was this massive Spear

353
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:36,519
of a plant you know what I mean whereas

354
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:39,039
DJ shorts is a shorter bushier plant

355
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:41,799
that uh they both have blueberry TPS and

356
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:42,958
they're both great yeah I mean I I never

357
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:44,799
thought that I would like something

358
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:47,759
again that tasted like a food because it

359
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:50,519
literally smells like a blueberry muffin

360
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:53,078
um you know and but I did enjoy it and I

361
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:55,240
like I I must have had the uh the Inda

362
00:13:53,078 --> 00:13:58,039
side of it because it really was a heavy

363
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:00,600
like high I'm I'm not a fan of sativas

364
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:03,078
yeah well you know a lot of people

365
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,440
consider OG Kusha sativa from one

366
00:14:03,078 --> 00:14:06,359
perspective but I feel like it's a

367
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,320
hybrid and it has the sedative effects

368
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,399
of an indicia but it's very uplifting as

369
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,000
well and it's one of those flavors that

370
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:14,958
I feel like I can smoke in the morning

371
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,120
in the afternoon and night and still get

372
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:19,399
the same great effect and it's one of

373
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,198
those things OG Kush is a little

374
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:24,440
different in my opinion in the sense

375
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:25,879
that your pallette doesn't adapt to it

376
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,120
like some other things where like after

377
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:29,198
two weeks you got to smoke something

378
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,600
else if it's really good GE you're going

379
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:34,399
to smoke it till it's gone and you can

380
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:36,040
keep smoking it and I feel like with

381
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,839
experience you know and experienced

382
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:40,838
Growers and and cultivators and smokers

383
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:43,480
that OG Kush is just one of those things

384
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:45,360
that we enjoy I mean as you mentioned

385
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,879
earlier you know when guys were growing

386
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,800
back then they were growing specifically

387
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:50,679
one style yeah you know so everybody

388
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:52,799
kind of like shared their recipe and

389
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:54,958
everyone knew to grow it at a certain

390
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:56,599
level and and that's what I enjoyed back

391
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:59,000
then it's like if my brother didn't have

392
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,159
it if I needed it get from Kenji I

393
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,720
didn't know Josh at the time and I

394
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:03,879
didn't know Wonder Brett but I knew that

395
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:06,399
people could get stuff from them right

396
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:08,559
um so like again once you once it was

397
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,360
consistent between that Core Group it

398
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:11,958
was kind of interchangeable oh I so and

399
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:16,039
so doesn't have it but so and so does

400
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:17,638
and it's it's equally as good right um I

401
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:20,319
do notice

402
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:22,039
that this particular plant even grown

403
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,079
outdoor though if it's grown properly

404
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:27,399
yeah it's [ __ ] fire it really is like

405
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:30,519
I it might even be better than indor in

406
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:32,480
some some ways yeah the turps the turps

407
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:34,120
I feel like outdoor if you if you do it

408
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,800
right I think there's something to be

409
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,399
said for those guys that do the soil

410
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:39,240
grown and then they use you know some of

411
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:41,679
the guys that do guano and stuff like

412
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,600
that or seagull [ __ ] seagull [ __ ]

413
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:46,000
seagull [ __ ] okay that's a new one to me

414
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,720
those guys on the you in NorCal they do

415
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,159
yeah I mean it's just yeah it's it's

416
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,720
amazing and some of these guys and it

417
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:52,838
makes it taste a little bit different it

418
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,360
doesn't taste like seagull [ __ ]

419
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,680
obviously just like with guano but it

420
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,399
definitely brings out the flavor and

421
00:15:55,679 --> 00:16:01,439
brings out a unique characteristic to it

422
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:04,720
that very distinct in certain regions

423
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,160
you know of meno and of humble these

424
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,199
guys are doing some really cool stuff

425
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:10,679
and the real OG guys that are growing OG

426
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:12,758
get these amazing expressions and those

427
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:15,039
guys still get top dollar for their bud

428
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:18,079
it's like my friend down in uh La um

429
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:20,480
shout out to Mark strain he has a he he

430
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:22,919
grows aquaponically yeah so his stuff

431
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:26,278
comes out even different from the

432
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:28,679
outdoor from the typical Hydro uh I love

433
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:31,159
the way his strains come out he has a

434
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:35,318
[ __ ] amazing uh original Indiana

435
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:37,159
bubblegum crossed um what is it it's

436
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:40,000
with the sour diesel so it's called sour

437
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:42,519
gum oh my God I love that [ __ ] strain

438
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,240
it really is phenomenal and then he has

439
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:46,639
an OG himself that's called scoopo that

440
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,560
is again it's another it's like a

441
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:52,198
skittles cross with an OG and that one

442
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:54,239
is another one that I really like yeah

443
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:56,000
Skittles OG a lot of people are doing

444
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,159
Skittles OG and I think a lot of people

445
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,559
are doing it wrong and then there's a

446
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:02,360
handful of guys doing it right where

447
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:05,240
it's not diet Skittles it's not you

448
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,838
think where it's like a a weaker version

449
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,038
of the Skittles you want it to be turpy

450
00:17:06,838 --> 00:17:11,159
it's got to be turpy whether it's OG or

451
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:14,240
Skittles or a combination of the two you

452
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:16,480
it's they're they're both so uniquely

453
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,959
strong in flavor that it's got to have a

454
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,720
punch to it yeah his his scopio has

455
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,480
exactly what you describe it has a punch

456
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:27,480
it has that really nice smell too it's

457
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:29,279
like H we just did a we did a back Cross

458
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,279
or not a back cross but we did across of

459
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:35,240
with uh chem dog Double D and some of

460
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:36,798
the fenos were kind of had a hazy smell

461
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,000
you know and we're like where's this

462
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:41,000
smell coming from and then some of them

463
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,079
were like dude it's like you just opened

464
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,519
up a jar of pine salt this is the one

465
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:47,159
this is the one we want you know yeah so

466
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:49,000
we're we're excited about some of these

467
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,360
crosses and hopefully we get a chance

468
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,160
Michigan is where we'll launch first

469
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:53,839
with them yeah and then ultimately I'll

470
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,519
bring them back out here like the

471
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:59,959
California Market I'm discovering too

472
00:17:56,519 --> 00:18:01,798
ISO this place is insane to get things

473
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,640
going you know I mean with between

474
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:06,639
Taxation and competition and everything

475
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,000
that's going on it's like this is a

476
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,520
really hard Market to to break into

477
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,119
you'll never flood it but in order for

478
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:17,158
you to get into it and make a staple for

479
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:19,798
yourself um it's difficult it is

480
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:22,280
difficult for sure for sure and you know

481
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:24,639
I mean we're still in the infancy of

482
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:26,440
legalization you know as far as

483
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,440
recreational you know and it's not even

484
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,120
legal on a federal level but eventually

485
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,080
going to stabilize a little bit more

486
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:33,879
it's going to be easier for people to

487
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:36,199
break into or harder depending on how

488
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,360
you look at it but it's definitely going

489
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,319
to stabilize a little more and right now

490
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:42,839
it's just so unstable it goes up one

491
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,079
year down the next year you know and in

492
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:46,759
one month to the next it can be

493
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:48,839
completely different 100% And I'm I'm

494
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:51,240
noticing too it's like it's not really

495
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:53,199
so much like I I I saw the celebrity

496
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,359
Brands coming out you know but unless

497
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,038
you're doing it like the guys in Dr

498
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:59,839
Green Thumb where your your artist

499
00:18:58,038 --> 00:19:03,279
that's actually backing it

500
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:04,959
is entrenched in the the culture you

501
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:06,200
know you well I'm backed by quality I

502
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,200
think that's where a lot of guys were

503
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,919
like I got a big name I'm gonna jump in

504
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,720
and throw my name out there but if you

505
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,400
don't back it with quality you're GNA

506
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,480
have problems it's it's pointless you

507
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:18,640
know and and it's weird too because I've

508
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:21,000
noticed the uh the difference in

509
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,360
marketing in terms of rock and roll

510
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,440
bands trying to get into it and then the

511
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:27,558
hip-hop guys trying to get into it right

512
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,880
the hip-hop guys like the culture

513
00:19:27,558 --> 00:19:31,839
flipped too because remember back in the

514
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,159
day like I'm a huge Metal Head you know

515
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:34,798
for somebody who worked in hip-hop for

516
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:38,360
as long as I did I never really listened

517
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:40,158
to it I'm you know Black Sabbath ACDC

518
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:42,399
you know I love punk rock all that stuff

519
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:45,200
yeah seur is awesome I mean like all

520
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:48,440
that stuff uh Mega Death all all

521
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,279
everything you know metal or Rock was my

522
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,798
thing but I remember the artists from

523
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:55,359
the 70s smoking weed was there you know

524
00:19:53,798 --> 00:19:56,879
Black Sabbath sweet leaf you know all

525
00:19:55,359 --> 00:20:00,000
this stuff you're you know you'd see

526
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:02,360
that and then here comes the 80s and the

527
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
90s with music and they stopped really

528
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:06,558
talking about smok and pot they did it

529
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,919
just kind of like faded away and then

530
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:10,519
the hip-hop guys came in with like you

531
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:11,759
know wearing a [ __ ] outfit made of

532
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:14,200
blunt

533
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:16,079
wraps know they're like all about it

534
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,440
they're just pushing pushing and pushing

535
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:19,798
it and you know but I have seen that the

536
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,919
guys that are trying to get into the

537
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:24,000
game in the hip-hop world are starting

538
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,799
to see the same thing that the if you

539
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,599
don't if you're not really all about it

540
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:31,400
and you're just in it for the money the

541
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:34,399
consumers see that and they just don't

542
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,880
it doesn't resonate totally into sales

543
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,600
and then rock and roll guys I mean I've

544
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:43,320
seen Azie had a had a line uh Anthrax I

545
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:44,959
think had a line motohead had a line but

546
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:47,240
you don't ever see these guys smoking on

547
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,720
camera no you know you don't see them

548
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,400
pushing it it's rare it's extremely rare

549
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,679
it's rare these guys are public about it

550
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,400
even though there's a lot of consumers

551
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:55,679
out there for sure but the hip-hop guys

552
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,840
they they're all about it they're

553
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,000
smoking in every it's part of their yeah

554
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:03,279
it's it's directly part of their culture

555
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,880
and influence on their music 100% And I

556
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:08,119
think it influences The Rock eyes they

557
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,159
just don't push it that way right you

558
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:11,558
know and where they used to again they

559
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,720
used to be a part of the music and now

560
00:21:11,558 --> 00:21:15,038
it's not so they'll flip and I I

561
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,600
wouldn't even say a flip because hip hop

562
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:18,640
didn't really exist in the 70s and the

563
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:21,599
early 80s it started you know getting

564
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,559
more popular as the 80s went on but um

565
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:24,918
you know just the trend of who was

566
00:21:23,558 --> 00:21:26,918
pushing what and what they were willing

567
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:28,600
to do with it the hip-hop guys took it

568
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:30,799
to a whole new level be

569
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:33,038
be real I he's yeah he took it to the

570
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:35,879
next level you know I give that guy so

571
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:37,440
much credit in in the sense of what he

572
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,440
was willing the the bullets he was

573
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,320
willing to take for doing it like he put

574
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,440
himself out there he didn't give a [ __ ]

575
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:45,200
the [ __ ] that he used to say yeah he did

576
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,759
not give a

577
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,679
[ __ ] I I I commend that I mean like you

578
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:53,519
know Snoop is another one obviously that

579
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:55,720
really started doing that as well but I

580
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:57,519
I I have to put be as the the front

581
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,360
runner in terms of what he was able to

582
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:01,038
do for the culture and really just

583
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:02,639
putting himself out there and and not

584
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:04,759
giving a [ __ ] it was amazing you know

585
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,200
back in the 90s when Cypress hell Hill

586
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:09,278
was like all about the weed people

587
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,319
throwing [ __ ] joints on stage you

588
00:22:09,278 --> 00:22:12,839
know like you got other shows where

589
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:14,319
girls are throwing their panties in the

590
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:15,639
Cypress Hill shows I mean they're doing

591
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:17,519
that too but they're throwing massive

592
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:19,120
amounts of weed on the stage I think

593
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:22,440
they were the first ones actually that

594
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:24,319
like really did not give a [ __ ] about

595
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,000
doing it on stage you know and the funny

596
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:29,200
thing is around the same time there was

597
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,599
panta right and pant so I was in the

598
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,679
metal back in the day too I love you

599
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:35,719
know I love all aspects of music there's

600
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,080
pretty much no genre that I I can't

601
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,480
appreciate and panta back in the day

602
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:43,119
they were all about weed too you know

603
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,839
dime bag back in the day smoking rest in

604
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:48,119
peace dime bag you can't get that name

605
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:49,599
if you know if you don't smoke yeah you

606
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:51,479
know well and then it kind of it didn't

607
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:53,639
die with them but it it definitely

608
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,038
didn't evolve and grow into kind of what

609
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,080
hip-hop has done 100% And I know you

610
00:22:56,038 --> 00:23:00,798
know I'm I won't name names but I knew

611
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:02,480
do know quite a few of these guys that

612
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:03,679
hit me up and like hey bro can you hook

613
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,319
me up with some bud I'm coming through

614
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,159
town yeah no problem but they won't

615
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:08,599
flaunt it they don't talk about it so I

616
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:10,840
won't put them on the spot and say oh I

617
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:12,480
know so and so smokes or whatever but I

618
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:14,839
wish they would I wish they would for

619
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,640
the culture and for the the the the you

620
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:18,798
know getting it normalized by people by

621
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,880
saying look at what these guys are

622
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:23,240
capable of doing and they still smoke

623
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:26,919
yeah I mean alcohol I think alcohol is

624
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:29,159
synonymous with metal absolutely it it

625
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:31,240
really has become part of that that

626
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:34,480
culture getting drunk you know having

627
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:36,519
that Jack Daniels you know I mean dime

628
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,759
panta were legendary I heard that he

629
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:40,158
used to have like a personal bartender

630
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:42,158
that traveled with them and would just

631
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,840
be mixing drinks on stage for them and

632
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:46,520
you know oh dude yeah I mean they're old

633
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:49,519
they had some old videos on VHS tapes I

634
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:51,240
still have those um but yeah of them you

635
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:53,480
know constantly puking they were smoking

636
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,200
weed and stuff too you know but like

637
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:58,000
constantly getting so hammered that they

638
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,798
were throwing up and you know I think

639
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,200
that's and a lot of cult that was very

640
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:04,158
very public they were very public about

641
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,440
the alcohol whereas I think alcohol is

642
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,320
kind of widespread but as far as an

643
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:12,440
alternative to alcohol weed is such a

644
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:15,960
better option 100% God I

645
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:19,278
mean you know we never discussed

646
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:21,519
obviously until I would say maybe within

647
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:23,720
the last nine years where people really

648
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:27,839
started talking about the potential

649
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:30,000
medicinal side of cannabis like I never

650
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:32,798
call it being a topic of conversation

651
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,720
we've been using it since 96

652
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:37,720
yeah for that purpose for that purpose

653
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,480
yeah but I mean I don't recall it ever

654
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,839
being like part of the real conversation

655
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,558
in terms of what people wanted and then

656
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:44,798
when I saw it started to go legal people

657
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:48,200
oh it's medical it's medical and I was

658
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:50,000
like what here in the Bay Area Medical

659
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,440
was a big thing I mean Dennis Peron said

660
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,159
it's medical whether you believe it or

661
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,320
not and that's how always I've I've used

662
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:56,880
that to to my I've used that on my

663
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:59,759
parents I've used that on a million

664
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,278
other people that smok and you know but

665
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:03,359
uh I know what you mean it's really got

666
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:05,919
more I think and I think a lot of that

667
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:08,119
was 60 minutes when sanj Gupta came on

668
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,360
and was like look at this kid and we

669
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:11,839
give him this you know this medicine

670
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:12,959
that's made from a plant and he has

671
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:15,199
seizures and now he doesn't have

672
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,919
seizures how can you argue with a parent

673
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:20,399
that wants to give their kid you know

674
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:23,278
plant medicine and it's that changed my

675
00:25:20,398 --> 00:25:24,959
parents mind 100% you know I think in

676
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:27,278
most people if you were to watch that

677
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,278
it's hard to deny the fact that if you

678
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:31,000
give

679
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:32,640
a kid medicine you know that that's your

680
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,599
right to give a kid medicine that heals

681
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,120
your kid I mean I hate that the

682
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:38,918
government wants to get in the way of

683
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:41,319
these kinds of things considering that

684
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:44,360
you know from what I've I've read in in

685
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:46,639
terms of like cannabis being involved in

686
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:48,519
medicine way back you know when they

687
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,440
used to have the so-called snake oil

688
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:52,278
salesman running around in the wild wild

689
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,159
west or whatever but you'd see that that

690
00:25:52,278 --> 00:25:56,119
bottle of their medicine and then they

691
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,278
would say you know 20% cannabis or

692
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:59,199
whatever you're like what the [ __ ]

693
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:01,599
really was was back around that time oh

694
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:05,159
yeah you know and then you find out that

695
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:07,480
they you were not allowed to do um

696
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:09,640
scientific research on the plant it like

697
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:11,640
completely outlawed you know and then

698
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:13,759
you find out that around the world that

699
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:16,759
wasn't necessarily the case no but even

700
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:18,480
2,000 years ago you know and more than

701
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:20,558
that you know we've used it as plant

702
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,679
medicine for a long time I said Steve

703
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:26,038
D'Angelo on a couple weeks ago he has a

704
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:28,159
retreat in Jamaica where they expose you

705
00:26:26,038 --> 00:26:30,798
to plant medicine and teach you all

706
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:33,080
kinds of cool stuff and pretty wild yeah

707
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:35,359
when you go to the uh The Hemp Museum in

708
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:37,439
Amsterdam you find out you could make a

709
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:39,918
[ __ ] car out of this stuff like you

710
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,720
can do so many things with it converted

711
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,360
into energy there's just so yeah hemp

712
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,798
creete you know I think these are all

713
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:47,359
the future future endeavors too that you

714
00:26:45,798 --> 00:26:49,000
know I mean people are working on it now

715
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:52,119
but I think it's going to be more

716
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,319
mainstream I think the personal I guess

717
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:55,959
you could say opinion of uh that might

718
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:58,240
sound kind of conspiracy to the whole

719
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:02,278
thing is I I believe the reason it was

720
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:04,278
placed in such a uh category where

721
00:27:02,278 --> 00:27:06,880
people weren't allowed to do certain cuz

722
00:27:04,278 --> 00:27:09,480
anyone could [ __ ] do it yeah you know

723
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,640
and and that that's not how capitalists

724
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:14,120
work you know you got to be able to

725
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:17,640
monopolize what's out there and you you

726
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:19,599
can't let the average person really

727
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:22,399
prosper and if you give everyone the

728
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:25,319
opportunity to do it suddenly no one can

729
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:27,879
be the king no one can find you know can

730
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:30,158
benefit financially of it unless you

731
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,760
squash that ability to do it I that's my

732
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,760
personal opinion because it makes no

733
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:37,278
sense otherwise why it's been outlawed

734
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:40,119
and illegal for so long well I think it

735
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:41,720
was racially motivated and also a

736
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:44,719
movement against the hippies the long

737
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:47,159
hairs well again coming down to it if

738
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,200
you uh you know could be racially

739
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:51,120
motivated but it's also financially

740
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,278
motivated because yeah you keep them

741
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:55,839
from that's all the same thing racially

742
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:58,759
motivated at a certain level it's about

743
00:27:55,839 --> 00:28:00,480
money yeah right yeah yeah it's it's sad

744
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:01,879
unfortunately but it's getting better

745
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,640
you know I hope the the government gets

746
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:05,720
its head out of its ass and legalizes it

747
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:08,799
everywhere across the board yeah it it

748
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:11,720
needs to it needs to be at this point it

749
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:13,639
needs to be and I descheduling is what

750
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,798
needs to happen not rescheduling I think

751
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:17,840
the schedule three thing is

752
00:28:15,798 --> 00:28:19,359
[ __ ] said I've said it a bunch of

753
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:21,398
times over the last few months but it's

754
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:23,278
total [ __ ] Des schedu it you don't

755
00:28:21,398 --> 00:28:24,719
schedule tobacco you don't schedule

756
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:26,000
alcohol in the same sense you know

757
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,960
they're Controlled Substances but

758
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,119
they're not a scheduled drug

759
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,960
100% agree with that you know and and in

760
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:34,798
Israel they they're like the only

761
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:39,038
country on earth I think that has been

762
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:40,679
doing actual research about the plant

763
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:42,558
you know there's other places too but

764
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:45,240
yeah I mean Israel is special because

765
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:47,558
there's not as much red tape so they're

766
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:50,159
a lot further ahead with stuff as far as

767
00:28:47,558 --> 00:28:53,200
drug Discovery and you know clinical

768
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:56,480
studies on specific ailments is using

769
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,360
cannaboids Dy mui he's a you know he's

770
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,599
he's leading the the pack on that one

771
00:28:58,359 --> 00:29:01,278
over in Israel but it's pretty

772
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:03,558
impressive you know and if we just kind

773
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:05,720
of open that up it's amazing the things

774
00:29:03,558 --> 00:29:08,200
we're going to find yeah I'm I'm I'm

775
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,679
excited for the future of cannabis in

776
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:13,038
terms of what they're going to discover

777
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:15,240
it can do I I do believe it is uh

778
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:18,278
Americal plant in a lot of ways that we

779
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:21,399
still haven't tapped into yeah um so I

780
00:29:18,278 --> 00:29:24,159
had the opportunity to uh go to Lebanon

781
00:29:21,398 --> 00:29:25,759
I went to Beirut and I was considered to

782
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,960
be one of the few westerners that

783
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:30,038
actually got to walk the fields of

784
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:32,880
cannabis where they make all the hash

785
00:29:30,038 --> 00:29:37,319
yeah I had never seen anything like this

786
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:39,080
uh it was fields of plants males females

787
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:41,200
didn't matter you know it just like as

788
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:43,439
far as the eye can see hectors and

789
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,440
hectors it was insane and I was like

790
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,960
what the [ __ ] is this and my friend who

791
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:51,840
took me there he's a CEO of a really big

792
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,640
oil company I won't say who um you know

793
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:55,038
he's he was like don't worry you're safe

794
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,360
because I noticed as we were walking

795
00:29:55,038 --> 00:30:00,879
these fields there are these um

796
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:02,798
portraits of Martyrs hanging and I'm

797
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,320
what's what's that and he says oh that's

798
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:06,158
a martyr from Hezbollah I was like

799
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:08,000
Hezbollah and he's don't worry you're

800
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,960
with me you're safe and I was like well

801
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,720
what the [ __ ] why is that here he's well

802
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,798
this crop is dedicated to that martyr

803
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,600
and whatever they make from that it

804
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:20,240
helps Finance part of their cause and I

805
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:22,278
was like wow oh [ __ ] really and but then

806
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,839
I got to watch how they do it you know

807
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:26,759
they wear these huge suits of leather

808
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:28,319
and they walk through these fields and

809
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:29,879
all the res just kind of sticks to it

810
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:32,240
and then once they get done walking they

811
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,679
go back to their shed and they scrape it

812
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,480
all off and that's how they make their

813
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:38,320
hash crazy and I was like Wow and their

814
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,599
hash was just out of this [ __ ] world

815
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:42,200
so I but I started asking more and more

816
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:43,918
about the plant there and I guess what

817
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,880
there is a University in Beirut that has

818
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,120
been doing some testing and things and

819
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:50,559
they're saying that that particular

820
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:52,599
strain because it's a feral strain um

821
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:54,720
has some amazing qualities that they're

822
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:56,678
discovering in it but it hasn't been you

823
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,278
know outside of Lebanon it hasn't been

824
00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:01,919
discussed yeah the wild so so I don't

825
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:04,880
know a ton about Lebanon or the studies

826
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:07,480
they're doing but I was in a taxi uh not

827
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:10,278
so long ago and it was Lebanese guy and

828
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:12,440
he was like uh I smelled like weed and

829
00:31:10,278 --> 00:31:14,000
he's like oh so you you smok the good

830
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,960
stuff and I'm like yeah he's like you

831
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,519
smoke hash and then we started talking

832
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,440
about Lebanon and he's like what most

833
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,919
Americans and Europeans don't know they

834
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,399
only know the red Lebanese hash but

835
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:24,600
actually the green stuff is the best

836
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:28,319
stuff over there I had no idea usually

837
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:30,638
green hash is garbage it's uh that I had

838
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:32,200
two small blocks that I mean I was only

839
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:33,918
going to be there for a week and they

840
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,120
gave me enough hash to last me six

841
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,639
[ __ ] months you know they're all Rick

842
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:39,439
here have this and I was like what am I

843
00:31:37,638 --> 00:31:41,719
gonna do with all this I can't take it

844
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,120
with me you know but I smoked it and

845
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:47,839
there was a a I guess kind of like an

846
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:49,000
olive colored yeah a hash it was amazing

847
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:50,480
but I didn't know what you said that

848
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,798
there was the you know I didn't know the

849
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,679
qualities differences yeah and I'd only

850
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:57,480
heard of red Lebanese that I mean that's

851
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:59,759
a you know in Amsterdam when I was there

852
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,399
my friend has a collection of hash Som

853
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:03,679
and he had some red Lebanese at some

854
00:32:01,398 --> 00:32:06,038
point when I was over there you maybe 10

855
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,840
years ago was really good I mean you

856
00:32:06,038 --> 00:32:09,319
know it's where not to change the

857
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:11,359
subject but you know where that big ass

858
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:13,720
explosion happened in in Lebanon a

859
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:16,319
couple years back yeah my hotel was

860
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,798
literally like half a mile from that

861
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:21,599
place had I been there at that time I

862
00:32:17,798 --> 00:32:24,158
would have gotten [ __ ] up wow

863
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:26,678
wild yeah things are wild over there

864
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:28,200
yeah it's a beautiful country though I

865
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:29,880
mean you can still see the devastation

866
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,639
unfortunately from some of the problems

867
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:34,080
that they've had with a few of the wars

868
00:32:31,638 --> 00:32:35,839
but the people like they really do kind

869
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:37,079
of like during the day everyone gets

870
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:38,720
together and they mingle with one

871
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:40,119
another and the traffic is kind of crazy

872
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,319
and everyone's going nuts and they're

873
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:45,158
they're drinking these tiny small cups

874
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:46,720
of uh really really strong coffee you

875
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:48,120
know but they'll like you're in the taxi

876
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,399
they'll they'll drive up they'll stop

877
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:51,278
for a second while they're taking you to

878
00:32:49,398 --> 00:32:52,479
your destination and yell something out

879
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:53,720
the window and a guy will come over and

880
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,839
give them a small little cup and they'll

881
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,240
drink it and they'll take off and

882
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:57,839
they'll go like half a mile and they'll

883
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:01,000
pull over they'll do it again like

884
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:03,038
they're all amped up on [ __ ] wow but um

885
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,960
everyone is just so friendly but at

886
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:08,599
Night the Lights Go Out Christians go

887
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:11,000
over here Muslims go over here the

888
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:12,038
whoever all the factions they separate

889
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,599
and they're they're no longer

890
00:33:12,038 --> 00:33:15,200
interacting with each other but during

891
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:16,839
the day there everyone's really friendly

892
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,480
really cool you got to balance that hash

893
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:21,359
out with coffee

894
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,798
yeah that's probably the case at the end

895
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:25,638
of the night I gotta go to sleep [ __ ]

896
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:27,599
break out that hash yeah uh they are

897
00:33:25,638 --> 00:33:30,319
definitely amped up over there so

898
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:32,199
describe the the the feral the wild

899
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:34,398
cannabis that you saw were they tall

900
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:37,038
lanky plants yeah I got I got pictures

901
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:39,398
with my friend standing in the fields

902
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:41,558
where they're way tall above his head

903
00:33:39,398 --> 00:33:43,199
and then there's other plants that are

904
00:33:41,558 --> 00:33:45,319
kind of you know maybe two three feet

905
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,759
tall but you know they're very again

906
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:52,359
males females uh sativas indicas like

907
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:54,599
it's just every sty like the seed re it

908
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:57,079
Reeds the fields every year well that

909
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:59,240
and they also they have these huge bags

910
00:33:57,079 --> 00:34:00,798
of seeds and they don't it's not like

911
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,159
they just throw them out yeah it's not

912
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:04,519
like a farmer that goes here put one

913
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:06,799
here 6 in here six oh no they're just

914
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:08,918
like like f you know feeding Birds

915
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:12,199
they're just throwing it out and then

916
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:14,118
the watering process like it's insane

917
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:17,398
they don't they they they water it like

918
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:19,519
a rice Patty they just flood the [ __ ]

919
00:34:17,398 --> 00:34:21,440
out of it and it gets so hot there that

920
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:24,039
they just let it sit until it evaporates

921
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,480
and then they flood it again and that's

922
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:27,599
pretty much how they grow it you know

923
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:30,280
and I I kept walking around going you

924
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:33,119
know I think if you guys like took the

925
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:35,639
time to get rid of some of these males

926
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:37,519
and had like crops of nothing but female

927
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:39,639
plants and did it might turn out better

928
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:41,519
but then I started thinking well

929
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:43,480
obviously what's better than what they

930
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:45,199
already got they obviously know what

931
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:47,679
they're doing because the quality of the

932
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:50,358
product is is it's right there you you

933
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,800
know so however they decided to do it is

934
00:34:50,358 --> 00:34:53,440
the way to do it don't change it they

935
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,839
just they they have their

936
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,079
method yeah it's real interesting places

937
00:34:55,838 --> 00:35:00,799
like that and it be interesting to

938
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:03,760
compare the seed stock from 30 years ago

939
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,839
to today and see how it's evolved yeah

940
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,240
uh again it looked it looked ancient in

941
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:10,519
terms of how they did it they would just

942
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:12,639
have big like uh wheelbarrows filled

943
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:14,358
with [ __ ] seeds really cool and they

944
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:16,400
literally just walk up scoop them all up

945
00:35:14,358 --> 00:35:17,559
into a bag and then take their walk

946
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:21,119
through the field and just starts

947
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:23,239
throwing them everywhere wild it's nuts

948
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,720
so where else in the world have you been

949
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:27,559
God you know though I've been fortunate

950
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:30,838
enough to to pretty much go from Iceland

951
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:32,880
all the way down to South Africa from uh

952
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:34,279
Japan all the way down to New Zealand uh

953
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,960
there's a few places I still haven't

954
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:40,480
been that I'm dying to go to but um I've

955
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:43,119
had I've I've seen a lot um Africa

956
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,280
hasn't been the pro it's probably the

957
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:48,358
least explored continent that I've been

958
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,680
to uh Nigeria being probably the

959
00:35:48,358 --> 00:35:53,039
absolute worst of the worst of places

960
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:55,598
that I've been to in terms of cannabis

961
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:57,920
and trying to get stuff there like just

962
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:59,720
terrible like it was the worst weed I'd

963
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:03,200
ever SE it was like Cow Patties it was

964
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:05,399
terrible ter South Africa Cape Town had

965
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:08,159
the best bud they really did out of the

966
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:11,119
whole country uh Johannesburg wasn't

967
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:14,920
good Durban Poison was garbage that I

968
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:17,280
tried got right people too I think yeah

969
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:20,880
I think that helps um but I definitely

970
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:23,480
did not enjoy that at all uh Sardinia

971
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:26,400
Italy you cannot find even a gram of

972
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:28,880
weed I'm like you guys have hash I need

973
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,760
this [ __ ] that you make this from and

974
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,680
they're like we don't have it we don't

975
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:35,280
grow it here we we get all our hash

976
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:36,919
shipped in from Morocco yeah I'm like

977
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,400
[ __ ] what am I going to do trying to I

978
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:41,119
think Italy was like they had a big CBD

979
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:44,519
you know legalization and they were

980
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:46,318
growing huge amounts of CBD and plots of

981
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:48,599
THC and some people ruined it for

982
00:36:46,318 --> 00:36:51,239
everybody it sounds like so now they

983
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:53,838
banned CBD again which is kind of wild

984
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:55,919
it kind of sucks uh you I I do know a

985
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:59,318
couple of guys uh in the country in

986
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:01,039
certain cities Milan mainly that that

987
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:04,239
grow

988
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:06,960
um I do have a a funny story on tour and

989
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:09,199
I don't mind telling this one so we're

990
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,559
in um Sweden and I don't know if you

991
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:14,679
recall this I think it was in

992
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:17,318
2007 or 2008 where Snoop had gotten

993
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:21,239
arrested yeah and uh he had gotten

994
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:24,599
arrested uh from a roadblock that the

995
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:26,358
police had set up specifically for him

996
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:28,160
and he was in a car and I don't remember

997
00:37:26,358 --> 00:37:30,598
the the young lady's name but she was an

998
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:31,759
artist from the country and no one knew

999
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:33,680
they were in the car so it was really

1000
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:37,720
funny that they set up the roadblock to

1001
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:39,719
catch them yeah well I had called Adam

1002
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:41,279
when we first landed saying hey man I I

1003
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:43,759
need to get something and he's like okay

1004
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:47,640
and so this guy flew in with a pound of

1005
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:49,839
[ __ ] weed and it was amazing stuff

1006
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:52,598
and it was all at the hotel well when

1007
00:37:49,838 --> 00:37:54,279
the show was over uh I get a phone call

1008
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:55,599
from the hotel telling me that the

1009
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,640
police are coming and they're going to

1010
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,079
search all the rooms

1011
00:37:57,639 --> 00:38:02,239
and I'm like what the [ __ ] and we had

1012
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:04,079
just put Snoop in the car to to leave

1013
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:07,439
and then I get word from him directly

1014
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:09,960
saying hey I'm getting arrested you know

1015
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,200
call so and so so I start making calls

1016
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,119
and I went wait a minute I got to get

1017
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:14,719
back to the [ __ ] hotel if they go

1018
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:17,240
into his room they're going to find that

1019
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:19,639
that [ __ ] pound of weed so I

1020
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:21,358
immediately get into a car take off to

1021
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:22,920
the hotel I get to the hotel the cops

1022
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:25,559
are in the lobby they hadn't made their

1023
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:27,119
way up yet I race up to the room I open

1024
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:31,078
the door I find the weed

1025
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:33,039
I tried to flush it now stupidest move

1026
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:36,200
ever because European toilets don't

1027
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:38,400
swirl it just pours water right so the

1028
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:41,039
weed is now just floating everywhere in

1029
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,599
the toilet and I'm like oh [ __ ] so I'm

1030
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:44,440
freaking out I'm like what am I going to

1031
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:46,920
do so I look and there's a trash can

1032
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:48,519
with the bin in it or a a liner in it I

1033
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,280
grab the liner and I scoop all the wheat

1034
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:52,400
out of the toilet and I run out to the

1035
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,839
balcony and I slung that [ __ ] over to

1036
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,318
the next building and it landed on the

1037
00:38:53,838 --> 00:38:57,480
roof and uh sure enough 10 minutes later

1038
00:38:56,318 --> 00:38:58,759
the cops come up and they're [ __ ]

1039
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:02,000
searching all the rooms and they didn't

1040
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:03,400
find anything thank God but uh that was

1041
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,119
scary cuz I was like what am I going to

1042
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,760
do if they catch me in here with it like

1043
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:09,599
this is you know Zero Tolerance country

1044
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,720
like they they really will [ __ ] you hard

1045
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,800
and that that was always like a concern

1046
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:15,759
of mine honestly because part of my job

1047
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:19,280
was not just being the road manager but

1048
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:21,040
also you know finding the weed the [ __ ]

1049
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,680
that I would have to do bro let me tell

1050
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:25,559
you like I've I would take a private car

1051
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:27,759
to Christiana if we were near anywhere

1052
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:30,119
near Denmark and I would go and I would

1053
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,560
literally buy out the whole [ __ ] City

1054
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:33,800
like I would walk in there going oh that

1055
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:36,159
right there how much you got of that oh

1056
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:37,880
we only have 10 grams 10 grams what I'll

1057
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:39,358
take it all what about this oh I only

1058
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:41,559
have five grams okay well give me that

1059
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:44,000
too okay and I would literally go from

1060
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:45,519
merch to merch person just buy

1061
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,760
everything they [ __ ] had and then

1062
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:50,199
sneak out get back in the private car

1063
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,079
and link up with the tour or it would be

1064
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:53,679
hey Adam there's nobody we know in

1065

1073
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:11,639
never really worried about it even

1074
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:14,000
though it was illegal in some places

1075
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:15,480
like Texas always weed somewhere yeah

1076
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,800

1122
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:54,800

1139
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,119
special rigs where they have a hot

1140
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:32,880
knives they they Tor it's attached to

1141
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:34,440
the torch yes and so it heats up the

1142
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,400
knives and then you push it together and

1143
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:39,358
it pushes the you know then you you hit

1144
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:41,920
it with straw my uh my really good

1145
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:45,318
friend John he's a native New Zealander

1146
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:47,039
mauy and uh he's all Rick come on mate

1147
00:42:45,318 --> 00:42:48,838
we got to do the knives and I was like

1148
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:50,400
the knives what are you talking about he

1149
00:42:48,838 --> 00:42:53,239
said you've never done the knives bro

1150
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,838
I'm like no never at all oh and so we'd

1151
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:56,159
go to the kitchen and he'd grab two

1152
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:58,039
butter knives and throw them in the St

1153
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:59,838
stove heat them up until they're super

1154
00:42:58,039 --> 00:43:01,039
hot and then he rolls up a cone out of

1155
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:02,078
paper he's like here put this in your

1156
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:03,759
mouth I'm like what the [ __ ] am I

1157
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:06,400
supposed to do with this he's like watch

1158
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:08,800
bro and then he'd grab the weed with the

1159
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,480
the hot knives squeeze it together and

1160
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,880
then you inhale it through the cone we

1161
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,358
used to do that with old school hash but

1162
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:16,000
these new zealanders will do it with

1163
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:18,558
weed and it's it's a strong but it's

1164
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,480
very it's nostalgic from younger years

1165
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:22,440
you know it's still pretty wild it was

1166
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,960
it was really strong I mean that [ __ ]

1167
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:25,760
would put me on my ass I'd be couch

1168
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:28,838
riding it after smoking it that way yeah

1169
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,800
I'll be coughing and yeah he it's funny

1170
00:43:28,838 --> 00:43:32,960
cuz he would make like little balls of

1171
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,920
weed you know and then that that he

1172
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,159
would literally touch one with one knife

1173
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,760
and it would stick to it then he'd grabb

1174
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:39,519
the other one and sandwich it together

1175
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,319
to to get the burn and put it right in

1176
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:43,440
front of the cone oh these guys had it

1177
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:44,838
attached to the torch so you would turn

1178
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,119
the torch on and it would heat it and

1179
00:43:44,838 --> 00:43:49,400
then press that's awesome that's

1180
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:51,318
inventive cuz I we didn't do it that way

1181
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:54,039
that was that's definitely a modern

1182
00:43:51,318 --> 00:43:56,318
version of how my friend John showed me

1183
00:43:54,039 --> 00:43:57,558
wild they don't do that in Australia

1184
00:43:56,318 --> 00:43:59,960
though that's the funny part oh it's

1185
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:01,920
it's a New Zealand thing for sure yeah

1186
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:04,519
yeah yeah yeah totally Australia's Got

1187
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,800
Its Own you know own ways of doing stuff

1188
00:44:04,519 --> 00:44:07,559
for sure and they're super passionate

1189
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:09,160
about wheed as well especially in the

1190
00:44:07,559 --> 00:44:13,880
Adelaide area that's where they seem to

1191
00:44:09,159 --> 00:44:15,960
have like really it's it's I think uh I

1192
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:17,400
it might be legal there now I just know

1193
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:20,760
that it's definitely medical I'm not

1194
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:22,079
sure about wreck but I definitely think

1195
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,200
Australia's medical it's been a while

1196
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:25,519
since I've been there but they

1197
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:27,598
definitely were like I would say the

1198
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:29,519
front run of the country in terms of

1199
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,440
growing it and having it like you can go

1200
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:32,880
to Sydney and get some but it would be

1201
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,240
something shipped in from somewhere else

1202
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,079
and it was kind of like all the same

1203
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:39,679
quality wasn't very good yeah um some of

1204
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:42,079
the stuff in Perth those guys seem to

1205
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:43,358
have like taken more pride in what they

1206
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:46,000
were growing there but definitely

1207
00:44:43,358 --> 00:44:49,039
Adelaide was the place I haven't been

1208
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,800
back to Australia since

1209
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:54,838
200 13 or 14 so I'm sure in the last 10

1210
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,680
years things have changed quite a bit

1211
00:44:54,838 --> 00:44:59,000
but back then that's what what it was

1212
00:44:56,679 --> 00:45:00,279
like yeah I've never been to Australia

1213
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,920
but I have friends that come to

1214
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,400
spannabis every year I bump into

1215
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,639
spannabis is the one of the most amazing

1216
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,358
events and you're going to have to go I

1217
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:07,960
have not been I definitely want to I've

1218
00:45:06,358 --> 00:45:11,119
heard the same thing it's a chip but

1219
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:14,838
yeah in 2024 I think it's March 14th

1220
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:17,119
15th and 16th U I go every

1221
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:18,480
year and it's just amazing adventure and

1222
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:19,559
so I see my friends from all around the

1223
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,318
world and so I got friends from

1224
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:23,800
Australia South

1225
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:27,318
Africa guys from Japan that I see every

1226
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:29,480
once in a while Japanese weed

1227
00:45:27,318 --> 00:45:32,759
have you smoked Japanese weed uh my

1228
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:35,159
friend Sushi shout out to Sushi he uh he

1229
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:38,119
would hook us up but it smelled and

1230
00:45:35,159 --> 00:45:39,358
tasted like ocean water like seaweed wow

1231
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:41,240
cuz that's where they grew it they grew

1232
00:45:39,358 --> 00:45:42,880
it in the harbor and they would like it

1233
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:45,358
was so close I don't think they were

1234
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:48,559
actually using salt water but it had

1235
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:51,679
that and it was hella expensive it was

1236
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:54,599
like ah I don't quote me on this but I

1237
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:58,118
want to say it was like almost $1,600 to

1238
00:45:54,599 --> 00:46:01,760
$2,000 for an ounce because they were so

1239
00:45:58,119 --> 00:46:04,280
afraid that one gram will land you seven

1240
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:07,359
years in jail like the the the the

1241
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:09,960
punishment was in extreme so growing it

1242
00:46:07,358 --> 00:46:11,480
you had to get top dollar you know bet

1243
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:13,599
and it looked great I mean it was

1244
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:15,760
amazing looking weed but it absolutely

1245
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:18,680
smelled like and it tasted like seaweed

1246
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:22,520
so you're from La it's kind of like that

1247
00:46:18,679 --> 00:46:24,399
yeah yeah looks amazing it looks there

1248
00:46:22,519 --> 00:46:26,519
is there is that what I call pretend

1249
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,480
that came out a lot in the I feel like

1250
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:31,440
the LA Market is full of a lot of that

1251
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,760
stuff that looks [ __ ] amazing like

1252
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,358
I'm not going to name any Brands but

1253
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:36,680
some of their stuff looks [ __ ]

1254
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:38,199
amazing I mean you see it on Instagram

1255
00:46:36,679 --> 00:46:40,480
or whatever or you see it in the bag and

1256
00:46:38,199 --> 00:46:42,039
then you go to smell it it smells okay

1257
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,880
you go to smoke it and there's no turps

1258
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:47,358
or you know I mean a lot of stuff is

1259
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:48,599
salt grown and whatever you know the the

1260
00:46:47,358 --> 00:46:50,558
I'm talking about the commercially

1261
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:52,599
produced stuff not like the the small

1262
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:54,280
farmer but you know there's because you

1263
00:46:52,599 --> 00:46:56,000
can get it to look amazing but it's all

1264
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:59,480
about taste and effect at the end of of

1265
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,559
the day 100% for me I on some level I

1266
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,159
don't even really care what it looks

1267
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:05,920
like if it gets me it it tastes [ __ ]

1268
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:07,759
amazing like I the look is that's I I'm

1269
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:10,119
the same way you know and I've I've seen

1270
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:11,960
plenty of that down in La I won't just

1271
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:14,519
say la I've I've seen that in a few

1272
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:15,838
areas where um it's it's lacking

1273
00:47:14,519 --> 00:47:17,599
something it's missing something and

1274
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:18,719
whether they overdid it with the salts

1275
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:20,960
just because they're trying to get a lot

1276
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:23,598
of yield yeah or they're doing something

1277
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:26,599
that um you know again they want it to

1278
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:29,200
look right they're just not hitting the

1279
00:47:26,599 --> 00:47:30,599
mark maybe it's a lack of CO2 maybe it's

1280
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:33,118
a you know there's something else that

1281
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:35,160
they're not doing that gives it that

1282
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:36,720
punch but there's plenty of stuff out

1283
00:47:35,159 --> 00:47:39,118
there that's like that and as you say in

1284
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:41,759
the commercial Market which I think is

1285
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:43,280
terrible if that's someone's first uh

1286
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,040
experience in cannabis and they're

1287
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,319
buying something based on what it looks

1288
00:47:45,039 --> 00:47:50,000
like unfortunately it happens a lot it

1289
00:47:47,318 --> 00:47:52,119
does it does but it and then it's kind

1290
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,119
of like a double-edged sword because I

1291
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:57,200
also feel like those guys that really

1292
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:59,800
take pride and doing what they do and

1293
00:47:57,199 --> 00:48:03,639
really trying to BU you know make the

1294
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:06,280
top shelf of top shelf yeah you're the

1295
00:48:03,639 --> 00:48:09,920
the the general customer right now is

1296
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:13,119
not doesn't have the money to pay for it

1297
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:16,318
or um don't doesn't care they'll buy

1298
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:18,838
that $10 e because they just want

1299
00:48:16,318 --> 00:48:20,599
something to smoke they might buy your

1300
00:48:18,838 --> 00:48:22,799
top shelf but they won't buy in quantity

1301
00:48:20,599 --> 00:48:24,480
because they'll buy some other stuff at

1302
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,119
a lower price to kind of mix it to make

1303
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,280
it last kind of thing you know what I

1304
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:29,880
mean and I noticed it in Colorado where

1305
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:32,839
you could have the best guys out there

1306
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:35,960
growing but the market doesn't dictate a

1307
00:48:32,838 --> 00:48:38,679
a fine connoisseur Bud they'll buy

1308
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:40,720
anything as long as it's at the right

1309
00:48:38,679 --> 00:48:42,279
price and kind of kind of has the effect

1310
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:44,639
you know what I mean we're a weird place

1311
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:46,519
we are we are because you know the other

1312
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:50,279
thing is like everyone's looking here

1313
00:48:46,519 --> 00:48:52,960
especially well what's the THC content

1314
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:54,960
bro I've had some [ __ ] that was like 18%

1315
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:57,679
that put me on my ass I've had some [ __ ]

1316
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:59,720
that was 10% % you know what I mean like

1317
00:48:57,679 --> 00:49:01,598
that you know it's not always about that

1318
00:48:59,719 --> 00:49:03,399
number and I think it is people are so

1319
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:06,280
blinded by that number and same thing

1320
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:07,960
with tpine percentage I think tarpine

1321
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:10,119
percentage is obviously important but

1322
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:11,720
it's specifically what kind of tpin are

1323
00:49:10,119 --> 00:49:16,079
we talking about you know what I mean

1324
00:49:11,719 --> 00:49:18,679
100% it's very specific to to you know

1325
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:20,720
distinct tpes and also cannaboids and

1326
00:49:18,679 --> 00:49:22,318
the the way they affect each other you

1327
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:24,199
know and then also your relationship

1328
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:25,639
with them depending it's so subjective

1329
00:49:24,199 --> 00:49:26,960
because cannabis in general is just

1330
00:49:25,639 --> 00:49:27,960
subjective to what you like and the

1331
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,720
effect that it gives you because we're

1332
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:34,039
all so different as far as you know body

1333
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:35,159
chemistry 100% I totally agree with you

1334
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:38,599
on that yeah I mean there's some people

1335
00:49:35,159 --> 00:49:41,399
that smoke Haze and like for most of us

1336
00:49:38,599 --> 00:49:43,359
it gives us heart palpitations and or

1337
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:46,639
hearts beating out of our chest and then

1338
00:49:43,358 --> 00:49:48,279
other people it relaxes them you know so

1339
00:49:46,639 --> 00:49:50,279
yeah for me it's like that's that's one

1340
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:53,359
of the signs where I look for that

1341
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:55,119
because of an unfortunate medical issue

1342
00:49:53,358 --> 00:49:56,199
that I've had I have to maintain my

1343
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:57,798
blood pressure pressure at a certain

1344
00:49:56,199 --> 00:50:00,279
thing so I've noticed that when I drink

1345
00:49:57,798 --> 00:50:02,000
I smoke sativas yeah it really [ __ ]

1346
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:04,960
with my blood pressure when I smoke an

1347
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,599
indicia IT relaxing it's calm my blood

1348
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,920
pressure doesn't go up how about Edibles

1349
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:12,680
versus smokables you know the thing

1350
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:15,000
about Edibles for me personally is I've

1351
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:17,000
never been able to find consistency in

1352
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,559
them you know someone will say hey Rick

1353
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:22,480
you know I I got you these uh really

1354
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:24,359
cool cherries or whatever that are 5

1355
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:26,559
milligrams each and I'm like oh really

1356
00:50:24,358 --> 00:50:28,598
okay cool and eat like three or four of

1357
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:31,000
them and I'm like okay I've got about 20

1358
00:50:28,599 --> 00:50:32,280
milligrams in me I feel good then

1359
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
somebody else will show up and say hey

1360
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:36,240
bro I got these gummies try one they're

1361
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,400
only 20 milligrams each oh okay and then

1362
00:50:36,239 --> 00:50:40,558
I'll eat one and I'll be like I'm

1363
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,680
hallucinating uh I don't feel good I'm

1364
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:44,559
like this is way stronger than [ __ ]

1365
00:50:42,679 --> 00:50:48,078
20 milligrams it's like I feel there's

1366
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:50,720
an inconsistency in how it's spread out

1367
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:52,680
within the product and so I'm not a huge

1368
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:54,598
fan of them you know even the ones that

1369
00:50:52,679 --> 00:50:57,078
I've liked when I went and reordered or

1370
00:50:54,599 --> 00:50:59,039
went and got a reup of whatever it was

1371
00:50:57,079 --> 00:51:01,160
I'm like these aren't the same they

1372
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:03,039
don't taste the same they don't have the

1373
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:05,279
same effect you know so that's my issue

1374
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:07,159
with the Edibles yeah well I got a

1375
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:11,559
question for you let's go back into the

1376
00:51:07,159 --> 00:51:14,039
90s and do you remember cat piss yes as

1377
00:51:11,559 --> 00:51:15,519
matter of fact I do so there's there's

1378
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:17,719
big debate going on and there has been

1379
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:19,719
for a long time about who created

1380
00:51:17,719 --> 00:51:21,480
whatever I I personally feel that it's a

1381
00:51:19,719 --> 00:51:23,759
flavor profile and there's probably

1382
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:26,880
multiple cat pisses not just this there

1383
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:28,920
was a SoCal cat piss from t dog you know

1384
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:32,240
he's been on Adam dun's show he's a he's

1385
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:36,119
quite the character shout out to TG um

1386
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:38,199
and Jackson Fire from SoCal but the one

1387
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:39,920
we had in the bay was a more of a sativa

1388
00:51:38,199 --> 00:51:42,598
and the one they had in SoCal was an

1389
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:44,240
indicia very short plant you know and

1390
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:46,599
short flowering and the one that my

1391
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:48,679
friends grew in the bay that had it was

1392
00:51:46,599 --> 00:51:50,559
that you know I've recently talked to

1393
00:51:48,679 --> 00:51:53,159
more people about it was a sativa that

1394
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:55,880
was like more than 10 weeks which is

1395
00:51:53,159 --> 00:51:59,039
very much the opposite but they both had

1396
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:01,680
ammonia and they both had like heavy THS

1397
00:51:59,039 --> 00:52:04,358
like I think the SoCal one from my

1398
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:06,679
understanding was more gas and you know

1399
00:52:04,358 --> 00:52:09,440
like strong pungent gas whereas the

1400
00:52:06,679 --> 00:52:11,838
NorCal was skunk and straight ammonia

1401
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:13,639
like nose burning THS that you know that

1402
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:17,159
really wake you up just from selling the

1403
00:52:13,639 --> 00:52:20,838
bag see now my experience was very

1404
00:52:17,159 --> 00:52:23,639
limited in that because I didn't find it

1405
00:52:20,838 --> 00:52:25,078
Pleasant in the in the smell yeah I

1406
00:52:23,639 --> 00:52:27,318
didn't enjoy it so I didn't want to

1407
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:28,720
really like indulge too much in it so I

1408
00:52:27,318 --> 00:52:31,279
don't have a lot of experience in terms

1409
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:33,519
of smoking it but that was my experience

1410
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,319
with it was like wow this is named

1411
00:52:33,519 --> 00:52:37,358
appropriately this [ __ ] smells like

1412
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:39,318
catpiss and I really don't want to smoke

1413
00:52:37,358 --> 00:52:42,199
that so I kind of stayed away from it

1414
00:52:39,318 --> 00:52:45,000
like we just did across of the rbk with

1415
00:52:42,199 --> 00:52:47,480
a sage and sour smells just like [ __ ]

1416
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,039
catpiss yeah you know and I was like

1417
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:52,358
look this might be cool for the market

1418
00:52:50,039 --> 00:52:54,719
not for me yeah Adam I did a lot of sage

1419
00:52:52,358 --> 00:52:57,318
and sour crosses with Adam um I'd got

1420
00:52:54,719 --> 00:52:59,078
some packs of T from th seeds of Adams

1421
00:52:57,318 --> 00:53:00,880
sage and sour when he was working with

1422
00:52:59,079 --> 00:53:03,599
Doug or whatever and then popped those

1423
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:05,200
and uh took we made Regular seeds for

1424
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:07,400
the sage Against the

1425
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:09,318
Machine I remember him telling me about

1426
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:10,720
that yeah yeah yeah a lot of fun stuff

1427
00:53:09,318 --> 00:53:12,199
but that's a real interesting one

1428
00:53:10,719 --> 00:53:14,639
because I feel like Crossing it with the

1429
00:53:12,199 --> 00:53:16,000
rbk you're just putting more gas into it

1430
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:17,400
I mean that's what we were hoping is

1431
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,318
like with all the crosses that we were

1432
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:21,400
doing we he he actually had another

1433
00:53:19,318 --> 00:53:23,599
Cross or another strain called

1434
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:25,720
appropri and I'm not familiar with the

1435
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:27,920
strain at all but apparently the curator

1436
00:53:25,719 --> 00:53:30,959
of that uh is no longer with us rest in

1437
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:34,720
peace yeah uh so Adam happened toh still

1438
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:36,240
have that strain and um when we made

1439
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:38,318
that cross I was really excited because

1440
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:40,639
he said Rick the original would like put

1441
00:53:38,318 --> 00:53:42,838
you in a catatonic State like you would

1442
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:44,679
literally be looking like Keith Richards

1443
00:53:42,838 --> 00:53:45,880
with your eyes closed in a huge Ash

1444
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:47,399
because you'd fall asleep halfway

1445
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:49,318
through smoking it you know like a

1446
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:52,039
heroin junky yeah so I was like oh I

1447
00:53:49,318 --> 00:53:55,679
can't wait to see how this turns out it

1448
00:53:52,039 --> 00:53:57,599
looks amazing there's [ __ ] crystals

1449
00:53:55,679 --> 00:54:00,960
every I mean like oh my God you look at

1450
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:03,160
this thing you go wow zero smell has no

1451
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,519
[ __ ] smell at all and that was like

1452
00:54:03,159 --> 00:54:06,798
the main thing that we wanted to do with

1453
00:54:04,519 --> 00:54:10,280
the crosses was like hoping that a plant

1454
00:54:06,798 --> 00:54:12,559
would take the smell of of the rbk yeah

1455
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:14,720
and and if the problem is is a lot of

1456
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:16,559
that stuff is recessive so it takes a

1457
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:18,439
lot of breeding work it's not just in

1458
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:20,640
that initial cross you have to actually

1459
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:21,920
do some more work do it again and do it

1460
00:54:20,639 --> 00:54:24,960
again I mean it took a long time before

1461
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:26,920
anybody even had OG cush seeds it's not

1462
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:29,358
like you had you you just self it and

1463
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:32,318
you got good OG cush seeds it's not it's

1464
00:54:29,358 --> 00:54:36,598
not that simple 100% and again this is

1465
00:54:32,318 --> 00:54:38,159
from me watching the industry seeing and

1466
00:54:36,599 --> 00:54:40,359
being around people and learning about

1467
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:42,440
it because I'm I'm not a cultivator yeah

1468
00:54:40,358 --> 00:54:44,598
but I do get the just of how things are

1469
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:46,960
created and how it works and as you said

1470
00:54:44,599 --> 00:54:48,440
it's uh the breeding process is not so

1471
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:51,639
simple as oh I got all these seeds let's

1472
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:53,559
find a feno no you find that feno do it

1473
00:54:51,639 --> 00:54:55,598
again and especially with OG and you

1474
00:54:53,559 --> 00:54:57,160
know I think there's things like for

1475
00:54:55,599 --> 00:55:00,599
instance where they made the gelato and

1476
00:54:57,159 --> 00:55:05,118
it was like okay the 23 is good the 27's

1477
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:08,280
good the 33 is good the the 41 the 41

1478
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:11,599
the 49 the 48 the 45 all these things

1479
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:13,240
had their place you know and I think uh

1480
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:14,920
it's not always like that and I think a

1481
00:55:13,239 --> 00:55:16,039
lot of people think oh yeah I just did

1482
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:17,400
this and it's gonna we're going to go

1483
00:55:16,039 --> 00:55:19,519
through it and a lot of times it's a

1484
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:20,920
needle and a hay stack literally and you

1485
00:55:19,519 --> 00:55:22,599
got to be able to grow good enough for

1486
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:24,200
it to express and that's another thing

1487
00:55:22,599 --> 00:55:25,920
it's like if you're not growing good

1488
00:55:24,199 --> 00:55:27,519
enough to express you're wasting your

1489
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,880
time I mean I understand that there's a

1490
00:55:27,519 --> 00:55:31,480
lot of people out there that do that

1491
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:33,160
with the within the seed game where they

1492
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:35,000
do that original thing and they find

1493
00:55:33,159 --> 00:55:36,719
that one and they go okay this is it you

1494
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,440
know we they only do it once they think

1495
00:55:36,719 --> 00:55:40,038
they found the right one and immediately

1496
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:41,519
they say this is the one and they start

1497
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:43,720
you know mass-producing that one and

1498
00:55:41,519 --> 00:55:45,400
you're like well you really didn't take

1499
00:55:43,719 --> 00:55:46,919
the time to really find out if that

1500
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:49,079
really is the one and sometimes they get

1501
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:50,838
lucky and a lot of times you might be

1502
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:52,160
overlooking some amazing stuff so if you

1503
00:55:50,838 --> 00:55:53,920
did find something amazing but you

1504
00:55:52,159 --> 00:55:57,038
didn't grow it out multiple times along

1505
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:59,920
with other stuff who knows yep who knows

1506
00:55:57,039 --> 00:56:01,880
I mean I know AJ he's been doing some

1507
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:04,880
really amazing crosses with stuff he has

1508
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:06,160
a a strain called I I told him you need

1509
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:09,160
I heard he's selling seeds too but he

1510
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:13,318
only does it in person for cash 100%

1511
00:56:09,159 --> 00:56:14,798
100% that's AJ he uh but he does have I

1512
00:56:13,318 --> 00:56:16,920
told him he needed to change the name he

1513
00:56:14,798 --> 00:56:19,960
calls it new carpet and I was like new

1514
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:21,358
carpet that doesn't sound appealing like

1515
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:23,039
no one wants to smoke new carpet yeah no

1516
00:56:21,358 --> 00:56:24,639
one that's can you imagine burning a new

1517
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:26,039
carpet and smoking I like no he goes but

1518
00:56:24,639 --> 00:56:27,639
it's was like I go yeah but change the

1519
00:56:26,039 --> 00:56:29,640
name bro like you're not doing yourself

1520
00:56:27,639 --> 00:56:31,798
any favors by calling it new carpet yeah

1521
00:56:29,639 --> 00:56:34,159
but he does have some really intriguing

1522
00:56:31,798 --> 00:56:35,719
crosses that he's been making um he's

1523
00:56:34,159 --> 00:56:38,399
supposed to send me some seeds of those

1524
00:56:35,719 --> 00:56:39,838
so when I do and I pop them I'll let you

1525
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,639
know what we're sitting on but because

1526
00:56:39,838 --> 00:56:44,239
he's he's been raving about that he took

1527
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:45,838
the rbk and crossed it with like I can't

1528
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:47,159
even tell you to be honest with you what

1529
00:56:45,838 --> 00:56:48,838
ones because he mentioned them to me but

1530
00:56:47,159 --> 00:56:50,159
it's like four other different strains

1531
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:51,599
I'm like [ __ ] you went crazy with it

1532
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:53,879
he's like I did but it came out great

1533
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:56,318
Rick trust me yeah so I can't wait to

1534
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:58,798
see what he actually did

1535
00:56:56,318 --> 00:57:01,199
nice yeah and he's he's old school he's

1536
00:56:58,798 --> 00:57:04,519
got the old school chem you know chem

1537
00:57:01,199 --> 00:57:06,279
lineage all the stuff from uh from G and

1538
00:57:04,519 --> 00:57:08,159
he's doing you know like his stuff is

1539
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:10,000
getting ready to hit the market I think

1540
00:57:08,159 --> 00:57:11,920
the end of next month or so he's got a

1541
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,519
deal in New York yeah so that's where

1542
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:15,920
he's at now and and a lot of people New

1543
00:57:13,519 --> 00:57:17,519
York's gonna pop I'm looking forward to

1544
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,280
it I'd like to see how it goes It's

1545
00:57:17,519 --> 00:57:21,880
Gonna struggle out there you know up to

1546
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:24,079
this point it's funny how they've opened

1547
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:25,798
the floodgates to do it but with no real

1548
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:27,440
structure yeah so it's like a

1549
00:57:25,798 --> 00:57:29,239
free-for-all right now still and the

1550
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:31,280
guys who've actually paid all the money

1551
00:57:29,239 --> 00:57:33,479
to get the Farms are stuck with their

1552
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:36,480
product because there's no stores taking

1553
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:38,880
it yet like it's kind of backwards yeah

1554
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:40,719
but once it gets moving in the right

1555
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:42,480
direction I do believe that New York is

1556
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:44,759
going to be a place where you can make

1557
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:48,079
some decent money in this business and

1558
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:49,440
actually uh succeed yeah I've had some

1559
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:50,960
companies out there that sold me on

1560
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,920
their hopes and dreams and have yet to

1561
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,838
pay me the money they owe me that's how

1562
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:57,039
it works unfortunately for the time

1563
00:57:54,838 --> 00:57:59,159
being I think it'll change yeah and I I

1564
00:57:57,039 --> 00:58:01,119
think it's going to change and you know

1565
00:57:59,159 --> 00:58:02,519
I I wish them well and I hope they have

1566
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:06,760
good luck and I hope they're successful

1567
00:58:02,519 --> 00:58:08,759
so that they imp pay me there you

1568
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:10,880
go it's been great having you on the

1569
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:12,240
show if people are interested in finding

1570
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:14,640
more about you and your brand where

1571
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:16,000
would they go well I do have I I I

1572
00:58:14,639 --> 00:58:17,920
haven't been really active on it yet

1573
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:21,400
because I've been concentrating on like

1574
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:24,798
the whole revamp of everything so I

1575
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:26,838
originally I have an IG account um

1576
00:58:24,798 --> 00:58:28,239
Beyond IG I really don't have anything

1577
00:58:26,838 --> 00:58:29,960
that I've been using to promote it and

1578
00:58:28,239 --> 00:58:32,598
I've only been promoting it as Ricky's

1579
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:35,159
Brothers kush yeah but now that I've

1580
00:58:32,599 --> 00:58:37,640
actually have come across some of the

1581
00:58:35,159 --> 00:58:39,279
original cuts of certain things and

1582
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:41,159
making the back crosses I'm starting

1583
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:43,920
Ricky's California Originals so I

1584
00:58:41,159 --> 00:58:45,838
actually have about 20 strains that I'll

1585
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,480
be coming to Market with in various ways

1586
00:58:45,838 --> 00:58:50,440
whether it's through seed through clone

1587
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:53,039
through actual flour awesome um so I I

1588
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:56,920
realize that in order to create a brand

1589
00:58:53,039 --> 00:58:58,960
again you have to have um Quality and

1590
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:02,960
assortment because you really just can't

1591
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:05,639
do it with one no and it used to be like

1592
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:07,599
that and that's where I felt like okay I

1593
00:59:05,639 --> 00:59:09,239
can succeed with this with Adam when we

1594
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:10,838
were talking about it I was like you can

1595
00:59:09,239 --> 00:59:12,798
do it with just one I remember the guys

1596
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:14,798
with the Paris OG I'll use them as a

1597
00:59:12,798 --> 00:59:17,280
great example perfect example you know

1598
00:59:14,798 --> 00:59:21,759
those guys came out to shoot with just

1599
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:24,839
one yeah and they [ __ ] crushed it

1600
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:27,240
like runs runs Paris these guys came out

1601
00:59:24,838 --> 00:59:28,880
with one thing and they hit and they hit

1602
00:59:27,239 --> 00:59:31,479
and and they knew what they were doing

1603
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:34,079
the quality was always there uh they

1604
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:36,400
definitely had it going but that's no

1605
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:38,680
longer the case now you know and I I

1606
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:41,838
realized unfortunately I missed that

1607
00:59:38,679 --> 00:59:45,038
boat and opportunity to really establish

1608
00:59:41,838 --> 00:59:47,159
myself in that sense so doing it now I'm

1609
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:48,680
realizing you know you gotta you got to

1610
00:59:47,159 --> 00:59:50,199
cater to people you got to have that

1611
00:59:48,679 --> 00:59:51,798
hybrid you got to have that sativa you

1612
00:59:50,199 --> 00:59:54,679
got to have that Indica you have to

1613
00:59:51,798 --> 00:59:57,000
really look at the market as a whole and

1614
00:59:54,679 --> 00:59:59,118
say I'm going to I'm I'm going to offer

1615
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:02,079
you a variety of stuff because

1616
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:03,720
everyone's also got different tastes

1617
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:05,318
different things that they like you know

1618
01:00:03,719 --> 01:00:06,798
so well you have something that you can

1619
01:00:05,318 --> 01:00:08,440
pivot in so many different directions

1620
01:00:06,798 --> 01:00:11,280
and collaborations everybody wants to

1621
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:12,400
work with OG I think now they do and I

1622
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:14,240
think part of that comes from a

1623
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,519
conversation also that b had on his

1624
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:19,639
podcast where he said he felt that OG's

1625
01:00:16,519 --> 01:00:21,679
were gonna make a comeback and it's been

1626
01:00:19,639 --> 01:00:23,199
the rumor for a long time OG's and S

1627
01:00:21,679 --> 01:00:25,358
making a comeback but it's the truth I

1628
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:28,000
mean I believe it's the truth especially

1629
01:00:25,358 --> 01:00:29,920
on that Boutique you know top tier

1630
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,159
Market that the people were all talking

1631
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:34,200
you know if you had real Sour real OG it

1632
01:00:32,159 --> 01:00:38,920
still should fetch the price of all the

1633
01:00:34,199 --> 01:00:40,239
purple stuff 100% 100% like so I I to go

1634
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:42,358
back to your original question what what

1635
01:00:40,239 --> 01:00:44,719
I'm doing so I'm going to revamp things

1636
01:00:42,358 --> 01:00:45,920
in the sense of Ricky's California

1637
01:00:44,719 --> 01:00:47,480
Originals I'm going to launch in

1638
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:49,039
Michigan everything's already there it's

1639
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:51,199
already being grown out yeah we're going

1640
01:00:49,039 --> 01:00:52,760
to do it there first uh those people

1641
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:55,239
that I'm working with there are like

1642
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:58,280
family to me so I'm in a really great

1643
01:00:55,239 --> 01:01:01,519
scenario and situation there with them

1644
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:04,599
um from that I'm also working with uh

1645
01:01:01,519 --> 01:01:06,400
cord day brus yeah um we're starting a

1646
01:01:04,599 --> 01:01:08,039
company with my friend Casey over there

1647
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:10,079
we're we've all started a company called

1648
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:12,200
hippie era where we're going to launch

1649
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:13,400
clothing along with the Lifestyle brand

1650
01:01:12,199 --> 01:01:15,439
and I'm going to be using some of the

1651
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:19,318
strains that I have to help him launch

1652
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:22,480
his uh situation and he's he's very much

1653
01:01:19,318 --> 01:01:24,519
uh you know a connoisseur of the plant

1654
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:25,798
as well so I think we can really do

1655
01:01:24,519 --> 01:01:28,519
something good in that nature and I'm

1656
01:01:25,798 --> 01:01:32,480
probably going to

1657
01:01:28,519 --> 01:01:34,519
um keep things on a very basic level

1658
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:38,400
with my brand I I

1659
01:01:34,519 --> 01:01:40,119
don't I don't see myself as being like

1660
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,720
wanting to take over the world with it

1661
01:01:40,119 --> 01:01:44,280
or wanting to do I just want to get in a

1662
01:01:41,719 --> 01:01:46,399
couple of certain areas I want to

1663
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:50,160
ultimately make money but at the same

1664
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:53,160
time I think that if I can make a profit

1665
01:01:50,159 --> 01:01:54,798
and be able to help other people with

1666
01:01:53,159 --> 01:01:58,598
some of the things that are going on I'm

1667
01:01:54,798 --> 01:02:00,679
going to be feel better about just doing

1668
01:01:58,599 --> 01:02:03,440
it in general if that makes sense like I

1669
01:02:00,679 --> 01:02:05,038
don't want to do it to get rich that's

1670
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,760
the bottom line I really don't I want I

1671
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:09,640
don't want to do it to be like oh you're

1672
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:11,559
just doing no I think that if I can get

1673
01:02:09,639 --> 01:02:13,759
into a situation where I can help people

1674
01:02:11,559 --> 01:02:15,559
through various ways whether it be

1675
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:16,960
through Charities through education

1676
01:02:15,559 --> 01:02:19,119
through other things where passion

1677
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:21,000
driven yeah like that's where I really

1678
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:23,119
want to sit within the whole realm of

1679
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:26,039
things yeah and so and I don't want to

1680
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:28,160
go through although I'm I'm comfortable

1681
01:02:26,039 --> 01:02:31,599
here you know speaking with you and I'll

1682
01:02:28,159 --> 01:02:33,480
do this with other people yeah I'm a I'm

1683
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:35,720
really am a behind the scenes kind of

1684
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:38,599
guy bro like I don't enjoy being in

1685
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:41,358
front of the camera and speaking about

1686
01:02:38,599 --> 01:02:43,039
my life story I have one but there I can

1687
01:02:41,358 --> 01:02:44,558
also find myself getting in trouble

1688
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:46,278
because I do know a lot of things that I

1689
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:49,920
need to shut the [ __ ] up about and not

1690
01:02:46,278 --> 01:02:51,519
talk about sure I know me that I'll just

1691
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:53,440
start blabbing and I might say something

1692
01:02:51,519 --> 01:02:55,038
that'll get me in trouble so well and

1693
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,880
it's there's something to be said about

1694
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:58,680
the old school smokers that are around

1695
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:01,920
your age I was just talking to obsolete

1696
01:02:58,679 --> 01:03:03,759
the other day and he was talking about

1697
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:05,639

things through a certain light and a

1717
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:50,079
certain view that uh I you know any

1718
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:51,440
subject no matter what it is it could be

1719
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:52,640
political could be whatever you know

1721
01:03:52,639 --> 01:03:57,759
next trip or whatever down memory Lane I

01:03:55,318 --> 01:03:59,880
I'm open to talking about everything I I

1723
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:01,880
do think that uh I would love to share

1724
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:04,000
that that part of it with with people as

1725
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:07,079
what I've been able to come across I've

1726
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:09,960
met some incredible people from Iran

1727
01:04:07,079 --> 01:04:11,760
Russia China you know everywhere around

1728
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:13,318
the world that I consider my friends and

1729
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,400
I think that the one thing I do love

1730
01:04:13,318 --> 01:04:17,719
about this industry is it can bring

1731
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:20,240
people together and we can overcome

1732
01:04:17,719 --> 01:04:22,519
certain obstacles and we can open up

1733
01:04:20,239 --> 01:04:23,798
lines of communication and get more

1734
01:04:22,519 --> 01:04:26,358
understanding with each other and I do

1735
01:04:23,798 --> 01:04:29,519
