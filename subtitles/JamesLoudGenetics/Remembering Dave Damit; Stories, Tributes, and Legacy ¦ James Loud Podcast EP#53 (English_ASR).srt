um keepers of the story yeah it's a hard

73
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:14,318

yeah whatever yeah it's just weed right

76
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,480
it's just it's just weed just weed

77
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:21,839
although and I think a lot of people

78
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:24,518
think it's just weed but it's so much

79
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,719

more red definitely one of the reddest

95
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:09,400

97
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,599
always been a boundary Pusher you know

98
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:16,280

99
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:19,199
really long time at other events as

100
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:22,519

101
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,560
your front yard when it was still

102
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:27,599
illegal but going in the direction of

103
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,399
being legal uh you know that was to me

104
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,280

105
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:32,679
balls to grow in my front yard and I

106

think they the plants would have gotten

107
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:38,680
taken it took a long time to get the

108

balls just to grow in my closet y you

109

passion and every time I stop growing

140

know but I will tell you from just

213
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,440
meeting people through smoking and

214
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:12,919
growing and sharing pictures of each

215
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:16,800
other's weed I met some real cool people

216
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:19,919
that um eventually got me involved with

217
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:24,519
hempest and hus was really the change of

218
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:27,679
my life right um I spent nearly 20 years

219
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:30,879
as a volunteer this was a it's a all

220
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:33,599
volunteer production um you we bought

221
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:35,919
Services reged equipment did all that

222
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,440
but the the infrastructure was all

223
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:41,360
assembled and disassembled the events

224
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,800
were always run by volunteers 100% so

225
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,200
diving in the

226
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:47,399
Hempfest uh that is one of the most

227
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,519
profound experiences that you can get as

228
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:52,639
far as canis goes uh because of the

229
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:55,679
collective consciousness of 300,000

230
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:59,600
other people yes totally there has never

231
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:05,039

250
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:58,440
that changed the world you know the Hest

251
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:00,039
and we're talking about people that

252
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,360
aren't there for the money maybe there's

253
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:04,719
a handful of people there for the money

254
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,200
but that's like the 1% you know that's

255
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,680
not the the real world you know it's

256
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,600
like there might be the 1% that's out

257
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:11,359
there to go try to make a buck but the

258
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,399
people that chill up in events like

259
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,879
Hempfest those are the people that love

260
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:18,519
weed that love cannabis or people that

261
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:22,679
are curious about it that maybe learn

262
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:25,320
something new I mean CU it it was about

263
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:27,919
legalization yeah it was about Freedom

264
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,879
it was about enjoying the plant for what

265
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:34,120
it is and you know and also friendship

266
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:37,559
and meeting new people exactly I um head

267
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:41,440
back to the passion with an event so

268
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:44,278
huge so undeniably huge yeah uh we

269
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,800
worked throughout the decades almost

270
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:50,559
three of them with the Seattle Police

271
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:52,479
the port police the fire department all

272
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,879
of the city agencies that you can

273
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,800
imagine and you can also Imagine That

274
00:11:54,879 --> 00:12:00,360
going into these events in the early

275
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:04,399
years skeptic ISM on the part of the

276
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:06,839
city or or the officials is such a such

277
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,839
a huge understatement you know these

278
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:11,920
hippies can't do anything yeah I mean I

279
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,480
think the hippies get uh but yeah people

280
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:15,319
they relate to cannabis to hippies and

281
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,959
then like the hippies they're they just

282
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,480
get high and and not smart right that's

283
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:22,239
never been the case and Bly St but it's

284
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,879
also Bly stma that cannabis is bad yeah

285
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,360
and that's that's yeah first we wanted

286
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:27,919
to have

287
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,159
legalization and then we wanted to have

288
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:32,599
normalization and now we just want

289
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:35,039
destigmatization because it's normal as

290
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,480
hell yeah there's nothing abnormal about

291
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:41,278
it what makes the world a better place

292
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:44,759
happiness yeah love authenticity and

293
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:48,320
what helps bring those on yeah yeah and

294
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:52,039
I'll tell you what um the nearly 30

295
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,480
years that hemp prevailed in those parts

296
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:58,480
annually there was

297
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:00,399
never a major incident not one gun

298
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:05,399
violence in

299
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:08,198
that not one death thank whoever it is

300
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:11,839
that you send your thanks and ask your

301
00:13:08,198 --> 00:13:11,838
hopes Crum

302
00:13:12,278 --> 00:13:18,720
into there's just no I don't know how to

303
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:21,278
explain it um well I kind of do was we

304
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,120
never allowed alcohol at our eventss

305
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:26,679
that was a big thing no alcohol no viets

306
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:30,560
beautiful that that was just such a

307
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:32,759
simple recipe and it prevailed for ideas

308
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,879
yeah something to be proud of it's

309
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:36,559
really impressive that the whole H the

310
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:39,198
model that they

311
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:41,719
had I mean to have an event that

312
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:44,159
successful for that many years without

313
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:47,079
major problems I mean that's almost

314
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:48,559
unheard of if you involved alcohol that

315
00:13:47,078 --> 00:13:50,198
it would be the polar opposite oh

316
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:52,919
totally totally or it could have

317
00:13:50,198 --> 00:13:57,278
involved a for-profit business model for

318
00:13:52,919 --> 00:14:00,120
sure the chaos could could is yeah an

319
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:02,759
amazing time and they were amazing time

320
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:05,799
and and we're still in them I mean it's

321
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:08,839
how we navigate the tail end of

322
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:12,399
legalization um so much work

323
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:15,240
to again um destigmatized

324
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,120
normalize allow H grows like some some

325
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,240
states

326
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,839
have there's a lot of work to be done

327
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,839
still fighting for some of the laws here

328
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,680
in Washington that's are really screwed

329
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,000
up laws hey we were the first state to

330
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:27,359
legalize us us in Colorado well

331
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,278
everybody learned from Washington in

332
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,079
Colorado on how to do it right now to do

333
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:34,720
wrong and most of the states made their

334
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:37,000
own mistakes anyway yeah they did they

335
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,079
did over taxation being one of the

336
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,519
biggest over taxation huge over Taxation

337
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:46,359
and a ridiculous sh Washington we

338
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:49,879
finally rescinded the uh the excise tax

339
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:53,240
which should go into a effect this July

340
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:55,879
and um along with that comes no more

341
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,480
taxation on medical cannabis right so

342
00:14:55,879 --> 00:15:00,000
you're going to see a Russian black

343
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:03,800
market growth and you're going to see a

344
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:07,440
rush in medical patient registration

345
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:08,758
yeah those are the two yeah and the part

346
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,240
the state's going to hate all of that

347
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:12,680
because it's LW of their revenue yeah I

348
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,600
mean I we were talked a little bit

349
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:17,958
earlier about how we live in such a

350
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:20,000
special time you know throughout history

351
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:23,479
to be part of this

352
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,919
and I feel like the two of us are are

353
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:30,159
both doing not only what our 18-year-old

354
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:32,120
s would be like super proud of yeah but

355
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:35,240
we're doing what we were supposed to do

356
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:37,959
when we came here you know to this

357
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:40,120
planet I feel like when we came here we

358
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:43,599
were meant to do what we're doing now

359
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:47,318
and I just I reflect on that a lot so

360
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:50,278
yeah I I agree I think that

361
00:15:47,318 --> 00:15:54,958
Destiny is something that I think we're

362
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:57,078
all given yeah born with um or at least

363
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:59,359
given to us as a model here's a possible

364
00:15:57,078 --> 00:16:02,879
thing for you we're not all cut out to

365
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:06,079
be rocket scientist computer programmers

366
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:09,958
or cannabis Growers y you know um so

367
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:13,239
yeah desly definitely I believe Destiny

368
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:15,159
plays a role in in our lives yeah yeah

369
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,318
wouldn't trade it would can't think of

370
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:20,120
much I'd trade it for wouldn't trade the

371
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:21,679
Cannabis you know the Cannabis lifestyle

372
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,480
it's it it's real interesting how it's

373
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:25,078
changed how we were in the shadows for

374
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,920
the longest time and we had to be in the

375
00:16:25,078 --> 00:16:29,519
shadows because of the risk right there

376
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:32,159
was so much risk

377
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,120
and that's changed and now the younger

378
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:36,799
generation they don't even know the risk

379
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:40,198
they don't know the risks they know the

380
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:43,000
glamour yeah uh and all of the stuff in

381
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:46,039
the middle is disappearing and what is

382
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,720
that stuff it's the passion right it's

383
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:51,799
still love why we get started this from

384
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,639
the beginning yeah the passion yeah the

385
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:57,318
passion's falling out for profit it's

386
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,759
falling out for glamour check out all

387

executive those D can dress yeah but

392
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,160
where's the passion for the not just the

393
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:17,919
passion for the plant but the

394
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:21,000
passion that this plant

395
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:23,160
brings to other just to others when once

396
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,240
you're passionate about something as

397
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,919
healing and healthy as cannabis it's

398
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,919
hard not to be passionate just about

399
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:33,400
loving other people yeah just a part of

400
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:37,280
our society that just is

and love Yeah interesting how our

404
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:49,678
society is is picking up on these chages

405
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:52,080
and yeah a lot of them are are are

406
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,000
passing mustard pretty easily people are

407
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:56,439
figuring out oh

408
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,440
it's it's not killing

409
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,400
anybody yeah the sky isn't falling

410
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,038
and it's the collective effort of so

411
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:07,880
many people these are you and I included

412
00:18:04,038 --> 00:18:10,879
Hipp Sten hippies can't do a d exactly

413
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:13,720
Stone the hi and and just regular people

414
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,880
that said that this this thing is okay

415
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,960
yeah and now there's more than 50% of

416
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,919
the United States is in approval of

417
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,440
recreational cannibal right which is

418
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,520
where it should be in 100 years ago they

419
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,120
didn't care right 100 years from now

420
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,798
they won't they care we care right now

421
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:29,678
though yes we do we're going to make it

422
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:32,759
half of right now absolutely yeah

423
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:35,600
um yeah and so what do you think um

424
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:38,038
about National legalization Federal

425
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:41,038
legalization Federal legalization

426
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:43,359
interstate commerce it has to happen it

427
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:45,279
has to happen it's really sad and

428
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:47,918
there's no reason that it should be

429
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:50,960
scheduled I'm all about

430
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,880
Des we need to deschedule it and treat

431
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,279
it like we treat alcohol and tobacco

432
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,919
it's a lot safer than alcohol and

433
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:59,480
tobacco for one thing yeah right but but

434
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:02,679
another thing being able to use

435
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:05,720
interstate commerce I think that takes

436
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:07,840
away the black market to a degree in a

437
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:12,200
good way I think interstate commerce

438
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:14,918
allows us to sell to other states uh you

439
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:18,200
know I just think it's silly that it's

440
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:20,360
not treated like alcohol or tobacco and

441
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:24,480
we're trying to reschedule it as a

442
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:26,678
schedule three drug I mean this is so

443
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,880
ridiculous it doesn't really make sense

444
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:32,360
we were talking about logic or common

445
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,280
sense how common sense is it

446
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:38,479
um you

447
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:41,399
know I don't see enough back door money

448
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:44,038
politically to make it a thing that a

449
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,840
guy is anti-cannabis and you can you can

450
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:49,119
vote on him based on that there some

451
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:52,720
wayone in that for politician and

452
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:53,759
there's a lot of money in it for States

453
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,279
and

454
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:59,319
municipalities should they you know be

455
00:19:56,279 --> 00:20:01,558
able to have an actual Market

456
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:02,439
yeah these propped up markets they're

457
00:20:01,558 --> 00:20:05,279
not

458
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:08,440
functional we're seeing you know the

459
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:12,879
we're seeing the best quality product

460
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,919
just um yeah knocked down Penny by Penny

461
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,360
by

462
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:20,440
Penny and the top shelf weed now seems

463
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:24,199
to be the [ __ ] weed the guy that's got

464
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:26,679
27 different grows multi-state operators

465
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:29,080
he's got the most money in marketing

466
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:33,360
exactly yeah I mean I think we get back

467
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:34,639
to our roots to a degree with uh

468
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:37,319
Boutique

469
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,038
flour I think I think but but also

470
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:41,399
there's a lot of people prioritizing

471
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:44,640
things like perple flour and I think

472
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:47,600
these things are fads I think that you

473
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,640
know purple flour is is nice but I don't

474
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:51,199
think it's any nicer in green you know I

475
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,320
think we need to go back and look at the

476
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,480
effect of the plant uhuh and the taste

477
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:57,240
of the plant those two things I mean for

478
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,038
me all the other stuff is just hype

479
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,919
anyway it's like yeah you know we can

480
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:02,158
talk about the way the ash burs and we

481
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:03,840
could talk about all these different

482
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,039
things but at the end of the day how

483
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:09,319
does it make you feel and how does it

484
00:21:06,038 --> 00:21:12,119
taste tell you it I I want my pot to

485
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:14,319
smell to taste like it smells yeah I

486
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:15,558
like it to smell like it tastes yeah

487
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:18,759
that's that's what it's all about those

488
00:21:15,558 --> 00:21:20,240
are the two first old factory senses

489
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:23,079
that you can bring to bear because so

490
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,519

496
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:41,839
very heavy fruit

497
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:43,480
blueberry it's it's it's special thanks

498
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:45,798
thanks it does have quite the

499
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,640
combination and it's good that they all

500
00:21:45,798 --> 00:21:50,879
they sink well they go well together at

501
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:52,320
any yeah yeah that's one of my uh so

502
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,960
that was one of my male breeding

503
00:21:52,319 --> 00:22:00,158
projects yeah which that really baffled

504
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:01,519
me that um breeding males um

505
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,840
get what it was I was smoking and we

506
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:05,440
were looking at pictures of weed and

507
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:08,558
getting ey somewhere in a partner's

508
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:11,240
house down in his basement with they I

509
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:13,558
thought why all people breed their

510
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,960
males and I obviously knew all of the

511
00:22:13,558 --> 00:22:16,480
answers because they didn't want 18

512
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,200
million seeds they wanted to be able to

513
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,440
sell their butt right oh you know I'm

514
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,440
thinking well there's ways just got to

515
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,640
be really

516
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:27,880
careful got to have a house on either

517
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,759
quarter of the 30 acre yeah no yeah but

518
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,480
it's so it's so much more simple than

519
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:35,640
that you know you can you can have a

520
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,839
safe pollen tight room to flower your

521
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:42,159
flowers you can have some stringent

522
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:45,038
dress codes pene rules you know clean it

523
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:49,760
shower shampoo whatever it

524
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:52,720
takes but um it's not that hard if you

525
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:55,319
put some work into it but right that's

526
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:58,679
just like growing any other way it's not

527
00:22:55,319 --> 00:23:02,879
hard just s so work what you put in you

528
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:07,320
get out yeah yep and I was

529
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:08,880
um real surprised with that blue 13 mail

530
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:11,798
on the back of your book your latest

531
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,278
book yeah so let's let's talk about that

532
00:23:11,798 --> 00:23:14,720
and and well I want to talk about

533
00:23:13,278 --> 00:23:17,440
breeding more but let's talk about the

534
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,480
book so if you guys have seen the the

535
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,278
breeding

536
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:24,440
book this is my single favorite photo of

537
00:23:22,278 --> 00:23:27,038
all time that's ever been taken of a

538
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:29,278
male plant and some people think it's

539
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:30,879
reversed I I've got a lot of comments

540
00:23:29,278 --> 00:23:32,519
that they're like no that's a reverse

541
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,000
fight well it's not this guy is the one

542
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:37,798
who grew that bred it took the photo of

543
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,159
it and ever since I saw that photo I've

544
00:23:37,798 --> 00:23:43,319
been in love with it and so it's just

545
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:46,240
it's a special photo there's nothing

546
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:47,759
quite like it uh you just kep and the

547
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,599
beauty of that is you captured it in the

548
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:52,119
moment it's not you know it it can only

549
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:54,439
be captured on film it's gone it's gone

550
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:56,038
that was at its peak and that was like

551
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,759
right before it started just dumping

552
00:23:56,038 --> 00:24:00,759
huland dump as yes yeah you could tell

553
00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:03,038
and it's just it's super healthy super

554
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:06,759
happy there's purple there's green it's

555
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:09,599
just it's an amazing photo and uh you

556
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:11,480
know for forever that'll be remembered

557
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:12,959
yeah at least by me and by the people

558
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,599
who read my book is one of the best

559
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:18,079
photos of a of a mail ever that's a huge

560
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:20,519
compliment and I I take it happily and

561
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:23,639
will anyway yeah there's um it was

562
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:26,000
actually I went to you to talk about

563
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:28,919
reversing yeah and that was I don't know

564
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,278
a year or two after this probably yeah

565
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:33,600
yeah still that was a while back yeah it

566
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:35,519
was there's no chemicals

567
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:38,599
no

568
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:41,359
silver sulfine or what there there's no

569
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:43,240
uh there no reversing tricks or well

570
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:44,798
there's all kinds of stuff all kind of

571
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,480
stuff and there's sowing if always just

572
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:50,319
skin a cat to still get good results but

573
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,558
you started breeding with males and how

574
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:54,278
many years ago was that because it's

575
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:56,599
been quite a while about 10 15 years

576
00:24:54,278 --> 00:24:59,079
yeah and you did you made a mimosa you

577
00:24:56,599 --> 00:25:01,319
made a mimosa before the M of the people

578
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:03,918
yes yes yeah yeah but the thing is with

579
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:06,678
that like [ __ ] man I can't put this on

580
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:09,000
the market it hadn't been [ __ ] back

581
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:11,720
cross you know just I didn't do the

582
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,278
stuff to stabilize it yeah there's a lot

583
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,558
of dudes that just Chuck pollen and

584
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:16,880
[ __ ] now they're a breeder or

585
00:25:15,558 --> 00:25:18,918
accidentally make seeds now they a

586
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,799
breeder that happens too that happens to

587
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:23,360
by the way sh but uh I mean throughout

588
00:25:21,798 --> 00:25:24,879
history you know there's other people

589
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:27,359
that just buy seeds and call themselves

590
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,360
breeders and it's the the hype train and

591
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:31,079
yeah you know I don't hate on anybody

592
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:32,479
and I don't call anybody out for

593
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:34,839
whatever they do I could care less I

594
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,360
just want to focus on me and improve

595
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:38,480
constantly trying to improve myself

596
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:40,959
because I'm not there yet I still have a

597
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,399
ways to go we got this book you took

598
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,000
photos in the book you're an amazing

599
00:25:42,398 --> 00:25:47,199
photographer by the way thanks so yeah I

600
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,839
think uh we got some good pollen shots

601
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,960
and you you know you uh do the poll with

602
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:55,519
the desicant so dud I could so I'm

603
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:57,038
reading through that and the part about

604
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:59,319
uh one of the universities that have

605
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:01,679
been studying about by been in Israel or

606
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:04,000
somewhere and then their methods for

607
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:08,720
collecting and storing

608
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:12,319
Hall so these guys been to my house yeah

609
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:15,000
they know that right and and and it's

610
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:17,000
it's just hit or best double off with me

611
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,919
common sense right in common sense I

612
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,720
think a lot of it common sense isn't so

613
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:23,000
common but a lot of the if you think

614
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,600
about stuff you know and use common

615
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,919
sense you can be successful yeah how do

616
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:29,038
I get it dry how do I know it was still

617
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:33,000
dry I don't want to open up bottle in my

618
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:35,398
house yeah wor sealed how do I know it's

619
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,759
still good yeah you know this is all

620
00:26:35,398 --> 00:26:39,918
about putting out a product you don't

621
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:42,038
want to put out [ __ ] put out a crappy

622
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,159
product so yeah that was was a whole

623
00:26:42,038 --> 00:26:46,278
reason for me not selling Mimosa seeds I

624
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:50,840
hadn't stabilized him somebody came

625
00:26:46,278 --> 00:26:55,240
along use the name snooze L yeah you had

626
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:56,879
a was it l Roa lunar Rosa lunar Rosa

627
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,960
what's his yeah what's his name was it

628
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:02,240
Belushi yeah is

629
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:04,798
growing lunar Rosa now something like

630
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:07,440
that same name yeah I think he took the

631
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:11,359
law the beginning yeah so it was L lunar

632
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:14,558
Rosa yeah real purple an thein so you're

633
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:17,119
right they're just they're not a flavor

634
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:20,278
flavonoid um they don't really I don't

635
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:21,278
know what it is that they can add to

636
00:27:20,278 --> 00:27:24,558
something

637
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:29,000
ingested you know they smoke yeah um

638
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:31,319
it's it's a good um it's an anti

639
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,240
inflammatory I I think there's you know

640
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:36,599
and there's nothing wrong with purple in

641
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,440
the you know the the full palet of

642
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:40,639
different color possibilities you know

643
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,640
we talking about pink flower the other

644
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,159
day I was talking about how sfv actually

645
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,360
it'll turn pink at the end and some

646
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,240
flowers like if you go longer you're

647
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:50,959
making seeds with sfv certain genetics

648
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,519
they turned pink and I think that that's

649
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,679
beautiful I think that purple is

650
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:58,240
beautiful but I don't think that it's

651
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,559
more for me it's not more special just

652
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,079
for me personally it's just not my

653
00:27:59,558 --> 00:28:02,319
preference and there's nothing wrong

654
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:03,678
that other people think that it's

655
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:06,319
amazing and they love it and that's what

656
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,919
the market Standard is cuz whatever it

657
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:10,759
is it is you know whatever the people

658
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,880
want the people want uh you know you can

659
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:15,519
change it by showing them something

660
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:18,760
different and maybe better but then what

661
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:20,599
is better right it's so subjective uh

662
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:22,679
you know because I think we're a little

663
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:25,000
bit older and so we like the hazes we

664
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:28,240
like the more up

665
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,398
Twisted yeah and I I love all of it but

666
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,679
I definitely love sativas and I love

667
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:34,239
that uplifting flower and there's

668
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:36,159
something that's special about the nose

669
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:39,679
on some of those you that are really

670
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:41,880
strong and just really loud yes yes I

671
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,919
can't get enough of them sometimes and

672
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,159
but but it's also you have to have a

673
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:47,038
pretty good tolerance for some of that

674
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:49,760
stuff you do it's not just the couch

675
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:52,079
loog tolerance right well you know you

676
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:54,000
can get paranoid if you smoke too much

677
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:57,759
tell palpiti you're looking out the

678
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:01,319
window yeah hiding from the cops they

679
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:03,278
there so we put meth in my weed yeah and

680
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:05,558
there's a lot on TV on the news these

681
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:10,558
days a lot of reports some of them are

682
00:29:05,558 --> 00:29:14,158
soan just ridiculously obviously aimed

683
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:17,359
at an agenda but then again the science

684
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:19,039
really isn't there on either side so

685
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:21,479
definitely more science needs to be

686
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:24,278
brought to bear and that's something

687
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,079
going back to Federal legalization yeah

688
00:29:24,278 --> 00:29:29,440
or at least say

689
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:31,519
cers this would be a v help when we're

690
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:35,558
having these discussions whether they be

691
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:38,679
political or legal or just societal

692
00:29:35,558 --> 00:29:41,158
right um that we use accurate

693
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:44,000
information yeah I was telling you about

694
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:46,480
when I was first diagnosed with cancer

695
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,558
then it was a real bad cancer still is

696
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:54,038
I'm still fighting it but what I found

697
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:55,918
out was like well [ __ ] I'm this weed guy

698
00:29:54,038 --> 00:29:58,240
everybody knows me from H out of Stave

699
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:02,200
the guy with the weed you with the long

700
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:05,038
here and H me yeah why can't I just do

701
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:07,000
what they all do and just cure

702
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:10,278
myself

703
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,278
and I you know I was kind of skeptical I

704
00:30:10,278 --> 00:30:13,880
was always little skeptical but fck if

705
00:30:12,278 --> 00:30:16,200
that's what they said they needed that's

706
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:19,399
what you got here here's all my super

707
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:21,440
diversity or Inda this will help you

708
00:30:19,398 --> 00:30:25,879
yeah again whether it helped him or not

709
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:28,840
it prob help me right with benevolence

710
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:32,799
but what I found out

711
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:35,798
it you know the whole gram a day 30 days

712
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:37,200
or 60 days I did four grams a day

713
00:30:35,798 --> 00:30:41,480
because I already knew I had a heavy

714
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:44,880
tolerance yeah I do for 120 days it

715
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:46,558
seems as if it didn't have an effect and

716
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,840
then about that same time just feel a

717
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:51,240
little bit after my first TR out of

718
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:53,639
chemo and then my surgery I discovered

719
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:59,240
that certain types of

720
00:30:53,640 --> 00:31:02,159
canono can kill certain types of cancer

721
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:04,720
yeah but if you think that about that

722
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:07,278
again logically or with common

723
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:10,000
sense there's another truth to that

724
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:14,200
which has been verified with empirical

725
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:17,960
data is that certain types of conoids

726
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:21,000
can exacerbate certain types of cancer

727
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:24,399
this weed can [ __ ] you up and can kill

728
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,880
your cancer this weed couldn't kill you

729
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:27,678
through your

730
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,519
cancer who would have thought it you

731
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,360
know

732
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:34,359
yeah so that kind of my little rant I

733
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:36,398
haven't been online much lately but my

734
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:38,240
rant is whenever I see somebody

735
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:41,398
especially if they're try to sell oros

736
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:44,880
or Pico or whatever yeah if this kills

737
00:31:41,398 --> 00:31:47,479
cancer C yourself but D we did this 20

738
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,840
years ago 30 years we already said all

739
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:52,200
of that [ __ ] yeah and we know it's not

740
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:53,879
true yeah and unfortunately there are

741
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,399
still a lot of folks out there pushing

742
00:31:53,880 --> 00:32:00,600
it as

743
00:31:56,398 --> 00:32:05,359
factual and uh robing people of a chance

744
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:07,558
long lot nothing else I know people

745
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:10,199
personally throughout my H best family

746
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:12,638
over 30 years said that's right man [ __ ]

747
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,919
that Western medicine [ __ ] those guys

748
00:32:12,638 --> 00:32:18,119
and those doctors it's all about big

749
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:21,080
Pharma man big Pharma and uh we watch

750
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:23,398
those people die at death yeah and this

751
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:26,319
that's really the sadest part right to

752
00:32:23,398 --> 00:32:28,199
me it was s so well it's to the

753
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:30,759
individual's body chemistry there's so

754
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,798
many things and so many factors it's not

755
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:36,599
straightforward it's not a one- siiz

756
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:39,319
fits-all solution if it was we wouldn't

757
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:40,719
have cancer anymore right and so it does

758
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:42,200
work for certain types of cancer it's

759
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,360
been shown to work for certain types of

760
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:47,080
cancer but also certain ailments Crohn's

761
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:49,599
disease man yes it's amazing for Crohn's

762
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:52,079
disease right but that other things uh

763
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:54,480
not so much and but but that every once

764
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:56,678
in a while you get somebody who's cured

765
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,599
from certain things so it's so

766
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:01,600
individual and I mean we're just

767
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:03,480
scratching the surface of it and that's

768
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:04,918
tied into the whole Federal legalization

769
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,079
that's why it needs to be federally

770
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:08,278
legal so we can study it and they are

771
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:09,759
allowing some studies but they're not

772
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:13,240
allowing enough studies once Federal

773
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:16,398
legalization goes then or or

774
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:18,440
decriminalization or rescheduling any of

775
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:20,239
them to be honest we can study it a lot

776
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:23,080
more in the United States they're way

777
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:26,798
ahead of us in Israel way ahead of us in

778
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:29,199
Israel and other countries as well but I

779
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:31,278
think we are making progress no doubt

780
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,080
we're making progress since we first met

781
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:37,720
it's a whole different moral oh jeez

782
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:41,199
right I goodness met in your uncle's

783
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:43,600
Fortress of a garage yeah yeah he was

784
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:46,639
going a bunch to my genetics and yeah we

785
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:49,839
got some good stuff and one a cup with

786
00:33:46,638 --> 00:33:51,240
one of them yeah yeah yeah in amstr D in

787
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:54,158
amster D in

788
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:56,839
2012 okay y so it's amazing the things

789
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:58,600
that bring us together you know right

790
00:33:56,839 --> 00:34:00,759
right and it's it's amazing how many

791
00:33:58,599 --> 00:34:02,319
people you meet along the way that you

792
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:04,879
meet one time and then that's it and

793
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:09,639
then other people you know I talk to you

794
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:11,639
more than I talk to Uncle Pat oh so but

795
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:14,200
but yeah I mean you meet people and you

796
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:16,079
connect with people and you know there's

797
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:18,598
there's some Synergy and you know you're

798
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,839
in a breeding you you you know I think

799
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:22,039
we've had a lot of good conversations

800
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:23,559
over the years in photography you you

801
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:25,559
know we went out to squim at can

802
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:28,039
Organics and you took photos when we

803
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:29,039
were running the Autos out there with me

804
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:33,199
and

805
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:35,918
Kyle uh and Marlin I thinka came out we

806
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:39,358
had a good trip on nor yeah we did Mar

807
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:41,279
Asher yes sir sir good times yeah

808
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:42,878
totally good times I like arguing with

809
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,519
you about being a breeder though I still

810
00:34:42,878 --> 00:34:47,078
I swear I'm not a breeder I don't know

811
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:49,280
ah you're you're more of a breeder than

812
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:50,879
most of the guys so all you can do the

813
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,320
breed you get the breeder card with me

814
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:54,279
as far as I'm concerned you're a real

815
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,280
breeder and you're actually concerned

816
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,760
about the things that matter we know

817
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,519
that I think so many guys are world

818
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,680
worried about what it looks like on

819
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:04,079
Instagram than what what they're

820
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:07,480
actually doing to the plant or creating

821
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:09,480
or feto hunting unfortunate yeah and a

822
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,199
lot of people don't understand the the

823
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:14,159
part about breeding to really be a

824
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:15,879
breeder you should be Fen acting and

825
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:17,118
selecting and finding winners if you're

826
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,079
not doing that you're just a seed

827
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,440
producer in my opinion you know you can

828
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:22,599
call yourself whatever you want I'm not

829
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:25,720
going to pagle on anybody but at the end

830
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:28,039
of the day the real process of breeding

831
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:29,759
is the selection process selection yeah

832
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:31,159
yeah so and that's what makes it special

833
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,280
and that to me that's one of the best

834
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:34,960
parts is you never know it's kind of a

835
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,760
watery to a degree I mean you might know

836
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,920
your Lin so well enough to go okay I'm

837
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:41,000
going to get something like this and you

838
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:43,680
have a good idea but sometimes it's [ __ ]

839
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,599
a lottery you CP 50 seeds and you never

840
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:47,719
know and and maybe you get nothing and

841
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,519
maybe you get all winner and sometimes

842
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:51,519
you get exactly what you think and

843
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:53,039
sometimes you get completely different

844
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:55,599
stuff that you're like where the heck

845
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:58,519
did this come from I had none of this

846
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:00,480
raspberry and any of my stuff a you know

847
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:03,719
I mean I think fruit pops up different

848
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:06,159
types of fruit mangoes guers some of

849
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:09,118
those are yeah I I love when those pop

850
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:12,039
up and then I love banana too Banana's

851
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:15,559
good I like smoking banana flour I've

852
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:18,199
never really had much luck with could

853
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:22,318
say luck but

854
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:25,199
um satisfaction with banana strains yeah

855
00:36:22,318 --> 00:36:27,800
like gr big and wunky and chunky which

856
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:29,639
obviously like but the flavor is say

857
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,880
I've never really tasted God damn it if

858
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:34,960
it says banana in they want to taste

859
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:37,880
banana yeah for sure smell it well so so

860
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:40,480
I did a banana Skittles cross and the

861
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:42,318
banana Z House of cultivar they have it

862
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,039
and it ought to have them send you some

863
00:36:42,318 --> 00:36:46,679
but the selection that was selected

864
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:48,318
because you get it all over the place

865
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:51,639
with within the selections there was

866
00:36:48,318 --> 00:36:53,838
banana chip there was like banana cream

867
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:57,159
there was like plantain like a green

868
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:59,480
banana kind of smell there was like a a

869
00:36:57,159 --> 00:37:01,039
couple different variations of like ripe

870
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:04,119
banana and then there was the candy

871
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:06,079
banana and that candy banana is what I'm

872
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:08,160
all about I wanted to smell those banana

873
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:10,800
e banana yeah well you know the banana

874
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:12,838
ruts candy I wanted to taste like that

875
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,880
where it's almost like fake chirp banana

876
00:37:12,838 --> 00:37:19,440
and then even the extract when you smoke

877
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:21,000
it it has that fake banana turp and so I

878
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,599
you know but when I did my crosses I

879
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,079
made Regular seeds so I used multiple

880
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:27,838
males so that gives you a wide variety

881
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:28,920
of possibilities so if you're a breeder

882
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:31,000
and someone who's actually doing

883
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:33,440
selection you can go in and you can go

884
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,159
okay well this cross is like chem 991

885
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:39,960
and it leans towards the chem but it has

886
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:43,000
a candy banana or has a a unre banana as

887
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:45,838
a very green banana taste or as banana

888
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,400
chip or banana custards uhhuh you know

889
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:48,400
you get some of those banana custardy

890
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,680
ones

891
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,838
and I love you know it's kind of a

892
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:53,879
choose your own ADV interesting and

893
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:56,039
that's part of the fun of it yeah

894
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:57,039
totally and for a while there that's

895
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:59,838
interesting you should talk about

896
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:01,440
multiple Naes I've never really known

897
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:05,799
how to pose that

898
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:09,679
question or to who or where

899
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:13,519
um what does what's the advantage other

900
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:16,199
than variety so increasing genetic

901
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:17,599
diversity in the F1 populations when

902
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:18,960
you're Crossing things together for the

903
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,519
first time if you don't know the

904
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,559
breeding lines and you're trying to

905
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:26,159
select a male I would me personally I

906
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:27,759
wouldn't select just one male I probably

907
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:31,318
three males that represent different

908
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,960
sure Expressions yeah right and so you

909
00:38:31,318 --> 00:38:34,838
know it's like once you know your lines

910
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,679
you're like okay this is the male this

911
00:38:34,838 --> 00:38:38,358
is the maale that I Envision is the mail

912
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:41,118
that I'm going to use you know this

913
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:43,559
one's squat it doesn't flower right away

914
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:45,720
or what whatever your your goals are I

915
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:48,078
like the way this Stacks yeah you know

916
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:51,039
there's so many things but like for me I

917
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:52,240
did the the sent hour and with that I

918
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:53,599
used three different Vees that

919
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:56,879
represented three different things that

920
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:59,160
I liked you know and then when we did

921
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,800
that the PO populations now you have

922
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:03,318
more variety and diversity so you can

923
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,240
pick it's Choose Your Own Adventure

924
00:39:03,318 --> 00:39:07,559
again and so and then the more seeds you

925
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:09,318
pop I have large amounts of seeds so

926
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:11,440
it's like okay we can pop 100 seeds and

927
00:39:09,318 --> 00:39:13,119
we can SE what we like and if there's

928
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,800
nothing good there we don't have to go

929
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:17,440
for other 100 but if it's good maybe we

930
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,760
pop 300 or you know and you can do that

931
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,920
on a smaller scale you can do on a

932
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,160
larger scale I have some friends that

933
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,880
are popping a thousand seeds one thing I

934
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:26,639
think that's a little extreme personally

935
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:30,800
but uh I mean I guess it comes down to

936
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:34,159
resources yeah it comes out of resources

937
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,880
and you know what you're willing to do

938
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:38,399
as far as time because all that stuff is

939
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:40,000
very time consuming and obviously

940
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,200
expensive you know when it comes to

941
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:46,280
resources and is that the best use of

942
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:49,078
your resources 18,000 or 25,000 seed

943
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:51,079
fenite and if you have the space and the

944
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:53,680
time and the money maybe it's worth it

945
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:56,680
for unicorns yeah but a lot of stuff you

946
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:59,039
can find within a good population you

947
00:39:56,679 --> 00:40:01,639
you might not find unicorn the next

948
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:03,119
whatever it is yeah you you may identify

949
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:05,679
the next OG Kush but lot of that stuff

950
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:08,519
is Lottery anyway like obviously like

951
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:10,118
the OG cush you know I feel like

952
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:13,759
something like that is has very

953
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:15,838
recessive traits and so that one was a

954
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,520
very you know whereas chem dog you look

955
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:21,400
at all those chem se's those were all

956
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:24,000
fire those it wasn't a winter winter

957
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,599
chicken dinner lottery ticket it was the

958
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,880
okay we popped the first one and it was

959
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:30,240
a fot it we popped the other ones they

960
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:33,358
were pretty good winners and then Sour

961
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:37,679
Diesel came out of that is you know you

962
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:40,119
know The Offspring of the chem 91 and I

963
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:42,598
think that so certain

964
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:44,039
things they just have it in there and

965
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:47,000
other thing is it's the watery where

966
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:50,960
it's that one in you know 18,000 or one

967
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:54,079
in 5,000 or the loud Berry that Jason

968
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,960
Midnight Rider hunted of my we popped

969
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:59,680
thousands of those seeds he got a 10

970
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:02,119
pack and found the winner in one 10 pack

971
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:04,799
and so you know and sometimes it's the

972
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:06,720
way it was grown and sometimes you grow

973
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,519
something out one time and the next time

974
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:10,559
you go ass out the same too so it's how

975
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:12,880
about they grow stuff out multiple times

976
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:14,358
you know and that always makes me wonder

977
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,119
well where does where did the difference

978
00:41:14,358 --> 00:41:19,039
come

979
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:20,519
from no from one time to the next yeah

980
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:23,159
so so there's so many things I mean

981
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:25,719
there's uh chemistry changes that happen

982
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:27,960
within the plant uh as the plant matures

983
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:29,799
so you're getting maturity that's why

984
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:32,039
from going from seed to that first

985
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:34,359
generation you can get a completely

986
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:35,679
different expression and then even the

987
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:37,440
Next Generation so we grow it out

988
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:39,118
multiple times and we change our minds

989
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,960
on what we think is the best along the

990
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:45,800
way and yeah I think looking at data

991
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:47,760
plus actually being able to uh compare

992
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:49,800
side by side that that's probably the

993
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,359
best you know but like you grow

994
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:54,318
something out three times in you though

995
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:56,039
that that third time okay also you may

996
00:41:54,318 --> 00:41:57,800
have to treat that plant a little bit

997
00:41:56,039 --> 00:42:00,119
different you that plant easily thinned

998
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:02,640
out more here or it can be pushed harder

999
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:04,838
we can feed it more nutrients calling a

1000
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:06,920
generation another seat you're just no

1001
00:42:04,838 --> 00:42:08,960
I'm talk clonal generation okay so we'll

1002
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:12,200
do clonal generation so from from the

1003
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,960
initial seed start I I've been debating

1004
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:15,639
this recently but I always get rid of

1005
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:17,318
that seed start and I don't grow the

1006
00:42:15,639 --> 00:42:19,000
seed start out so I start with the first

1007
00:42:17,318 --> 00:42:20,719
colonal generation and what we do is

1008
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,920
we'll basically take that seed start

1009
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:24,399
grow a big enough to take clones off it

1010
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,800
right now we're getting five clones

1011
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,519
we're going to clone those get rid of

1012
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,960
the additional seed start because you

1013
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:33,039
don't get that anyway so I don't want to

1014
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,880
see what I can't have now if you're

1015
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:36,358
selling seeds that could be valuable if

1016
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,318
somebody's growing those seeds in a

1017
00:42:36,358 --> 00:42:40,239
field to know what kind of Expressions

1018
00:42:38,318 --> 00:42:42,480
they're getting but if you're trying to

1019
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:44,919
sell clones and you want to or license

1020
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,199
genetics like the stuff that we're doing

1021
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:48,358
uh when you talk about licensing

1022
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:50,679
genetics you want something that's

1023
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:51,880
you're going at this representation of

1024
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:53,719
what you'll get you're going to see in

1025
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:55,838
the future what your customers are going

1026
00:42:53,719 --> 00:42:58,039
to see what people are going to see you

1027
00:42:55,838 --> 00:42:59,599
know for years to come hopefully

1028
00:42:58,039 --> 00:43:01,358
uh and so that's why we start with the

1029
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:03,440
first generation and grow it out to its

1030
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:05,199
three colonal generations before we

1031
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,639
really make the decision on what's the

1032
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:09,480
winter that's it for this time yeah

1033
00:43:07,639 --> 00:43:11,078
really it so I gotta get you down the

1034
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,400
the Bay Area to check out the facility I

1035
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:14,519
feel like we're doing some really

1036
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,880
incredible stuff you know and I'm

1037
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:17,759
excited to share with people like

1038
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:19,079
yourself that we've been talking about

1039
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,160
this kind of stuff forever and turning

1040
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:24,960
it into reality is pretty amazing

1041
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:27,879
seriously just seriously yeah very very

1042
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,880
passionate for it again as we keep going

1043
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:32,318
back to

1044
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:35,440
um yeah can't think of

1045
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:38,639
anything that requires passion that's

1046
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:40,358
the negative Endeavor yeah in life so

1047
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:42,000
throughout this journey you've learned a

1048
00:43:40,358 --> 00:43:43,799
ton of stuff I mean I feel like we've

1049
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,838
all learned We're Young we think we're

1050
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,519
so smart and we think we know everything

1051
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:49,159
and we're so invincible and then as we

1052
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:51,719
get older we realize we're not

1053
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:53,480
Invincible we're fragile uh we don't

1054
00:43:51,719 --> 00:43:56,078
know everything we know very little

1055
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:58,480
compared to what we could know and it's

1056
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:00,000
you know forever we're learning yeah but

1057
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,199
what would be your one piece of advice

1058
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,960
for the younger generation that's coming

1059
00:44:02,199 --> 00:44:06,960
into the in Industry that's passionate

1060
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:09,639
by cannabis follow your heart don't

1061
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,760
follow your wallet and just [ __ ] the

1062
00:44:09,639 --> 00:44:14,358
money if you want to make money in this

1063
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:17,720
industry maybe someday you will as you

1064
00:44:14,358 --> 00:44:20,000
can see these multi-state operators with

1065
00:44:17,719 --> 00:44:23,039
millions and millions and millions of

1066
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,239
bankroll behind them but you know you

1067
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:27,759
see those guys fall in by the ways side

1068
00:44:25,239 --> 00:44:30,279
really rapidly too yeah

1069
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:32,839
um they don't have the passion for the

1070
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:33,680
plan um they don't have the passion for

1071
00:44:32,838 --> 00:44:36,358
the

1072
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:39,279
knowledge um I don't think they I don't

1073
00:44:36,358 --> 00:44:42,920
think a lot of these big

1074
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:44,880
operators have an understanding of of

1075
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:47,240
the power of this

1076
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:49,680
plant so I would just say follow your

1077
00:44:47,239 --> 00:44:52,558
heart man follow your heart and have

1078
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:55,399
good intents and and always be cure when

1079
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:57,400
it comes to the plant just be honest

1080
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,920
about what you're growing if you're

1081
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:01,079
spraying it with something be honest

1082
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:03,960
about what you're spraying it with yeah

1083
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:05,559
you know um if you're having issues get

1084
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:07,559
help there's so many people out there

1085
00:45:05,559 --> 00:45:08,800
that want to tell you everything yeah

1086
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:10,599
because there's a lot of folks out there

1087
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:13,079
that know everything literally it's

1088
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:16,160
amazing how people how many people out

1089
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:20,119
there know so much about growing really

1090
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:23,679
good weed again it's um it's something

1091
00:45:20,119 --> 00:45:25,880
that takes some passion and and

1092
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:28,239
commitment so yeah just don't get into

1093
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:31,079
it unless you have

1094
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:33,799
that I think it's as simple as a

1095
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:35,839
authenticity there you go authenticity

1096
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:38,240
absolutely thank you so you got quite

1097
00:45:35,838 --> 00:45:40,639
the guitar collection got a few back

1098
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:41,959
there yeah you got some nice fers and

1099
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:45,199
yeah yeah

1100
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:48,920
so he's B Fender guy I'm more proud of

1101
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:51,679
the Hempfest artwork up on the wall and

1102
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:55,318
that was just like no other well you've

1103
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:57,519
done other events too not just s so yeah

1104
00:45:55,318 --> 00:46:01,358
s and a friend so I was

1105
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:04,400
uh like I love growing weed guy needs

1106
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:06,719
guy needs to um fix his lights or his

1107
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:09,838
exhaust or some [ __ ] in his room and I'm

1108
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:12,239
working in a uh working for sea green

1109
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:16,318
you might even know him have the first

1110
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:18,358
i502 license in the state right and P

1111
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:20,159
had a dispensary pretty close so

1112
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:22,519
whenever I was out of weed or needed

1113
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:25,639
something or I run over this place by

1114
00:46:22,519 --> 00:46:27,358
and weed became Pals you know talk about

1115
00:46:25,639 --> 00:46:29,199
growing weed he had a bunch of we GR in

1116
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:32,078
the back of his

1117
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:33,598
dispensary and um and I was up working

1118
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:36,119
on lighting or saw him some company

1119
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:39,039
giving a bunch of Lights in comes one of

1120
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:41,519
the venders dve dve you got to check

1121
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:43,558
this old guy out man it's crazy he's got

1122
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:47,000
like the purplest weed I've ever seen

1123
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:51,920
and it they're in a can it's in a paint

1124
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:54,519
can so when I looked and yeah

1125
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:58,440
about and talk about what I was doing

1126
00:46:54,519 --> 00:47:02,880
show B his weed and purple [ __ ] it was

1127
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:06,318
uh stray called it old old Toby old boy

1129
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:09,519
stop at little Toby

1130
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:15,558
yeah there's a lot history with that see

1131
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:18,200
yeah oh boy we'll talk about that later

1132
00:47:15,559 --> 00:47:20,720
yeah that's a all other show yeah

1133
00:47:18,199 --> 00:47:23,919

the bathrooms they want to know whether

1198

guys we have a big paper cab drawing on

1203

00:50:39,679 --> 00:50:44,199
one you chose you know that's not a way

1213
00:50:41,798 --> 00:50:46,519
to [ __ ] we you do not build a

1214
00:50:44,199 --> 00:50:48,598
clientele that way yeah so that was

1215
00:50:46,519 --> 00:50:51,159
another contribution and made sure that

1216
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:54,640
we got a map that was digit all and

1217
00:50:51,159 --> 00:50:58,480
clickable all and right all the stuff I

1218
00:50:54,639 --> 00:51:00,719
mean we were each in all right had um a

1219
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:04,519
decent amount of skills but it was

1220
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:07,078
definitely the um the combination yeah

1221
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:10,480
that that gave us ws and actually

1222
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:13,519
allowed us to to run this

1223
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:15,719
professionally so

1224
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:17,920
um that was kind of the role in the

1225
00:51:15,719 --> 00:51:21,318
beginning for me and of course it's

1226
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:24,760
there's always the uh the plcity and you

sometime yeah you guys had a good run

1231
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:38,639
this could to be an interesting Road

1232
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:41,680
there's a whole lot of shows that are

1233
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:44,159
going under yeah after the the beginning

1234
00:51:41,679 --> 00:51:46,798
we saw what Indo Expo that didn't last

1235
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:50,798
long no there's some details behind that

1236
00:51:46,798 --> 00:51:53,079
one too but still perfectly viable event

1237
00:51:50,798 --> 00:51:56,039
that should still be around the dudes

1238
00:51:53,079 --> 00:51:58,798
that put it on were authentic well see

1239
00:51:56,039 --> 00:52:02,239

1240
00:51:58,798 --> 00:52:05,480
different events and annual events and

1241
00:52:02,239 --> 00:52:08,279
one one that was on tour the US kind of

1242
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:11,719
win all over what do you think the

1243
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:13,680
secret recipe for success is with with

1244
00:52:11,719 --> 00:52:15,399
doing that in the EV in the event space

1245
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:17,798
in the event space it's matter of a few

1246
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:21,160
things first of all you need to know

1247
00:52:17,798 --> 00:52:23,960
rules and rigs in that

1248
00:52:21,159 --> 00:52:25,519
region public smoking lab public

1249
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:28,480
consumption

1250
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:31,440
um can you buy or

1251
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:34,318
sell at the site that you're producing

1252
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:38,679
this event on y even though the state of

1253
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:41,279
the city allows it will will the event

1254
00:52:38,679 --> 00:52:43,919
center allow it that's always been a big

1255
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:46,559
one but but the state says but the local

1256
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:49,880
but yeah but this is our building we say

1257
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:51,319
no so that's a tough one um so

1258
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:53,400
definitely know where you're going and

1259
00:52:51,318 --> 00:52:54,838
what you can do once you get there yeah

1260
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:57,599
that's the biggest thing because now you

1261
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:59,639
can design an event

1262
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:02,880
that fits the parameters of what you're

1263
00:52:59,639 --> 00:53:06,639
able to do right or you're able to do

1264
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:09,880
what you're design originally

1265
00:53:06,639 --> 00:53:12,519
intended that and now Outreach yeah I

1266
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:15,960
see people straight up selling weed on

1267
00:53:12,519 --> 00:53:18,079
Facebook sell seeds on Facebook it's

1268
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,440
this that's the craziest thing ever the

1269
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:21,599
the seed thing for me because you know

1270
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:23,880
it's like I see I sell seeds legally we

1271
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:26,079
can't use metaphor marketing to sell the

1272
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:28,039
seeds yet even though it's to have

1273
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:30,280
product is still a gray area with meta

1274
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:33,279
for MPH they called it well no meta

1275
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:35,559
which is other meta Facebook and

1276
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:38,119
Instagram so I can't sell my seeds

1277
00:53:35,559 --> 00:53:39,798
legally through meta right now it's a

1278
00:53:38,119 --> 00:53:42,200
gray area like they won't let me do it I

1279
00:53:39,798 --> 00:53:44,358
could promote my book I could promote my

1280
00:53:42,199 --> 00:53:46,279
podcast but I cannot sell seeds and

1281
00:53:44,358 --> 00:53:49,039
that's fine but I do see other people

1282
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:51,240
doing it you know they're they're uh

1283
00:53:49,039 --> 00:53:54,358
they're doing like the Gorilla Marketing

1284
00:53:51,239 --> 00:53:56,879
style and do it until they get caught I

1285
00:53:54,358 --> 00:53:59,199
guess it's what happens with us y we

1286
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:01,640
type cannabis in one of our posts some

1287
00:53:59,199 --> 00:54:04,639
were taken down the next day yeah shut

1288
00:54:01,639 --> 00:54:08,199
down um there's an

1289
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:10,719
event that we believe is has a good time

1290
00:54:08,199 --> 00:54:12,960
monitoring our pages and turning Us in

1291
00:54:10,719 --> 00:54:15,078
yeah seems to be sport among some other

1292
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,880
F these businesses yeah there's a lot of

1293
00:54:15,079 --> 00:54:18,720
haters out there I wish they would all

1294
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:21,240
just uh focus on making themselves

1295
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:22,838
better but yeah I just you got to ignore

1296
00:54:21,239 --> 00:54:26,078
them unfortunately that's just the way

1297
00:54:22,838 --> 00:54:30,000
you go right and again it we'll go back

1298
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:31,240
to allowing us to build stronger models

1299
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,400
stronger business

1300
00:54:31,239 --> 00:54:36,039
models well you know your enemies are

1301
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:37,400
the the ones who make you strong yes so

1302
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:39,079
a lot of people don't understand that

1303
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:41,160
you know if like your enemies are the

1304
00:54:39,079 --> 00:54:44,039
ones who make you successful and strong

1305
00:54:41,159 --> 00:54:47,480
yes and so you know everything comes

1306
00:54:44,039 --> 00:54:49,880
with a grain of salt but I think the

1307
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:52,318
people around you are the ones you know

1308
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:55,079
that influence and make you who you are

1309
00:54:52,318 --> 00:54:56,880
and that's okay too completely and yes

1310
00:54:55,079 --> 00:54:59,400
that they are you you are your

1311
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:02,358
environment you are what you eat being

1312
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:04,400
as simple as that yeah yeah

1313
00:55:02,358 --> 00:55:07,358
so then you

1314
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:09,838
know components change some things boil

1315
00:55:07,358 --> 00:55:12,440
to the top of the pot yeah as they're in

1316
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:13,838
the process of cooking and also those

1317
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:15,920
are kind of my things you know like I

1318
00:55:13,838 --> 00:55:18,119
said the cream Rises to the top yeah you

1319
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:21,358
may be in that pot with a bunch

1320
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:25,599
of ingredients here know sure

1321
00:55:21,358 --> 00:55:27,119
about doesn't matter take on the take on

1322
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:29,920
the essences

1323
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:32,960
take on the other qualities yeah and

1324
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:35,880
come up to the top of the F yeah you

1325
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:41,079
know yeah fight your way if you have to

1326
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:44,039
amen amen yeah yeah and you know I think

1327
00:55:41,079 --> 00:55:45,920
for me one of the things was I I was

1328
00:55:44,039 --> 00:55:48,720
told like you want to make life easy you

1329
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:51,680
want your kids to have an easy life what

1330
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:53,279
I've learned is struggle is what defines

1331
00:55:51,679 --> 00:55:56,719
you and struggle is what makes you

1332
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:58,480
strong and so going through struggle is

1333
00:55:56,719 --> 00:56:02,078
not necessarily a bad

1334
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:04,159
thing I at know hard work is good for

1335
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:05,920
hard work is definitely good for people

1336
00:56:04,159 --> 00:56:07,279
yeah we need a lot more hard work out

1337
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:10,000
there I think the younger generation can

1338
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:12,280
of LAX that work ethic yeah but in a

1339
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:17,079
couple Generations we can get it back so

1340
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:19,640
remove it y yeah and we will I mean it's

1341
00:56:17,079 --> 00:56:23,079
it's a natural progression it's a cycle

1342
00:56:19,639 --> 00:56:25,519
yeah so as far as your breathing

1343
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:27,559
philosophies let's dive into that for a

1344
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:30,559
minute and to the first sh that I don't

1345
00:56:27,559 --> 00:56:32,039
have any of yeah well so I mean you

1346
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:33,839
don't have any but you do believe in

1347
00:56:32,039 --> 00:56:36,920
breeding males you do believe in doing

1348
00:56:33,838 --> 00:56:38,759
male selections yeah so let's let's talk

1349
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:40,639
about that you know as far as male

1350
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:44,200
selections what do you look forward to

1351
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:47,480
me like I said it's all yeah it's all

1352
00:56:44,199 --> 00:56:50,078
personal preference right yeah I like

1353
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:52,760
what I like I I like a nice pointy spear

1354
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:55,359
shaped nug and I like to see that in my

1355
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:58,359
males I see a lot of males that that are

1356
00:56:55,358 --> 00:57:00,400
people's freaking unicorns and it's

1357
00:56:58,358 --> 00:57:04,239
interesting to me that they have some

1358
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:06,599
little tiny top nugs and kind of Wither

1359
00:57:04,239 --> 00:57:08,038
away to the bottom yeah and I would

1360
00:57:06,599 --> 00:57:11,599
think that a more

1361
00:57:08,039 --> 00:57:14,920
vigorous chunky plant would yield the

1362
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:17,760
same in the female of Warg chubby plant

1363
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:21,000
so it was just that physical that first

1364
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:24,599
physical observation of the of the plant

1365
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:26,798
that that helped me decide right which

1366
00:57:24,599 --> 00:57:30,000
which was my favorite

1367
00:57:26,798 --> 00:57:32,480
I aromatics are a bit of a thing with

1368
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:36,519
males but they're important definitely I

1369
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:39,599
mean definitely important MH the clex um

1370
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:42,880
combination of of TS and flavonoids that

1371
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:45,680
you named off as you were smelling that

1372
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:47,720
blue 13 you don't smell any of that

1373
00:57:45,679 --> 00:57:50,598
while they're little baby males W in the

1374
00:57:47,719 --> 00:57:52,439
dust no you know you get a lot of GRA

1375
00:57:50,599 --> 00:57:54,280
you get a little stem rub and like yeah

1376
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:55,920
you get a little stem rub and get

1377
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:57,720
something something in there yeah you

1378
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:59,358
get a little green a lot of green a lot

1379
00:57:57,719 --> 00:58:01,239
of green but yeah for the stem rub but

1380
00:57:59,358 --> 00:58:02,960
for me I've always got chlorophyll some

1381
00:58:01,239 --> 00:58:04,598
of the time you get like if it's orange

1382
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:07,079
you you'll get orange yeah you know or

1383
00:58:04,599 --> 00:58:09,680
if it's there's certain specific things

1384
00:58:07,079 --> 00:58:12,480
hazy was sometimes you can get that the

1385
00:58:09,679 --> 00:58:16,399
haze on there you know and but yeah

1386
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:19,798
definitely like orange pops and lemon

1387
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:22,480
pops CIT Citrus ones really pop but the

1388
00:58:19,798 --> 00:58:23,880
sub tees don't come out until the flow's

1389
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:26,719
grown out and you can actually smell the

1390
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:28,838
flow yeah the female flow the female

1391
00:58:26,719 --> 00:58:31,679
exactly and so that's where it goes back

1392
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:35,199
to time it just bringing good we takes

1393
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:38,358
time time and patience patience yeah

1394
00:58:35,199 --> 00:58:40,118
yeah I mean life is short the the irony

1395
00:58:38,358 --> 00:58:44,759
is life is short but you have to have

1396
00:58:40,119 --> 00:58:46,480
patience right victim but you know um at

1397
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:48,599
a point that was where I was at in my

1398
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:50,358
life I had plenty patience canacon was

1399
00:58:48,599 --> 00:58:53,200
doing really well yeah so I didn't have

1400
00:58:50,358 --> 00:58:54,798
to go out and hustle twice as twice as

1401
00:58:53,199 --> 00:58:58,000
hard as

1402
00:58:54,798 --> 00:58:59,838
before so so yeah that allowed me I was

1403
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,440
blessed with the ability to have

1404
00:58:59,838 --> 00:59:04,679
patience yeah all of us a blessing it

1405
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:07,318
this really is so that was what got me

1406
00:59:04,679 --> 00:59:09,358
into breeding males was why are people

1407
00:59:07,318 --> 00:59:11,239
talking about breeding males they read

1408
00:59:09,358 --> 00:59:12,480
this with that this with that how did

1409
00:59:11,239 --> 00:59:15,000
they breed it there are a couple of

1410
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:17,599
females which one was the male which one

1411
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:19,798
was the female yeah I mean all of those

1412
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:21,960
questions popped up and said want to

1413
00:59:19,798 --> 00:59:23,759
read some [ __ ] males yeah and see

1414
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:26,159
what happens well and taking photos of

1415
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:27,799
males you've taken some amazing photos I

1416
00:59:26,159 --> 00:59:28,759
know a lot of great photographers out

1417
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:30,159
there but not a lot of great

1418
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:33,880
photographers that have taken pictures

1419
00:59:30,159 --> 00:59:36,920
of males right right so it's you hard to

1420
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:37,680
come by yeah and they're under B yeah

1421
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:42,079
yeah

1422
00:59:37,679 --> 00:59:44,279
exactly um the F and the and and the

1423
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:45,880
photography opportunities yeah and and

1424
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:47,720
the window is also short where they're

1425
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:50,720
in their Peak to where they look amazing

1426
00:59:47,719 --> 00:59:51,879
so you really the the guy who's doing

1427
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:53,519
the photography is probably the

1428
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:54,798
photographer typically I mean I've had

1429
00:59:53,519 --> 00:59:58,400
photographers come in and get some of

1430
00:59:54,798 --> 01:00:00,038
the stuff of my Maes but but man if if

1431
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,519
you are a photographer and you have

1432
01:00:00,039 --> 01:00:03,599
males it just makes it even better

1433
01:00:01,519 --> 01:00:06,440
because there's a very short window of

1434
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:08,960
when it's in Peak yeah yeah F so then

1435
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:11,838
when the when the basically when the

1436
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:13,960
grenades have all opened up and all

1437
01:00:11,838 --> 01:00:15,440
those pollen sacks have open up the

1438
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:19,358
pollen is released it's a beautiful

1439
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:23,159
looking flower too yes you know M or a

1440
01:00:19,358 --> 01:00:27,000
or a minut for minute yeahor ptis or

1441
01:00:23,159 --> 01:00:28,960
whatever we had totally all on turns

1442
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,599
pollen turns you got to really you know

1443
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:32,358
basically separate that pollen pretty

1444
01:00:30,599 --> 01:00:34,640
quickly once they start opening up like

1445
01:00:32,358 --> 01:00:36,798
that oh totally but once they're open

1446
01:00:34,639 --> 01:00:40,199
and you hit them that's that's for me

1447
01:00:36,798 --> 01:00:42,838
that's one of the most satisfying

1448
01:00:40,199 --> 01:00:44,919
experiences is when you have a big male

1449
01:00:42,838 --> 01:00:47,558
or reverse female and you have the co

1450
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:49,720
the huge Cola and it's opened up where

1451
01:00:47,559 --> 01:00:53,039
you know the P's going to fly and you

1452
01:00:49,719 --> 01:00:55,078
hit it or you shake it and that pollen

1453
01:00:53,039 --> 01:00:57,119
just flows whether it's in a room or

1454
01:00:55,079 --> 01:00:59,400
Outdoors Outdoors is even more

1455
01:00:57,119 --> 01:01:01,200
impressive yes totally you know I was I

1456
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:04,798
was down south of San Diego with my

1457
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:07,038
buddies uh and they were doing the my my

1458
01:01:04,798 --> 01:01:09,798
buddy created the well not created but

1459
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:12,559
he decided to use the leaf blow with the

1460
01:01:09,798 --> 01:01:14,199
Mason jar of pollen and you shake it

1461
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:16,200
Leaf flower and you know there's videos

1462
01:01:14,199 --> 01:01:18,358
online from this so the leaf flow is

1463
01:01:16,199 --> 01:01:20,279
turned around backwards to be a vacum

1464
01:01:18,358 --> 01:01:23,159
yeah well Leaf flower blows right so to

1465
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:25,319
the back of it it sucks air put the

1466
01:01:23,159 --> 01:01:26,798
pollen in the dry pollen through there

1467
01:01:25,318 --> 01:01:28,798
and it just shoot shoots it out over the

1468
01:01:26,798 --> 01:01:33,920
field you know and this is this was done

1469
01:01:28,798 --> 01:01:37,280
on the offse but to see the wave of

1470
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:39,079
pollen the plants and you know it's just

1471
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:41,920
locking on and you're making a ton of

1472
01:01:39,079 --> 01:01:43,359
seed I mean I love that but even a wave

1473
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:46,119
in the room that kind of floats above

1474
01:01:43,358 --> 01:01:48,798
the canopy of pollenly goes from Ed Edge

1475
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:49,960
when you smack that plant well I like to

1476
01:01:48,798 --> 01:01:52,639
because I grow

1477
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:54,440
indoors and you do the infinity tents

1478
01:01:52,639 --> 01:01:58,879
now like we have something in common

1479
01:01:54,440 --> 01:02:00,798
with I like those in CH this yeah the

1480
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:03,079
controllers once you get the controllers

1481
01:02:00,798 --> 01:02:04,920
dialed in they do everything for you I

1482
01:02:03,079 --> 01:02:06,160
think they're really straight for easy

1483
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:07,639
and if you're looking for breeding

1484
01:02:06,159 --> 01:02:08,960
Chambers if you have a house you can

1485
01:02:07,639 --> 01:02:11,798
separate your stuff but even if you have

1486
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:14,318
a facility see Infinity tents work

1487
01:02:11,798 --> 01:02:15,960
really well for keeping your plants

1488
01:02:14,318 --> 01:02:19,440
separate you have to maintain this size

1489
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:21,440
of a room or seven plants or 10 plants

1490
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:23,119
exactly yeah when they make them in

1491
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:26,318
different shapes and size different

1492
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:27,838
needs I me the little 2x4s yeah I had a

1493
01:02:26,318 --> 01:02:31,599
couple of those so that one hanging

1494
01:02:27,838 --> 01:02:35,440
around um I put my Mals in there and

1495
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:38,278
just flower my Mals yeah um definitely

1496
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:41,000
taking care and caution with my exhaust

1497
01:02:38,278 --> 01:02:44,079
systems MH but once those males are big

1498
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:47,278
and they're ready to go um I take a big

1499
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:49,160
ass mason jar quarter pound jars yes

1500
01:02:47,278 --> 01:02:51,559
call them clean the hell out of it you

1501
01:02:49,159 --> 01:02:54,719
know do all of the sanitary stuff yeah

1502
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:58,839
and I turn off all of my air light off

1503
01:02:54,719 --> 01:03:01,879
cuz they have bad cheapos head pans um

1504
01:02:58,838 --> 01:03:02,798
turn all the air off no move as little

1505
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:05,559
as

1506
01:03:02,798 --> 01:03:08,599
possible zip the zipper open just enough

1507
01:03:05,559 --> 01:03:11,519
for me to get up in there yeah and I

1508
01:03:08,599 --> 01:03:12,920
take that big ass [ __ ] top Cola and a

1509
01:03:11,519 --> 01:03:15,159
couple of the other branches and I'd

1510
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:17,318
squeeze them together and you loing

1511
01:03:15,159 --> 01:03:20,679
little po floating down sure to this

1512
01:03:17,318 --> 01:03:22,079
point just upside down with that mason

1513
01:03:20,679 --> 01:03:24,199
jar I don't know if I can hold on to one

1514
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:26,318
right out upside down with that mason

1515
01:03:24,199 --> 01:03:30,118
jar and oh yeah had some quite you break

1516
01:03:26,318 --> 01:03:31,838
the stem and then you just give a slap

1517
01:03:30,119 --> 01:03:34,358
just a slap and you're watching it all

1518
01:03:31,838 --> 01:03:36,119
roll down the side of that jar roll it

1519
01:03:34,358 --> 01:03:39,558
around a little bit more damn just a

1520
01:03:36,119 --> 01:03:41,798
slap and just like gently pull it out of

1521
01:03:39,559 --> 01:03:44,039
there as you're pulling pulling with it

1522
01:03:41,798 --> 01:03:45,679
oh I'm sure oh yeah and then you just

1523
01:03:44,039 --> 01:03:48,359
cap

1524
01:03:45,679 --> 01:03:50,558
it lock everything up you go out on the

1525
01:03:48,358 --> 01:03:52,318
front porch or wherever so it's not to

1526
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:53,440
you know contaminate your indoor air too

1527
01:03:52,318 --> 01:03:56,519
much

1528
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:59,079
total give it a spank on the lid I just

1529
01:03:56,519 --> 01:04:02,880
watch that stuff roll again down the

1530
01:03:59,079 --> 01:04:05,839
sides of the jar solid yellow wave

1531
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:09,000
just [ __ ] love it yeah that's that's

1532
01:04:05,838 --> 01:04:11,920
my favorite part of deina ating a mail

1533
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:13,400
yeah and I collect it and clean it and I

1534
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:15,000
think a lot of people would love to hear

1535
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:16,440
about how you clean your pollen and

1536
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,039
store your pollen I think that's

1537
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:19,519
valuable I don't talk about that enough

1538
01:04:18,039 --> 01:04:21,680
on my show but you know I think you're

1539
01:04:19,519 --> 01:04:23,798
an expert in that regard so why don't

1540
01:04:21,679 --> 01:04:27,558
you share how you uh colle from that

1541
01:04:23,798 --> 01:04:29,920
point how you separate clean it store it

1542
01:04:27,559 --> 01:04:32,278
uh dry it out yeah and a lot of little

1543
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:34,200
black bugs that I don't get indoors that

1544
01:04:32,278 --> 01:04:36,440
I get Outdoors yeah I don't know if they

1545
01:04:34,199 --> 01:04:37,838
are but I know a good reason to grow

1546
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:42,559
indoors with your

1547
01:04:37,838 --> 01:04:46,920
males but um pretty simple take U you

1548
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:48,440
know six or eight um sheets and and put

1549
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:51,880
them on a table something like this

1550
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:53,880
table right here um of just typing paper

1551
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:57,200
you know printer paper

1552
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:58,880
mhm and it'll take it have a round

1553
01:04:57,199 --> 01:05:03,960
rimmed

1554
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:06,400
um calling her a s a screen just buying

1555
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:09,000
screen plop that on top of the jar turn

1556
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:10,798
it all over I get to have fun Bing my

1557
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:14,599
pollen down the sides of the jar again

1558
01:05:10,798 --> 01:05:16,318
just the other way B smack B you know do

1559
01:05:14,599 --> 01:05:18,440
it for a

1560
01:05:16,318 --> 01:05:19,599
while until you get till you feel like

1561
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:22,480
you get everything that's going to roll

1562
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:26,000
out of there um now I've got a piece of

1563
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:28,519
paper kind of tap the S side well ways

1564
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:32,000
to get it into a singular file I'll

1565
01:05:28,519 --> 01:05:33,880
crease the papor down both sides yeah um

1566
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,760
make end up making like the old cocaine

1567
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:39,200
things the folds with the snow

1568
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:42,520
seals that little diagonal thing they

1569
01:05:39,199 --> 01:05:44,558
big coke and but snow seals I remember

1570
01:05:42,519 --> 01:05:46,798
so I basically give a big snow sh powder

1571
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:50,680
envelope powder envelope yeah thank you

1572
01:05:46,798 --> 01:05:53,079
yeah yeah yeah and um at that

1573
01:05:50,679 --> 01:05:56,199
point um I'll sit it in there I'll DP a

1574
01:05:53,079 --> 01:05:59,599
bunch of desicant beads in it um color

1575
01:05:56,199 --> 01:06:02,679
changing desicant beads y they're easy

1576
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:04,278
to find Amazon has them all day long and

1577
01:06:02,679 --> 01:06:06,480
these are just a plain beads they're not

1578
01:06:04,278 --> 01:06:08,760
inside the packets the packets would

1579
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:11,079
just get a lot of pollen stuck to them

1580
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:12,680
and just the plain beads and I you know

1581
01:06:11,079 --> 01:06:15,680
squish them around a little bit I seal

1582
01:06:12,679 --> 01:06:19,358
that little pouch up and stick something

1583
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:23,078
on top of it yeah for a while a couple

1584
01:06:19,358 --> 01:06:25,798
of days come back SI out all the beads

1585
01:06:23,079 --> 01:06:27,760
they've turned all Pink by now yeah so

1586
01:06:25,798 --> 01:06:29,519
Ty to change a bead s them out on that

1587
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:34,000
same little SI I was talking about the

1588
01:06:29,519 --> 01:06:35,838
little ra screen um redo the process St

1589
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,719
it back on the paper you can see if

1590
01:06:35,838 --> 01:06:39,920
there's debris in your falline right and

1591
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:41,318
um that's the first thing you would do

1592
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:43,838
is pick out a little tweezer or

1593
01:06:41,318 --> 01:06:47,278
something to pick out any debris growing

1594
01:06:43,838 --> 01:06:48,719
indoor I get very little yeah um and I'm

1595
01:06:47,278 --> 01:06:51,159
not beating the heck out of the plants

1596
01:06:48,719 --> 01:06:54,038
I'm getting really virtually no Leaf

1597
01:06:51,159 --> 01:06:56,440
debris mhm so you got some pollen it

1598
01:06:54,039 --> 01:06:59,559
it's pretty damn dry do that about three

1599
01:06:56,440 --> 01:07:02,200
or four times until I get literally no

1600
01:06:59,559 --> 01:07:05,240
pink Beats back and it take a week or

1601
01:07:02,199 --> 01:07:08,159
two and try to do it out in my garage

1602
01:07:05,239 --> 01:07:10,399
where it's cool yeah in the 60s or so I

1603
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:11,879
try to keep it cool I fight with

1604
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:14,798
moisture out there I really have a way

1605
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:16,440
to you know to mitigate or to control

1606
01:07:14,798 --> 01:07:18,239
the whole environment and that's where

1607
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:20,920
I'm thinking about adding back that

1608
01:07:18,239 --> 01:07:24,439
little 2x10 tent right so I can throw

1609
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:25,838
humidity in there take it out just as

1610
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:28,400
easily as I could control the

1611
01:07:25,838 --> 01:07:31,440

environmentally controlled pollen curing

1613
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:35,599
if you will I had never thought of the

1614
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:38,160
idea of curing pollen until I read your

1615
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:39,798
book or that section of your book it's

1616

1663
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,560
get yeah and that goes to the Z's all of

1664
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:32,480

of money with the candies another event

1671
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:51,759
that may or may not come to fruition

1672
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:54,399
over the next several years right

1673
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:55,960
somebody big company big testing out in

1674
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:57,960
California

1675
01:09:55,960 --> 01:10:04,800
decided they were going to change the

1676
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:08,399
letters from NN i s to NN Ys yeah canes

1677
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:09,600
um first off there is is a real lame way

1678
01:10:08,399 --> 01:10:13,559
to spell the

1679
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:18,320
canes um but secondly still steel ini sh

1680
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:19,880
yeah not big with that thiefs yeah you

1681
01:10:18,319 --> 01:10:22,039
know the industry is kind of been built

1682
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:25,440
on that with genetics wise people

1683
01:10:22,039 --> 01:10:28,479
renaming and thank you look at run Slim

1684
01:10:25,439 --> 01:10:31,279
Sherry gelato and gelato

1685
01:10:28,479 --> 01:10:34,000
33 and the comparisons where people have

1686
01:10:31,279 --> 01:10:35,679
just cut fished other people for

1687
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,439
whatever it is and that's not just the

1688
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:41,279
only one it's been throughout the years

1689
01:10:37,439 --> 01:10:42,559
I mean OG Kush in it's really sad that

1690
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:43,880
it's gone that way and you can never

1691
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:47,480
really trust it but

1692
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:49,279
also what is really what is subjective

1693
01:10:47,479 --> 01:10:50,678
to the individual and what they have

1694
01:10:49,279 --> 01:10:52,719
been given unless you got it from the

1695
01:10:50,679 --> 01:10:54,840
breeder who knows maybe you got this

1696
01:10:52,719 --> 01:10:57,158
awesome cut and it's called this but

1697
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:59,279
really it went through seven different

1698
01:10:57,158 --> 01:11:02,319
people got renamed along the way and it

1699
01:10:59,279 --> 01:11:04,559
thought that or it's a sugar I'm growing

1700
01:11:02,319 --> 01:11:07,599
out of small badge right

1701

01:13:00,639 --> 01:13:05,440
other people's genetics and put their

1747

name on it or call the the thing

1748

cannabis shows I went to and it was in

destiny of being a cannabis journalist

I would say he was my canid daddy

1845
01:17:10,439 --> 01:17:15,279
because he was like a father and a

1846
01:17:12,679 --> 01:17:17,960
mentor and a best friend for me in the

1847
01:17:15,279 --> 01:17:22,198
Cannabis industry he supported

1848
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:25,359
everything that I had created and he had

1849
01:17:22,198 --> 01:17:27,719
my back on all of my wild ideas and he

1850
01:17:25,359 --> 01:17:30,399
listened and you know some of my ideas

1851
01:17:27,719 --> 01:17:33,279
were absolutely [ __ ] Bonkers but they

1852
01:17:30,399 --> 01:17:35,238
were legitimate and they were real and

1853
01:17:33,279 --> 01:17:37,599
they were creative and he absolutely

1854
01:17:35,238 --> 01:17:39,039
adored it and supported me completely

1855
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:41,079
and followed it through all the way to

1856
01:17:39,039 --> 01:17:45,198
my pitch of my comic book to different

1857

than that he was my best friend uh he

1860
01:17:50,198 --> 01:17:56,279

things and did all the stuff and uh we

1955
01:22:08,079 --> 01:22:12,319
were kind of isolated here in Lynwood

1956
01:22:10,359 --> 01:22:14,079
and this very dead end you're looking at

1957
01:22:12,319 --> 01:22:17,840
right now is actually where I was where

1969
01:22:41,439 --> 01:22:46,039

1974
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:56,679
for

1975
01:22:55,079 --> 01:22:58,479
those of you that don't know a lot of us

1976
01:22:56,679 --> 01:23:01,440

1977
01:22:58,479 --> 01:23:03,519
of a can as well but you know I soon I

1978
01:23:01,439 --> 01:23:05,039
soon transitioned into a bong after that

1979
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:08,120
you know we had the plastic Graphics

1980
01:23:05,039 --> 01:23:10,880
bongs back when I was a kid right but

1981
01:23:08,119 --> 01:23:13,119
yeah so you started smoking out of a can

1982
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:15,039
I smok on a can decided we were going to

1983
01:23:13,119 --> 01:23:17,079
grow some weed put this little

1984
01:23:15,039 --> 01:23:19,279
fluorescent light in my closet oh my God

1985
01:23:17,079 --> 01:23:20,760
if my mom ever found it you know yeah

1986
01:23:19,279 --> 01:23:22,840
and I didn't know the first thing about

1987
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:25,159
growing weed put in dirt keep it in some

1988
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:26,800
water you know keep it moist and grew

1989
01:23:25,158 --> 01:23:28,359
great couldn't figure out how to get

1990
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:29,719
flowers on it didn't even know there was

1991
01:23:28,359 --> 01:23:31,559
such a thing as flowers because the

1992
01:23:29,719 --> 01:23:34,520
commercial stuff we were getting was

1993
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:36,679
just that commercial Columbian whatever

1994
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:38,560
it was so it was really good sometimes

1995
01:23:36,679 --> 01:23:42,639
but yeah we didn't get much flour in our

1996
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:44,440
bags right and so I didn't didn't really

1997
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:47,119
learn about growing flower for quite

1998
01:23:44,439 --> 01:23:48,879
some time so we smoked dried up leaves

1999
01:23:47,119 --> 01:23:51,079
yeah yeah wasn't very good didn't get

2000
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:53,199
very high just her out for very long

2001
01:23:51,079 --> 01:23:55,039
because of that yeah we all have origin

2002
01:23:53,198 --> 01:23:57,519
stories though we do

2003
01:23:55,039 --> 01:23:59,079
eventually uh hanging out with the older

2004
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:00,960
brothers of Bruce and Brian we met some

2005
01:23:59,079 --> 01:24:03,039
older dudes and they were the weed

2006
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:06,880
dealers we learned a little bit from

2007
01:24:03,039 --> 01:24:09,760
them yeah about where it came from and

2008
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:11,279
and most of the weed up here was brick

2009
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:14,480
weed that had seeds in it there wasn't a

2010
01:24:11,279 --> 01:24:16,599
lot of hom grow right maybe in the 80s

2011
01:24:14,479 --> 01:24:19,599
there started to get the ' 80s was when

2012
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:23,039
we had the the hom grow bag appeal hit

2013
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:26,000
Affy thae ay thae ay Tha bro I sure

2014
01:24:23,039 --> 01:24:27,760
missed that stuff and it wasn't it was

2015
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,840
so interesting how sticky it was and

2016
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:33,079
I've yet to

2017
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:36,400
see in modernday cannabis the same

2018
01:24:33,079 --> 01:24:38,559
qualities where it sticky literally I

2019
01:24:36,399 --> 01:24:41,000
could throw it it would stick on you

2020
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:43,159
yeah right pick it yeah you don't see

2021
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:46,279
that anymore no it didn't but it wasn't

2022
01:24:43,158 --> 01:24:47,920
just wet weed right it was res it was

2023
01:24:46,279 --> 01:24:49,759
resin yeah it was resin you could stick

2024
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:51,039
it the glass no problem you can th it on

2025
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:52,760
anything yeah you got it's going to be a

2026
01:24:51,039 --> 01:24:54,399
[ __ ] to wash that piece of glass off

2027
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:57,400
yeah yeah so we went through that

2028
01:24:54,399 --> 01:24:59,279
transition here that was my learned how

2029
01:24:57,399 --> 01:25:01,559
to roll weed with that stuff learned how

2030
01:24:59,279 --> 01:25:03,439
to roll joints wow what a pain in the B

2031
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:05,639
that was yeah chopping it up your little

2032
01:25:03,439 --> 01:25:08,519
bits with scissors trying not to get it

2033
01:25:05,639 --> 01:25:10,840
clunky yeah so that was it back to

2034
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:13,239
growing weed wow it took another couple

2035
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:15,159
of years for me to actually try to get

2036
01:25:13,238 --> 01:25:17,638
serious about creating buzs and flowers

2037
01:25:15,158 --> 01:25:19,799
once we saw the appy thae of course

2038
01:25:17,639 --> 01:25:21,679
since selia when we were learn about

2039
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:23,199
cilia too was like yeah when you get

2040
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:25,480
some seeds from that stuff there at No

2041
01:25:23,198 --> 01:25:27,879
Seeds bro cilia

2042
01:25:25,479 --> 01:25:30,000
right found some decent weed to grow

2043
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:32,600
some decent seeds Columbian weed wasn't

2044
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:35,238
bad man Hawking and all of the stuff

2045
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:37,920
that DJ Short loves to talk about yeah

2046
01:25:35,238 --> 01:25:40,599
damn um we grew some good weed out of

2047
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:44,118
those seeds yeah yeah they finally

2048
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:46,560
learned about the light cycle nice yeah

2049
01:25:44,118 --> 01:25:49,198
miracle I don't remember what we did for

2050
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:50,679
fertilizer we dug in my mom's Miracle

2051
01:25:49,198 --> 01:25:54,879
Grow under the kitchen sink that she

2052
01:25:50,679 --> 01:25:59,118
used in all of her house plants right we

2053
01:25:54,880 --> 01:26:01,920
NPK man F NPK is some of the most

2054
01:25:59,118 --> 01:26:05,279
rebranded repackaged hyped

2055
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:09,920
[ __ ] couple of entities on the planet

2056
01:26:05,279 --> 01:26:11,880
they I mean just you know totally basic

2057
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:14,560
so there something we said for basic too

2058
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:17,199
I think uh totally a lot of people want

2059
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:19,360
to get so complicated and on some level

2060
01:26:17,198 --> 01:26:22,238
you can go really basic and get really

2061
01:26:19,359 --> 01:26:23,799
good results you know as we get older we

2062
01:26:22,238 --> 01:26:25,039
want to refine stuff and we want to make

2063
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:29,039
it our own

2064
01:26:25,039 --> 01:26:31,439
but on some level there is the beauty of

2065
01:26:29,039 --> 01:26:32,880
Simplicity and I remember amazing stuff

2066
01:26:31,439 --> 01:26:35,158
and maybe our Palace were different or

2067
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:38,440
whatever but like there was a lot of

2068
01:26:35,158 --> 01:26:41,238
stuff that you know less is more in

2069
01:26:38,439 --> 01:26:43,279
certain instances for sure I started

2070
01:26:41,238 --> 01:26:45,839
using this this guy's nudes I always

2071
01:26:43,279 --> 01:26:47,679
wanted to grow organic but you know that

2072
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:49,279
really takes outside it's tough to grow

2073
01:26:47,679 --> 01:26:53,079
organic unless you're

2074
01:26:49,279 --> 01:26:56,719
outside um now with modern technology

2075
01:26:53,079 --> 01:27:00,039
technology to grow organic um it's a lot

2076
01:26:56,719 --> 01:27:02,158
easier now there's a lot of the provide

2077
01:27:00,039 --> 01:27:03,920
they starting soil at the very least I

2078
01:27:02,158 --> 01:27:08,118
mean there's organic soils you can buy

2079
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:11,000
organic inputs you can argue that promix

2080
01:27:08,118 --> 01:27:12,559
is organic or not certainly they add

2081
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:15,279
some

2082
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:20,400
uh no not vermiculite but the other

2083
01:27:15,279 --> 01:27:22,279
light perite perite rather thank you um

2084
01:27:20,399 --> 01:27:24,679
that was always my base I just started

2085
01:27:22,279 --> 01:27:26,759
we started to use a make a super soil

2086
01:27:24,679 --> 01:27:28,800
yeah and adding all of our own inputs

2087
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:30,960
and the tarp method Shake of a corner

2088
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:34,400
shake you know go around it and mix the

2089
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:35,480
heck out of it but um after a point I

2090
01:27:34,399 --> 01:27:37,000
met a

2091
01:27:35,479 --> 01:27:41,399
guy

2092
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:44,719
um who was making his own nutrients up

2093
01:27:41,399 --> 01:27:48,158
in Blain up near the Canadian border

2094
01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:51,800
yeah and uh Dominion Organics if anybody

2095
01:27:48,158 --> 01:27:55,158
remembers the brand nice uh Blaine

2096
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:57,279
passed away didn't have any PL with

2097
01:27:55,158 --> 01:28:00,238
family or friends to carry on the

2098
01:27:57,279 --> 01:28:02,840
business but he built some of the finest

2099
01:28:00,238 --> 01:28:05,198
finest organic

2100
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:09,159
inputs never grown any better weed than

2101
01:28:05,198 --> 01:28:10,960
with his wow yeah just just good stuff

2102
01:28:09,158 --> 01:28:12,599
and unfortunately he died you know the

2103
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:14,840
re ofes who knows where they are who

2104
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:18,480
might have them family isn't interested

2105
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:21,440
in in any upkeep of the company or the

2106
01:28:18,479 --> 01:28:23,559
product seem be happening a lot lately

2107
01:28:21,439 --> 01:28:25,359
pardon me that happens a lot with these

2108
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:27,159
the younger generation not wanting to

2109
01:28:25,359 --> 01:28:30,559
follow suit with the parents for

2110
01:28:27,158 --> 01:28:32,079
thousands of years the St the son or the

2111
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:33,840
daughter did what the father did

2112
01:28:32,079 --> 01:28:35,679
typically it was from father to son

2113
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:39,639
father to son and businesses got dressed

2114
01:28:35,679 --> 01:28:41,319
on and and names you know yeah totally

2115
01:28:39,639 --> 01:28:43,760
they followed the father and the son and

2116
01:28:41,319 --> 01:28:46,039
their business right but uh

2117
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:48,760
unfortunately that didn't happen

2118
01:28:46,039 --> 01:28:51,439
here and um so it's really interesting I

2119
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:54,480
quit growing there for a while got sick

2120
01:28:51,439 --> 01:28:57,118
um had some health issues uh minute

2121
01:28:54,479 --> 01:29:00,319
growing just all the work of growing was

2122
01:28:57,118 --> 01:29:03,920
overwhelming to me so I had to quit and

2123
01:29:00,319 --> 01:29:06,118
I so I quit for a couple of years during

2124
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:10,600
that time this is when Blair

2125
01:29:06,118 --> 01:29:13,118
died and um so getting back into growing

2126
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:15,719
I had a couple of half buckets of this

2127
01:29:13,118 --> 01:29:17,198
half buckets of that and grew out my

2128
01:29:15,719 --> 01:29:19,359
first batch

2129
01:29:17,198 --> 01:29:22,519
and made me real

2130
01:29:19,359 --> 01:29:24,839
happy second batch I ran out of the NES

2131
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:26,159
wow like damn and I finally found out

2132
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:28,239
where you know why I couldn't get them

2133
01:29:26,158 --> 01:29:33,000
they weren't out there neither was their

2134
01:29:28,238 --> 01:29:35,919
maker and so I'm shopping around for

2135
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:38,639
organic nutrients and Alaska fish

2136
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:41,118
fertilizer came up I thought yeah that's

2137
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:42,880
organic as hell I'm going to use that

2138
01:29:41,118 --> 01:29:45,039
and I found out they also had a blue

2139
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:47,199
they the low end and the high end

2140
01:29:45,039 --> 01:29:50,639
thought this is perfect man it was cheap

2141
01:29:47,198 --> 01:29:52,000
man super cheap so I started growing

2142
01:29:50,639 --> 01:29:54,880
with this

2143
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:57,359
stuff and I don't know what was going on

2144
01:29:54,880 --> 01:30:00,359
my plants were growing and getting huge

2145
01:29:57,359 --> 01:30:01,399
and turning brown cardboard Brown all at

2146
01:30:00,359 --> 01:30:04,359
the same

2147
01:30:01,399 --> 01:30:07,920
time the hell's going on with my weed

2148
01:30:04,359 --> 01:30:10,000
man um and the one thing that I really

2149
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:12,840
took me this whole most of this whole

2150
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:14,000
batch to figure it out duh no greater

2151
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:17,319
check my

2152
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:19,039
pH during this time this six or eight or

2153
01:30:17,319 --> 01:30:21,238
almost 10 years time that I grew with

2154
01:30:19,039 --> 01:30:23,639
Blair's nutrients yeah the dominan

2155
01:30:21,238 --> 01:30:25,879
Organics I ended up hanging up my pH

2156
01:30:23,639 --> 01:30:27,840
Meer never never needed I was like why

2157
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:29,440
do those even use a pH everybody's all

2158
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:32,600
like got to check your pH got to check

2159
01:30:29,439 --> 01:30:36,719
your pH well was always great yeah six

2160
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:39,039
65 67 you know just right

2161
01:30:36,719 --> 01:30:40,920
there so I never really pH I never

2162
01:30:39,039 --> 01:30:43,118
bothered to after a couple of years of

2163
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:44,639
going through that breaking a pH made

2164
01:30:43,118 --> 01:30:46,799
hell they were 500 bucks or something

2165
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:48,679
back in the day they still probably are

2166
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:50,719
well you can get the $30 pH feder and

2167
01:30:48,679 --> 01:30:52,520
you can get the $500 pH right you can

2168
01:30:50,719 --> 01:30:55,560
even spend more than five you sure you

2169
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:59,520
oh yeah you sure can but um and there's

2170
01:30:55,560 --> 01:31:01,360
the middle of the roads but uh I finally

2171
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:03,880
decided I should probably check

2172
01:31:01,359 --> 01:31:06,399
something yeah you know where we where

2173
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:08,039
we fans dying so I checked the

2174
01:31:06,399 --> 01:31:12,439
pH

2175
01:31:08,039 --> 01:31:14,679
2.0 2.0 oh well that explains a lot that

2176
01:31:12,439 --> 01:31:16,279
explained a lot like yeah I've been

2177
01:31:14,679 --> 01:31:19,480
growing weed all my life I'm I'm a

2178
01:31:16,279 --> 01:31:23,000
master grower man

2179
01:31:19,479 --> 01:31:24,519
yeah um but those are valuable lessons

2180
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:27,118
totally you know

2181
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:28,920
I I know I happen to find a um a

2182
01:31:27,118 --> 01:31:33,279
nutrient mix that went well with the

2183
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:36,480
water that's always 7.0 yeah perfect

2184
01:31:33,279 --> 01:31:39,559
yeah so got myself a pen and some up and

2185
01:31:36,479 --> 01:31:42,238
down and yeah but I just still didn't

2186
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:45,360
like the Alaska fish fertilizer I don't

2187
01:31:42,238 --> 01:31:46,399
know I'm using it hesitantly because

2188
01:31:45,359 --> 01:31:50,399
it's

2189
01:31:46,399 --> 01:31:53,479
organic um and obviously with a pH meter

2190
01:31:50,399 --> 01:31:57,759
having you know results like I did yeah

2191
01:31:53,479 --> 01:31:59,559
the the turps and the flavors flavonoids

2192
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:03,039
that's kind of yet to be seen I don't

2193
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:05,800
know that that blue 13 yeah that was a

2194
01:32:03,039 --> 01:32:08,439
Alaska fish fertilizer yeah that's got

2195
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:11,000
some decent turs it has great turs yeah

2196
01:32:08,439 --> 01:32:13,479
yeah it has really good turbs yeah so

2197
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:15,279
and it's really complex and that's the

2198
01:32:13,479 --> 01:32:16,959
one thing I like I like complexity with

2199
01:32:15,279 --> 01:32:18,679
my flavors if it's just straight

2200
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:21,000
blueberry I might like it in the

2201
01:32:18,679 --> 01:32:23,239
beginning for a day right but I get over

2202
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:25,439
it real quick uh my favorite things have

2203
01:32:23,238 --> 01:32:26,399
a lot of complex to them yeah our visual

2204
01:32:25,439 --> 01:32:29,678
friend

2205
01:32:26,399 --> 01:32:32,238
Allison Hell she's come by Till It's

2206
01:32:29,679 --> 01:32:35,039
Gone quarter pound at a time her first s

2207
01:32:32,238 --> 01:32:36,718
stash yeah she just blew through it I

2208
01:32:35,039 --> 01:32:39,519
can't smoke anything

2209
01:32:36,719 --> 01:32:41,399
else yeah once you find something that

2210
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:43,760
that you get along with like that where

2211
01:32:41,399 --> 01:32:46,679
you like the taste you like the

2212
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:48,400
effect and it's available yes you know

2213
01:32:46,679 --> 01:32:50,719
that's the thing is is like it's a fresh

2214
01:32:48,399 --> 01:32:52,719
product so like availability it might be

2215
01:32:50,719 --> 01:32:55,079
available once every 3 months if you're

2216
01:32:52,719 --> 01:32:57,198
lucky it's available more than that but

2217
01:32:55,079 --> 01:32:59,319
typically you know Back in the Day stuff

2218
01:32:57,198 --> 01:33:00,479
was good stuff was available once every

2219
01:32:59,319 --> 01:33:02,238
three months you might have a little

2220
01:33:00,479 --> 01:33:04,839
window of a month

2221
01:33:02,238 --> 01:33:07,519
so but uh we had droughts too where you

2222
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:08,400
couldn't get stuff for extended amounts

2223
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:11,280
of

2224
01:33:08,399 --> 01:33:14,599
time that was also a Time coming into a

2225
01:33:11,279 --> 01:33:18,880
time where um medical laws were enacted

2226
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:20,760
in California and then Washington and um

2227
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:24,239
that was the Wild West for quite some

2228
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:26,520
time so well availability was pretty

2229
01:33:24,238 --> 01:33:29,238
good well let's take a step back into

2230
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:30,480
the 80s because I feel like not a lot of

2231
01:33:29,238 --> 01:33:31,638
people that watch the show unless they

2232
01:33:30,479 --> 01:33:33,479
were there not a lot of people know

2233
01:33:31,639 --> 01:33:35,639
about the 80s ' 80s was before my time I

2234
01:33:33,479 --> 01:33:38,919
started smoking in ' 91 but I would like

2235
01:33:35,639 --> 01:33:40,920
to hear about the scene and the energy

2236
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:42,679
in the 80s you know CU that that's when

2237
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:45,199
it was really illegal across the board

2238
01:33:42,679 --> 01:33:47,279
federally on a state level yeah

2239
01:33:45,198 --> 01:33:48,479
everything else it was kind of scary man

2240
01:33:47,279 --> 01:33:50,639
I mean cocaine was right there in the

2241
01:33:48,479 --> 01:33:52,198
80s too yeah and it was like you know if

2242
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:55,359
you were balling you had the good weed

2243
01:33:52,198 --> 01:33:57,599
and the cocaine and all that crap but uh

2244
01:33:55,359 --> 01:34:00,279
weed was interesting um we did go

2245
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:03,239
through droughts yeah in those days boy

2246
01:34:00,279 --> 01:34:04,759
I remember my wife was pregnant with my

2247
01:34:03,238 --> 01:34:07,279
with our first child my

2406
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:48,079
smoking well on that notion you got some

2407
01:40:46,079 --> 01:40:50,079
big balls later on in life because this

2408
01:40:48,079 --> 01:40:51,639
is the same yard where I came over to

2409
01:40:50,079 --> 01:40:54,479
your house and you're growing big ass

2410
01:40:51,639 --> 01:40:56,400
plants like right behind where I'm

2411
01:40:54,479 --> 01:40:57,678
sitting right now you had some plants in

2412
01:40:56,399 --> 01:41:01,479
the same

2413
01:40:57,679 --> 01:41:03,399
bed uh so you did have some balls yeah a

2414
01:41:01,479 --> 01:41:05,759
lot less to lose at that point too right

2415
01:41:03,399 --> 01:41:08,238
you know a lot less to risk right yeah I

2416
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:09,920
mean I'm I still smile every time I

2417
01:41:08,238 --> 01:41:11,678
think about those plants you know like

2418
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:13,239
in your front yard we're not talking

2419
01:41:11,679 --> 01:41:14,920
about the backyard I mean everyone grows

2420
01:41:13,238 --> 01:41:17,519
in their backyard true not a lot of

2421
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:19,239
people grow in a suburban area in their

2422
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:21,360
front yard you know I think what are

2423
01:41:19,238 --> 01:41:24,118
those pot plants in your front yard sir

2424
01:41:21,359 --> 01:41:28,359
oh is that what that is cool

2425
01:41:24,118 --> 01:41:29,719
right but uh yeah that was that was an

2426
01:41:28,359 --> 01:41:32,279
that was

2427
01:41:29,719 --> 01:41:34,439
a that was a middle finger Danny cop

2428
01:41:32,279 --> 01:41:35,880
that drove down my dead end yeah living

2429
01:41:34,439 --> 01:41:38,039
at the bottom of a dead end you know

2430
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:40,920
they look over here as they're turning

2431
01:41:38,039 --> 01:41:42,679
around yeah that was well that was the

2432
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:45,560
the point where it was going legal you

2433
01:41:42,679 --> 01:41:47,279
knew it was going legal and yeah she

2434
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:50,800
basically just said [ __ ] you medical I

2435
01:41:47,279 --> 01:41:54,000
got a medical card I mean all of that

2436
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:56,480
right yeah so uh n let's talk about the

2437
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,439
90s a little bit cuz you so California

2438
01:41:56,479 --> 01:42:01,319
in

2439
01:41:57,439 --> 01:42:05,759
96 uh went medical right and that was a

2440
01:42:01,319 --> 01:42:07,960
big deal prop 215 25 yes uh and that

2441
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:10,480
kind of changed the landscape for

2442
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:12,319
everybody uh especially Washington

2443
01:42:10,479 --> 01:42:14,718
followed suit with medical or in

2444
01:42:12,319 --> 01:42:16,920
followed suit several other states yeah

2445
01:42:14,719 --> 01:42:19,399
it's definitely been a West Coast thing

2446
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:22,000
the thing about Washington coming up

2447
01:42:19,399 --> 01:42:24,039
here since the 90s smoking weed up here

2448
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:26,560
since the 90s

2449
01:42:24,039 --> 01:42:28,359
uh I always found that it was more moist

2450
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:29,960
and I for the longest time I didn't

2451
01:42:28,359 --> 01:42:32,719
understand it fully but there's so much

2452
01:42:29,960 --> 01:42:35,399
more humidity up here you go to Colorado

2453
01:42:32,719 --> 01:42:37,118
it's really dry you come up here it's

2454
01:42:35,399 --> 01:42:38,559
moist right like so you leave it out of

2455
01:42:37,118 --> 01:42:42,598
the jar for just a couple minutes it

2456
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:44,119
seems like uh it would be spongy so

2457
01:42:42,599 --> 01:42:46,039
there was a lot of spongy butt up here

2458
01:42:44,118 --> 01:42:48,479
not that it was bad or anything like

2459
01:42:46,039 --> 01:42:52,439
that but there was it was spongy Bud it

2460
01:42:48,479 --> 01:42:54,959
wasn't until I feel like the 2000s in

2461
01:42:52,439 --> 01:42:56,759
the midd 20 where people were using

2462
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:58,800
controlled environments to dry and cure

2463
01:42:56,760 --> 01:43:00,560
their bud before they put it in jars

2464
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:03,119
they're getting that uh what I would

2465
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:04,320
call back then California quality and we

2466
01:43:03,118 --> 01:43:07,000
just have naturally good weather in

2467
01:43:04,319 --> 01:43:08,920
California so it made it so much easier

2468
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:11,279
for that drawing and curing and the

2469
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:13,880
longer shelf life yeah completely

2470
01:43:11,279 --> 01:43:15,840
completely yeah I agree and that was

2471
01:43:13,880 --> 01:43:18,679
something you know that was something

2472
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:21,480
that we eventually got into yeah um you

2473
01:43:18,679 --> 01:43:24,279
know like I said in the 90s medical

2474
01:43:21,479 --> 01:43:27,638
happened and uh

2475
01:43:24,279 --> 01:43:30,079
so did a lot of huge commercial grows

2476
01:43:27,639 --> 01:43:33,520
yeah that took a lot of weed out of

2477
01:43:30,079 --> 01:43:35,279
state tons and tons literally up here in

2478
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:37,520
the in the area right here out of

2479
01:43:35,279 --> 01:43:39,719
Seattle yeah growing in Barnes I think a

2480
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:41,040
lot of people grew in Barns where was

2481
01:43:39,719 --> 01:43:46,198
downtown in the middle of [ __ ]

2482
01:43:41,039 --> 01:43:49,399
downtown Seattle wow yeah talk about uh

2483
01:43:46,198 --> 01:43:51,719
air game VI on point I was worried about

2484
01:43:49,399 --> 01:43:54,319
my eight lights like when I went to

2485
01:43:51,719 --> 01:43:56,800
eight lights it was a big deal back

2486
01:43:54,319 --> 01:43:59,719
that was where I

2487
01:43:56,800 --> 01:44:02,199
realized that there was a there were a

2488
01:43:59,719 --> 01:44:04,079
couple of places to fit in this culture

2489
01:44:02,198 --> 01:44:07,799
yeah there were the medical folks that I

2490
01:44:04,079 --> 01:44:09,719
was always down with that helped promote

2491
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:12,520
and then there were still the top secret

2492
01:44:09,719 --> 01:44:14,000
guys which had always been there yeah

2493
01:44:12,520 --> 01:44:17,760
that that they were just making so much

2494
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:21,800
money so much Bank yeah and you know

2495
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:23,599
fists I believe the the medical folks I

2496
01:44:21,800 --> 01:44:26,199
believed everybody

2497
01:44:23,599 --> 01:44:27,239
who said that cannabis helped their Al

2498
01:44:26,198 --> 01:44:29,678
helped their

2499
01:44:27,238 --> 01:44:32,198
ills and that's where I decided I would

2500
01:44:29,679 --> 01:44:34,639
land yeah and that way I could grow

2501
01:44:32,198 --> 01:44:37,759
small amounts didn't have to worry about

2502
01:44:34,639 --> 01:44:42,079
getting you know 10 20 year sentences

2503
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:44,960
right um and yes there was the medical

2504
01:44:42,079 --> 01:44:48,198
legal sure justifications but those

2505
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:50,800
still were not a not a sure thing but um

2506
01:44:48,198 --> 01:44:51,678
I ended up I ended up knowing everybody

2507
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:54,800
on the

2508
01:44:51,679 --> 01:44:56,599
planet that need needed weed they had no

2509
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:57,679
money a lot of them had no money because

2510
01:44:56,599 --> 01:45:00,239
they couldn't work because they couldn't

2511
01:44:57,679 --> 01:45:02,199
get the weed cuz right diverticula just

2512
01:45:00,238 --> 01:45:04,439
you know simple [ __ ] that probably

2513
01:45:02,198 --> 01:45:05,839
wouldn't kill them very soon but God if

2514
01:45:04,439 --> 01:45:08,359
they had some weed they could punction

2515
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:11,760
like you and me yeah like an average

2516
01:45:08,359 --> 01:45:14,359
normal guy so that kind of that hit me

2517
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:17,360
in the heart yeah that's the direction

2518
01:45:14,359 --> 01:45:18,719
that I ended up going in so yeah I never

2519
01:45:17,359 --> 01:45:19,719
made the tons of money that a lot of

2520
01:45:18,719 --> 01:45:23,840
dudes

2521
01:45:19,719 --> 01:45:27,079
did yeah I mean I would say that the

2522
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:29,520
the Elder the the lady that basically

2523
01:45:27,079 --> 01:45:32,079
turned me onto the

2524
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:35,760
lifestyle of you know having plants she

2525
01:45:32,079 --> 01:45:38,279
she gave out a lot a lot of flower a lot

2526
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:42,760
of flower and she was part of the the

2527
01:45:38,279 --> 01:45:45,679
AIDS movement and she constantly was

2528
01:45:42,760 --> 01:45:48,440
giving stuff out uh you know she was

2529
01:45:45,679 --> 01:45:50,118
selling stuff too but I would say she

2530
01:45:48,439 --> 01:45:51,919
probably gave out as much as she sold

2531
01:45:50,118 --> 01:45:54,759
and exactly you know and that's that's

2532
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:58,399
how I met you originally is through her

2533
01:45:54,760 --> 01:46:01,199
and through Pat and so it's it's the

2534
01:45:58,399 --> 01:46:03,598
same kind of thing and I feel like she

2535
01:46:01,198 --> 01:46:07,238
was pushing Organics before anybody else

2536
01:46:03,599 --> 01:46:11,400
I heard it from her Organics grow grown

2537
01:46:07,238 --> 01:46:14,000
with soil you know things like that and

2538
01:46:11,399 --> 01:46:16,439
uh yeah I feel like when you can give

2539
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:18,560
back I mean I feel like cannabis just by

2540
01:46:16,439 --> 01:46:22,039
itself you're making the world a better

2541
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:24,039
place and if you can give it to people

2542
01:46:22,039 --> 01:46:25,519
you know obviously you can only give

2543
01:46:24,039 --> 01:46:28,000
what you can give I think there's a

2544
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:32,440
there's a line where we can give back to

2545
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:35,039
a degree but we can only give so much to

2546
01:46:32,439 --> 01:46:38,000
where it's benefiting other people and

2547
01:46:35,039 --> 01:46:40,319
not hurting ourselves I had to I mean I

2548
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:43,520
subsidized my garden out of pocket I

2549
01:46:40,319 --> 01:46:46,359
don't know how many times yeah it's like

2550
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:47,599
now am I G to pay my rent oh crap yeah

2551
01:46:46,359 --> 01:46:49,880
hurry up and

2552
01:46:47,599 --> 01:46:53,199
dry but when you're dealing with people

2553
01:46:49,880 --> 01:46:55,800
that actually need it cure an a not even

2554
01:46:53,198 --> 01:46:58,198
to cure but maybe to help them whatever

2555
01:46:55,800 --> 01:46:59,639
they're to get through the next day and

2556
01:46:58,198 --> 01:47:02,519
some people that's all they need is to

2557
01:46:59,639 --> 01:47:04,679
get through one more day yeah yeah it's

2558
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:06,520
it's an amazing beautiful thing that

2559
01:47:04,679 --> 01:47:08,880
brings so many of us together yeah and

2560
01:47:06,520 --> 01:47:11,119
it's that it's that Care

2561
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:13,960
Community that's the true cannbis

2562
01:47:11,118 --> 01:47:16,118
Community right I would say that's the

2563
01:47:13,960 --> 01:47:17,520
foundation of it all yeah and I think he

2564
01:47:16,118 --> 01:47:19,079
goes in other directions but the

2565
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:21,840
foundation and the

2566
01:47:19,079 --> 01:47:24,158
origin of the legalization wasn't the

2567
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:25,520
financial side it was the people that

2568
01:47:24,158 --> 01:47:27,879
didn't want to see other people go into

2569
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:29,920
prison and the people that knew that it

2570
01:47:27,880 --> 01:47:33,039
helped other people the CIA

2571
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:34,399
compassionate action um so many groups

2572
01:47:33,039 --> 01:47:38,118
that were

2573
01:47:34,399 --> 01:47:41,638
literally um founded on compassion yeah

2574
01:47:38,118 --> 01:47:44,519
and Care yeah and yeah definitely proud

2575
01:47:41,639 --> 01:47:47,199
to have been to have even played the

2576
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:48,840
smallest part in that so many people

2577
01:47:47,198 --> 01:47:51,439
were involved and I can't sit here and

2578
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:53,239
say man I gave out all my lead to sick

2579
01:47:51,439 --> 01:47:55,919
Bookers

2580
01:47:53,238 --> 01:47:58,879
so many people did that so many people

2581
01:47:55,920 --> 01:48:00,800
did that but it's a on another notion

2582
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:04,440
though it's it's a collective effort of

2583
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:06,920
so many people so much effort and and

2584
01:48:04,439 --> 01:48:08,799
just making positive movements in the

2585
01:48:06,920 --> 01:48:10,480
right direction you know I think that's

2586
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:12,400
how you make change it's it's all starts

2587
01:48:10,479 --> 01:48:15,359
with one action it can start with you or

2588
01:48:12,399 --> 01:48:17,439
anybody else but it's a it's a group

2589
01:48:15,359 --> 01:48:18,839
effort and it's a beautiful thing

2590
01:48:17,439 --> 01:48:20,638
because we're here now talking about

2591
01:48:18,840 --> 01:48:22,400
ited you know we couldn't talk about

2592
01:48:20,639 --> 01:48:24,159
this in public and probably even record

2593
01:48:22,399 --> 01:48:26,879
this oh my God 30 years ago in your

2594
01:48:24,158 --> 01:48:28,519
front yard no we we'd be in big trouble

2595
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:30,639
by now your neighbors might call the

2596
01:48:28,520 --> 01:48:32,199
cops on us you know 30 years ago God

2597
01:48:30,639 --> 01:48:33,520
looks like he's got a pot leaf on or

2598
01:48:32,198 --> 01:48:35,598
something and there's three of them and

2599
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:38,560
they're in the yard no they got cameras

2600
01:48:35,599 --> 01:48:40,880
yeah totally it just gives my heart Joy

2601
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:42,560
could so it keeps giving yeah it keeps

2602
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:43,679
on giving I I can barely give my weed

2603
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:45,000
away because everybody's already buying

2604
01:48:43,679 --> 01:48:47,199
it at the store they didn't know some

2605
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:50,639
dude still grows it yeah there's some

2606
01:48:47,198 --> 01:48:54,000
folks obviously that do but um just to

2607
01:48:50,639 --> 01:48:57,039
think about it and to actually be able

2608
01:48:54,000 --> 01:49:00,520
to own that that Karma that good sense

2609
01:48:57,039 --> 01:49:03,000
of good yeah that's really awesome you

2610
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:04,719
know karma is always this mysterious

2611
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:07,238
thing that you never

2612
01:49:04,719 --> 01:49:08,639
really I guess well karma is real

2613
01:49:07,238 --> 01:49:10,238
whether you believe it or not that's

2614
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:12,520
what I've been saying my whole life it's

2615
01:49:10,238 --> 01:49:14,598
like karma is there karma is real it

2616
01:49:12,520 --> 01:49:17,239
doesn't matter whether you believe in it

2617
01:49:14,599 --> 01:49:19,039
but to be able to feel it and as a

2618
01:49:17,238 --> 01:49:21,959
affirmation that it really is a thing

2619
01:49:19,039 --> 01:49:24,920
and that is there for sure yeah it's

2620
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:28,079
that's amazing yeah I agree right yeah

2621
01:49:24,920 --> 01:49:30,960
totally so for the ones that have uh

2622
01:49:28,079 --> 01:49:32,719
done me wrong Karma's there whether you

2623
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:36,480
believe in it or not you

2624
01:49:32,719 --> 01:49:38,039
know uh yeah and we we live in this A

2625
01:49:36,479 --> 01:49:39,559
Beautiful World and there's Beauty in

2626
01:49:38,039 --> 01:49:42,920
the world even with the you know there's

2627
01:49:39,560 --> 01:49:44,679
sad sadness tragedy all these other

2628
01:49:42,920 --> 01:49:47,440

2630
01:49:47,439 --> 01:49:52,238

ourselves amen amen and we're blessed to

2632
01:49:52,238 --> 01:49:56,238
be able to recognize that right yeah I

2633
01:49:54,520 --> 01:49:58,679
mean I think that's that's part of it as

2634
01:49:56,238 --> 01:50:02,439
well being able to be grateful and have

2635
01:49:58,679 --> 01:50:05,880
gratitude yeah and living in gratitude

2636
01:50:02,439 --> 01:50:08,678
and I mean you know we we don't choose

2637
01:50:05,880 --> 01:50:10,319
the cards we get dealt always but we can

2638
01:50:08,679 --> 01:50:11,239
choose how to deal with them to play

2639
01:50:10,319 --> 01:50:15,559
them

2640
01:50:11,238 --> 01:50:17,759

quite like Hempfest if you've never

people uh that talk about right and

2683

wrong with cannabis you know we got

2687
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,840
it on and I just thousands of us though

2688
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:22,319
not just me I'm such a small part in

2689
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:25,159
this well but you guys are all cogs in

2690
01:52:22,319 --> 01:52:27,719
the the big wheel yeah totally totally

2691
01:52:25,158 --> 01:52:33,479
yeah there was a lot of cogs yeah and I

2692
01:52:27,719 --> 01:52:36,118
was just one of them Co came y 2019 2020

2693
01:52:33,479 --> 01:52:38,559
that was a big hit to us 502

2694
01:52:36,118 --> 01:52:41,519
legalization came yeah and the laws

2695
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:43,880
prohibited um commercial cannabis from

2696
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:46,199
advertising yeah the advertising laws

2697
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:47,960
killed most of our Revenue that we would

2698
01:52:46,198 --> 01:52:51,118
use to put on the event the event cost

2699
01:52:47,960 --> 01:52:52,960
almost a million bucks yeah to put on uh

2700
01:52:51,118 --> 01:52:55,439
they were talking rent and port I mean

2701
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:57,639
it's it's an event like any other yeah

2702
01:52:55,439 --> 01:52:59,158
you got to have the infrastructure sure

2703
01:52:57,639 --> 01:53:01,279
got to have the people and of course the

2704
01:52:59,158 --> 01:53:03,039
cities they would always throw some uh

2705
01:53:01,279 --> 01:53:05,639
they would always throw some something

2706
01:53:03,039 --> 01:53:07,960
at us sideways but we'd manage

2707
01:53:05,639 --> 01:53:10,840
to manage to very

2708
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:14,158
nimbly um catch the throw and make the

2709
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:16,199
play for sure activism isn't cheap it's

2710
01:53:14,158 --> 01:53:17,799
not cheap it's not easy yeah it's not

2711
01:53:16,198 --> 01:53:21,000
cheap it's not easy you just got to do

2712
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:24,440
what you believe in you do it y yeah I

2713
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:24,439
guess the final part of that is

2714
01:53:24,520 --> 01:53:32,280
that we achieved our mission statement

2715
01:53:28,118 --> 01:53:36,479
yeah we really we didn't you know we

2716
01:53:32,279 --> 01:53:39,599
enabled um 502 to pass here we enabled

2717
01:53:36,479 --> 01:53:42,158
legal cannabis the idea that 502 is any

2718
01:53:39,599 --> 01:53:44,199
good or not is still up for debate um

2719
01:53:42,158 --> 01:53:46,559
but I will say this for sure when you

2720
01:53:44,198 --> 01:53:49,039
get pulled over and your car smells like

2721
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:51,159
weed you all you got to do is tell that

2722
01:53:49,039 --> 01:53:55,198
officer I'm sorry officer but the smell

2723
01:53:51,158 --> 01:53:58,078
of cannabis press or burnt is no longer

2724
01:53:55,198 --> 01:54:01,118
um a valid reason grounds for you know

2725
01:53:58,078 --> 01:54:03,359
see longer grounds for a search or or a

2726
01:54:01,118 --> 01:54:04,598
seizure yeah but you know you can go to

2727
01:54:03,359 --> 01:54:07,158
the store and you can buy an ounce of

2728
01:54:04,599 --> 01:54:09,360
weed and drive home now yeah I sold Rick

2729

Steves his travel goo Rick Steves in

2730
01:54:09,359 --> 01:54:15,238

regulate uh THC levels and concentrates

2778
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:24,199
here in Washington silly very silly they

2779
01:56:22,639 --> 01:56:26,359
don't understand that they're proing up

2780
01:56:24,198 --> 01:56:29,198
the black markets every time they make a

2781
01:56:26,359 --> 01:56:31,799
move with their policy yeah

2782
01:56:29,198 --> 01:56:33,678
yeah no only profit up the black markets

2783
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:35,920

2784
01:56:33,679 --> 01:56:38,520
availability quality there again more

2785
01:56:35,920 --> 01:56:40,599
doe diverse selection right dude Black

2786
01:56:38,520 --> 01:56:42,880
Market isn't just some [ __ ] we got

2787
01:56:40,599 --> 01:56:44,319
some [ __ ] from the sidewalk yeah oh no

2788
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:47,880
dud that's the guys that are growing

2789
01:56:44,319 --> 01:56:50,439
craft weed it's the most craft produ tot

2790
01:56:47,880 --> 01:56:52,719
production of craft cannabis in the

2791
01:56:50,439 --> 01:56:55,158
state of Washington is what what sinks

2792
01:56:52,719 --> 01:56:57,880
most businesses what sinks most

2793
01:56:55,158 --> 01:57:01,638
production companies MH it ain't easy to

2794
01:56:57,880 --> 01:57:04,760
sell your [ __ ] for you know 25 cents a

2795
01:57:01,639 --> 01:57:06,840
gram after what you got to put into it

2796
01:57:04,760 --> 01:57:09,320
it's again it comes to the multi-state

2797
01:57:06,840 --> 01:57:11,480
operators with enough money to buy or

2798
01:57:09,319 --> 01:57:14,479
Price everybody out of the markets is

2799
01:57:11,479 --> 01:57:16,678
what we see here yeah I think it's what

2800
01:57:14,479 --> 01:57:17,959
we see across the country Washington has

2801
01:57:16,679 --> 01:57:20,560
some good brands though there's some

2802
01:57:17,960 --> 01:57:22,239
people doing it right house of cultivar

2803
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:25,199
my good friends over there and can

2804
01:57:22,238 --> 01:57:26,598
Organics and there's a bunch of guys you

2805
01:57:25,198 --> 01:57:28,238
know I think that those are just a

2806
01:57:26,599 --> 01:57:30,480
handful of them that I'm friends with

2807
01:57:28,238 --> 01:57:32,598
but uh those the guys I'm friends with I

2808
01:57:30,479 --> 01:57:34,839
feel like they do some of the best work

2809
01:57:32,599 --> 01:57:37,239
in the state for sure it's all

2810
01:57:34,840 --> 01:57:38,880
subjective but because that that kind of

2811
01:57:37,238 --> 01:57:41,039
leads into my next question is how do

2812
01:57:38,880 --> 01:57:43,599
you feel about

2813
01:57:41,039 --> 01:57:45,880
legalization what did they do right and

2814
01:57:43,599 --> 01:57:48,119
what did they do wrong not integrating

2815
01:57:45,880 --> 01:57:51,760
vertically I think because the biggest

2816
01:57:48,118 --> 01:57:54,759
mistake yeah really not allowing

2817
01:57:51,760 --> 01:57:56,000
vertical integration actually was none

2818
01:57:54,760 --> 01:57:59,000
yeah so you can't own your own

2819
01:57:56,000 --> 01:58:01,719
dispensary if you grow right right huge

2820
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:04,520
it's a huge hit to Growers yeah it's a

2821
01:58:01,719 --> 01:58:07,719
huge H dispensary operators it just it's

2822
01:58:04,520 --> 01:58:10,199
the market is not a true market it's

2823
01:58:07,719 --> 01:58:12,239
propped up here and there yeah um you

2824
01:58:10,198 --> 01:58:15,118
let a market go it will correct itself

2825
01:58:12,238 --> 01:58:18,000
markets just do that right um ours

2826
01:58:15,118 --> 01:58:21,679
hasn't self-corrected because it's got

2827
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:25,279
so much hesty structure over here it's

2828
01:58:21,679 --> 01:58:27,960
just not the true market yeah um a lot

2829
01:58:25,279 --> 01:58:32,039
of what we didn't see the DUI for vision

2830
01:58:27,960 --> 01:58:34,679
was another huge one um five nanograms

2831
01:58:32,039 --> 01:58:37,238
in your blood that's a subjective number

2832
01:58:34,679 --> 01:58:39,719
too it's such a subjective number the

2833
01:58:37,238 --> 01:58:42,039
state you've probably got like 10x on

2834
01:58:39,719 --> 01:58:43,000
that right now in your system see the

2835
01:58:42,039 --> 01:58:48,800
state's

2836
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:50,960
toxicology um lab uh lead Professor CEO

2837
01:58:48,800 --> 01:58:52,719
whatever you call him he was totally

2838
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:54,279
against it and he showed what

2839
01:58:52,719 --> 01:58:57,800
yeah and he showed how the comparisons

2840
01:58:54,279 --> 01:59:01,439
work between alcohol and cannabis and

2841
01:58:57,800 --> 01:59:05,199
amounts levels in your bloodstream yeah

2842
01:59:01,439 --> 01:59:07,319
and uh it just is nonsensical so it puts

2843
01:59:05,198 --> 01:59:10,919
people at risk who just took a hit

2844
01:59:07,319 --> 01:59:13,198
yesterday and you know or it was Friday

2845
01:59:10,920 --> 01:59:15,480
they got off work they smoked the bowl

2846
01:59:13,198 --> 01:59:17,839
it's Monday they're going to work well

2847
01:59:15,479 --> 01:59:20,078
they hadn't been high since Friday they

2848
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:24,119
damn sure got five nanograms in their

2849
01:59:20,078 --> 01:59:26,279
blood right and now they've got DUI the

2850
01:59:24,118 --> 01:59:28,799
DUI is a really life

2851
01:59:26,279 --> 01:59:31,479
destroying little piece of law

2852
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:34,279
infraction if you will that's just no

2853
01:59:31,479 --> 01:59:36,319
good it lead you it costs a lot of money

2854
01:59:34,279 --> 01:59:38,399
yeah um for some people because of their

2855
01:59:36,319 --> 01:59:40,840
background it might cost them a whole

2856
01:59:38,399 --> 01:59:42,559
lot of time away from their families or

2857
01:59:40,840 --> 01:59:44,719
off work going through some kind of

2858
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:46,280
treatment program getting a job if you

2859
01:59:44,719 --> 01:59:49,000
don't have a job and it's not your

2860
01:59:46,279 --> 01:59:50,759
record um yeah yeah not a cool thing at

2861
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:52,599
all as far as what do they do right I

2862
01:59:50,760 --> 01:59:54,719
mean it is they did something right they

2863
01:59:52,599 --> 01:59:57,319
passed it to where I think they went in

2864
01:59:54,719 --> 01:59:59,198
the right direction yeah totally um I

2865
01:59:57,319 --> 02:00:01,238
can go right now and buy some weed yeah

2866
01:59:59,198 --> 02:00:03,839
I just go to a store and buy weed yeah I

2867
02:00:01,238 --> 02:00:07,279
don't have to like hope I know the guy

2868
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:09,760
or does he remember me or right because

2869
02:00:07,279 --> 02:00:12,920
my guy is out you know yeah hopefully

2870
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:15,119
he's still do you remember me yeah so

2871
02:00:12,920 --> 02:00:17,359
convenience definitely for convenience

2872
02:00:15,118 --> 02:00:19,519
yeah testing is a good thing it's a

2873
02:00:17,359 --> 02:00:21,559
whole another debacle whether testing is

2874
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:23,520
done properly accurately should this

2875
02:00:21,560 --> 02:00:26,520
event tested how should it be tested

2876
02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:28,679
what should it be tested for um I'm all

2877
02:00:26,520 --> 02:00:31,440
for testing because we're ingesting this

2878
02:00:28,679 --> 02:00:34,560
stuff yeah why not sure we test the

2879
02:00:31,439 --> 02:00:37,158
quality of beef we chickens we test most

2880
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:39,239
of the stuff that we ingest yeah I mean

2881
02:00:37,158 --> 02:00:41,238
I think the levels at which we test are

2882
02:00:39,238 --> 02:00:44,279
higher than any other Agricultural

2883
02:00:41,238 --> 02:00:47,559
Product okay I and I haven't compared

2884
02:00:44,279 --> 02:00:49,719
but yeah I accept that assertion yeah I

2885
02:00:47,560 --> 02:00:52,280
agree I I imagine that's true yeah some

2886
02:00:49,719 --> 02:00:54,560
of the stuff may be a little bit extreme

2887
02:00:52,279 --> 02:00:56,519
but at the same time if we're doing it

2888
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:58,880
we we can do that right yeah yeah

2889
02:00:56,520 --> 02:01:00,960
exactly and that that's a whole another

2890
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:03,560
whole another philosophical battle in

2891
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:05,760
the in the world of cannabis between the

2892
02:01:03,560 --> 02:01:08,599
powers that be and the yeah the actual

2893
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:10,679
powers that are meaning the The Growers

2894
02:01:08,599 --> 02:01:13,119
The Producers

2895
02:01:10,679 --> 02:01:15,719
processors uh unfortunately we don't

2896
02:01:13,118 --> 02:01:17,960
wield as big a stick as you know the

2897
02:01:15,719 --> 02:01:20,198
municipal folks and the yeah the

2898
02:01:17,960 --> 02:01:22,840
legislative folks what would you like to

2899
02:01:20,198 --> 02:01:26,479
see in the future for

2900
02:01:22,840 --> 02:01:28,199
legalization homegrown has to happen it

2901
02:01:26,479 --> 02:01:29,879
has to be legal they took away homeg

2902
02:01:28,198 --> 02:01:31,118
growing in the state of Washington yeah

2903
02:01:29,880 --> 02:01:33,279
that's one of the also one of the

2904
02:01:31,118 --> 02:01:35,198
biggest mistakes they took away medical

2905
02:01:33,279 --> 02:01:37,559
and they took away well they didn't take

2906
02:01:35,198 --> 02:01:39,359
away medical per se yeah but you do need

2907
02:01:37,560 --> 02:01:43,000
to register with the state and have a

2908
02:01:39,359 --> 02:01:45,359
medical card and of course you can um do

2909
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:48,679
they still have medical dispensaries

2910
02:01:45,359 --> 02:01:50,679
they have no not strictly no but they do

2911
02:01:48,679 --> 02:01:52,359
have dispensaries that cater to medical

2912
02:01:50,679 --> 02:01:54,760
patients

2913
02:01:52,359 --> 02:01:56,399
give them a price break yeah they they

2914
02:01:54,760 --> 02:01:59,880
still have to pay tax though still have

2915
02:01:56,399 --> 02:02:01,479
to pay excise tax yeah and that's on

2916
02:01:59,880 --> 02:02:04,319
just about anything you buy here in

2917
02:02:01,479 --> 02:02:07,519
state of Washington anyways yeah but as

2918
02:02:04,319 --> 02:02:09,479
as of through the Cannabis Alliance yeah

2919
02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:11,960
is another group that I'll shout out

2920
02:02:09,479 --> 02:02:13,759
cannabis Alliance to yeah um they've

2921
02:02:11,960 --> 02:02:15,599
just achieved a great victory in the

2922
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:18,360
Senate and through through the

2923
02:02:15,599 --> 02:02:23,039
legislature I should say that does away

2924
02:02:18,359 --> 02:02:26,118
with excise tax on medical cannabis so

2925
02:02:23,039 --> 02:02:28,719
in July it starts sometime in July if

2926
02:02:26,118 --> 02:02:32,319
you're a medical cannabis patient with a

2927
02:02:28,719 --> 02:02:34,920
card of course um you can go buy your

2928
02:02:32,319 --> 02:02:36,319
weed completely tax-free that's how it

2929
02:02:34,920 --> 02:02:38,560
should be yeah I think that's great

2930
02:02:36,319 --> 02:02:42,279
totally and I think it

2931
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:45,719
also will lead into

2932
02:02:42,279 --> 02:02:48,198
um uh medical providers hmos and all

2933
02:02:45,719 --> 02:02:51,279
those guys to pay for cannabis

2934
02:02:48,198 --> 02:02:54,198
prescriptions yeah essentially I have a

2935
02:02:51,279 --> 02:02:56,039
prescription from my doctor mhm it

2936
02:02:54,198 --> 02:02:59,319
allows me to grow a few plants and then

2937
02:02:56,039 --> 02:03:01,519
I have the extra plant um right in that

2938
02:02:59,319 --> 02:03:05,840
she did those do they should give you

2939
02:03:01,520 --> 02:03:07,280
some free electricity too that be great

2940
02:03:05,840 --> 02:03:10,480
yeah wow I had thought of that there

2941
02:03:07,279 --> 02:03:11,719
some solar panels whatever you right so

2942
02:03:10,479 --> 02:03:13,559
give you some solar panels for your

2943
02:03:11,719 --> 02:03:15,800
plants I think that's great oh yeah it's

2944
02:03:13,560 --> 02:03:18,960
a great idea want to go green let's go

2945
02:03:15,800 --> 02:03:21,760
double green all right the future is

2946
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:23,560
bright um and you know we're also de

2947
02:03:21,760 --> 02:03:27,119
deal with a bureaucracy that is our

2948
02:03:23,560 --> 02:03:29,920
government so the future is slow and

2949
02:03:27,118 --> 02:03:31,719
cumbersome and falling all over itself

2950
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:34,039
right it's still pretty bright there a

2951
02:03:31,719 --> 02:03:36,319
bright pile of [ __ ] rolling

2952
02:03:34,039 --> 02:03:39,319
underground but uh better than a dark

2953
02:03:36,319 --> 02:03:41,238
pile of [ __ ] better than a dark see yeah

2954
02:03:39,319 --> 02:03:42,759
we're getting there getting there slowly

2955
02:03:41,238 --> 02:03:45,638
but surely guys like you that are

2956
02:03:42,760 --> 02:03:47,800
driving this it's a team effort I say it

2957
02:03:45,639 --> 02:03:50,559
all the time and yeah I mean it's we're

2958
02:03:47,800 --> 02:03:52,119
all just in it together to be successful

2959
02:03:50,559 --> 02:03:53,719
and there's people that are passionate

2960
02:03:52,118 --> 02:03:55,279
there's people that driven by the wrong

2961
02:03:53,719 --> 02:03:56,920
things but there are people driven by

2962
02:03:55,279 --> 02:03:59,759
the right things there are

2963
02:03:56,920 --> 02:04:01,520
people that have passion for the sacred

2964
02:03:59,760 --> 02:04:03,679
plant like I talk about a lot like

2965
02:04:01,520 --> 02:04:06,119
yourself like me the saying is it takes

2966
02:04:03,679 --> 02:04:08,599
a village but the truth is it takes the

2967
02:04:06,118 --> 02:04:12,158
world man it takes the world it's slowly

2968
02:04:08,599 --> 02:04:15,078
changing people's mind about the stigma

2969
02:04:12,158 --> 02:04:17,558
of cannabis I think that's and so there

2970
02:04:15,078 --> 02:04:20,439
we go it's the stigma and what how do

2971
02:04:17,559 --> 02:04:22,559
you beat a stigma education it it comes

2972
02:04:20,439 --> 02:04:24,960
down to education and that's where I was

2973
02:04:22,559 --> 02:04:26,159
going when I was thanking you for doing

2974
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:29,078
what you're doing you're putting this

2975
02:04:26,158 --> 02:04:31,558
out there um I don't know how much you

2977
02:04:31,559 --> 02:04:36,159
big Rockstar it was it was never about

02:04:41,679 --> 02:04:46,279

2983
02:04:43,479 --> 02:04:47,799
of the plant and uh it's it's a

2984
02:04:46,279 --> 02:04:49,359
beautiful thing and also I have so many

2985
02:04:47,800 --> 02:04:50,520
friends in the industry being able to

2986

great you know being able to share your

2992
02:05:00,359 --> 02:05:04,279
bit your legacy you have kids you have

2993
02:05:02,118 --> 02:05:06,359
grandkids M I have two grand kids two

2994
02:05:04,279 --> 02:05:10,279
grandkids how do you feel about Legacy

2995
02:05:06,359 --> 02:05:14,039
and what is your legacy you know my dad

2996
02:05:10,279 --> 02:05:16,399
was a merchant of the union rep for the

2997
02:05:14,039 --> 02:05:18,840
C fars International Union sell deep sea

2998
02:05:16,399 --> 02:05:22,158
I sell deep sea yeah getting in trouble

2999
02:05:18,840 --> 02:05:24,679
as a young boy young man um got shipped

3000
02:05:22,158 --> 02:05:26,719
off like a lot of kids probably did

3001
02:05:24,679 --> 02:05:28,840
right it's just something I was not into

3002
02:05:26,719 --> 02:05:30,559
you know then I got married and had a

3003
02:05:28,840 --> 02:05:33,599
kid and definitely didn't want to be

3004
02:05:30,559 --> 02:05:35,199
gone all the time yeah and uh this

3005
02:05:33,599 --> 02:05:38,679
wasn't something for

3006
02:05:35,198 --> 02:05:41,279
me uh went into construction union

3007
02:05:38,679 --> 02:05:43,800
carpenter for decades it's not something

3008
02:05:41,279 --> 02:05:47,039
for my son though he's not into growing

3009
02:05:43,800 --> 02:05:50,119
weed he's not into growing or you know

3010
02:05:47,039 --> 02:05:52,399
he works construction pseudo but I'm

3011
02:05:50,118 --> 02:05:55,158
afraid that my IM immediate family

3012
02:05:52,399 --> 02:05:57,198
doesn't have the desire to carry on my

3013
02:05:55,158 --> 02:06:00,759
legacy yeah and so that kind of leaves

3014
02:05:57,198 --> 02:06:03,000
me in a Lurch you know um what am I

3015
02:06:00,760 --> 02:06:05,199
going to do I've got some great genetics

3016
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:06,118
man sitting in little bottles and jars

3017
02:06:05,198 --> 02:06:09,799
in

3018
02:06:06,118 --> 02:06:12,078
refrigerator getting old going bad you

3019
02:06:09,800 --> 02:06:14,599
name it you know run the gamut just like

3020
02:06:12,078 --> 02:06:16,880
any other guy that breeds probably I was

3021
02:06:14,599 --> 02:06:19,559
saying the value of seeds is in their

3022
02:06:16,880 --> 02:06:20,719
use and not in their possession amen and

3023
02:06:19,559 --> 02:06:23,000
there's so many people that collect

3024
02:06:20,719 --> 02:06:24,760
seeds and it's like that's that's great

3025
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:26,238
sad but it's sad on a whole another

3026
02:06:24,760 --> 02:06:27,719
level it's sad that you're not using

3027
02:06:26,238 --> 02:06:30,078
those seeds and finding out what's in

3028
02:06:27,719 --> 02:06:32,679
there because there's magic yeah there's

3029
02:06:30,078 --> 02:06:34,359
there really I mean we we can we see eye

3030
02:06:32,679 --> 02:06:36,679
to eye on that and there is Magic and

3031
02:06:34,359 --> 02:06:39,198
seeds there's stuff that's still waiting

3032
02:06:36,679 --> 02:06:40,279
to be discovered there's tons of stuff

3033
02:06:39,198 --> 02:06:42,238
out there where are they though where

3034
02:06:40,279 --> 02:06:45,679
are they they're in D refrigerator in

3035
02:06:42,238 --> 02:06:47,039
his laundry room by his garage right

3036
02:06:45,679 --> 02:06:49,359
then that's an issue for me right now

3037
02:06:47,039 --> 02:06:50,639
I'll give it my health issues yeah well

3038
02:06:49,359 --> 02:06:52,759
and your legacy is so much more than

3039
02:06:50,639 --> 02:06:54,279
that I feel like we were talking earlier

3040
02:06:52,760 --> 02:06:57,679
about the

3041
02:06:54,279 --> 02:07:00,359
2013 it was it 13 or 14 with Snoop Lion

3042
02:06:57,679 --> 02:07:01,440
yeah uh in Denver we were at that cup

3043
02:07:00,359 --> 02:07:03,279
you were at that cup you brought your

3044
02:07:01,439 --> 02:07:05,638
daughter for her 21st birthday to see

3045
02:07:03,279 --> 02:07:08,158
Snoop Lion you got to smoke with snoop

3046
02:07:05,639 --> 02:07:09,559
Snoop Lion and he was Snoop Lion because

3047
02:07:08,158 --> 02:07:10,759
they didn't pay him enough because he

3048
02:07:09,559 --> 02:07:12,320
they couldn't afford to pay him a lot of

3049
02:07:10,760 --> 02:07:15,480
money but he still went on and djed

3050
02:07:12,319 --> 02:07:17,319
instead of instead of rapping yeah and

3051
02:07:15,479 --> 02:07:20,238
uh that was a magical cup that was a

3052
02:07:17,319 --> 02:07:22,558
magical experience but you have been

3053
02:07:20,238 --> 02:07:25,919
able to share the those experiences with

3054
02:07:22,559 --> 02:07:29,320
your daughter and passed on experiences

3055
02:07:25,920 --> 02:07:31,399
that she can pass on to Jasper to Jasper

3056
02:07:29,319 --> 02:07:33,279
yeah really cool and I mean there

3057
02:07:31,399 --> 02:07:35,839
stories like that where you you know she

3058
02:07:33,279 --> 02:07:38,920
got to experience it and she was telling

3059
02:07:35,840 --> 02:07:41,199
me earlier about the story on the you

3060
02:07:38,920 --> 02:07:42,920
know on the on the lot when she was at

3061
02:07:41,198 --> 02:07:44,839
the event and they have all the free

3062
02:07:42,920 --> 02:07:46,199
samples that they give out and it's

3063
02:07:44,840 --> 02:07:47,760
she's not the only one that's happened

3064
02:07:46,198 --> 02:07:50,039
to but you know they have samples and

3065
02:07:47,760 --> 02:07:51,760
there's like all these cool Edibles and

3066
02:07:50,039 --> 02:07:53,359
if you're into Edibles that was the

3067
02:07:51,760 --> 02:07:55,039
place to be because there would be

3068
02:07:53,359 --> 02:07:57,759
cotton candy and there would be ice

3069
02:07:55,039 --> 02:08:00,719
cream and there would be hter sticks

3070
02:07:57,760 --> 02:08:03,039
Savory stuff yeah crackers that had you

3071
02:08:00,719 --> 02:08:05,480
know infusions and there was just 500

3072
02:08:03,039 --> 02:08:07,198
milligrams dude and you and back then

3073
02:08:05,479 --> 02:08:08,839
they weren't really concerned with high

3074
02:08:07,198 --> 02:08:10,359
milligram doses now in California it's

3075
02:08:08,840 --> 02:08:13,078
like 10 milligrams per dose 100

3076
02:08:10,359 --> 02:08:14,759
milligrams per package back then I mean

3077
02:08:13,078 --> 02:08:16,759
in the 90s we never even thought about a

3078
02:08:14,760 --> 02:08:18,159
milligram it was like how strong can we

3079
02:08:16,760 --> 02:08:22,000
make it to where it still tastes good

3080
02:08:18,158 --> 02:08:24,558
but exciting times you know back then

3081
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:26,479
it it was the New Horizon and everything

3082
02:08:24,559 --> 02:08:28,119
was new and I when you're younger it's

3083
02:08:26,479 --> 02:08:30,759
kind of like that anyway oh yeah but

3084
02:08:28,118 --> 02:08:33,158
like all the stuff is new and exciting

3085
02:08:30,760 --> 02:08:34,760
and smoking out of a can for the first

3086
02:08:33,158 --> 02:08:36,439
time or even after you've done it a

3087
02:08:34,760 --> 02:08:38,920
while it's like what else can you smoke

3088
02:08:36,439 --> 02:08:41,479
out of what you know you know and they

3089
02:08:38,920 --> 02:08:43,480
talk about cannabis being the gateway

3090
02:08:41,479 --> 02:08:46,198
drug right I feel like we hear that a

3091
02:08:43,479 --> 02:08:48,959
lot I think alcohol is a gayway drug in

3092
02:08:46,198 --> 02:08:51,479
my own opinion he man hey man TR but uh

3093
02:08:48,960 --> 02:08:54,078
truly but yeah I mean truly alcohol is

3094
02:08:51,479 --> 02:08:57,198
the gateway drug and cannabis is the

3095
02:08:54,078 --> 02:08:59,880
kind of opposite in my opinion mhm yeah

3096
02:08:57,198 --> 02:09:01,759
it's the gateway to to Enlightenment to

3097
02:08:59,880 --> 02:09:04,000
Enlightenment to sobriety if you're

3098
02:09:01,760 --> 02:09:06,159
having issues with other drugs it's

3099
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:09,639
definitely well it's a self-reflection

3100
02:09:06,158 --> 02:09:12,399
drug so if you smoke if you get high mhm

3101
02:09:09,639 --> 02:09:14,559
cannabis will help you self-reflect yes

3102
02:09:12,399 --> 02:09:16,279
and see the world as it truly is you you

3103
02:09:14,559 --> 02:09:18,400
may not want to see yourself that way

3104
02:09:16,279 --> 02:09:20,840
and I think the people that El spoke

3105
02:09:18,399 --> 02:09:22,039
they feel uncomfortable and because

3106
02:09:20,840 --> 02:09:24,719
because it really shows you who you

3107
02:09:22,039 --> 02:09:26,639
truly are psychedelics do that too yeah

3108
02:09:24,719 --> 02:09:29,559
they do and they really show you the

3109
02:09:26,639 --> 02:09:33,559
truth whether you want to see it or not

3110
02:09:29,559 --> 02:09:35,440
yeah and uh it's a peaceful thing oh

3111
02:09:33,559 --> 02:09:36,840
very much so very much so and again

3112
02:09:35,439 --> 02:09:39,078
there are a lot different strengths of

3113
02:09:36,840 --> 02:09:41,159
psychedelics when you said that I

3114
02:09:39,078 --> 02:09:43,599
almost you this really isn't a

3115
02:09:41,158 --> 02:09:46,319
psychedelic that's a pretty tough

3116
02:09:43,599 --> 02:09:49,760
blow but you know and in that respect

3117
02:09:46,319 --> 02:09:52,558
yeah I have to agree it changes

3118
02:09:49,760 --> 02:09:57,039
perception perspective perspective and

3119
02:09:52,559 --> 02:09:59,039
perception yeah and uh you get really

3120
02:09:57,039 --> 02:10:00,479
high you're going to think things that

3121
02:09:59,039 --> 02:10:03,359
you wouldn't normally

3122
02:10:00,479 --> 02:10:05,439
think and uh you might get real hungry

3123
02:10:03,359 --> 02:10:06,759
yeah get real hungry and you're gonna

3124
02:10:05,439 --> 02:10:08,558
the thing is that you're going to think

3125
02:10:06,760 --> 02:10:10,280
so much of things you might not

3126
02:10:08,559 --> 02:10:12,639
ordinarily think

3127
02:10:10,279 --> 02:10:14,479
of but you're going to open your mind to

3128
02:10:12,639 --> 02:10:17,400
allow them if they come by there they

3129
02:10:14,479 --> 02:10:19,118
are well you might not see the things in

3130
02:10:17,399 --> 02:10:21,920
the same way you would see them if you

3131
02:10:19,118 --> 02:10:23,679
were sober and I feel like smoke allows

3132
02:10:21,920 --> 02:10:26,359
you to see things from a different

3133
02:10:23,679 --> 02:10:29,639
perspective exactly yeah and I feel like

3134
02:10:26,359 --> 02:10:31,639
if we were all smoking it would change

3135
02:10:29,639 --> 02:10:33,599
our perception and perspective on the

3136
02:10:31,639 --> 02:10:37,880
way we see things yeah you see good and

3137
02:10:33,599 --> 02:10:39,639
bad and you know I feel like uh you see

3138
02:10:37,880 --> 02:10:41,800
the world as it really is sometimes

3139
02:10:39,639 --> 02:10:43,118
psychedelics even more so you dive into

3140
02:10:41,800 --> 02:10:44,760
some psychedelics and then you start

3141
02:10:43,118 --> 02:10:47,238
lifting off these filters you can be

3142
02:10:44,760 --> 02:10:49,199
gone for a while yeah yeah cuz what

3143
02:10:47,238 --> 02:10:50,879
happens is I feel like we get real jaded

3144
02:10:49,198 --> 02:10:52,319
from the experiences of life from the

3145
02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:54,000
time where born we have these

3146
02:10:52,319 --> 02:10:55,759
experiences and every experience puts a

3147
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:59,479
filter over your eyes right over your

3148
02:10:55,760 --> 02:11:01,280
mind yeah and so sometimes it's great to

3149
02:10:59,479 --> 02:11:04,039
lift those filters off and see the world

3150
02:11:01,279 --> 02:11:06,198
as it truly is agreed so because we

3151
02:11:04,039 --> 02:11:08,439
we're all we all live in these bubbles

3152
02:11:06,198 --> 02:11:10,198
we all see the world from our bubble

3153
02:11:08,439 --> 02:11:11,479
because of the experiences that have

3154
02:11:10,198 --> 02:11:13,960
been you know there's some genetic

3155
02:11:11,479 --> 02:11:16,519
involvement sure and psychological stuff

3156
02:11:13,960 --> 02:11:19,760
but you I think we inherit some stuff

3157
02:11:16,520 --> 02:11:23,280
potentially M but uh lifting those

3158
02:11:19,760 --> 02:11:27,679
filters off and mus mushrooms you know

3159
02:11:23,279 --> 02:11:32,800
all psychedelics mushrooms LSD yeah iasa

3160
02:11:27,679 --> 02:11:34,199
you know DMT forms and P right I feel um

3161
02:11:32,800 --> 02:11:35,599
even I were talking about mushrooms

3162
02:11:34,198 --> 02:11:39,799
yesterday and how they're kind of not

3163
02:11:35,599 --> 02:11:41,800
really the most fun high um the stomach

3164
02:11:39,800 --> 02:11:43,880
High I hate getting the stomach High

3165
02:11:41,800 --> 02:11:46,719
yeah they're not a very social high for

3166
02:11:43,880 --> 02:11:48,880
me just depends on the for for me it's

3167
02:11:46,719 --> 02:11:50,000
the opposite it depends on the mushroom

3168
02:11:48,880 --> 02:11:52,199
it might have been my brother I was

3169
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:55,039
talking about yeah yeah yeah yeah so for

3170
02:11:52,198 --> 02:11:57,319
me it's the it's the opposite I would

3171
02:11:55,039 --> 02:12:00,399
say that it's depending on the mushroom

3172
02:11:57,319 --> 02:12:03,158
but my good friend Mr Marlon aser uhhuh

3173
02:12:00,399 --> 02:12:04,839
we uh have eaten our fair share of

3174
02:12:03,158 --> 02:12:08,399
mushrooms together

3175
02:12:04,840 --> 02:12:10,880
and they and if it's too much I I'm very

3176
02:12:08,399 --> 02:12:11,839
antisocial yeah but with the right dose

3177
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:13,239
and especially the right kind of

3178
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:15,400
mushrooms I can't quot laughing and I

3179
02:12:13,238 --> 02:12:16,959
have the greatest time and this guy is

3180
02:12:15,399 --> 02:12:20,399
someone who goes out and performs and

3181
02:12:16,960 --> 02:12:22,399
sings ree in front of thousands and

3182
02:12:20,399 --> 02:12:25,679
thousands of people high on mushrooms no

3183
02:12:22,399 --> 02:12:27,158
uhuh absolutely and and you know and so

3184
02:12:25,679 --> 02:12:28,719
I it's a public speaking thing for me

3185
02:12:27,158 --> 02:12:30,839
too sometimes I'll do public speaking

3186
02:12:28,719 --> 02:12:33,800
and I'll eat a micro do before because I

3187
02:12:30,840 --> 02:12:36,239
feel like uh my memory recall is better

3188
02:12:33,800 --> 02:12:38,520
and I'm able to respond it's it's like

3189
02:12:36,238 --> 02:12:40,718
caffeine with memory recall for me with

3190
02:12:38,520 --> 02:12:42,480
the micro dose interesting so I'm able

3191
02:12:40,719 --> 02:12:44,319
to do a lot of public speaking and and

3192
02:12:42,479 --> 02:12:47,638
you just have to get once you're past

3193
02:12:44,319 --> 02:12:49,039
that fear it allows you to open up right

3194
02:12:47,639 --> 02:12:51,800
and I don't do it all the time I don't

3195
02:12:49,039 --> 02:12:53,679
need to do it on my show but uh I've

3196
02:12:51,800 --> 02:12:57,400
done it on my show and I've done it at

3197
02:12:53,679 --> 02:13:00,319
MJ Biz when I spoke uh at MJ Biz before

3198
02:12:57,399 --> 02:13:02,279
and um yeah and it's a beautiful thing

3199
02:13:00,319 --> 02:13:04,679
but heavy doses of psychedelics are

3200
02:13:02,279 --> 02:13:06,559
definitely for reflection yeah you know

3201
02:13:04,679 --> 02:13:09,559
going inside and

3202
02:13:06,559 --> 02:13:12,400
seeing the world as it truly is or it's

3203
02:13:09,559 --> 02:13:14,719
it's a great way to reflect on who you

3204
02:13:12,399 --> 02:13:16,920
are and getting rid of your ego and

3205
02:13:14,719 --> 02:13:21,639
looking at it from the outside

3206
02:13:16,920 --> 02:13:23,078
right so his ego is just a it's one of

3207
02:13:21,639 --> 02:13:28,118
those things we all have to deal with

3208
02:13:23,078 --> 02:13:31,519
ego yeah we do we do I agree it's an

3209
02:13:28,118 --> 02:13:34,598
integral part of us I mean without an

3210
02:13:31,520 --> 02:13:37,079
ego that's that's a whole new different

3211
02:13:34,599 --> 02:13:39,480
consideration yeah if we all lo you know

3212
02:13:37,078 --> 02:13:41,920
kill your ego that's always been a thing

3213
02:13:39,479 --> 02:13:44,279
where we all be if nobody had an ego

3214
02:13:41,920 --> 02:13:47,559
we'd all be one would that

3215
02:13:44,279 --> 02:13:51,559
work was that like not like

3216
02:13:47,559 --> 02:13:54,239
um homogenizing every single Canabis

3217
02:13:51,559 --> 02:13:57,079
veto out there it's like no it's just

3218
02:13:54,238 --> 02:13:59,439
weed yeah kind of weed weed it's just

3219
02:13:57,078 --> 02:14:02,599
one thing just one thing yeah so I

3220
02:13:59,439 --> 02:14:04,638
wonder wonder how that homogeneization

3221
02:14:02,599 --> 02:14:06,800
of

3222
02:14:04,639 --> 02:14:10,159
humanity well I think you know we were

3223
02:14:06,800 --> 02:14:13,239
talking about canono and

3224
02:14:10,158 --> 02:14:16,000
cancer yesterday we touched on that and

3225
02:14:13,238 --> 02:14:19,879
people selling RSO under the guys that

3226
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:23,118
it'll cure cancer and some cannaboids

3227
02:14:19,880 --> 02:14:26,920
are good for and have been proven to

3228
02:14:23,118 --> 02:14:29,839
help and be beneficial and other kabon

3229
02:14:26,920 --> 02:14:33,559
can exacerbate certain conditions

3230
02:14:29,840 --> 02:14:36,000
certain types of cancer and but some

3231
02:14:33,559 --> 02:14:38,000
people are using the RSO as like a

3232
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:41,039
blanket statement that my product cures

3233
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:43,118
cancer yeah yeah and just just floating

3234
02:14:41,039 --> 02:14:46,000
the idea out there that it's a Panacea

3235
02:14:43,118 --> 02:14:50,319
of some of some sort yeah it is no

3236
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:52,960
Panacea there really is none you know um

3237
02:14:50,319 --> 02:14:54,759
with a little with science thrown in

3238
02:14:52,960 --> 02:14:57,559
halia cannabis can do a lot of things

3239
02:14:54,760 --> 02:15:00,559
I'm sure yeah and possibly may be able

3240
02:14:57,559 --> 02:15:04,039
to you know cure cancer or at least be

3241
02:15:00,559 --> 02:15:08,000
you know one of the one of the

3242
02:15:04,039 --> 02:15:10,319
prime sources of that of that who know

3243
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:13,359
and RSO to a degree there's many types

3244
02:15:10,319 --> 02:15:16,279
of RSO too it's not not all RSO is

3245
02:15:13,359 --> 02:15:18,960
created equally all of my hardcore canus

3246
02:15:16,279 --> 02:15:21,759
ofici a out there every time I say RSO

3247
02:15:18,960 --> 02:15:25,078
they're just go oh SHO themselves in the

3248
02:15:21,760 --> 02:15:27,520
head oh oh CU right evidently Rick is on

3249
02:15:25,078 --> 02:15:29,118
the well I get it it's not a clean

3250
02:15:27,520 --> 02:15:32,520
product it's not a good

3251
02:15:29,118 --> 02:15:35,158
product PCO now or Pico full extract

3252
02:15:32,520 --> 02:15:37,040
cannabis oil is the thing right and I

3253
02:15:35,158 --> 02:15:39,439
know that in my circles if I don't call

3254
02:15:37,039 --> 02:15:43,078
it that I'm beat

3255
02:15:39,439 --> 02:15:45,799
right so that's for all you uh Pico fers

3256
02:15:43,078 --> 02:15:47,920
out there yeah well and it has the

3257
02:15:45,800 --> 02:15:49,840
potential to do great things it doesn't

3258
02:15:47,920 --> 02:15:51,480
always do great things but it's so

3259
02:15:49,840 --> 02:15:54,119
subjective to the individual and our

3260
02:15:51,479 --> 02:15:56,479
