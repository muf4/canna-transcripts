00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:30,079
you know you worked with Eddie LEP among

14
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,200
other people you want to go into

15
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:35,079
starting out around Eddie LEP I think

16
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,520
that'd be a great place Leapster yeah so

17
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:40,640
uh back in the day you know I lived in

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,719
Wyoming and uh was the late 90s I was on

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,719
a a a a student loan repayment program

20
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:49,000
for rural areas so they you would go

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,640
serve the community for two years and

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,439
they would pay your all your student

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,920
loans it's amazing crazy right

24
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:57,238

00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:55,839
the doctor uh old Milan Hopkins was a

72
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,560
Vietnam medic and uh he uh you know EDD

73
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,200
he like pulled him out and was like Hey

74
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,360
this and that he started writing he made

75
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:03,759
a a lot of money off off that Arrow but

76
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,040
people would go up there and uh get

77
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,399
their things and there's a group of

78
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:11,158
people and then you know there's [ __ ]

79
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:14,439
Eddie goddamn and this is Eddie before

80
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:16,919
he was Eddie so he was just like he's a

81
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:18,598
Gruff dude black Levis you know he's not

82
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:21,238
he's not the rock star that he became

83
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:22,919
later in life swears like I mean he

84
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:24,799
always swore like he hit his thumb with

85
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:27,439
hammer but

86
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,760
um I'm like enthusiastic because my

87
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:30,959
whole life up to this point is about

88
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:33,639
weed right and I got to convince this

89
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,158
dude that like hey this is what I want

90
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:37,199
to do where do I get in you know what I

91
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:38,840
mean and I don't think he like me too

92
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:42,598
much because Eddie wasn't a nice shirt

93
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,158
type of guy and uh so anyway I I

94
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:46,199
convinced him that I was worthy or

95
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,919
something and he he he he's like I'll

96
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:50,280
start you off at a yellow leaf Merchant

97
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,679
little did he know that I had a resume

98
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,759
that well succeeded that already at this

99
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,719
time so I started going there all the

100
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:59,479
time I didn't have many friends so I had

101
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:03,759
a kinship with Eddie we became great

102
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:05,798
friends friends nice and uh we grew weed

103
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:08,158
together for many years and was this

104
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:10,519
like late 90s or this is the late 90s

105
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:12,598
before it all happened and like I said

106
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:14,120
so the more momentum it got and the more

107
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:16,798
people and then the High Times started

108
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,199
coming in it became this Juggernaut and

109
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:23,079
you know Eddie wanted to take him on and

110
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:25,160
win so uh that was the game so he wanted

111
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:27,120
to go big and how he's going to go

112
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,639
bigger and the the real thing what he

113
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,840
was trying to do was okay you get your

114
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:33,079
grip we'll grow your weed up here you

115
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:36,000
get the weed at the end of the year it's

116
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:37,560
like $10 a gram it's revolutionary and

117
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,079
the type of people that are going in

118
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:43,079
there at this time are people that

119
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:46,680
really need you you know some help so it

120
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:48,800
w it was a plan with with with multi-g

121
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,759
goals to help the people and to take on

122
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,000
the big guy right and beat the big guy

123
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:57,840
so we ended up uh I forget the year

124
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,439
because uh you know my son was born

125
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:02,399
somewhere in there and I I kind of left

126
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:04,439
towards the end but it was uh we grew

127
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,839
40,000 plants right there on the side of

128
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:08,319
the road on the 20 it's pretty County

129
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:10,638
and uh the pictures are still around to

130
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:13,399
Pro the pictures are there and and and

131
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:17,560
uh a guy Jason Dunlap was there for

132
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:21,038
years with a camera wow so he's got a

133
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:24,680
freaking 5,000 hours of Eddie Le Farm

134
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:26,918
footage through this whole period and uh

135
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:30,680
all all all the craziness that went on

136
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:32,959
and led up to the point where uh

137
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,918
Eddie became the Hugh Hefner of weed

138
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:39,079
totally with his Smoky jackets and his

139
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:42,758
parties and his right multiple wives and

140
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:44,478
um yeah it was a it was it was it was

141
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,560
something else I'll tell you what it was

142
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:50,879

143
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,959

00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:44,478
Northwest it was

165
00:06:41,598 --> 00:06:46,759
like I was a skateboard kid and my homie

166
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:49,279
uh maybe I shouldn't even say the name

167
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:52,038
bleep that out but he had a halfpipe and

168
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:53,918
you know there was other kids and his

169
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:55,878
sister had like a wicked collection of

170
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:59,120
bongs remember ceramic bongs and they're

171
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:01,479
like saying Wizards and just stuff like

172
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,439
that and you know we kind of started

173
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:06,680
smoking around the skateboard scene and

174
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:08,560
then uh there were some older kids that

175
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:12,519
were in our neighborhood and they were

176
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,560
uh they were foster kids but they were

177
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:17,159
far Advanced and I'm telling you this is

178
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,879
in the 80s these kids had Briefcase full

179
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:23,039
of the Kryptonite lime green

180
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:25,039
crystally insane weed when we were

181
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:26,759
little kids you know so we're just

182
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:27,478
running around the woods smoking weed

183
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:29,720
that's

184
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:31,598
awesome so the genetics back then what

185
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,520
kind of stuff were you smoking for me it

186
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:37,598
was green and brown we had green and

187
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:39,279
brown and there was like outdoor yeah so

188
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:41,199
where we were we didn't have that

189
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:43,119
outdoor I didn't see that that that

190
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,960
stuff till later we didn't we didn't

191
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,399
really have we didn't have brick weed we

192
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:51,758
just had KGB yeah killer greenbud you

193
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:55,239
got greenbud greenbud indoor Washington

194
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:59,520
northwest right uh Northern Lights um

195
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:01,319
the G13 the Pez these strs but before

196
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,519
the names started coming later those

197
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:07,080
names but really we called

198
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:08,799
it The Killers or the cripplers yeah and

199
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:11,000
then uh you know they started coming

200
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,360
names like Pez and then You' start know

201
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,839
the northern lights and stuff but right

202
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,000
it was greenbud

203
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:20,079
KGB crippes it I don't know if it was

204
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,519
related to The cppy Strain but it's like

205
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:23,839
we just called it the

206
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:26,158
crippes yeah it's interesting we I mean

207
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:28,439
I think we saw names in high times

208
00:08:26,158 --> 00:08:30,120
before we saw names on the streets when

209
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:32,360
you know growing up

210
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,599
yeah I was this was I was smoking way

211
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,120
before I seen a high time so it was like

212
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,320
and then

213
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,679
uh my my mom used to send me down to my

214
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,440
grandpa when I was growing up and I was

215
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:49,159
like 13 and stuff and uh maybe maybe a

216
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,279
little older 14 and and uh I'd go hang

217
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:54,000
out with my cousins and and and their

218
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:55,600
dad was a Vietnam vet and my my Grandpa

219
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,639
would take us on these big trips we'd go

220
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,480
to like the air show in Wisconsin d d d

221
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:02,159
and then I I remember one time before we

222
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,519
left my cousin shelle she's like come

223
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:07,319
here and into the into her dad's bedroom

224
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,200
and in the closet bro there was a stack

225
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,399
of High Times it was like High Times and

226
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,320
Easy Rider magazines yeah and then there

227
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,278
was a garbage bag black trash bag and

228
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,200
she reached in it and she's

229
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:20,720
like she like grab some of that and so I

230
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,879
grabbed some and I grabbed High Times

231
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,160
too so she took two handfuls I took one

232
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:27,759
and that just pretty much fueled our

233
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:29,879
summer as kids just and that was like

234
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:33,039
that was like that lime green

235
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:35,879
skunk bud yeah and ever since then I was

236
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:38,838
a smoker really I just uh and it was

237
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:41,200
skunky skunk bud right like sweet skunk

238
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:42,680
like this the Brotherhood skunk yeah

239
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,320
that's awesome skunk the stuff we don't

240
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:46,479
see anymore I feel like you don't see

241
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,720
skunk that [ __ ] would got busted so much

242
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,720
in that time that it it couldn't exist

243
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,040
anymore because it would get you busted

244
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,759
and and whether whether you're buying it

245
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:58,120
you could smell it right cat piss too

246
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:02,159
cat piss is another

247
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:06,000
one um yeah some of those old flavors I

248
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:08,159
feel like a lot of the flavors back then

249
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,399
I mean it's not the weed was back better

250
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,519
back then but I feel like in general

251
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,360
there was a lot of good stuff in the 90s

252
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:16,639
when we first started getting names and

253
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,278
stuff like that I feel like the quality

254
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:21,199
there were more passionate people

255
00:10:18,278 --> 00:10:22,679
involved and so there was it was also

256
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,000
more dangerous and a lot of other things

257
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:25,359
there was a lot of other factors but I

258
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,799
feel like there was a lot of good stuff

259
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,320
and a lot of unique flavors there was

260
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:31,039
more diversity I mean there was all kind

261
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,879
of sativas especially there were

262
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:38,838
tertiary tertiary turps that have been

263
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:41,360
bred into non-existence yeah like thcp

264
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:44,079
thch they're they're finding this again

265
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:47,879
in small amounts in roadside hemp in

266
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:49,638
Italy wow and it gets you extremely high

267
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:51,958
because as a kid like you got so high

268
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:53,759
you couldn't get the get the lighter to

269
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:55,679
the Bowl you know what I mean so there

270
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:58,278
was some other chemistry going on in the

271
00:10:55,679 --> 00:11:00,719
plant that exist existed in such small

272
00:10:58,278 --> 00:11:03,958
levels that it was obviously the first

273
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,720
thing to go with uh not poor breeding

274
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:07,239
practices but a bunch of people that are

275
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,480
trying to breed plant that don't know

276
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,919
much about the stuff behind it and don't

277
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,839
even know that that stuff exists to

278
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:14,639
begin with so it's like no nobody's

279
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,959
fault but it was just in its natural

280
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:20,159
state it had some things that were just

281
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:23,078
more powerful totally yeah it's

282
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:24,319
interesting and with the gelato hype now

283
00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:26,679
and the direction of the market has gone

284
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,000
it's completely changed right there's

285
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:30,120
guys like Kevin JRE I don't know if

286
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,600
you've been following Kevin in the stuff

287
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,000
he's been doing but like he's been on

288
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,000
this adventure he was in Columbia for a

289
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,679
while I see see yeah Pakistan I saw that

290
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,278
that's what it's all about yeah you know

291
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:42,679
that looks like a legendary uh crew I

292
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:44,759
know some of the dudes you seen over

293
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:46,319
there and yeah you know big up that's

294
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:47,759
that's really that's really cool and

295
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,760
that's that's the stuff that got me

296
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:51,519
excited about it in the beginning the

297
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:53,120
ability to maybe go on trips like that

298
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,839
and you see him he's like looking

299
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,480
undercover with his hat his beard shaved

300
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,720
like a certain way and that's cool man

301
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,000
um

302
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,680
yeah I feel like we need to get back

303
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
into that kind of stuff yeah get some

304
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:06,120
more diversity in the gene pool I think

305
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,720
so much of the stuff has gotten

306
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,839
homogenized we saw it happen in Europe

307
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,639
in the late 90s early 2000s with the

308
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:13,880
hazes right you know everything Haze

309
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,399
getting bred into everything and I think

310
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:18,320
we've gone into the gelados now we need

311
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:21,320
to take a step back the second everybody

312
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,720
started using purple as a qualifier BR

313
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,879
we used to throw the purple strains away

314
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,120
yeah we used to throw the purple strains

315
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:29,480
away because they didn't get you high

316
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,399
right they don't get you well and that's

317
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,959
normal right know and then that comes to

318
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:35,039
the thing is there's a fatal flaw on the

319
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:37,000
testing is like you must have got

320
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:39,439
something wrong that that that if these

321
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,480
purple strains testing in the 35 36 and

322
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,600
they're not getting you as high as a a

323
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,600
20 something OG Kush something's wrong

324
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,240
in the science you need to go back and

325
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,278
refigure it out and like we were

326
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,879
touching on before the the other turps

327
00:12:50,278 --> 00:12:55,679
that you know still exist but need to be

328
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:57,278
found preserved not turps but cannaboids

329
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,078
is what I meant to say yeah like the

330
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:00,639
thcp well and there's so many other

331
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:03,559
molecules at play right so like we've

332
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:05,240
been just looking at cannaboids and tpin

333
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:07,958
we're just getting into THS which create

334
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,959
like the skunky smells and uh yeah I

335
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:12,599
just saw another article came out the

336
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:15,559
other day about a whole new class of uh

337
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:18,199
smells and cannabis I didn't really have

338
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:19,919
the I didn't read it so I I assumed it

339
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:21,559
was probably about THS but it it might

340
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:23,319
even be about something else but I

341
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:26,239
didn't yeah yeah I just I just read it

342
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:28,480
it was a abstract Tech yeah yeah it was

343
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,120
abstract Tech he tell them call them up

344
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,800
James say that's old news we knew about

345
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,360
these we knew about these Styles but no

346
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:36,159
they really did an in-depth look at THS

347
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:39,320
and also started doing studies with

348
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:41,078
people and and tpin I don't ever want to

349
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,120
downplay tpin we know that tpin are

350
00:13:41,078 --> 00:13:45,519
valuable but there's other things that

351
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,360
play for sure in the effect especially

352
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,240
when you're talking about skunky things

353
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,720
where or like nose burning things those

354
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:54,000
those tiles that burn your nose they're

355
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,000
so small too right so yeah small small

356
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,519
amounts and then now everyone's

357
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
searching for these large amounts of

358
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,720
things when it's really it's really like

359
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,600
the small things that count it's the

360
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:07,480
magic it's it's the small pieces don't

361
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,159
forget to you know admir those moments

362
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,720
those small moments in life as well as

363
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:13,120
in the cannabis plant well there's like

364
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:16,360
40,000 tpes right I mean we're we're

365
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,240
only testing 40 of the 40,000 that are

366
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,120
out there you know it's like we don't

367
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,159
even really know what's out there to the

368
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,959
degree and there's such small particles

369
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:26,120
of so many different things that's that

370
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:27,679
kosher grape soda that right there

371
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,679
that's the

372
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:30,679
P5

373
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:37,958
that was grown in

374
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:39,799
uh go ahead that's got a good good

375
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:42,758
flavor it does right it's creamy right

376
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:45,000
off the git it's like creamy and a

377
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:48,639
little grapey

378
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,519
sungrown Nevada County The Ridge North

379
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,519
San

380
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:54,959
Juan it's a little fresh still but uh

381
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,839
you know I got a bunch of other stuff

382
00:14:54,958 --> 00:15:01,758
too but that one yeah that one stands

383
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:04,880
out for sure oh it also makes hash nice

384
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:04,879
it's got a really distinct

385
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:12,000
flavor it's not super bright with flavor

386
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:13,758
it's more subtle which I like yeah it's

387
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,958
got a lot of subtlety to

388
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:18,000
it it's not like everything else

389
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:20,879
everybody's smoking right now which is

390
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,919
like I feel like this P5 is what all the

391
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:27,519
new uh hybrid what is a P5 though the P5

392
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:29,278
is a gelato 33 TK well which is what

393
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,600
Pluto is it's a backseat of the Pluto oh

394
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:32,480
it's back seat of the Pluto Pluto's good

395
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,199
it's a little bit different than the

396
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,560
Pluto I feel like Pluto's amazing this

397
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:40,039
is a little uh it's it's well-rounded

398
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:41,919
like the Pluto but even more so I feel

399
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:43,799
like all the gelato hybrids are trying

400
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:47,318
to be what this stuff

401
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:48,639
is so that was a in fact I didn't even

402
00:15:47,318 --> 00:15:50,559
come up with that quote somebody said

403
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,318
that last night when I was in an event

404
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:54,479
so we were smoking on

405
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:56,120
it yeah it doesn't it has something

406
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,199
that's a little different than than the

407
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:01,159
gelat it's like a liveliness yeah like a

408
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:03,120
like a opener at the end yeah it's

409
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:05,439
floral and it has a really long finish

410
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,440
which I

411
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:10,479
like but yeah this stuff's

412
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:16,480
great and I like that that burns down to

413
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,759
the ash like literally you could put the

414
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,240
joint out fire it up five more times and

415
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:22,440
smoke the roach and it would still taste

416
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,919
good right so and I think it tests above

417
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,319
five% turps That's The Telltale yeah

418
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:29,639
when you smoke it down to burn your

419
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:32,039
lips so for feno hunting when I'm

420
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:33,799
sharing bags now instead of giving

421
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:37,318
people

422
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:38,758
flour instead of giving people flour uh

423
00:16:37,318 --> 00:16:41,120
to do whatever they want with I'm giving

424
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:42,879
them joints right and everybody gets on

425
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,159
they're on the same even playing field I

426
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:46,278
feel like it just kind of evens out the

427
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:49,078
playing field a little more yeah totally

428
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:50,639
bro um yeah sometimes it doesn't look

429
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:52,078
the best but if you smoked it it would

430
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,560
beat these other things that are just

431
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:56,239
like oh just a gleaming picture yeah

432
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:59,559
I've seen it happen more more than once

433
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,759
but then at the same time and all over

434
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:03,559
goals it's got to click the others too

435
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,480
so right A lot of the time in the fenal

436
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:07,958
hunt we don't give it as much time and

437
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,599
like and like we were going to grow a a

438
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:13,720
crop for flowers totally so they get a

439
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:15,038
little beaten down and right I'm a firm

440
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,400
believer of growing it out at least

441
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:19,199
three times too like one time doesn't

442
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,360
really tell you the whole story right

443
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,160
this the genetics change over the period

444
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,479
of three generations typically it'll

445
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,679
stabilize somewhere in there and yeah

446
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,759
but it's a lot of work a lot of smoking

447
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,798
yeah I like the idea of coming up with

448
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:34,000
some go some guidelines like that like

449
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:36,319
you just said grow it three times or

450
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,480
like a lot of strains like people are

451
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:40,839
like oh my strain and and this and that

452
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,880
and they it's just like a single cross

453
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:45,359
with one somebody else's seeds like it

454
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,799
should have four parents right or four

455
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:50,000
generations before you can claim it you

456
00:17:47,798 --> 00:17:51,599
know you breeded it four times or it had

457
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,759
four distinct different parents which is

458
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:56,759
like four generations of breeding also

459
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:59,919
so we got to get into that so what is a

460
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:02,359
lot of the breeding out there is just

461
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,799
participation Awards yeah yo you get

462
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:06,000
this and you get that let me tell you a

463
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:08,119
story about the birds and the bees okay

464
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,079
you're going to make some seeds guys but

465
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:12,879
then the real work is in taking that to

466
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:14,319
something else so right making it your

467
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,080
own yeah

468
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:18,798
absolutely yeah it's funny because

469
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:20,960
everyone's doing these F1 complex poly

470
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:22,798
hybrids that are just like it's it's

471
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,960
beyond the bottleneck yeah well and

472
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:25,440
they're like I have access to good

473
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,319
genetics so now I make good seeds and

474
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,400
it's like well you made a new cross and

475
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:30,759
that's that's great I mean I think I'll

476
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,480
commend anybody that makes some good

477
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:36,038
genetics I think that's great no nobody

478
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:39,200
owns seed breeding no no one owns seed

479
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:42,000
making yeah well and it's a group effort

480
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,720
and I think uh we're all working on the

481
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,519
shoulders of the Giants that came before

482
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:49,440
us at the end of the day we're we're uh

483
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:51,759
in the infancy of this industry to a

484
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,759
degree but like we're working on

485
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:55,798
thousands of years worth of work

486
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:57,599
technically speak we're we're just we

487
00:18:55,798 --> 00:18:59,400
work for the plant yeah we work for the

488
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:01,719
we're working on cre

489
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,960
stewards to a deg this is like you know

490
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,798
we work for the bees we was like we take

491
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,919
our role way too seriously that ego gets

492
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:11,079
in the way you know like let's talk

493
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:14,200
about that for a second like we come

494
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:18,000
from the 215 and then it got buried by

495
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:20,759
by the the proposition 6 what was it 64

496
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,599
69 and and and the first thing that went

497
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:25,599
out out of out the window was compassion

498
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:27,319
right the whole thing about 215 was

499
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:28,918
compassion you found your way because

500
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:30,720
you believed in the medicine in the

501
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:33,038
plant and through that you found some

502
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,200
people that really needed your help and

503
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:38,000
and needed that and as soon as it

504
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:41,679
changed there was no more compassion

505
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,359
yeah when slowly butet greed and ego

506
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,960
took its place yeah but there's still

507
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:48,079
Balan I mean there's people like us that

508
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,798
are out there still trying to do bro

509
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:51,480
it's there there's a lot of Warriors

510
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:52,839
it's a big war and there's a I'm not

511
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,839
going to discredit the world that

512
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:56,879
there's no but like you know and the

513
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:58,759
main thing it's just like we didn't get

514
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,480
any cheaper

515
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:03,200
you know what I mean it actually got

516
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:06,360
more expensive and it got maybe you

517
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,480
could get it get get it easier but you

518
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:10,119
didn't have to wait for the guy to call

519
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,720
you back and drive around town but uh

520
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:13,798
but you know I was like yeah to the

521
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,480
retail guy it didn't get any cheaper but

522
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:17,279
on the wholeale just they broke

523
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:20,400
everyone's backs killed the farmer

524
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:21,599
chopped them off the knees and right

525
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,080
that's pretty crazy the the

526
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:24,759
consolidation that's happened over the

527
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:26,519
last and the people failing and giving

528
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:27,798
up but then you see who the real

529
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:29,319
passionate people are cuz it's like they

530
00:20:27,798 --> 00:20:30,639
won't do anything else and I feel like

531
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:31,960
there's a lot of people that watch the

532
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,159
show and there's a lot of people out

533
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,400
there yeah there's a lot of people that

534
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:38,440
love weed their whole life is weed

535
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,159
plants medicine uh all all all that cool

536
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:43,038
natural stuff I feel

537
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:45,159
like this is where I meant to be at this

538
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:46,359
time in this place in my whole life if

539
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:48,080
you look back I talk about my

540
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:51,359
18-year-old self being really happy with

541
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:53,639
who I am now um we've gone through all

542
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:56,279
these phases and it's like the people

543
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,600
that love weed you you can't you know

544
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:59,558
you can't bypass those weed those those

545
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:01,918
people

546
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:03,158
or necessarily like that that's what's

547
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,480
happening with these big corporations

548
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:06,120
too some of them are like forgetting

549
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,720
about the passion side of it they're

550
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:10,239
just focusing on profits right and you

551
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,120
know it's one thing to focus on profits

552
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,759
and care about quality and care about

553
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:16,479
the plant you know I mean I think

554
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:18,640
profits are part of the model too like

555
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,200
you have to we're all trying to feed our

556
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,480
our families there's nobody out there

557
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,000
that doesn't love a little bit of money

558
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,798
absolutely you know there's a lot of

559
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,079
battles to pick people yeah they open it

560
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:30,440
up for the corporations come in and and

561
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:32,480
you know Corporation is just a way to

562
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:34,759
form yourself to protect assets and

563
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:38,278
stuff but I know you say that that

564
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:41,720
mentality of that whole thing but yeah

565
00:21:38,278 --> 00:21:44,960
there is a worldwide worldwide uh

566
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:48,200
militia of true ganja people from coast

567
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,558

568
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,798

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,480
the pass they get the quality some of

575
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,240
them maybe not all of them but I guess

576
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,480
it's like that with everything in life

577
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,200

00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:47,759
and I'm used to you know I was used to

648
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:50,480
this world where it was like catpiss

649
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:52,558
tasted like catpiss you know and skunk

650
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,399
smelled like skunk but then somewhere

651
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:57,158
around the 2010s it seems like we got

652
00:24:54,398 --> 00:24:58,599
the names all [ __ ] up uh cookies was

653
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:00,240
okay though cuz at least there was

654
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:02,639
something related to you when that [ __ ]

655
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,919
first came out was it next level fire

656
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,880
yeah um that [ __ ] existed before it came

657
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:10,720
out too though so that was just it was

658
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:13,240
just that [ __ ] was a mythical strain

659
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,720
definitely yeah it was good you know

660
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,240
people loved it and it was another one

661
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,519
that had smoked down to to the roach

662
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,599
it'd be delicious if you grew it

663
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:22,158
correctly and then Sunset sherbet it's

664
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:24,639
an interesting one because I feel like

665
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:28,600
it never got its day like cookies did

666
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:30,600
and gelato did because gelato came to

667
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:33,558
it was like you ever been to the races

668
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:35,480
and [ __ ] and it was like sherbet was

669
00:25:33,558 --> 00:25:38,038
everything was people talking about then

670
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:40,919
dis just came out of [ __ ] nowhere

671
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:42,480

00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:30,599
interesting it gets to the point it's

693
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:34,199
like people want to divide and conquer

694
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:36,319
so much or even separate us by Democrats

695
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,919
and Republicans and people with long

696
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:39,798
hair and short hair and all this stuff

697
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:44,159
and really we're all just people at the

698
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:47,480
end of the day 100 that's a trip well

699
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,679
yeah people that like weed so yeah and

700
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,720

brother get to work we're together in

705
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:02,720
this you know and it's wild because you

706
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:04,000
know I see a lot of people that had this

707
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,120
vision of who they were going to be when

708
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,359
they were older and this is exactly what

709
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:10,158
I wanted to do me too bro and I'm like

710
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:11,798
my homie came through from high school

711
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,320
he's passing he's like dog you're one of

712
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:15,599
the only people that I knew in my whole

713
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:16,960
life that did what you wanted to do as a

714
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:20,359
kid

715
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,759
yeah totally and it's like and the weed

716
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:23,038
it's always been good but like it's

717
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:24,278
pretty amazing now I mean I think

718
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:26,480
there's some interesting stuff still

719
00:27:24,278 --> 00:27:29,159
coming oh man these kids are changing

720
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,000
the game every day bro blowing it up bro

721
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:32,520
but even the even the stuff like this

722
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,398
right this old like we look at some of

723
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:37,240
the old school the piff is very popular

724
00:27:35,398 --> 00:27:39,599
now again and Hazel are starting to come

725
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:42,519
back but this isn't like appealing to a

726
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:44,879
lot of people but it's appealing to me y

727
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:46,038
I got a a piff Cross or the Cuban black

728
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,320

737
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:08,158
definitely some diversity in there and

738
00:28:05,798 --> 00:28:10,158

terpinolene earlier and and getting high

753
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:47,000

754
00:28:44,278 --> 00:28:48,960
should cause a panic attack because it's

755
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,558

00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:18,719

00:29:15,398 --> 00:29:20,918
friend he's like best Sour Girl i' know

768
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,079
I love the sour so like and then there's

769
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:25,880
we were talking about Mis mislabeling

770
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:28,158
things and stuff and uh I think this

771
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:31,640
sour that when

772
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:33,399
came uh associated with the sour was

773
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:35,840
actually the Virginia skunk and they

774
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:37,759
were just calling it Sour Diesel but it

775
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:42,000
was actually Virginia

776
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:43,640
skunk and uh interesting I don't know

777
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,798
like there's so many people telling the

778
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:47,360
same story it's hard to keep it right A

779
00:29:45,798 --> 00:29:49,879
lot of people don't want to tell the c

780
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:53,119
fishing going on but uh yeah this I'm

781
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:55,080
pretty sure that it was uh Virginia scog

782
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:56,798
well so my understanding you know

783
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:58,480
there's all kinds of opinions on Sour

784
00:29:56,798 --> 00:30:00,359
Diesel but Sour Diesel originally I

785
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,599
believe was just a bag seat of the chem

786
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:05,038
91 there wasn't breeding work that went

787
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:06,558
into it uh the stories of my book

788
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:07,960
actually right you know I think it's the

789
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:11,000
same story that Mojave and I talked

790
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:13,960
about on a podcast a while back but and

791
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,960
uh my buddy at rotown genetics he has

792
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:18,480
you know Gabby Gabby got to get that

793
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,159
dude on the sour story those are some of

794
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,839
the kids that brought it out those dudes

795
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,240
original dudes we don't mentioned all

796
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:25,879
those names but [ __ ] like there's

797
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,720
there's some stories and there's some

798
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:30,480
different things but yeah continue yeah

799
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,960

800
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,079
weasel and all that good stuff um but

801
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:38,159

00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:51,558
fingerprint work done for my flora DNA

808
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:55,638
and he has some genomic stuff done on

809
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:57,119
sour and his genomics show six different

810
00:30:55,638 --> 00:31:00,918
Oakland Allen yeah yeah yeah yeah he's

811
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:02,239
good dude yeah for sure OG yeah we we

812
00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:04,799
would definitely have some of his stuff

813
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,399
for sure yeah I think he's he's doing

814
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:08,558
some real breeding work yeah you know

815
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:10,158
there's there's a handful of people

816
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:12,398
there's more than we know you know it's

817
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:15,039
just such a weird small circle that

818
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:16,798
people are like oh this is it this is it

819
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:18,839
and it's just like bro I'm a complex

820
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:21,038
human entity the only thing I don't only

821
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:24,240
just breed plants and I love plants I

822
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:26,240
collect corn seeds and sunflowers and I

823
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,599
love that stuff but like to Define

824
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,038
someone just by the of oh bro you put

825
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:32,038
plants in the and then you make

826
00:31:30,038 --> 00:31:35,720
selections and then that defines your

827
00:31:32,038 --> 00:31:36,919
essence no bro it's like I just I just

828
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:39,519
love that you could grow something in

829
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:42,440
the ground and like get a melon or or a

830
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:44,159
tree or this weed you know it's it's an

831
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:46,360
amazing thing

832
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,200
totally yeah it's amazing to be able to

833
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:50,599
grow stuff out of a

834
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:53,360
seed you know we were we were seeds at

835
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:53,359
one point

836
00:31:53,798 --> 00:31:59,158
right so this is going to be a tasty one

837
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,159
I could tell already

838
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:04,000
yeah that one's going to be

839
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:07,119
crazy yeah there's studies about can

840
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,960
tpin that cancel them each other out too

841
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:11,319
right there's some new stuff coming

842
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,519
out yeah you know that's the thing is

843
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:16,678
now there can be a lot more studies yeah

844
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:20,638
there's so many like things you could

845
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:22,600
study about the weed plant it uh

846
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:24,918
anti-aging you know you smoke enough

847
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:26,398
weed you don't get wrinkles right you

848
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:28,840
know what I mean totally there's some

849
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:30,719
truth to all that stuff especially the

850
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:33,000
anti-aging stuff and then it's just like

851
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,558
people overdoing it with high power [ __ ]

state and uh we're vertically integrated

915
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:19,440
where all the weed we go just goes into

916
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:21,440
our stores and Our Brands and what that

917
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,880

know it gives me a huge platform to to

925
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:42,640
do more things and you know definitely

926
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:44,559
grow more seeds and be active and uh got

927
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:46,960
a lot a big machine behind us we can

928
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:49,639
really do anything right any product on

929
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:53,440
our shelves 85% of the products are ours

930
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:56,480
whether it's uh pre-roll a tinure

931
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,358
gummies drinks yeah you guys so you guys

932
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,599
do everything everything fully

933
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:01,960
vertically integrated pretty much fully

934
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:03,920
vertically integrated you know and uh yo

935
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:06,358
my guys they bootstrapped this off off

936
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:09,400
10 Millie and uh they built this machine

937
00:36:06,358 --> 00:36:11,598
and it's just uh it's a great Evolution

938
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:14,200
yeah for the massive for sure so we got

939
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:17,359
a lot of massive stuff coming out and uh

940
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:19,759
you know working on some stuff um all

941
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:21,279
kinds of stuff so we just uh got a new

942
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,720
hash lab so we're going to be working

943
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,359
more on water hash and rosin bringing

944
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:27,199
that to the table because that's one of

945
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:28,719
the things we have been Outsourcing but

946
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:29,679
so you guys have been feno hunting too

947
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:32,519
it looks

948
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:35,078
like did we've done a couple pretty big

949
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:37,800
feno hunts the first one was uh in

950
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:39,318
Selenas in our uh we're still in Selenas

951
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:42,480
so these guys were some of the first in

952
00:36:39,318 --> 00:36:44,199
Selenas when that whole green Rush uh

953
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,599
blew off and now we're like one of I

954
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:49,159
think there's only eight Farms still in

955
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:51,599
Selenas but we're still there we did a I

956
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:54,118
think it was a 36 strain feno hun out

957
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:56,280
there wow and how many seeds of each did

958
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:59,519
you typically Pop I think we tried to do

959
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:01,160
at least uh 10 of each maybe maybe there

960
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:04,880
was more of certain strains yeah there

961
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:06,679
was 50 of a few strains but uh yeah it

962
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,119
wasn't huge numbers it was just more

963
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:10,679
crack cracked the surface and then uh

964
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:12,760
see what you got see what you're working

965
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:16,318
it was overwhelming working through the

966
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:19,160
turps in there and uh it was really hard

967
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:20,920
to pick things that that that weren't

968
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:22,598
like really hitting and some of the

969
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,000
things just you know how you had to pick

970
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:27,119
because they didn't really fit the

971
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,838
commercial uh paradigms or or

972
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,760
all the markers but some of the most

973
00:37:28,838 --> 00:37:34,078
phenomenal weed you ever seen so we'll

974
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:36,960
be able to get back into that later but

975
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:40,039
we did another feno hunt up there in uh

976
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:43,159
um North San Juan as well and that was

977
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:46,279
uh I think like 12 different strains we

978
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:49,480
were just up there last week testing uh

979
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:52,440
just different hashers and just exciting

980
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:54,358
stuff like that yeah that's awesome yeah

981
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:57,200
yeah so when you're doing

982
00:37:54,358 --> 00:37:59,000
selections uh at scale

983
00:37:57,199 --> 00:38:01,000
what are the selections you're looking

984
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,639
for what are the the main traits that

985
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,639
you're kind of going for you guys going

986
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:06,358
for nose well so like we're vertically

987
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:08,838
integrated so like what do we want we

988
00:38:06,358 --> 00:38:12,000
want to have stuff that nobody has

989
00:38:08,838 --> 00:38:14,400
number one so as slowly massive takes

990
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,039
over uh uh we still have some of the

991
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,960
Hitters from other people but it'll be

992
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:20,358
you know a big portion of that and you

993
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,000
know we want to cover all the tping

994
00:38:20,358 --> 00:38:25,480
profiles orange you know you want

995
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,079
primary colors like yeah exactly 100%

996
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,880
and then uh yeah that's the that's the

997
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:32,800
whole thing and through that process

998
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:34,480
find Elites that are are really exciting

999
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,960
and once we click that just move on to

1000
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:39,920
the to the to the next thing and uh

1001
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:42,240
digging deeper and uh you know we've

1002
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:44,559
been testing some of the males just to

1003
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:46,159
see there cannaboids and uh you guys

1004
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:47,880
reverse them at all or you just yeah

1005
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:51,759
we're we're we're reversing we're doing

1006
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:54,358
a lot of that stuff that's awesome um we

1007
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,920
we were doing uh a lot of cleaning of

1008
00:38:54,358 --> 00:39:00,039
the genetics outsourced with these guys

1009
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:02,200
and uh do a lot of redundancy testing

1010
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:04,519
and then uh there's protocols for

1011
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:06,639
cleaning the plants and then restarting

1012
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:07,920
from tissue culture so they they go you

1013
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:10,679
guys are going through they go through

1014
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:13,639
testing like uh eight months and you

1015
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:17,679
know redundancy over and over for like T

1016
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:21,199
TMV and the The Hop and then the curly

1017
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:23,078
nightm whatever the next thing is so um

1018
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:25,000
and and then by testing them multiple

1019
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:26,680
times you can see that's clear from the

1020
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,480
system and then we can release them back

1021
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:30,279
out you know they're going to they're

1022
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,639
they're doomed to get infected again but

1023
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,839
through this you know you saw that

1024
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:36,639
research they found some immune plants

1025
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:38,400
yeah plants and me into the hob vroid so

1026
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:40,598
whether it's the hob vroid something

1027
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,160
else will show up next week you know not

1028
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:44,119
next week but like there'll be another

1029
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:47,838
thing so you got to stay on your toes

1030
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:49,400
and be current with all this yep science

1031
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:52,759
and and surround yourself with smart

1032
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:54,960
people and uh yeah continue to

1033
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:56,680
learn yeah and realize that you can't

1034
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,720
just do it all yourself it takes a team

1035
00:39:56,679 --> 00:40:01,239
it's great you can't you can't do it all

1036
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:02,799
yourself no and it's amazing working

1037
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:04,919

00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,318
these different uh parts of the of the

1043
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,400
system and just see how big it is and

1044
00:40:17,318 --> 00:40:22,480
and

1045

long ago it was a good podcast so uh

1066
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:14,920
what kind of stuff are you working on

1067
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:16,399
specifically this year anything you want

1068
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:18,039
to talk about or you guys keep it all in

1069
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,800
the dark what are we working on so you

1070
00:41:18,039 --> 00:41:21,358
know we also wanted to bring some

1071
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:23,039
sativas like you're talking about well

1072
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:25,279
there's a debate is it sativa it's not

1073
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:27,239
sativa well there's obviously TPS that

1074
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,040
exist in this

1075
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:30,719
other side of the world weed that you

1076
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:33,079
don't want to call sativa anymore that

1077
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:34,719
aren't existed in this so we wanted to

1078
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:38,000
look for some of those profiles that

1079
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:39,439
we're actually smoking right now and uh

1080
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,280
offer some stuff like that some

1081
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:46,200
preservation stuff also for this growing

1082
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,680
uh uh consumer Market of people 60 and

1083
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:50,318
over you know the Boomers they the some

1084
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:53,960
of the weed's too strong for them they

1085
00:41:50,318 --> 00:41:56,239
want a nostalgic effect of like oh yeah

1086
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:59,358
remember I smoked the aapco gold or the

1087
00:41:56,239 --> 00:42:01,479
you know d d and they didn't get so high

1088
00:41:59,358 --> 00:42:04,358
they couldn't function cuz they're old

1089
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,800
now and it's just like it's hard so um

1090
00:42:04,358 --> 00:42:07,559
you know appealing to just different

1091
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,560
demographics when they want to smoke a

1092
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:11,279
whole joint and not be high right you

1093
00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:13,239
know like I had a chef that I used to

1094
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:17,480
the biggest demographic of emerging

1095
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:17,479
consumers of cannabis that

1096
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,039
taste that's the one though that's like

1097
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:23,319
that combination right there that's the

1098
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:27,480
combo we

1099
00:42:23,318 --> 00:42:30,519
should yeah do the [ __ ] massive loud

1100
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:32,079
yeah down we we should definitely super

1101
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:33,599
this is one of the best ways to actually

1102
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:35,400
figure out what crosses you know you

1103
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,000
smoke stuff together this [ __ ] right

1104
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:40,280
here though it's got good flavor it's

1105
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
complex and it's a it's a hitter too it

1106
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,760
hits hard yeah it's one of those ones

1107
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,880
that I feel like it expands your chest

1108
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:48,559
though some stuff that's one of those

1109
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:51,440
missing things is that expando yeah

1110
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:54,200
where' the expando go yeah it got lost

1111
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:57,480
somewhere along the it's very rare now

1112
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:59,639
like bro bong hits yeah just bong rips

1113
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:01,400
like of the Kryptonite weed back in the

1114
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:03,879
day that's strong as dabs bro that was

1115
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:06,318
like that was like some Next Level [ __ ]

1116
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:09,280
there's there not a lot of snappable

1117
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:11,239
weed anymore bring snappable weed back

1118
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,000
because bongs are cool yeah when they

1119
00:43:11,239 --> 00:43:15,279
bubble and they're C huge collection of

1120
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,318
Bon fing love that [ __ ] bring snappable

1121
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,240
weed back that's one of the you ask me

1122
00:43:17,318 --> 00:43:23,000
that's another thing I want to do yeah

1123
00:43:19,239 --> 00:43:26,719
lime green crystally cripplers for your

1124
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:28,199
bong custom tailored for bong heads

1125
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:30,000
yeah I mean I bet some of that stuff was

1126
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:31,879
like 18% that just rocked our world

1127
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,800
because of the chirpin because of the

1128
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:37,559
flavor molecules y cannaboids Cano serp

1129
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:41,519
just different combinations of stuff

1130
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:43,559
yeah pull it up uh again THC H thcp or

1131
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:45,719
do the research on your own uh be

1132
00:43:43,559 --> 00:43:47,440
surprised what you find out they're

1133
00:43:45,719 --> 00:43:50,639
learning new stuff about cannabis every

1134
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:52,599
day but thcv thcv is awesome about that

1135
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:53,879
one for sure I got some dabbable thtv

1136
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:55,119
that's been sitting for a couple years

1137
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:58,160
and I just found it and took some dabs

1138
00:43:55,119 --> 00:44:00,680
of it it was could have thcv in it yeah

1139
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:05,039
it feels like it's a likely candidate

1140
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:06,679
for thcv right thcv and cbdv I mean all

1141
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:09,838
these things are amazing and there it's

1142
00:44:06,679 --> 00:44:13,558
actually considered hemp by itself it's

1143
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:15,880
hemp until it's not hemp right but

1144
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:17,680
that's the flavor flavor Chasers are

1145
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:21,519
gonna love this stuff come on dog that's

1146
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:23,598
like you L yeah I mean it's good good at

1147
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:26,199
Sol that [ __ ] that would have you

1148
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:28,200
hallucinating at a Burning Spear concert

1149
00:44:26,199 --> 00:44:30,239
yeah I could see this giving you a

1150
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:31,679
little paranoia too that's what I was

1151
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:33,039
saying when I was out there waiting and

1152
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:35,480
I was like [ __ ] am I going to park on

1153
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:37,199
the street excuse me and I smoked the WW

1154
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:39,199
and I was like wow I got a little racy

1155
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:41,439
and was like a little overwhelmed I'm

1156
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:44,078
like maybe that wasn't the best

1157
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,599
choice yeah but now we're safe in the

1158
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:47,079
compound well you know and I don't

1159
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:48,640
really dab this kind of stuff either

1160
00:44:47,079 --> 00:44:51,880
because it's so strong because the dabs

1161
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:55,440
will [ __ ] wreck your life um at least

1162
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:56,599
in my opinion some of that stuff so high

1163
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,079
yeah definitely

1164
00:44:56,599 --> 00:45:00,559
but the flavor on that so good and we're

1165
00:44:59,079 --> 00:45:02,000
just getting into it and I feel like

1166
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:04,000
with those kind of things The Joint

1167
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,960
changes in flavor got me high as [ __ ]

1168
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,400
just those couple hits well it kind of

1169
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,760
really elevated from the stuff we were

1170
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:11,000
smoking earlier we were smoking good

1171
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:13,319
stuff but it's like it's just another

1172
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
level another level of good and then you

1173
00:45:13,318 --> 00:45:18,358
show people those buds and they might be

1174
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,000
like oh bro get that and yeah they look

1175
00:45:18,358 --> 00:45:22,318
at like oh nobody wants that but it's

1176
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,760
like smoke it come on fire the ugliest

1177
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:26,920
weed I ever smoked was also the best

1178
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:29,200
weed so that's yeah that's so I always

1179
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:31,599
St the homie I was like uh what's it

1180
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:33,519

1181
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:35,599

those Ethiopian crosses I'm like what's

1184
00:45:37,719 --> 00:45:41,639
up you know I want that ugly weed yeah

1185
00:45:39,639 --> 00:45:43,159
the uglier the better sometimes

1186
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:44,879
especially the ones that like you have

1187
00:45:43,159 --> 00:45:46,279
the bracks that are stacked at fox tail

1188
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,440
out it's like some of that stuff that

1189
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:50,960
looks very undesirable is absolutely

1190
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:52,760
amazing I mean Sour's kind of like that

1191
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,119
yeah Sour's like on the nice end of that

1192
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:56,599
but some of this stuff looks really bad

1193
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:58,880
where like the buds are just s like that

1194
00:45:56,599 --> 00:46:01,000
the one that's tolerated but yeah right

1195
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:03,680
just [ __ ] that will never get

1196
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:07,519
trimmed yeah seriously what else did I

1197
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:09,558
grow that this year uh just in the

1198
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:11,199
backyard I had

1199
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:15,800

yeah I think they're doing good work I

1209
00:46:34,639 --> 00:46:37,920
think there's yeah I mean there's a

1210
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:39,358
handful of people doing really good work

1211
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,519
and there's you know I like I like the

1212
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:43,558
guys that are using stuff that's outside

1213
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:45,800
the box it's like yeah we can all breed

1214
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:47,040
this stuff that's around but going back

1215
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,318
and you know you're doing the Lord's

1216
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:50,440
work going back and working with land

1217
00:46:48,318 --> 00:46:52,400
races people don't understand like land

1218
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,720
races are nothing like if you think I'm

1219
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,838
G to work with the land race man there's

1220
00:46:53,719 --> 00:46:58,358
a lot of work some people be like the

1221
00:46:55,838 --> 00:47:00,039
they'll be like oh yeah I got the the

1222
00:46:58,358 --> 00:47:01,519
Hindu Kush land and then you bring it

1223
00:47:00,039 --> 00:47:03,279
back and grow it and it's like bro

1224
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:05,159
that's some scraggle yeah I didn't do

1225
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,079
what you wanted to do and like you said

1226
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:09,920
it got to take one two three times to

1227
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:11,760
master some stuff and like tweak it out

1228
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:15,880
and and and have a large amount of seeds

1229
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:17,960
in that case yeah well Mojave Richmond

1230
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:20,800
said once the seed leaves the land the

1231
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:22,519
race is over right so because it grows

1232
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,760
specific to that environment so the

1233
00:47:22,519 --> 00:47:25,159
second you move to a different

1234
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,440
environment whether it's indoors or

1235
00:47:25,159 --> 00:47:29,598
whatever you're changing the environment

1236
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,358
you know the plant naturally adapts to

1237
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:32,960
its environment too it's like we do too

1238
00:47:31,358 --> 00:47:35,318
as humans you know it's it's pretty

1239
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,880
amazing but the land R stuff it's like

1240
00:47:35,318 --> 00:47:39,440
try to grow some Colombian and see what

1241
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:43,160
happens you know and some of these

1242
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:46,800
really long flowering 18 weeks 20 weeks

1243
00:47:43,159 --> 00:47:49,440
yeah wild and then Big Ups to the people

1244
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:51,559
that do grow those out those 20 weeks

1245
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,318
yeah for us to see and just you're a

1246
00:47:51,559 --> 00:47:57,680
real badass if you a 20 we plan I got a

1247
00:47:54,318 --> 00:47:59,318
lot dude yeah 100% because I mean I

1248
00:47:57,679 --> 00:48:01,519
think a lot of people that have 20 we

1249
00:47:59,318 --> 00:48:02,838
plants probably cut them at 10 weeks too

1250
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:04,440
right you know and I think that happens

1251
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:06,440
a lot or they weren't ready for the ride

1252
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:10,159
and then there's a whole like few more

1253
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:12,318
extra [ __ ] a month or two of uh of

1254
00:48:10,159 --> 00:48:13,719
problems that could happen occur yeah I

1255
00:48:12,318 --> 00:48:15,440
mean when you're flowering for that long

1256
00:48:13,719 --> 00:48:18,279
there's so many things that could happen

1257
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:20,318
it's one thing when you're flowering and

1258
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:22,920
you have stuff that flowers for eight

1259
00:48:20,318 --> 00:48:26,199
weeks or 10

1260
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:28,079
weeks how's the flavor still oh

1261
00:48:26,199 --> 00:48:30,358
that's what that's a that's like a top

1262
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:30,359
10

1263
00:48:31,159 --> 00:48:38,519
joint that's a top 10 joint right there

1264
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:40,800
yep it's got Nice Ash too it's got a oil

1265
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:44,519
ringing Nice

1266
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:47,920
Ash and it's a day wrecker for sure a

1267
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:50,639
turp ring on the sativa

1268
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,920
Banger yeah you know it's a banger yeah

1269
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:53,598
and a lot of people haven't even seen

1270
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,200
this to make a decision themselves and

1271
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:57,480
it's like you know

1272
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:58,759
yeah people make their mind up by

1273
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,719
looking at something rather than trying

1274
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:03,160
it and I

1275
00:48:59,719 --> 00:49:05,480
think there's people that have that uh

1276
00:49:03,159 --> 00:49:06,558
interest in experimenting trying

1277
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:08,280
different things especially with

1278
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:10,000
cannabis and those are the ones that get

1279
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:11,798
surprised the most like if you're

1280
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,039
looking for an experience instead of

1281
00:49:11,798 --> 00:49:14,880
just trying to do what everybody else is

1282
00:49:13,039 --> 00:49:16,400
doing you're going for a new experience

1283
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:19,838
right you're gonna find some magic out

1284
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:23,280
there yeah my homie uh uh uh lives in

1285
00:49:19,838 --> 00:49:25,000
Willets um wo was weed he he he's been

1286
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:28,280
messing around for a few years and then

1287
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:31,358
he loves land races a lot too and then

1288
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:34,079
he showed me this strain that he made uh

1289
00:49:31,358 --> 00:49:37,279
is the Robert Creek Congo nice crossed

1290
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:40,559
with the Cong congales land race Congo

1291
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:42,480
is amazing and bro it was like nuggets

1292
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:44,160
of the Ste it was a stickiest land race

1293
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:47,280
I ever seen in my life shout out to

1294
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:50,239
homie bro and uh I was like man you're

1295
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:52,519
on to something with that yeah it was

1296
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:54,239
like cuz you you think of it like one of

1297
00:49:52,519 --> 00:49:57,880
those ones horrible to trim or whatever

1298
00:49:54,239 --> 00:50:01,118
it was just it was like some 98 yeah 98

1299
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:04,079
chronic wow crazy did you do you know

1300
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:06,240
the story about the Robert Creek cono no

1301
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:08,079
no that's I want tell the best that I

1302
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:10,759
know but I'll probably mess it up but so

1303
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:15,720
there there's these guy the congan

1304
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:19,119
Pirates running running weed and uh and

1305
00:50:15,719 --> 00:50:21,039
and then they were like H north of Spain

1306
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:23,119
uh what was that Island I forget but the

1307
00:50:21,039 --> 00:50:26,199
it Shipwrecked on this island and there

1308
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:28,640
was this dude Monro dude the black hand

1309
00:50:26,199 --> 00:50:30,239
that was a boat mechanic and he fixed

1310
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:33,239
these dude's boat they were they were

1311
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:34,919
running bales of the Congo weed and so

1312
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:36,519
he he like you know wanted to get paid

1313
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:38,920
and stuff but he wanted like a bail so

1314
00:50:36,519 --> 00:50:41,039
he he like handpicked the bail or

1315
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:43,240
whatever and from that he selected the

1316
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:45,159
seeds and he grew it [ __ ] I can't

1317
00:50:43,239 --> 00:50:47,959
remember the island name right now off

1318
00:50:45,159 --> 00:50:49,759
the top of my head but uh he grew it

1319
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:52,159
there forever and some Canadian dude

1320
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:54,119
went there got the strain I think that's

1321
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:55,798
where JRE and a lot of people got her

1322
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:58,280
from but they called it Robert Creek

1323
00:50:55,798 --> 00:51:00,039
Congo nice I think Robert's Creek's a

1324
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:03,079
place in Canada where they were growing

1325
00:51:00,039 --> 00:51:04,960
it but uh that one by itself is one of

1326
00:51:03,079 --> 00:51:07,119
those nightmares to trim but his cross

1327
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,880
is fire bro so big UPS to him for

1328
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:10,559
looking outside the box and doing

1329
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:12,358
something yeah and the genetics are

1330
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:15,519
amazing it tastes really good it's got a

1331
00:51:12,358 --> 00:51:17,639
unique kind of musky muskiness to it

1332
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:19,880
along with it has the African kind of

1333
00:51:17,639 --> 00:51:22,598
taste a little bit but the effect it's

1334
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:24,440
funny cuz Durban is also a region in

1335
00:51:22,599 --> 00:51:26,240
Africa right right and Congo you know

1336
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:27,599
we're talking about two different places

1337
00:51:26,239 --> 00:51:29,919
and they have two completely different

1338
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:32,440
effects I feel like Durban kicks your

1339
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:34,680
your head's another one that they got to

1340
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:36,119
find that bring that one back the real

1341
00:51:34,679 --> 00:51:38,279
Durban that's like an e we were just

1342
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:39,920
talking about theor t yeah it's all that

1343
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:41,920
licorice it's that's what it's all about

1344
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:44,400
it's that real licoricey like that stuff

1345
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:46,000
will get you but then red Congo gets you

1346
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,079
super high too but the thing with the

1347
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,880
Congo is it makes me happy and laugh and

1348
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:52,559
like Durban I think Durban is like an as

1349
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:55,079
a little bit Congo's like almost the

1350
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:57,480
north by uh by Morocco right or is it

1351
00:51:55,079 --> 00:52:00,039
more in the mid I believe it's in the

1352
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:02,559
middle somewhere it's a great time to be

1353
00:52:00,039 --> 00:52:04,119
alive I think it's a scary time to be

1354
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:06,480
alive and a great time to be alive

1355
00:52:04,119 --> 00:52:08,599
there's so many things and like with

1356
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,199
weed it's just we're we're still in the

1357
00:52:08,599 --> 00:52:12,480
infancy of it we're still figuring it

1358
00:52:10,199 --> 00:52:14,118
all out it's not stabilized yet and I

1359
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,519
think that's those are the beautiful

1360
00:52:14,119 --> 00:52:18,640
times there's there's enough for

1361
00:52:15,519 --> 00:52:22,199
everybody yeah to figure some things out

1362
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:24,598
yeah we're we're we're in the best time

1363
00:52:22,199 --> 00:52:26,358
yeah and struggle is real and I think

1364
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:28,440
but struggle is okay too I you know I

1365
00:52:26,358 --> 00:52:30,119
think people shy away from struggles

1366
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:32,358
sometimes you know you just got to

1367
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:34,200
accept it and then suck it up and then

1368
00:52:32,358 --> 00:52:36,199
we're going to evolve into better times

1369
00:52:34,199 --> 00:52:37,719
I mean I think that's just the way of

1370
00:52:36,199 --> 00:52:40,358
life

1371
00:52:37,719 --> 00:52:42,159
yeah there's there's not too many people

1372
00:52:40,358 --> 00:52:44,519
you know there's that have just had a

1373
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:46,279
pure plush upbringing there's there's a

1374
00:52:44,519 --> 00:52:48,440
few but you know I think yeah but you

1375
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:50,160
need that in my opinion you need that

1376
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:51,760
like the sour and the sweet right so

1377
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:53,759
like you don't appreciate the sweet

1378
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,559
unless you experience the sour and

1379
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:59,319
that's that's one of the things Buddha

1380
00:52:55,559 --> 00:53:01,119
and you go on your own path right I feel

1381
00:52:59,318 --> 00:53:02,880
like the the tough times have made me

1382
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:07,079
appreciate the good times even more but

1383
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:10,318
it's all fleeting anyway yeah nothing's

1384
00:53:07,079 --> 00:53:13,839
promised we're we're just here you know

1385
00:53:10,318 --> 00:53:15,798
occupa occupying space and time yeah

1386
00:53:13,838 --> 00:53:17,798
what we're left with what we're left

1387
00:53:15,798 --> 00:53:20,159
with is our last breath and it could be

1388
00:53:17,798 --> 00:53:22,920
a breath of anger could be a breath of

1389
00:53:20,159 --> 00:53:25,279
of Joy so you you choose how to live

1390
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:28,920
your life when it at any minute could

1391
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:31,160
and Which choice do you want

1392
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:33,400
totally yeah man you're B in cold

1393
00:53:31,159 --> 00:53:35,440
plunging too I saw some videos I love

1394
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:37,838
cold plunging that's my thing I co

1395
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:40,079
plunge every day and I just love it I

1396
00:53:37,838 --> 00:53:41,599
feel like it gives I I don't I used to

1397
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:43,318
smoke before I did now I do it first

1398
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:45,599
thing in the morning i' get out of bed

1399
00:53:43,318 --> 00:53:47,679
and I just go plunge and I do long

1400
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:49,838
plunges I don't do the short ones it's

1401
00:53:47,679 --> 00:53:51,798
crazy to think that it's one of those

1402
00:53:49,838 --> 00:53:54,039
things that like right now just us

1403
00:53:51,798 --> 00:53:56,519
thinking about coal plunging yeah is

1404
00:53:54,039 --> 00:53:58,558
having positive impacts on our body

1405
00:53:56,519 --> 00:54:00,480
because we've cold plunged it's that

1406
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:02,400
powerful that you could just think of a

1407
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:05,318
time when you did it get some of the

1408
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:07,039
benefits yeah I I agree 100% so I have I

1409
00:54:05,318 --> 00:54:08,599
listen to meditation music right so I

1410
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:10,480
listen to this music that I've listened

1411
00:54:08,599 --> 00:54:12,519
to every day since I started doing it

1412
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,798
and now like if I have it going on my

1413
00:54:12,519 --> 00:54:18,480
head I all of a sudden get super relaxed

1414
00:54:14,798 --> 00:54:20,280
right so pretty amazing yeah I like I

1415
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:21,798
like those ones when it's snowing out

1416
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:24,760
that's the best ones when it's really

1417
00:54:21,798 --> 00:54:26,920
like it's hard to keep it going like in

1418
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:28,520
in the summer fully like the cold plunge

1419
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:30,480
unless you got the electric plug in or

1420
00:54:28,519 --> 00:54:34,239
something yeah but uh those best ones

1421
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:37,079
are just like in the snow just like it

1422
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:39,039
really makes time stop for for and

1423
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:43,119
really SL just I'm feeling it right now

1424
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:44,838
brother yeah yeah it's it's y I went so

1425
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:47,000
when I did go to Amsterdam this last

1426
00:54:44,838 --> 00:54:50,000
time because I hadn't seen Soma for like

1427
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:53,119
20 some years and then uh we we linked

1428
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:56,679
up and we we uh spent some time together

1429
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:59,400
and and SP bro took us to the the sauna

1430
00:54:56,679 --> 00:55:02,000
ritual oh yeah I've done that many times

1431
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:04,000
that's and it was like that first one

1432
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,199
and then it's like the super hot one and

1433
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,599
then they got all the things that

1434
00:55:05,199 --> 00:55:09,399
they're putting on on the hot rocks and

1435
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:12,119
then they finish it up with the

1436
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:13,798
opning and then the Opium drops on you

1437
00:55:12,119 --> 00:55:16,039
and you're just

1438
00:55:13,798 --> 00:55:19,400
like and then cold plunge and then the

1439
00:55:16,039 --> 00:55:21,199
second one's like like pretty mellow in

1440
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:24,079
comparison but the hot air and then they

1441
00:55:21,199 --> 00:55:26,679
ended with the uh that elang Lang flower

1442
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:28,880
that made Chanel number five yeah one of

1443
00:55:26,679 --> 00:55:30,838
the best scents in the world it's like I

1444
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:33,160
never knew that there was such a ritual

1445
00:55:30,838 --> 00:55:34,880
around sauna and then and then of course

1446
00:55:33,159 --> 00:55:36,598
some's like yeah you got to this this

1447
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,960
one security guard you got to watch out

1448
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:40,280
for this guy but we could go over here

1449
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:41,280
and smoke the Hash Pipe and we're just

1450
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:43,640
like it's

1451
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,880
always put he's like okay give me your

1452
00:55:43,639 --> 00:55:47,719
coffee and just Scoops the butter in

1453
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:49,599
there it's the best just to put the

1454
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:52,159
butter in your coffee before you go in

1455
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:54,280
so he makes the most amazing brittle too

1456
00:55:52,159 --> 00:55:55,519
that that brittle is something special

1457
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:58,440
blessed to have s

1458
00:55:55,519 --> 00:56:00,038
oh yeah bro blessed to have them yeah

1459
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:02,240
the spa experiences those are the best

1460
00:56:00,039 --> 00:56:04,000
I'm finished and I love sauna like

1461
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:06,519
that's that's a thing from my child I

1462
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,280
want that in my life all the time bro

1463
00:56:06,519 --> 00:56:09,798
it's like you know that's one of the

1464
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:11,039
things I look forward doing to doing

1465
00:56:09,798 --> 00:56:13,199
every time I go to Instagram is going to

1466
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:15,920
the spa yeah and it's just it's always a

1467
00:56:13,199 --> 00:56:17,078
different experience too you know so

1468
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:19,200
always an

1469
00:56:17,079 --> 00:56:21,839
adventure uh yeah I've been too high at

1470
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:24,199
this the spa before bro it's kind of

1471
00:56:21,838 --> 00:56:28,199
like it gets crazy dude it's just like

1472
00:56:24,199 --> 00:56:31,078
yeah that Spa

1473
00:56:28,199 --> 00:56:33,358
totally that good still still delicious

1474
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:36,400
it's fire that's a good combo I feel

1475
00:56:33,358 --> 00:56:38,440
like those would be good together I

1476
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:40,519
think they would breed pretty pretty

1477
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:41,679
good too it is pretty fire Str

1478
00:56:40,519 --> 00:56:43,480
especially because it's similar

1479
00:56:41,679 --> 00:56:44,639
structure so people wouldn't be upset

1480
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:46,639
because they know what they were getting

1481
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:48,598
into from before you

1482
00:56:46,639 --> 00:56:50,078
started so some of this stuff if you

1483
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:51,920
were to cross it with the gelato and

1484
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:53,480
sell seeds of it people would be like

1485
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:55,400
wait a second what's going on here the

1486
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:57,440
plants look crazy but it's like like

1487
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:58,838
yeah you you know I think there's

1488
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,880
potential for this stuff too you just

1489
00:56:58,838 --> 00:57:01,798
have to be able to appreciate a

1490
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:05,240
different

1491
00:57:01,798 --> 00:57:06,759
structure yeah like like but like you

1492
00:57:05,239 --> 00:57:09,159
said if it was in a joint and people

1493
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:11,640
didn't see it and one another that one

1494
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:12,960
might be too strong for people it might

1495
00:57:11,639 --> 00:57:15,440
be so it's really

1496
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:17,798
racy it's really racy it's got a good

1497
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:19,318
freaking uh profile but then it I feel

1498
00:57:17,798 --> 00:57:21,798
like it kind of Mellows out too a little

1499
00:57:19,318 --> 00:57:24,279
bit like I think I was more high like a

1500
00:57:21,798 --> 00:57:26,960
little bit ago and now I'm more like

1501
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:30,519
Smooth right well it's it's funny how

1502
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:33,199
extracts have evolved into Rosen carts

1503
00:57:30,519 --> 00:57:34,519
like where we were in the 90s right you

1504
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:38,598
know that's when I first started seeing

1505
00:57:34,519 --> 00:57:41,038
hash was in the 90s to uh you know

1506
00:57:38,599 --> 00:57:44,798
extract Tricom Technologies he was doing

1507
00:57:41,039 --> 00:57:48,520
the original BHO before anybody else

1508
00:57:44,798 --> 00:57:50,119
right and then uh Rosen carts we got

1509
00:57:48,519 --> 00:57:51,920
into rosin and now they're putting in

1510
00:57:50,119 --> 00:57:53,960
carts capture inter and these are really

1511
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:55,599
good this is Jetty and uh they do a

1512
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:58,519
great job with their cards they taste

1513
00:57:55,599 --> 00:58:00,000
amazing this is a TAA one too like it's

1514
00:57:58,519 --> 00:58:02,838

1515
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:05,039
pen yeah I was lucky enough to move to

1516
00:58:02,838 --> 00:58:07,199
Amsterdam well I wish it wouldn't been

1517
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:10,359
the end of an era but the end of a Great

1518
00:58:07,199 --> 00:58:14,719
era of hashish when that there was some

1519
00:58:10,358 --> 00:58:17,358
just amazing land race hashish before it

1520
00:58:14,719 --> 00:58:20,598
became dominant on these other cultivars

1521
00:58:17,358 --> 00:58:23,719
and stuff uh real like Steve Hayes

1522

1533
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:52,200
lot of [ __ ] and and he showed me so much

1534
00:58:49,679 --> 00:58:53,919
about hash before it vanished off the

1535
00:58:52,199 --> 00:58:56,798
Earth there's still hash and there's

1536
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:58,280
good hash but it's it's different there

1537
00:58:56,798 --> 00:59:00,400
was so much more variety of stuff for

1538
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:02,000
sure but yeah so tell us a little bit

1539
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,760
more am about Amsterdam did you live

1540
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,318
there for a while Amsterdam so it was

1541
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:09,079
like around 2,000 years old I was like

1542
00:59:06,318 --> 00:59:10,480
so I was always in the seeds and all

1543
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:12,400
that and that's what I was doing with

1544
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:14,400
Eddie too was like I convinced him about

1545
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:17,280
the seeds and then that's when the

1546
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:20,119
Eddie's medicinal seeds started and then

1547
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:22,640
uh we were doing some stuff on the side

1548
00:59:20,119 --> 00:59:25,838
like the beaster side so we we had some

1549
00:59:22,639 --> 00:59:27,719
funds available and uh just we had met

1550
00:59:25,838 --> 00:59:29,318
some people and we're like yo that's the

1551
00:59:27,719 --> 00:59:31,519
that's what we wanted to do is move to

1552
00:59:29,318 --> 00:59:33,838
Amsterdam and start start a seed company

1553
00:59:31,519 --> 00:59:36,719
grow weed because that's that was the

1554
00:59:33,838 --> 00:59:40,279
Apex of it right right so we funded it

1555
00:59:36,719 --> 00:59:43,000
we we had a couple spots and we we moved

1556
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:45,000
over there and we were growing and uh

1557
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,719
that's where I met Don and Aaron and

1558
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,358
they they were like hiding out and this

1559
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:49,679
and that and like you know they were

1560
00:59:48,358 --> 00:59:53,798
like okay come down here this is where

1561
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:56,038

1562
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:57,280
euro maybe was was even Gilder back then

1563
00:59:56,039 --> 00:59:59,760
I think it was right at the end of the

1564
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:01,280
Gilder and then yeah we just got to go

1565
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:03,440
down here and spray paint and silver

1566

like everyone El and then like we just

1567
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:09,039
we just raged for a while while we were

1568
01:00:06,119 --> 01:00:11,920
there but that was a great time um like

1569
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:14,079
that's when I first met s and stuff yeah

1570

and then then I went back recently and

1573
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:26,559
Amsterdam's way different than it than

1574
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:26,559
it was yeah it was so much it was like

1575
01:00:26,679 --> 01:00:31,919
and now it's like uh it's like Las Vegas

1581
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:44,440

or something good times for sure

1608
01:01:41,358 --> 01:01:45,719
Amsterdam was so wild dude back then

1609
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:48,480
compared to now and I mean I guess we're

1610
01:01:45,719 --> 01:01:50,838
older too well when I first well I went

1611
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:53,760
to college in London for a while and

1612
01:01:50,838 --> 01:01:56,199
then I would take the bus and the ferry

1613
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:58,319
over to amster Dam it took like 11 hours

1614
01:01:56,199 --> 01:02:00,358
9 hours or something and it was the

1615
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:01,719
cheapest way you could get there cuz I

1616
01:02:00,358 --> 01:02:03,078
was a college student and then i' just

1617
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:05,919
go there for the week and stay in a

1618
01:02:03,079 --> 01:02:08,720
hostel and I just smoke Ash and weed and

1619
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:11,200
[ __ ] it's amazing and that was that was

1620
01:02:08,719 --> 01:02:14,038
way back in the early that was

1621
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:16,759
like cheapers that was like 91 or

1622
01:02:14,039 --> 01:02:19,119
something wow long before I went there

1623
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:21,039
it it was it was a different era yeah

1624
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:23,358
for sure 91's when I first started

1625
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:26,200
smoking same year chem dog 91 was a

1626
01:02:23,358 --> 01:02:30,318
special year yeah for sure for so many

1627
01:02:26,199 --> 01:02:32,919
things so Grateful Dead that bag seed

1628
01:02:30,318 --> 01:02:35,318
the 90s was a great era for cannabis it

1629
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:38,079
was it was like the Age of Enlightenment

1630
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:40,159
to a degree I mean I think it was really

1631
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:42,119
special with all the different genetics

1632
01:02:40,159 --> 01:02:44,798
that were being created and the people

1633
01:02:42,119 --> 01:02:46,960
were growing quality I think the quality

1634
01:02:44,798 --> 01:02:48,719
improved you know I we understood

1635
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:51,079
technology a little bit more we also

1636
01:02:48,719 --> 01:02:55,199
thought three-part was an amazing input

1637
01:02:51,079 --> 01:02:57,160
for for I've always been organic I was I

1638
01:02:55,199 --> 01:03:01,239
always thought that was the way to go

1639
01:02:57,159 --> 01:03:02,879
guos and stuff and just natural yeah not

1640
01:03:01,239 --> 01:03:05,639
that I haven't thrown some cammies on it

1641
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:09,720
here and there but like that was just my

1642
01:03:05,639 --> 01:03:12,440
my right I prefer organic for for the

1643
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:14,879
effect I think Coco's great

1644
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:16,358
now but yeah back in the day soil was

1645
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:18,039
three part though there was people bro

1646
01:03:16,358 --> 01:03:19,960
back in the day that Miracle Grow that

1647
01:03:18,039 --> 01:03:23,119
doesn't exist anymore I see some

1648
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:25,480
oldtimers grow some weed that look like

1649
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:27,880
grow Krypton

1650
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:30,599
and like just smell crazy smoke that

1651
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:32,318
[ __ ] it would knock you out probably not

1652
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:35,318
so much that the weed was so powerful

1653
01:03:32,318 --> 01:03:38,558
but the kimys and the heavy metals just

1654
01:03:35,318 --> 01:03:41,079
dusted you no flush no these guys were

1655
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:42,480
flush I think one of the first dudes

1656
01:03:41,079 --> 01:03:46,440
that I learned that [ __ ] from back in

1657
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:49,159
the day one one garbage can one cup of

1658
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:50,599
of Miracle Grow every watering wow and

1659
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:53,078
then you switch it to the other one at

1660
01:03:50,599 --> 01:03:54,318
the end and then at certain time but

1661
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:56,839
it's just like so that's that would be

1662
01:03:54,318 --> 01:03:59,880
be a super low dose of it this guy was

1663
01:03:56,838 --> 01:04:02,639
this guy was crazy he had the he had the

1664
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:07,400
laskan Thunder [ __ ] back in the day in

1665
01:04:02,639 --> 01:04:09,400
in the 80s late 80s 90s in Tacoma he was

1666
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:11,318
he was these it was good weed in

1667
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:13,039
Washington if you were doing it back

1668
01:04:11,318 --> 01:04:15,719
then you had to be a little bit crazy

1669
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:17,160
yeah or a mad genius and those dudes

1670
01:04:15,719 --> 01:04:19,118
like hit out a little better it was

1671
01:04:17,159 --> 01:04:22,440
usually a balance of both yeah but there

1672
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:25,519
was some that dude was a lunatic bro my

1673
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:27,039
family Washington they were the yeah

1674
01:04:25,519 --> 01:04:29,278
they've been growing a long time yeah

1675
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:31,240
Washington Got The Chronic forever the

1676
01:04:29,278 --> 01:04:33,400
only problem they never [ __ ] it it

1677
01:04:31,239 --> 01:04:34,879
would be so the humidity was so high

1678
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:37,480
it's really hard to maintain we're so

1679
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:40,240
blessed in California for the humidity

1680
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:41,880
especially in the temperature but uh our

1681
01:04:40,239 --> 01:04:43,838
weed stays perfect most of the times

1682
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:46,480
like Colorado gets too dry Washington

1683
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:47,920
would Colorado will ruin your sack

1684
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:50,599
Hawaii you got to keep that [ __ ] in the

1685
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:53,760
freezer just take nugs out or it'll be

1686
01:04:50,599 --> 01:04:54,960
dusted it just Brown out and uh I took

1687
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:56,640
stuff out of my my freezer that was in

1688
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:58,358
there for 5 years it was almost like it

1689
01:04:56,639 --> 01:05:00,879
was frozen in the block of ice at the

1690
01:04:58,358 --> 01:05:03,400
bottom and it had been there for 5 years

1691
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:04,798
and finally we defrosted and it was some

1692
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:07,798
loud Berry from back in the day and this

1693
01:05:04,798 --> 01:05:09,960
stuff five years old still had turps so

1694
01:05:07,798 --> 01:05:13,119
freezers were good freezers a great way

1695
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:14,760
to preserve your stuff yeah for sure

1696
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:18,240
yeah a lot of people don't utilize the

1697
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:19,440
cold chain for turp storage yeah I think

1698
01:05:18,239 --> 01:05:20,919
that's going to be a game changer in the

1699
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:22,400
future for the entire industry though

1700
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:24,639
you look at loganitus you were talking

1701
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:27,039
about lanus earlier but I think

1702
01:05:24,639 --> 01:05:29,719
but what what was I saying about Lanas

1703
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:33,799
you were saying that Bill Gates now owns

1704
01:05:29,719 --> 01:05:38,118
Lanas well Bill Gates I he own heekin a

1705
01:05:33,798 --> 01:05:41,038
big chunk of it so hinin owns Lanas y

1706
01:05:38,119 --> 01:05:44,519

these circuses and just that group is

1740
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:07,720
just they're a different breed really

1741
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:09,519
good people all fun they understand hard

1742
01:07:07,719 --> 01:07:13,038
the funny thing about the guys who did

1743
01:07:09,519 --> 01:07:14,880
the B the Beer Circus like vair society

1744
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:16,039
and all the people that were involved

1745
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:17,480
you know that I was friends with this

1746
01:07:16,039 --> 01:07:20,160
guy Travis who was one of the managers

1747
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:22,119
but everybody really knew how to work

1748
01:07:20,159 --> 01:07:23,598
hard and also have a good time right

1749
01:07:22,119 --> 01:07:25,240
that's one of the beauty beauties of

1750
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:27,838
life if you learn how to work your ass

1751
01:07:25,239 --> 01:07:31,159
off when you need to and then also party

1752
01:07:27,838 --> 01:07:33,000
when you you need to or want to you know

1753
01:07:31,159 --> 01:07:35,920
I think that's what life's all

1754
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:38,079
about the balance the

1755
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:39,599
