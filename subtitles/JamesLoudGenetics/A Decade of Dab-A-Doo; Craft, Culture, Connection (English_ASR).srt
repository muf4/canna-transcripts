clothes are doing tumbling inside the

31
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:30,840

32
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,159
the drum of the clothes dryer but by one

33
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,600

something so much bigger than myself MAA

109
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:56,879
brought together a community of

110
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:59,919
enthusiasts who were eager to share

111
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:02,000
their passion for hashish the atmosphere

112
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:05,399
was electric filled with a sense of

113
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,439
curiosity and camaraderie you had uh uh

114
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:08,758
Hitman

115
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:11,160
Glass Marin Asher was like the

116
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:13,280
entertainment when VA came into America

117
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,720
at that point DJ had gotten her together

118
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,439
with spoiled Rob which is spoiled

119
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,440
patience Collective who's one of the

120
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:21,439
goats for separating lipids fats waxes

121
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:24,519
getting down to distillate you know uh

122
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:27,120
Delta 9 Delta 8 along with holy water

123
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:30,719
you know it it it goes back real far

124
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,360
Davido is uh has a place in my heart

125
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,400
right now because I was in a room full

126
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,360
of people who love cannabis I don't

127
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:39,879
think there was one person in that room

128
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:43,280
who didn't love

129
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:46,279
cannabis and that's a kind of rare thing

130
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:49,159
for our community these days and I think

131
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:53,000
it's a really precious thing that that

132
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:55,720
we had for many years and so seeing this

133
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,079
community and have a place really

134
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,160
important function that first event was

135
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:03,279
a symbol of the cultural shift happening

136
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,120
within cannabis a move toward quality

137
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:08,079
craftsmanship and

138
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,240
Community even then it was clear that

139
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:12,680
this Gathering was something special but

140
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,840
that first one in America was something

141
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,199
that was just extremely unique and here

142
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:19,839
it is back now and it's a great thing to

143
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,080
see how far she's come and over 50 to

144
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:24,279
this point it's incredible but to be a

145
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:26,399
part of the 10-year anniversary and to

146

147
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:31,239

148
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:33,318

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,160
their love for resin and the desire to

169
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:23,959
celebrate the craft as I don't usually

170
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:26,759
like all these cups and competitions

171
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:29,839
where you only have a few judges I

172
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:32,680

amazing entries we have bubble hash we

204
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:48,759
have rosin and then we have traditional

205
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,920
and Temple balls so those three

206
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:52,958
categories are what we're judging today

207
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:55,360
and you know I'm just blessed to be a

208
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:57,719
part of this thing at daadu the

209
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,320
competition celebrates the Artistry of

210
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,240
resin extraction with three categories

211
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,720
that showcase the diversity and

212
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,959
craftsmanship in the world of

213
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,120
concentrates let's take a closer look at

214
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:11,639
each one first we have ice waterer hash

215
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,679
this concentrate is made using a

216
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:16,039
solventless extraction method that

217
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:18,679
preserves the purity of the plant by

218
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:22,319
agitating cannabis plant material in ice

219
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:25,399
cold water the tricomes tiny resinous

220
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,360
glands rich in cannaboids and tpin are

221
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:29,440
separated from the rest of the plant

222
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,360
once collected and carefully dried

223
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,160
what's left is a highquality hash known

224
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:37,079
for its potency and smoothness next up

225
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:39,319
is rosin another solventless concentrate

226
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:42,559
rosin is created by applying heat and

227
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:44,640
pressure to cannabis flour ke or hash

228
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:46,879
this process results in a sticky

229
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:49,879
resinous substance that's rich in both

230
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:51,600
cannaboids and Turpin rosin has quickly

231
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:54,240
become a favorite in the concentrate

232
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,560
world for its Pure Clean flavor and high

233
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,799
potency finally there's the temple ball

234
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:01,799
a traditional type of handrolled hash

235
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:04,838
known for its distinctive shape and

236
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:07,039
silky texture made by pressing high

237
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:09,839
quality tricomes into a dense rounded

238
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:12,278
form Temple balls have a rich tpine

239
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,959
profile and are known for their potent

240
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:17,600
effects each entry is presented

241
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:20,119
anonymously labeled only by a

242
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,360
number this ensures a focus on the

243
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,600
quality of the product rather than its

244
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,600
origin we are getting ready to get all

245
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,360
these uh out to the people we're doing

246
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,240
intake right now last minute intake but

247
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,879
we're uh numbering everything so that

248
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:36,600
it's Anonymous so that people don't know

249
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:39,240
what's what necessarily uh we have a lot

250
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,759
of amazing entries three categories

251
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,639
we've got rosin we've got water has and

252
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:47,120
we have traditional SL Temple balls

253
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,440
really amazing stuff I I've seen them

254
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,839
come in over the last month and it's

255
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,959
nothing but spectacular I'm seeing the

256
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,800
best of the best and I judged K ofest

257
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:59,679
2024 there was amazing stuff there too

258
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:02,759
but this is just really special ipants

259
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:07,399
rate each entry across four categories

260
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:10,240
smell look taste and effect actually I

261
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:12,720
always feel that a Dadu is uh like a

262
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,120
wine tastery you get 20 bottles of good

263
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,360
wine and you get a a bunch of people and

264
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,879
you know they're going to have a good

265
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:21,000
time and it's kind of the same way the D

266
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:24,600
do because everybody who comes there

267
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,320
loves hash and there's competitors and

268
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,800
some of those entries are fantastic the

269
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:32,839
same day everybody has to try all the

270
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:35,240
entries and vote for them and at the end

271
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:38,120
of the day we'll know who the winners

272
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:41,200
were we are judging each entry on a

273
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,879
scale of 1 to five based on these

274
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,759
different categories look taste effect

275
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:48,519
and smell we're going through each one

276
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:51,480
of the entries one by one each judge

277
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:53,240
will write down their favorite first

278
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,839
second and third place then we're going

279
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:59,360
to tally it up at the end and announce

280
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,360
the winner at 9:00 p.m. tonight

281
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:07,639
first comes the smell each judge inhales

282
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:10,159
deeply exploring the Rich Turpin those

283
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:13,198
aromatic compounds that make each sample

284
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:15,278
unique the look is next with judges

285
00:12:13,198 --> 00:12:17,879
examining the color texture and

286
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:20,120
consistency of the resin the golden

287
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:22,000
shine of a well-made rosin or the rich

288
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,759
dark tones of a classic hash tell their

289
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,120
own stories of care and craft then

290
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:30,360
there's the taste arguably the most

291
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,839
enjoyable part each judge takes their

292
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:36,639
time savoring the flavors whether it's

293
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:39,440
floral spicy or earthy the effect

294
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:42,440
completes the experience the way each

295
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:45,399
entry feels whether it's relaxing

296
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:47,199
uplifting or somewhere in between adds

297
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:49,639
the final touch to the

298
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:52,198
score the judging isn't just about

299
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:54,360
finding a winner it's a collective

300
00:12:52,198 --> 00:12:57,359
experience where people share notes

301
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:00,600
debate their favorites and enjoy the

302
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,919
moment the true magic of daadu is the

303
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,000
community it creates where cannabis

304
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:07,039
enthusiasts from different backgrounds

305
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,759
come together to celebrate their shared

306
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:11,480
love of

307
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:14,159
resin Mila Johanson is at the center of

308
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:16,839
it all smiling and interacting with

309
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:20,000
attendees sharing stories from her

310
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:22,480
journey the atmosphere is electric with

311
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,799
people exchanging ideas enjoying the

312
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,920
company and remembering why they fell in

313
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:30,278
love with hashish in the first

314
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:32,719
place for MAA daadu has always been

315
00:13:30,278 --> 00:13:34,198
about more than just competition it's

316
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,480
about

317
00:13:34,198 --> 00:13:39,679
connection what I like about daadu most

318
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:43,159
is that nobody's looking at their phone

319
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:44,559
MAA says everyone's communicating

320
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:46,360
whether they're from the same part of

321
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:49,198
the world or

322
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,360
