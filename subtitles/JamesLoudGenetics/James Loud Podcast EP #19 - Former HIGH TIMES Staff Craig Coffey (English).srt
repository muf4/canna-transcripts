1
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:09,884
Yeah,

2
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:10,926
How's it going, everybody?

3
00:00:10,926 --> 00:00:12,804
Welcome to the James Loud Podcast.

4
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:15,265
And today my special guest is Craig Coffey.

5
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:17,057
How you doing, Craig?

6
00:00:17,057 --> 00:00:21,061
So Craig and I go back at least ten years from high Times events.

7
00:00:21,103 --> 00:00:22,396
That's getting close to 20 years.

8
00:00:22,396 --> 00:00:24,231
Yeah, it's interesting.

9
00:00:24,231 --> 00:00:26,483
It's been a while. I mean, time just flies.

10
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:28,153
But you, you've worked for high times.

11
00:00:28,152 --> 00:00:28,736
I feel like

12
00:00:28,736 --> 00:00:29,027
you were

13
00:00:29,027 --> 00:00:33,073
the perfect person for the podcast because you were a connoisseur of cannabis.

14
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:34,783
All I've ever care about my whole life.

15
00:00:34,783 --> 00:00:36,911
I keep the main thing as the main thing.

16
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:39,414
Totally. No, that's amazing. And you love weed.

17
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:40,539
You know a lot about weed.

18
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:44,878
You know a lot about flavor profiles and getting high.

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,588
Well, when you asked me to come on the podcast,

20
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:47,963
I asked you what we were going to talk about,

21
00:00:47,963 --> 00:00:51,134
and I was afraid you were going to say like work or industry or something.

22
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,886
But you said we

23
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:53,719
absolutely,

24
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:56,680
you know, talk about we're yeah, we're going to talk about weed.

25
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,683
And that's what I like and genetics and how genetics have changed.

26
00:00:59,683 --> 00:01:03,437
I think that's a great topic for today, at least to start off with, is how

27
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:06,483
the genetics have changed over the last since you started smoking.

28
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:09,486
But before we talk about that, let's dive into your history.

29
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:10,570
let's start at the beginning.

30
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:14,823
The very first time I smoked a joint was probably in 1991, and within

31
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,451
a month of that I would say I was a regular daily

32
00:01:17,451 --> 00:01:20,871
smoker every day awake and make it actually turn my life around.

33
00:01:20,871 --> 00:01:25,584
I was kind of a bad high school student and the weekend got me really interested

34
00:01:25,584 --> 00:01:29,756
in my first period chemistry class and out of nowhere, because of weed,

35
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:30,798
I became a really good student.

36
00:01:30,798 --> 00:01:33,801
I graduated with a great GPA and got a good job.

37
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,512
That's awesome. Great.

38
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:39,682
We tell your mom I credit we entirely her graduating high school.

39
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:40,058
Nice.

40
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:43,144
And so you're probably around 1413 first time.

41
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,728
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Me too.

42
00:01:44,728 --> 00:01:47,774
So I was born in 77, 76, 76. Yeah.

43
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:51,527
So yeah, same years that was doesn't good year for weed chem dog.

44
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,947
That was a good year for him dog. Good year for a lot of things.

45
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:58,909
91 was a good year to this day I think that it's the pinnacle of weed

46
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:02,204
this can anyone I don't think has gone further than that personally.

47
00:02:02,287 --> 00:02:05,415
No. And it's so influential to so many things,

48
00:02:05,415 --> 00:02:06,625
just like the Grateful Dead. I mean,

49
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:11,756
and Kim Dog is a part of the Grateful Dead, the person and the genetics.

50
00:02:11,838 --> 00:02:15,175
I think, you know, we talk about the Grateful Dead a lot on my show,

51
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:18,596
but I think there's a lot of ties to the cannabis industry for sure.

52
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,890
Even if you're not a Deadhead. Yeah, you like weed.

53
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:23,392
You should respect and love the Grateful Dead.

54
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:26,396
Yeah. Integral part of what we do right now.

55
00:02:26,395 --> 00:02:28,939
And if that scene didn't exist, I don't think we'd be even close

56
00:02:28,939 --> 00:02:31,401
to where we are today as far as strains and variety and.

57
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,695
Oh yeah, everything. Everything. Well, yeah.

58
00:02:34,736 --> 00:02:36,698
I mean, I think Dennis Prone said it said it

59
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,701
best that it's medical whether you believe it is or not.

60
00:02:39,741 --> 00:02:40,617
Every single time

61
00:02:40,617 --> 00:02:44,621
you smoke a joint, it's a medical, there's medical benefits for sure.

62
00:02:44,705 --> 00:02:46,748
You know, and I think

63
00:02:46,832 --> 00:02:47,457
now that we're

64
00:02:47,457 --> 00:02:51,336
older, you look at it, you know, we've been smoking since we were kids.

65
00:02:51,378 --> 00:02:55,173
And I think it's only had positive influence on my life.

66
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,385
I can't think of a negative one.

67
00:02:57,384 --> 00:03:00,304
Me either. Not not my health.

68
00:03:00,304 --> 00:03:05,143
I wish I was I wish I spent a little less money in my lifetime.

69
00:03:05,225 --> 00:03:06,894
The munchies for me, it's the munchies.

70
00:03:06,894 --> 00:03:08,271
You know, It's giving me the munchies when,

71
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,397
you know I don't always need to eat so much.

72
00:03:10,397 --> 00:03:13,401
Totally. For your life. Absolutely.

73
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:15,403
Yeah. And so you in the last

74
00:03:15,402 --> 00:03:17,780
you've been in California for a while now, but you moved out from New York.

75
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,366
We first met in the High Times events, but hung out in New York

76
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:25,329
at the office, smoked weed in New York when it was totally illegal.

77
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:28,957
Now you can smoke it on the streets and it's pretty amazing right now.

78
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,127
I haven't lived there since 2015.

79
00:03:32,127 --> 00:03:35,797
I went back recently for the first time in legalization. Wow.

80
00:03:35,923 --> 00:03:37,508
Just blaze enjoy

81
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:41,094
right out in the public and all the places I've ever been arrested or harassed.

82
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,972
I just when I went to ah, I'm in.

83
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,849
That's amazing. Smoking in every spot.

84
00:03:44,848 --> 00:03:48,143
And Times Square. Coney Island. Yeah. Yeah.

85
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,855
So genetics wise, what were you smoking out there

86
00:03:50,937 --> 00:03:53,690
in California or my brother with me,

87
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:56,485
I went into a few shops and honestly, like,

88
00:03:56,485 --> 00:03:59,030
there's got to be great we in New York, there always is great with New York,

89
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:03,533
but there's so many storefronts right now that I feel like it's kind of

90
00:04:03,575 --> 00:04:04,242
hit and miss.

91
00:04:04,242 --> 00:04:06,704
It's pretty hard to find great weed just up the street.

92
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:08,831
Yeah, there's a lot of mediocre weed.

93
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,375
New York right now, a lot of media just everywhere.

94
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,961
There's a lot I mean, there's a lot of stuff that looks good, too.

95
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:15,004
Or it's like, Oh, that's good.

96
00:04:15,003 --> 00:04:17,673
Then you get to smoke it and it's the pretend ticker

97
00:04:17,673 --> 00:04:19,716
you used to call it pretend to go back in the day.

98
00:04:19,716 --> 00:04:20,091
So yeah.

99
00:04:20,091 --> 00:04:25,139
So how's weed changed over the past since you started smoking?

100
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:28,518
What were the evolutions that you see and where it is today?

101
00:04:28,517 --> 00:04:32,771
Well, when I first got into weed in Florida,

102
00:04:32,812 --> 00:04:35,815
you read about strains in high times, and if you were lucky,

103
00:04:35,815 --> 00:04:38,985
maybe your boy had something he said was some strain that he named water.

104
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:42,073
But in Florida, at least at the time, there was two types of weed.

105
00:04:42,072 --> 00:04:45,075
There was Kirby, which was basically didn't have seeds.

106
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,453
And then there was everything else, you know. Right.

107
00:04:47,452 --> 00:04:51,998
So anything that was like a proper strain growing out, right, without seeds

108
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,627
in the nineties in Florida was created and that was it.

109
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:58,088
Wow. I'd say in my life until about the year 2000,

110
00:04:58,297 --> 00:05:00,049
I only knew I was like,

111
00:05:00,048 --> 00:05:02,926
I didn't know exactly what strain I was smoking this, right?

112
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,679
Yeah. The next step in the evolution for me

113
00:05:04,678 --> 00:05:07,722
was when I got into the high crime scene and started working cannabis Cops

114
00:05:07,723 --> 00:05:10,725
as being guys like you and the people who were actually

115
00:05:10,725 --> 00:05:15,855
doing it, like doing breeds and seeing a hundred different strains of the cop and

116
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:16,899
the variety.

117
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:20,485
Oh, so much variety and and then over in Europe, it was like this

118
00:05:20,485 --> 00:05:21,736
big melting pot of people

119
00:05:21,737 --> 00:05:24,949
that had all kinds of different genetics that they were bringing in.

120
00:05:25,031 --> 00:05:27,617
Every year you see the span of business.

121
00:05:27,617 --> 00:05:31,122
Cannabis is still very much like that, you know, where you have

122
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:34,125
all these people coming in from all over and everybody.

123
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:34,959
So some people,

124
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,252
they wouldn't even talk to each other except for the fact that

125
00:05:37,252 --> 00:05:38,503
their passion about weed.

126
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,588
And that's the beauty of weed too.

127
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:40,213
It's like food.

128
00:05:40,213 --> 00:05:43,091
It's just another one of those things that really brings us together as people.

129
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:44,843
I mean, one of the interesting things going on

130
00:05:44,843 --> 00:05:49,348
and we now that all these laws are starting to peel back is, um,

131
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:52,852
we used to have little islands of people

132
00:05:52,851 --> 00:05:55,353
developing great strains and we were completely disconnected

133
00:05:55,353 --> 00:05:57,105
from each other because of the law or whatever.

134
00:05:57,105 --> 00:05:58,524
Yeah, occasionally you go to a festival

135
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,526
and meet somebody else like you or whatever,

136
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:04,362
but now it's like you can develop a strain in L.A.

137
00:06:04,362 --> 00:06:08,492
that within a year is a nationwide strain worldwide.

138
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,453
Like, yeah, it's crazy.

139
00:06:10,452 --> 00:06:12,746
It's all global now. It's so wild. Yeah.

140
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,622
And I think there's good and bad to that.

141
00:06:14,622 --> 00:06:19,836
Like it's kind of made the gene pool a little homogenous, in my opinion.

142
00:06:19,836 --> 00:06:22,798
More modest. And I would like to see it not completely homogenous, right?

143
00:06:22,798 --> 00:06:25,925
I mean, like, I agree and I think

144
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:26,968
we fall into these

145
00:06:26,968 --> 00:06:29,971
traps because that's, that's how I describe it as a trap.

146
00:06:29,971 --> 00:06:32,432
Because of hype, because of popularity.

147
00:06:32,432 --> 00:06:33,516
We get excited about something.

148
00:06:33,516 --> 00:06:37,187
They did it in Europe with Hayes, I always talk about how, you know,

149
00:06:37,187 --> 00:06:40,649
in the nineties, like they homogenize the genetics over there with Hayes.

150
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,651
People got excited about Hayes and the diversity went away

151
00:06:43,651 --> 00:06:47,113
and then gelato came along, you know, I mean, cookies,

152
00:06:47,197 --> 00:06:51,242
sherbet, gelato, you know, lemon cherry gelato.

153
00:06:51,242 --> 00:06:54,538
Then we have runts and all these things and it's like they're very much

154
00:06:54,538 --> 00:06:57,875
similar and people, you know, and then that's all people demand.

155
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,293
And then the other stuff is like,

156
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:03,463
No, I don't want any Jack Herrera or I don't want any survivors, you know?

157
00:07:03,463 --> 00:07:06,759
And but that's changing now to look at look at the scene overnight in New York.

158
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:11,138
So I feel like because there's so many people, we also have this

159
00:07:11,221 --> 00:07:14,599
these groups of people that are like, no, I want some survivors.

160
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,853
I want shit that doesn't have a ceiling where I can keep smoking and keep

161
00:07:17,853 --> 00:07:19,062
getting more. Hi.

162
00:07:19,062 --> 00:07:21,064
Scarcity breeds popularity.

163
00:07:21,064 --> 00:07:24,317
Like, yeah, like if you have a flow like people are Tiger runs right now,

164
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,487
take runs away for three or four years and that's going to be

165
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,823
the only thing anybody wants you totally.

166
00:07:28,822 --> 00:07:33,243
Yeah GDP Nobody wants to grow GDP though so yeah.

167
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:37,206
Why didn't anybody want to do well in my opinion the reason people on

168
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:40,793
I love GDP but nobody wants to grow it because it takes about 31 days

169
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:44,338
to veg it properly to get big enough buds so that when you harvest

170
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:48,300
you got chunky bud and says small buds so it doesn't get big.

171
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,302
It's not a big plant, it's a small short plant.

172
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:54,473
I knew a lot of sour diesel growers in New Yorker in New York

173
00:07:54,473 --> 00:07:58,394
that unless they can get $500 an ounce, it wasn't worth growing.

174
00:07:58,476 --> 00:08:00,520
Yeah, look at that price at that time, you know.

175
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:01,646
Right. Oh, yeah.

176
00:08:01,646 --> 00:08:04,149
The reason is just not a chopper, you know, I still love salads.

177
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:06,276
So everybody knows You don't.

178
00:08:06,276 --> 00:08:07,860
You don't See, It's so funny, though,

179
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,447
but I think a lot of people don't even know what sour diesel is.

180
00:08:10,447 --> 00:08:14,285
So there's some confusion in that strain that started

181
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:18,247
with the European diesel, which is not sour diesel at all.

182
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:18,997
The right thing

183
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:22,459
altogether like well, like Silver's New York City diesel completely.

184
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:27,088
It's it's great and it's grapefruit it's it's loud but it's not gas.

185
00:08:27,172 --> 00:08:28,424
It's not gas by any means.

186
00:08:28,423 --> 00:08:29,591
It's it's you know,

187
00:08:29,591 --> 00:08:32,093
I was actually just talking to Soma yesterday about that

188
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:35,681
because we're we're working on some tissue culture stuff

189
00:08:35,764 --> 00:08:36,974
with with the New York City

190
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:41,854
diesel is very different than diesel chem dog any of these, you know

191
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:45,607
and then we're talking about burnt rubber, the smell of burnt rubber

192
00:08:45,606 --> 00:08:49,360
as opposed to fresh grapefruit Further complicate that strain with

193
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,863
the popularity of the name.

194
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:55,451
It became like rappers were putting it in their lyrics and stuff like that.

195
00:08:55,533 --> 00:08:59,163
So anybody who is trying to hustle some, we wanted to call

196
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:02,457
whatever they had and sour diesel in the in New York would be so yeah

197
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:05,753
we went through a summer where everything in New York

198
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:10,049
that didn't have seeds was called the Summer Crazy, you know, Blue Dream.

199
00:09:10,173 --> 00:09:11,466
No one wants Blue Dream. We're calling it.

200
00:09:11,466 --> 00:09:15,303
So it is like, somebody told me once, if you love Blue Dream

201
00:09:15,303 --> 00:09:16,764
that you don't know anything about weed,

202
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:20,893
But if you hate Blue Dream, then you really don't know anything about

203
00:09:20,975 --> 00:09:22,519
that. Is 100% the truth.

204
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:24,229
I couldn't agree more,

205
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:28,400
you know, and I'm not the biggest fan, but I'm also I appreciate

206
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:32,028
the fact that it probably has the single best out of all the stuff

207
00:09:32,028 --> 00:09:35,908
out there as far as structure, as far as vigor,

208
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,824
consistency.

209
00:09:36,825 --> 00:09:41,455
I mean, you grow nice, huge monster buds and if you do it right, they're loud.

210
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,624
It's just maybe not the personal preference for a lot of people.

211
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,334
It's not what people want to smoke every day.

212
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,668
But Good Blue Dream is still good. Blue dream.

213
00:09:47,668 --> 00:09:50,672
I like it because it reminds me of

214
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:54,218
in New York, The only access to reliable clones

215
00:09:54,217 --> 00:09:58,262
that I had in the early 2000 was a guy that in Strawberry Coffee.

216
00:09:58,346 --> 00:10:00,765
Yeah. And the actual Carl Cushman Strawberry

217
00:10:00,765 --> 00:10:04,102
coffee is very similar to Blue Dream, I think in flavor profile.

218
00:10:04,311 --> 00:10:04,894
Mm hmm.

219
00:10:04,894 --> 00:10:07,855
Maybe not in tax policy or whatever, but totally when I smoke

220
00:10:07,855 --> 00:10:11,025
Blue Dream and it's a blue dream, it takes me back to smoking.

221
00:10:11,025 --> 00:10:13,611
And of course, from strawberry coffee in my head, you know, that's awesome.

222
00:10:13,611 --> 00:10:16,531
And that's the beauty of it also is all these flavor profiles are nostalgic.

223
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:19,951
I'm seeing stuff coming out now that people are seeing as original.

224
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:20,952
I'm like, Hmm, well,

225
00:10:20,952 --> 00:10:24,997
I was smoking that same flavor profile, you know, 25 years ago.

226
00:10:24,998 --> 00:10:29,253
We had some similar stuff, like the Juicy Fruit, like from back in the day,

227
00:10:29,336 --> 00:10:30,921
you know, And that wasn't even 25 years ago

228
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:34,383
that maybe that was a little less. But around that time,

229
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:35,466
we're seeing stuff that's

230
00:10:35,466 --> 00:10:38,636
very juicy fruit, like juicy fruit, bubble gum, you know what I mean?

231
00:10:38,636 --> 00:10:41,222
Like where you taste like you're chewing on the gum.

232
00:10:41,222 --> 00:10:44,642
Well, those that's not an original profile. And

233
00:10:44,725 --> 00:10:45,894
the lemons?

234
00:10:45,894 --> 00:10:47,395
I haven't even heard the slimming.

235
00:10:47,395 --> 00:10:49,021
Yeah, that's that name is great.

236
00:10:49,022 --> 00:10:51,358
When you say that's what comes on. Totally.

237
00:10:51,357 --> 00:10:53,568
Yeah. And I love those unique flavor profiles,

238
00:10:53,568 --> 00:10:56,822
but they remind you of something very distinct.

239
00:10:56,904 --> 00:10:59,908
You know, like Bubba Kush has this soapy ness to it, right?

240
00:10:59,908 --> 00:11:02,159
And every time I smell that slurping is,

241
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:04,913
I think of barbeques, but I also think of Irish Springs.

242
00:11:04,913 --> 00:11:06,831
So, you know, heavily.

243
00:11:06,831 --> 00:11:07,665
And I love that.

244
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:08,417
I love that about it.

245
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:12,796
And the really, you know, Bubba, I think some of the mass producers

246
00:11:12,796 --> 00:11:17,718
in large scale cultivators kind of fucked the Bubba market up, but real good.

247
00:11:17,717 --> 00:11:19,510
Bubba Kush is real good.

248
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:23,598
Bubba Kitchen is amazing, amazing flavor profile and it burns to the roots.

249
00:11:23,764 --> 00:11:26,726
Amazing. You've fire, it gets really high.

250
00:11:26,726 --> 00:11:30,230
I wouldn't say gets you super high, but the flavor so good it gets you lit.

251
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,188
Yeah. So, yeah.

252
00:11:31,188 --> 00:11:34,358
And back in the day, we had like, the Master Kush, the Bubba Kush.

253
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:38,655
The OG goes to a trend of more flavor profiles.

254
00:11:38,654 --> 00:11:39,990
And that's another thing that, like,

255
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,908
I'm kind of disappointed with the legal cannabis

256
00:11:41,908 --> 00:11:44,119
industry is everybody is just racing towards potency.

257
00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:48,706
Now. And yeah, above 24 or 25% who even can tell the difference?

258
00:11:48,706 --> 00:11:52,628
Honestly, it's like, I mean, I have some stuff that's 14%

259
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:55,547
my sour diesel, for example, I grew sour back in the day

260
00:11:55,547 --> 00:12:00,177
and we had our sour crosses that were testing like 14 to 16%

261
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:04,389
and those will smoke any of the 30% stuff that most people have today

262
00:12:04,472 --> 00:12:05,723
dragging the THC here.

263
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:08,685
Oh yeah, It'll get you some serious couch log.

264
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:13,565
So it's really interesting the recent debate on the word psychoactive

265
00:12:13,648 --> 00:12:16,942
versus psychotropic and technically

266
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:21,156
CBD is psychoactive because it passes the blood brain barrier.

267
00:12:21,155 --> 00:12:23,115
Is that the definition? The difference between.

268
00:12:23,115 --> 00:12:23,949
Uh huh, yes.

269
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,453
So psychotropic is the one that gives you the effect, right?

270
00:12:26,452 --> 00:12:28,704
Like the high in psychotropic.

271
00:12:28,705 --> 00:12:30,665
And I've always used psychoactive psychoactive.

272
00:12:30,664 --> 00:12:33,584
And just recently I was corrected

273
00:12:33,668 --> 00:12:34,586
that.

274
00:12:34,586 --> 00:12:36,797
And I think that's an interesting thing to share.

275
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:39,423
Yeah, it's it's all about those little details in life.

276
00:12:39,423 --> 00:12:40,549
And, you know,

277
00:12:40,549 --> 00:12:44,011
I also pronounce the incorrect a lot of times until somebody corrects me.

278
00:12:44,011 --> 00:12:49,517
So I was saying GTP instead of tea for a little bit.

279
00:12:49,558 --> 00:12:53,230
Yeah, that's yeah, seriously, what's wrong with you?

280
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,148
You know

281
00:12:55,148 --> 00:12:55,649
so. Yeah.

282
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:58,735
So let's, let's talk about high times for a little bit, you know,

283
00:12:58,818 --> 00:13:00,277
how did that start?

284
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:04,740
so I was working for a, I came up through college

285
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:08,328
with a network engineering

286
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,831
focus, you know, in the mid-nineties.

287
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:14,668
So like pre Google, you know, like the Internet

288
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,711
was still an infant, but I knew it.

289
00:13:16,711 --> 00:13:19,089
QML Yeah, Excel and things like that.

290
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:22,092
So I was making a lot of really good money doing temp jobs

291
00:13:22,091 --> 00:13:26,679
in, in Manhattan, in New York and I was also

292
00:13:26,763 --> 00:13:27,389
like, I

293
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:30,392
would take a temp job, find the two or three

294
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:34,229
people in this office and smoke weed like I do in the week that I was there.

295
00:13:34,312 --> 00:13:37,106
And now I have a new client, so I like it all.

296
00:13:37,106 --> 00:13:38,315
Duct tape killed in my life.

297
00:13:38,316 --> 00:13:40,317
Really Well at the time, right,

298
00:13:40,317 --> 00:13:43,321
I one of these temp jobs finally turning to a job with a

299
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:47,324
a company that was building Ford Motor Companies internal website

300
00:13:47,408 --> 00:13:50,745
and I was I was managing a pool of programmers

301
00:13:50,828 --> 00:13:54,875
and then 911 happened and we were in Lower Manhattan, our office building.

302
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:55,625
So we closed.

303
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,210
The company never reopened

304
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,336
and we all kind of scattered, but we remained friends

305
00:13:59,336 --> 00:14:02,340
and one of the guys that I used to manage got the job at High times.

306
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,758
This guy, Jeff Westin.

307
00:14:03,758 --> 00:14:07,220
I don't know if you're out there, Jeff. I love him very much.

308
00:14:07,303 --> 00:14:07,887
When he got

309
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:10,932
the job, everybody at the company we worked for looked at me.

310
00:14:10,932 --> 00:14:11,975
Nobody congratulated him.

311
00:14:11,975 --> 00:14:13,268
They all looked at me to figure out how I

312
00:14:13,268 --> 00:14:16,354
that was my job because I was God's only stoner in that place.

313
00:14:16,354 --> 00:14:19,232
I was selling everybody from the owner down to the receptionist.

314
00:14:19,231 --> 00:14:20,608
We ran the place, you know.

315
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:21,151
Right.

316
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:24,820
And Jeff lived in high times for about two years,

317
00:14:24,946 --> 00:14:27,574
got a job as the lead programmer for The Onion,

318
00:14:27,573 --> 00:14:30,492
and he dropped my reference and that was it.

319
00:14:30,493 --> 00:14:33,163
I got my dream job. The job I always bought for. Totally.

320
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,538
I couldn't believe it, man.

321
00:14:34,538 --> 00:14:37,500
It was like a life changing experience. I bet.

322
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,000
I bet you're

323
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,795
just so stoked to go to work every day just to go and take the interview.

324
00:14:41,796 --> 00:14:43,298
I'm going to go walk into High Times office

325
00:14:43,298 --> 00:14:45,216
and talk to Michael Kennedy over high times?

326
00:14:45,216 --> 00:14:47,719
Yeah, that's a trip job. I was almost enough for me, man.

327
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:50,430
I was like, I was pretty psyched. Yeah.

328
00:14:50,513 --> 00:14:53,557
I went into the interview and Michael Kennedy, you know, rest in peace.

329
00:14:53,557 --> 00:14:56,811
Michael's kind of an intimidating guy, like a serious, serious,

330
00:14:57,062 --> 00:15:00,523
very serious player in counterculture history.

331
00:15:00,523 --> 00:15:03,817
Like, Yeah, broke business, too, you know, it's.

332
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,822
Yeah, gangster at every level, like from the professional to the street

333
00:15:07,822 --> 00:15:08,990
level, right?

334
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,825
And I go and I was nervous as hell, man.

335
00:15:10,825 --> 00:15:13,578
I went in there and he didn't even read my resume.

336
00:15:13,577 --> 00:15:15,829
He looks at it, he's like, coffee. That's my last name.

337
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,791
Yeah, we have a house in Ireland.

338
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,417
Our neighbors are coffee and they're good people.

339
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:21,418
I think you're going to do fine here.

340
00:15:21,418 --> 00:15:23,545
Oh, that's great.

341
00:15:23,546 --> 00:15:24,506
Amazing.

342
00:15:24,505 --> 00:15:25,130
And that was that.

343
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:28,009
12 years later, man. Yeah.

344
00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:29,009
So what did you do there?

345
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:32,221
You did the same thing the whole time you were there. Or

346
00:15:32,304 --> 00:15:34,515
in 2005 as the

347
00:15:34,515 --> 00:15:38,394
Director of Technology and Director of technology at High Times

348
00:15:38,394 --> 00:15:41,939
means that anything that plugs into an electrical outlet is my responsibility.

349
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,191
From the toaster.

350
00:15:43,191 --> 00:15:45,692
Yeah. Website to the fax machine. You like that? Yeah.

351
00:15:45,692 --> 00:15:48,321
We were 15 person company, so. Right.

352
00:15:48,321 --> 00:15:51,032
Well, yeah, you did a lot of coordinating too like

353
00:15:51,032 --> 00:15:56,579
for events then as it I'm a paperwork and organization nerd that's really like

354
00:15:56,663 --> 00:16:00,457
I mean I have this work style that I call Alpha.

355
00:16:00,457 --> 00:16:01,668
I'm going to write a book about this one day.

356
00:16:01,668 --> 00:16:04,671
I call Alpha Lazy.

357
00:16:04,796 --> 00:16:09,843
I cannot accept low level output like I want to do big things.

358
00:16:09,926 --> 00:16:12,679
It also deeply lazy, you know?

359
00:16:12,678 --> 00:16:14,471
So there's a conflict inside of me all the time,

360
00:16:14,471 --> 00:16:17,516
and the way I make it work for me is I go into a place

361
00:16:17,517 --> 00:16:20,979
I find the hardest thing that this business is dealing with.

362
00:16:21,062 --> 00:16:25,358
I take it on and I do it for five or six months to figure out ways to make it easy.

363
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:30,613
And then in six months my alpha leasing techniques have got me

364
00:16:30,697 --> 00:16:33,825
doing the hardest thing in this company without really putting any effort.

365
00:16:33,825 --> 00:16:37,078
Everybody thinks I'm a dynamo and I'm just maximum efficiency, you know?

366
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,580
Maximum efficiency, Yep.

367
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:43,168
So I was able to employ alpha lazy

368
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:47,046
in a really good way in high times because they were in chaos.

369
00:16:47,046 --> 00:16:48,464
Like organizational chaos.

370
00:16:48,464 --> 00:16:53,344
Yeah, they were just starting us cards and things like that.

371
00:16:53,552 --> 00:16:56,346
We were going from the minor leagues to the big leagues right when I got hired.

372
00:16:56,346 --> 00:16:58,473
Right. And they needed major organizational help.

373
00:16:58,474 --> 00:17:00,310
And that's what I do. That's my forte.

374
00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:02,060
So it's awesome.

375
00:17:02,061 --> 00:17:03,437
Match Made in Heaven. It was perfect.

376
00:17:03,437 --> 00:17:04,855
Yeah, I love them and they love me.

377
00:17:04,855 --> 00:17:06,900
And it worked out great for 12 years.

378
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,817
Yeah, Yeah. The perfect storm.

379
00:17:08,817 --> 00:17:09,318
I was great.

380
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:13,489
We did big things together, was high times, did big things.

381
00:17:13,573 --> 00:17:16,367
You know, I think some of the younger people might not know exactly

382
00:17:16,366 --> 00:17:19,870
like what went down in high times, but like we started doing cannabis crops

383
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:23,750
when changing the game, they would say to Europe to do a cannabis cup,

384
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,877
and there was no guarantee that we were all going to end up in a European prison.

385
00:17:26,961 --> 00:17:28,671
Yeah, like there was no God like.

386
00:17:28,671 --> 00:17:29,672
And we knew this going in.

387
00:17:29,672 --> 00:17:32,467
Like that was part of what made us a special crew, I think.

388
00:17:32,467 --> 00:17:34,052
Yeah. And people did get arrested.

389
00:17:34,051 --> 00:17:35,385
Mila got arrested one time.

390
00:17:35,385 --> 00:17:37,971
You know, it's like you make an omelet, you break some eggs.

391
00:17:37,971 --> 00:17:39,348
Yeah, Yeah, totally.

392
00:17:39,348 --> 00:17:40,307
I remember when they arrested

393
00:17:40,307 --> 00:17:44,186
Mila that one year, and it's in Oregon, bailed her out of jail.

394
00:17:44,269 --> 00:17:46,605
But, like, they arrested Mila out of all people.

395
00:17:46,605 --> 00:17:48,523
Yeah, she. She was.

396
00:17:48,523 --> 00:17:50,108
Yeah. She's tough as nails, though.

397
00:17:50,108 --> 00:17:52,861
Yeah, she was. She was ready for it, you know? Well, she was asking.

398
00:17:52,862 --> 00:17:56,074
We are when that happened we, we had just picked,

399
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:58,368
we used to do the Cannabis Cup at the Powers of Amsterdam,

400
00:17:58,367 --> 00:18:01,244
which was like a nightclub right. In the power zone, its doors.

401
00:18:01,244 --> 00:18:06,416
And we found a new venue which was much fancier, much nicer. And

402
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,961
outside of the city limits, right

403
00:18:08,961 --> 00:18:12,173
to be a problem because the local police didn't know how to deal with this.

404
00:18:12,256 --> 00:18:15,968
The radius, you know, totally with an army full of jackboots

405
00:18:15,968 --> 00:18:20,181
and straight like patios all down our way.

406
00:18:20,181 --> 00:18:21,723
And oh, I remember.

407
00:18:21,723 --> 00:18:23,433
I remember it was pretty great. Honestly.

408
00:18:23,433 --> 00:18:26,436
Turn out to be one of the best cops. Like that was a lot of good memories.

409
00:18:26,436 --> 00:18:27,229
Yeah. Yeah.

410
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:30,482
Mila is marching around going from cop to cop asking,

411
00:18:30,482 --> 00:18:31,858
How much were you in my order?

412
00:18:31,858 --> 00:18:33,735
I think 300 grams was what the answer was.

413
00:18:33,736 --> 00:18:34,612
Maybe 600 grams.

414
00:18:34,612 --> 00:18:36,698
And she's like, look, 31 grams.

415
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:39,325
Take her to jail, right? Yeah.

416
00:18:39,325 --> 00:18:41,035
Classic Vila.

417
00:18:41,035 --> 00:18:42,077
I want to go to jail.

418
00:18:42,077 --> 00:18:43,954
Yeah, and she did.

419
00:18:43,954 --> 00:18:45,997
And she did.

420
00:18:45,998 --> 00:18:46,833
Yeah. Good times.

421
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,334
The jail old man.

422
00:18:48,334 --> 00:18:50,461
It's a different experience over there for sure.

423
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:52,797
I stayed in hotel her worse than that.

424
00:18:52,797 --> 00:18:54,048
She also like.

425
00:18:54,048 --> 00:18:56,467
Yeah. so has been in the hospital.

426
00:18:56,467 --> 00:18:57,176
I don't know if you heard.

427
00:18:57,175 --> 00:19:01,556
Yeah, I just talked to him today so some will know

428
00:19:01,556 --> 00:19:03,057
which episode got, you know, he.

429
00:19:03,057 --> 00:19:04,683
But he's out of jail.

430
00:19:04,683 --> 00:19:05,851
I'm in the hospital

431
00:19:05,852 --> 00:19:07,937
which is similar for so because he's like smoking

432
00:19:07,936 --> 00:19:10,981
and they don't like smoking in hospitals I'm sure he doesn't like being

433
00:19:10,981 --> 00:19:14,067
institutionalized in in any way, shape or form.

434
00:19:14,067 --> 00:19:17,821
So That was when we were going to Amsterdam,

435
00:19:17,904 --> 00:19:19,197
I would be

436
00:19:19,198 --> 00:19:21,117
they would send three of us early, like a week early,

437
00:19:21,116 --> 00:19:23,326
just to start getting things together, collect money

438
00:19:23,326 --> 00:19:25,078
for a couple of years, who wants money and things like that.

439
00:19:25,078 --> 00:19:27,414
And someone was always our first out because he would pay.

440
00:19:27,414 --> 00:19:31,668
First of all, he would buy a giant ass was right to pay for all of it in cash.

441
00:19:31,751 --> 00:19:34,504
So we go there, go to someone's house.

442
00:19:34,505 --> 00:19:36,799
I'd have to take the next day off because if you ever go to someone's

443
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:38,843
house, it's not like you can do anything tomorrow.

444
00:19:38,843 --> 00:19:40,845
And it's true.

445
00:19:40,845 --> 00:19:42,054
Like a sack for money.

446
00:19:42,054 --> 00:19:44,432
Just to get everything going right?

447
00:19:44,432 --> 00:19:46,099
Yeah. And someone loves smoking.

448
00:19:46,099 --> 00:19:47,267
Oh, yeah. So, yeah.

449
00:19:47,268 --> 00:19:49,729
Love smoking hash, loves smoking, everything.

450
00:19:49,729 --> 00:19:51,605
So you like hash as well.

451
00:19:51,605 --> 00:19:54,817
I used to be a huge diver. Yeah.

452
00:19:54,901 --> 00:19:58,278
In fact, for maybe two years or so, I barely smoke flowers.

453
00:19:58,278 --> 00:19:58,988
All I did was that.

454
00:19:58,988 --> 00:20:04,576
But since I moved to California, I've kind of gone back to flowers.

455
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,120
There's such good flower out here.

456
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:07,370
There is so much variety.

457
00:20:07,371 --> 00:20:11,167
And like, we were indoor growers in New York forever.

458
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,251
You know, we had grown in closets, basements,

459
00:20:13,251 --> 00:20:16,963
attics, you name it, like and I, but I never was able to grow a full sun.

460
00:20:17,048 --> 00:20:20,550
And we moved out here and I'm in Vallejo and climate is beautiful, man.

461
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,093
I don't know if you guys know much about it,

462
00:20:22,094 --> 00:20:25,681
but it's like sunny and 75 degrees, about 300 days a year, you know?

463
00:20:25,765 --> 00:20:26,307
Yeah.

464
00:20:26,307 --> 00:20:30,603
So we're full time growers now and I'm loving every minute that I'm the cover.

465
00:20:30,603 --> 00:20:32,395
Like I used to think Express was the answer.

466
00:20:32,395 --> 00:20:34,022
And that's not right, guys.

467
00:20:34,022 --> 00:20:36,024
Full Sun is the fucking answer.

468
00:20:36,025 --> 00:20:36,359
Yeah.

469
00:20:36,358 --> 00:20:39,028
Vallejo has changed so much since the Romper Room gang.

470
00:20:39,028 --> 00:20:43,199
You know, like, like back in the day, Mac, Dre and, you know, E-40, you know,

471
00:20:43,199 --> 00:20:45,993
rapping about that stuff in Vallejo,

472
00:20:45,992 --> 00:20:48,078
for better or worse, a lot of the bears changed,

473
00:20:48,078 --> 00:20:50,498
but I think Vallejo especially is cleaned up quite a bit.

474
00:20:50,498 --> 00:20:52,458
It's a wild place now.

475
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:56,504
It's still a little crazy, but I thought I knew what a bad neighborhood was

476
00:20:56,503 --> 00:21:00,465
and yet but I personally, like I thrive in a bad neighborhood,

477
00:21:00,465 --> 00:21:01,466
so I kind of love it there.

478
00:21:01,467 --> 00:21:04,845
Yeah, I know how to operate in a in a bad spot.

479
00:21:04,971 --> 00:21:07,306
Yeah. You got to keep your head on swivel.

480
00:21:07,306 --> 00:21:09,933
You don't jump out of a car in a parking lot.

481
00:21:10,017 --> 00:21:11,268
I grew up in Brooklyn, like, I know.

482
00:21:11,268 --> 00:21:13,729
I know how to do it. So, yeah, awareness.

483
00:21:13,729 --> 00:21:14,896
But that's just about life too.

484
00:21:14,896 --> 00:21:16,856
Being aware of your situation.

485
00:21:16,856 --> 00:21:17,774
On the bright side,

486
00:21:17,775 --> 00:21:20,277
you know all that we're done talking about negative shooting.

487
00:21:20,277 --> 00:21:22,113
Vallejo. Vallejo is a wonderful place.

488
00:21:22,113 --> 00:21:25,533
It's a beautiful city with culture and heritage

489
00:21:25,532 --> 00:21:29,244
and a very that goes to San Francisco and like it's.

490
00:21:29,327 --> 00:21:32,248
Yeah, and there's access, there's restaurants, there's you know

491
00:21:32,248 --> 00:21:36,961
Benesch is right there The San Francisco's close Yeah for sure.

492
00:21:37,044 --> 00:21:39,463
Yeah I mean I think there's so many people move in there too.

493
00:21:39,462 --> 00:21:42,549
It's like the property values went up like crazy.

494
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:46,010
I didn't think I could ever buy a house like I was a an apartment dweller.

495
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:47,846
I thought I was a rental guy for the rest of my life.

496
00:21:47,846 --> 00:21:50,266
And we moved to play on water for something nice.

497
00:21:50,266 --> 00:21:52,560
Could have never happened if it wasn't for

498
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,395
you got in at the right time too, because now it's crazy.

499
00:21:55,395 --> 00:21:57,772
It's almost doubled in value since since we bought it.

500
00:21:57,772 --> 00:21:59,274
The pandemic.

501
00:21:59,275 --> 00:22:00,109
Crazy. Yeah.

502
00:22:00,108 --> 00:22:01,901
And there's no houses available. Really. Like the.

503
00:22:01,902 --> 00:22:02,819
Yeah, the

504
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:06,197
the amount of properties available in California in general is just

505
00:22:06,198 --> 00:22:08,743
really difficult. So we got

506
00:22:08,826 --> 00:22:11,453
a nice sized backyard and I was a little bit afraid that

507
00:22:11,453 --> 00:22:15,081
I would have trouble getting robberies or maybe I'd piss off the neighbors.

508
00:22:15,165 --> 00:22:16,708
I'm a New Yorker, man, you know, I don't know

509
00:22:16,709 --> 00:22:19,253
what California people are like growing weed next to, right?

510
00:22:19,252 --> 00:22:21,713
Apparently nobody gives a shit in Vallejo.

511
00:22:21,713 --> 00:22:24,008
I mean, most most places they don't give a shit.

512
00:22:24,008 --> 00:22:28,095
My my neighbors, like every fence that we share, a fence with.

513
00:22:28,261 --> 00:22:29,304
Yeah, yeah.

514
00:22:29,305 --> 00:22:32,057
And I noticed, like, some of them were just throwing

515
00:22:32,057 --> 00:22:33,726
seeds in the dirty living to do whatever.

516
00:22:33,726 --> 00:22:36,604
And they were like 12 foot tall males out in my backyard.

517
00:22:36,604 --> 00:22:37,270
Oh, God.

518
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:40,482
So I bought a horse about this grove.

519
00:22:40,482 --> 00:22:42,902
I was swear to God, this is the tree.

520
00:22:42,902 --> 00:22:44,194
And I gave it to all of my neighbors

521
00:22:44,194 --> 00:22:46,821
with a butterball who was I know they're growing weed.

522
00:22:46,821 --> 00:22:47,780
And I was like,

523
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,615
you know, read this book

524
00:22:48,615 --> 00:22:50,658
and let me tell you, these guys were so like,

525
00:22:50,659 --> 00:22:55,873
you should have given them Danny Daniels book,

526
00:22:55,914 --> 00:22:58,166
But there are a bunch of Chicano guys.

527
00:22:58,166 --> 00:22:59,459
Yeah, yeah.

528
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,045
Or, Hey, everybody loves Hauge.

529
00:23:01,045 --> 00:23:03,756
Yeah, Tell him he's Canadian.

530
00:23:03,756 --> 00:23:04,882
That's great.

531
00:23:04,882 --> 00:23:06,133
Classic.

532
00:23:06,133 --> 00:23:08,510
in the Bay Area, everyone goes everywhere. There's lots of people.

533
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,637
I mean, most neighborhoods, you smell it. Yeah.

534
00:23:10,637 --> 00:23:12,180
And it's also legal.

535
00:23:12,181 --> 00:23:15,643
It's legal to grow in most cities, I think in most areas in the Bay Area.

536
00:23:15,683 --> 00:23:16,393
Yeah.

537
00:23:16,393 --> 00:23:21,356
Well, they cannot stop you in California from going indoors Some counties, right?

538
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,191
Outdoor.

539
00:23:22,191 --> 00:23:24,652
Yeah. Yeah, I think Concord is like that.

540
00:23:24,652 --> 00:23:26,362
They don't want you growing outdoors.

541
00:23:26,362 --> 00:23:27,321
So long right there.

542
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,865
Yeah, I can't be outdoors but everybody totally.

543
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:31,283
Yeah.

544
00:23:31,282 --> 00:23:32,867
They don't even want to mess with that in Oakland

545
00:23:32,867 --> 00:23:34,702
because they know nobody's going to come in.

546
00:23:34,702 --> 00:23:36,622
Right? Seriously?

547
00:23:36,622 --> 00:23:39,750
Not unless they're going to buy some weed from you.

548
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:40,292
But yeah.

549
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:46,256
So high times and then the cups and I mean, I think that was like a big

550
00:23:46,339 --> 00:23:49,384
like a big thing that happened 12 years ago

551
00:23:49,384 --> 00:23:51,220
when you started doing American Cups. Yeah.

552
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:56,267
Like you went from doing one cup a year for four to not 20 years, but for like 15.

553
00:23:56,392 --> 00:23:58,477
It was like, yeah, have a fun party,

554
00:23:58,477 --> 00:24:02,314
right type stuff, attitude towards cups to a full on business.

555
00:24:02,314 --> 00:24:05,276
Yeah. Six a year. 100,000 people per cup.

556
00:24:05,276 --> 00:24:05,609
Oh yeah.

557
00:24:05,608 --> 00:24:09,195
Multimillion dollar operation and Yeah crazy

558
00:24:09,195 --> 00:24:12,490
and like and it was radio up here.

559
00:24:12,574 --> 00:24:13,575
It was still a hurricane.

560
00:24:13,575 --> 00:24:15,995
It was and it was still like herding cats for you guys

561
00:24:15,994 --> 00:24:18,871
and dealing with stoners and people that think they want to

562
00:24:18,872 --> 00:24:22,292
do business and I mean, it was just crazy from the outside looking in.

563
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:23,584
I think a lot of people thought High Times

564
00:24:23,585 --> 00:24:27,338
was like 100 person corporations and totally like 20 people in a room.

565
00:24:27,423 --> 00:24:29,883
Yeah, yeah. No, but it did feel like that.

566
00:24:29,883 --> 00:24:34,304
I mean, to organize an event where you have that many people going,

567
00:24:34,346 --> 00:24:37,682
it takes a lot of organization and you're going to make mistakes,

568
00:24:37,849 --> 00:24:38,850
you know, a ton of mistakes.

569
00:24:38,851 --> 00:24:42,146
But I was the thing I was proud of is like we never took a step backwards.

570
00:24:42,145 --> 00:24:44,397
Every couple is better than the last one the whole time I was there. Right.

571
00:24:44,397 --> 00:24:46,107
I'm very proud of that record.

572
00:24:46,107 --> 00:24:48,359
We made a ton of mistakes. We fucked up all the time.

573
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:49,819
Yeah, but that's part of life.

574
00:24:49,819 --> 00:24:50,361
That's part of life.

575
00:24:50,362 --> 00:24:51,904
That's part of growing to making mistakes,

576
00:24:51,904 --> 00:24:53,531
learning from your mistakes, correcting them.

577
00:24:53,531 --> 00:24:57,785
So the next crop or the next event can be better.

578
00:24:57,786 --> 00:24:59,621
This is how progress happens. We make mistakes.

579
00:24:59,621 --> 00:25:02,458
We learn from our mistakes. I talk about that a lot on my show.

580
00:25:02,458 --> 00:25:05,919
I think it's a it's a great thing that mistakes are a valuable teacher.

581
00:25:06,086 --> 00:25:08,463
Yeah. And having

582
00:25:08,547 --> 00:25:11,924
a small enough ego to recognize that like to get better at something.

583
00:25:11,924 --> 00:25:15,887
Like you don't just learn how to play the guitar bad ass just right.

584
00:25:16,137 --> 00:25:18,807
It takes a lot of time and repetition, you know what I mean?

585
00:25:18,807 --> 00:25:22,853
You learn how you make mistakes and you have to have a small enough ego

586
00:25:22,853 --> 00:25:25,105
to just keep practicing and practicing. Even if you suck.

587
00:25:25,105 --> 00:25:28,400
Everybody sucks in the beginning, it whatever it is with not growing

588
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,778
because I think some people just get it right out the gate and crush,

589
00:25:31,862 --> 00:25:33,906
you know, especially women, women cultivators.

590
00:25:33,905 --> 00:25:34,822
For whatever reason.

591
00:25:34,823 --> 00:25:39,870
I feel like they just tend to do better right out of the gate than men do.

592
00:25:39,952 --> 00:25:42,955
Not a sexist remark or anything like that, but I think there's

593
00:25:42,955 --> 00:25:48,002
a level of attention to detail on the female gender

594
00:25:48,086 --> 00:25:49,671
that I don't think that we are.

595
00:25:49,671 --> 00:25:50,463
Yeah, yeah.

596
00:25:50,463 --> 00:25:53,383
And it's something it's so individual. I mean, that's just generalizing.

597
00:25:53,383 --> 00:25:55,928
I know some people, some of my friends just right out of the gate.

598
00:25:55,928 --> 00:25:59,473
I mean, I don't think right out the gate I was the best at growing

599
00:25:59,472 --> 00:26:03,559
or even making seeds like I learned in the book.

600
00:26:03,602 --> 00:26:08,774
I yeah, my plans to make I did every stupidity thing as a young girl.

601
00:26:08,856 --> 00:26:12,610
Yeah, well, I mean, I remember I was excited to get a couple thousand

602
00:26:12,611 --> 00:26:16,907
seeds per light and now I can get 45 to 50000 seeds for 4x4.

603
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:19,326
And yeah, I mean it's like, but that's the whole thing.

604
00:26:19,326 --> 00:26:22,788
But you're excited that you got some but not realizing what the potential was.

605
00:26:22,788 --> 00:26:27,125
And now that I see the potential of 45 that I'm like 50,000, no problem.

606
00:26:27,209 --> 00:26:28,000
quality too.

607
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,377
Like if you've,

608
00:26:29,377 --> 00:26:29,919
if you've never

609
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,673
experienced quality at the level, there's always levels to this stuff.

610
00:26:33,757 --> 00:26:37,219
And so most people are exposed to this level, they get something a little better.

611
00:26:37,219 --> 00:26:38,929
They think that's, that's amazing.

612
00:26:38,929 --> 00:26:42,932
But if you show them this, then it's like, Oh, wow, amazing.

613
00:26:43,016 --> 00:26:44,183
That's kind of how I felt.

614
00:26:44,183 --> 00:26:46,144
Like, I'll go back to what I said earlier.

615
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:48,355
The pinnacle of cannabis branding to me.

616
00:26:48,355 --> 00:26:50,315
Yeah. Can you one.

617
00:26:50,315 --> 00:26:54,278
Yeah, Like there's been things that are almost as good as anything better.

618
00:26:54,361 --> 00:26:56,780
And the funny thing is, is it was a bad seed.

619
00:26:56,779 --> 00:26:59,657
It was a mistake. Yeah, well, I don't know.

620
00:26:59,657 --> 00:27:01,117
I mean, it was God's.

621
00:27:01,117 --> 00:27:03,202
Yeah. No, no, no, no.

622
00:27:03,202 --> 00:27:06,205
Greg and his cut of very lucky.

623
00:27:06,289 --> 00:27:08,000
Yeah. Here we are.

624
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,667
Popped a bunch of them and,

625
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:13,129
you know, shout out to the whole Kim dog crew, you know, all those guys.

626
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:13,964
Yeah.

627
00:27:13,963 --> 00:27:18,259
We had skunked VA on a while back and he's, he's amazing guy.

628
00:27:18,259 --> 00:27:20,554
But you know Mike P but all these guys.

629
00:27:20,554 --> 00:27:22,096
GS Amazing.

630
00:27:22,096 --> 00:27:23,514
You know, I think.

631
00:27:23,515 --> 00:27:27,060
JJ Yeah, he's got a seed thing coming out now too wild.

632
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:31,315
Some sour diesel seeds have can meet him and give him cash to get him You can't buy

633
00:27:31,315 --> 00:27:34,692
one hilarious face and Mike

634
00:27:34,776 --> 00:27:38,739
right He's going to pick and choose who he sells to.

635
00:27:38,821 --> 00:27:39,447
Yes our

636
00:27:39,448 --> 00:27:42,451
diesel sees that's an interesting one because

637
00:27:42,616 --> 00:27:47,330
I think JJ from Top Dog has actually done a really good job with his back crossing.

638
00:27:47,372 --> 00:27:48,832
have you popped any of those?

639
00:27:48,832 --> 00:27:52,002
I have smoked some that other people have grown to show me how good they are

640
00:27:52,001 --> 00:27:55,547
because I struggled making, you know, I mean, we did a lot of back

641
00:27:55,547 --> 00:27:58,633
crossings with sour diesel to try and that was a what he's doing

642
00:27:58,633 --> 00:28:02,721
is what I was trying to do 15 years ago, and he's actually done it a lot better.

643
00:28:02,721 --> 00:28:05,432
I think he started from a better place than we did.

644
00:28:05,432 --> 00:28:08,184
We started with the spicy jack

645
00:28:08,184 --> 00:28:11,605
times, sour diesel or spice, but we tried to recreate it.

646
00:28:11,688 --> 00:28:15,817
I wanted to create seeds of sour diesel and so we like its base

647
00:28:15,817 --> 00:28:19,278
base elements or through we have we have sour diesel.

648
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:21,573
Basically we had the real sour diesel.

649
00:28:21,573 --> 00:28:23,158
The our crew had the real sour diesel.

650
00:28:23,157 --> 00:28:26,744
The Cam's all the kinks come since all that stuff.

651
00:28:26,827 --> 00:28:29,122
But I wanted sour diesel seeds but I wanted to sell

652
00:28:29,122 --> 00:28:32,625
sour diesel seeds so everybody in the world could enjoy it.

653
00:28:32,709 --> 00:28:36,296
And it was really difficult because we crossed

654
00:28:36,296 --> 00:28:39,924
it was a spicy jack cross that my partners had made.

655
00:28:40,008 --> 00:28:43,970
And then basically we took that and basically put it back on the sour

656
00:28:44,054 --> 00:28:47,057
and then put it back on the sour again to find sour diesel.

657
00:28:47,182 --> 00:28:50,352
And the spicy jack wasn't like Jack career that everybody knows.

658
00:28:50,352 --> 00:28:53,355
This was a funky like pungent Jack didn't have that

659
00:28:53,355 --> 00:28:56,607
you're okay change to it or not

660
00:28:56,691 --> 00:29:01,238
so so some of them did but most of them weren't like that hazy Tropeano clean.

661
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:02,655
This was more like funky

662
00:29:02,655 --> 00:29:05,575
and it went really well with it, but it was its own unique thing.

663
00:29:05,575 --> 00:29:08,577
It wasn't sour diesel even through the back crosses.

664
00:29:08,577 --> 00:29:12,581
And I think my buddy Micah that I've talked about on the show

665
00:29:12,624 --> 00:29:14,291
took that four times back.

666
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:16,293
And then so we had four back crosses

667
00:29:16,294 --> 00:29:19,172
and at that point we, we didn't work on it anymore.

668
00:29:19,172 --> 00:29:21,967
It was, it was cool. It was its own thing.

669
00:29:21,967 --> 00:29:23,093
There was a 70 sour.

670
00:29:23,093 --> 00:29:26,012
And if people remember the 70 sour that we did

671
00:29:26,096 --> 00:29:28,222
that Mike and I did together.

672
00:29:28,222 --> 00:29:29,682
But it was it was unique.

673
00:29:29,682 --> 00:29:31,768
It was its own thing, but it wasn't sour diesel.

674
00:29:31,768 --> 00:29:34,770
And then we went over to Europe and mess with some Europeans

675
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:37,731
that were like crossing it with White Widow.

676
00:29:37,731 --> 00:29:40,442
And so we had to cut over there doing some White Widow crosses.

677
00:29:40,442 --> 00:29:43,529
And that's definitely not the right direction the way JJ did.

678
00:29:43,529 --> 00:29:44,154
It was good.

679
00:29:44,154 --> 00:29:47,325
I think there's a couple other people that have done it as well,

680
00:29:47,325 --> 00:29:51,371
but JJ is really going through going for that nose and it's very difficult,

681
00:29:51,453 --> 00:29:54,749
more difficult than what most people think because it's not always

682
00:29:54,749 --> 00:29:57,961
a straight, straight and forward as it looks like on paper.

683
00:29:57,961 --> 00:30:01,839
On paper it looks like, Oh, you do this, this and this, and you get this.

684
00:30:01,923 --> 00:30:05,509
But there's a lot of things that can happen in that time period

685
00:30:05,719 --> 00:30:10,599
where you get different things, quantum mechanics and play and you get so much.

686
00:30:10,682 --> 00:30:14,019
Yeah, I feel like we have this real interesting

687
00:30:14,019 --> 00:30:18,606
tie to cannabis that, you know, it makes it makes us feel whole.

688
00:30:18,606 --> 00:30:22,109
Some of us, not maybe not everybody, but I feel whole from cannabis.

689
00:30:22,192 --> 00:30:24,403
I get that I feel like it completes me to a degree.

690
00:30:24,403 --> 00:30:25,989
Like I wouldn't be doing anything.

691
00:30:25,989 --> 00:30:28,533
I feel like this is where I belong in life.

692
00:30:28,615 --> 00:30:30,160
You know, I agree.

693
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,619
And I like

694
00:30:31,618 --> 00:30:34,371
cannabis, like I have a serious A.D.D.

695
00:30:34,372 --> 00:30:35,414
issue, I think.

696
00:30:35,414 --> 00:30:36,750
Yeah, A.D.D.

697
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:39,001
issue from when I was a child and cannabis fixes.

698
00:30:39,001 --> 00:30:40,169
And that's the reason it's undiagnosed

699
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:42,589
because I never had to go further than cannabis, right?

700
00:30:42,588 --> 00:30:43,339
Totally.

701
00:30:43,339 --> 00:30:44,965
Well, until the balance is. Yeah, right.

702
00:30:44,965 --> 00:30:47,259
Like it does the same thing for me.

703
00:30:47,259 --> 00:30:50,512
I mean, I grew up in a weed house to my parents are basically just like

704
00:30:50,512 --> 00:30:53,515
I am like they my dad was singing in the seventies and stuff.

705
00:30:53,682 --> 00:30:55,602
Yeah, they smoked weed in front of us.

706
00:30:55,602 --> 00:30:57,019
Like a lot of parents drink water

707
00:30:57,019 --> 00:30:58,896
in front of their kids, you know, like it was not even a thing.

708
00:30:58,896 --> 00:31:01,191
Like, it wasn't even, like, hide it.

709
00:31:01,191 --> 00:31:02,525
Yeah, right.

710
00:31:02,525 --> 00:31:05,445
So for me, it's like you're on cannabis and dealing with

711
00:31:05,444 --> 00:31:08,530
cannabis is as normal as talking to my mom or something.

712
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:09,740
Yeah. Yeah.

713
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,451
I would feel weird if it wasn't in my life.

714
00:31:11,451 --> 00:31:15,288
Yeah, you. It's. It's one of those interesting things.

715
00:31:15,372 --> 00:31:16,163
Psychedelics, too.

716
00:31:16,163 --> 00:31:17,664
Like, I, you know, I struggle,

717
00:31:17,664 --> 00:31:20,335
I love psychedelics, but struggle to embrace it

718
00:31:20,335 --> 00:31:22,377
as easily as I can embrace cannabis. Yeah.

719
00:31:22,377 --> 00:31:25,089
For me, it's on the same level. It just depends on what it is.

720
00:31:25,089 --> 00:31:28,884
But like mushrooms and people doing all these microdosing When I was younger,

721
00:31:28,884 --> 00:31:30,845
we didn't do micro doses when we were kids.

722
00:31:30,845 --> 00:31:32,430
No, nobody did even weed though.

723
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:34,599
Like we didn't we were you smoke weed the high.

724
00:31:34,598 --> 00:31:36,725
We didn't smoke weed. A couple of puffs and that was it.

725
00:31:36,726 --> 00:31:38,645
It was like, we're finishing the joint.

726
00:31:38,644 --> 00:31:40,646
We're not going to put the joint away and then pull it out later.

727
00:31:40,646 --> 00:31:42,898
You know what I mean? Like, that never happened.

728
00:31:42,898 --> 00:31:46,443
When we were young, my brother and I had a thing where we.

729
00:31:46,443 --> 00:31:48,904
We were always smoking in the car in Florida.

730
00:31:48,904 --> 00:31:50,365
Yeah. In the nineties.

731
00:31:50,365 --> 00:31:52,491
So you didn't even want to have a broken ashtray.

732
00:31:52,491 --> 00:31:55,787
So whatever had the last of the roach had the ether roach, I was.

733
00:31:55,869 --> 00:31:57,913
Oh that's so disgusting. It's disgusting.

734
00:31:57,913 --> 00:32:00,916
You better smoke it all the way down so there's not a big roach, you know,

735
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:02,626
But you guys weren't using crutches either.

736
00:32:02,626 --> 00:32:04,753
So it was like you're smoking.

737
00:32:04,753 --> 00:32:07,048
Smoking it down to the little bits.

738
00:32:07,048 --> 00:32:08,842
Yeah, well, let's fire some of this stuff up.

739
00:32:08,842 --> 00:32:10,884
Yeah. What are we talking out here?

740
00:32:10,884 --> 00:32:13,471
this is Skittles season,

741
00:32:13,471 --> 00:32:16,682
so I've been working on the perfect joint

742
00:32:16,766 --> 00:32:20,728
for a while now with the tips we got Professional general on Instagram.

743
00:32:20,728 --> 00:32:21,688
Big shout out.

744
00:32:21,688 --> 00:32:23,398
He rolled these actual.

745
00:32:23,397 --> 00:32:26,567
These are the last few I have but I run professional joint over.

746
00:32:26,608 --> 00:32:27,568
That's a job.

747
00:32:27,568 --> 00:32:28,318
That's his name.

748
00:32:28,318 --> 00:32:29,903
Yeah, that's his Instagram name.

749
00:32:29,903 --> 00:32:33,782
Yeah. I mean, if you want that job, we're looking, we're hiring.

750
00:32:33,866 --> 00:32:37,161
So I think part of what we do

751
00:32:37,244 --> 00:32:40,914
as James led genetics, we want to show the finished product.

752
00:32:40,914 --> 00:32:44,335
So like if you're going to buy seeds or clones from us, you'll be able

753
00:32:44,335 --> 00:32:47,713
to have access to the flower

754
00:32:47,797 --> 00:32:50,341
to see the finished flower so you don't have to wait 90 days.

755
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,134
That's one of the beauties of kind of what we're doing.

756
00:32:52,134 --> 00:32:55,137
But also I smoke joints like this.

757
00:32:55,346 --> 00:32:59,224
And so what I wanted is to be able to share that experience with people.

758
00:32:59,224 --> 00:33:02,894
And this is still probably a year out before we have these to market

759
00:33:02,979 --> 00:33:03,770
in California.

760
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:07,399
But I want people to experience the same thing I experience when I get to smoke.

761
00:33:07,482 --> 00:33:10,485
And so then they get to really get the full flavor of it.

762
00:33:10,612 --> 00:33:13,281
And we've been, you know, so like, for example,

763
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:18,911
you know, with the R&amp;D process, we were doing some of these monsters

764
00:33:18,952 --> 00:33:21,413
where these these are great, these are cool.

765
00:33:21,413 --> 00:33:23,206
This is a five grammar, you know what I mean?

766
00:33:23,207 --> 00:33:25,501
But and it's got a big tip, but it burns hot.

767
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,336
Yeah. So it burns too hot.

768
00:33:27,336 --> 00:33:28,211
You're like, okay, yeah.

769
00:33:28,211 --> 00:33:30,423
Like you lose the turnips like you still taste them

770
00:33:30,423 --> 00:33:34,719
and it's still good, but it's just not as good as this shape and this size.

771
00:33:34,719 --> 00:33:36,721
I feel like these are 3.5 grams

772
00:33:36,721 --> 00:33:40,432
and you get the real full flavor and get clowned on all the time.

773
00:33:40,432 --> 00:33:41,768
But I prefer skinny joint.

774
00:33:41,768 --> 00:33:44,519
Like to me it's equivalent of like a low temp that you're not.

775
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:45,896
Absolutely.

776
00:33:45,896 --> 00:33:50,025
Well, it goes through and it's not hot and so you're not killing those Terps.

777
00:33:50,108 --> 00:33:51,778
I mean, this is fun. It looks cool.

778
00:33:51,778 --> 00:33:52,444
It's like,

779
00:33:52,444 --> 00:33:55,322
you know, all these things are like they've been researching for cigars

780
00:33:55,323 --> 00:33:56,074
for a long time.

781
00:33:56,074 --> 00:33:59,869
And if you look at the best, smoking cigars, some people like the big hot ones

782
00:33:59,911 --> 00:34:00,745
that burn.

783
00:34:00,744 --> 00:34:03,580
But the flavor profile is not nearly

784
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:06,750
as delicate on a cigar as it is on a joint.

785
00:34:06,834 --> 00:34:09,921
you're looking for those subtleties and you want to be able to get those, like

786
00:34:09,961 --> 00:34:12,465
extreme subtleties, not even just subtleties,

787
00:34:12,465 --> 00:34:14,550
but like extreme subtleties with some of this stuff.

788
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:17,345
Can you legal and this I don't know if this is even legal or not

789
00:34:17,344 --> 00:34:21,139
can you legally sell seeded find it like Sure.

790
00:34:21,391 --> 00:34:23,351
So like you were just saying you would like people to be able

791
00:34:23,351 --> 00:34:25,519
to smoke that we see the weed before they grow it out.

792
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:29,731
Yeah nobody packages seeds just like grow out of seed and put it in

793
00:34:29,731 --> 00:34:30,690
and let me buy you.

794
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:32,567
You could, but you wouldn't want to smoke that bird

795
00:34:32,568 --> 00:34:34,445
because it's less potent for one thing.

796
00:34:34,445 --> 00:34:36,364
So. But you could, you could.

797
00:34:36,364 --> 00:34:36,697
Yeah.

798
00:34:36,697 --> 00:34:40,992
But then, so I mean that basically goes on to our model where you'll be able

799
00:34:40,992 --> 00:34:45,498
to get our flower and see flower samples so you don't have to wait the 90 days.

800
00:34:45,581 --> 00:34:48,459
And also we're going to have joints of stuff

801
00:34:48,458 --> 00:34:51,670
that'll be in metric too where you can check it out.

802
00:34:51,753 --> 00:34:53,797
We have, you know, tissue culture, all the stuff.

803
00:34:53,797 --> 00:34:56,258
So if you're getting seeds from us, you'll be able to see the finished product.

804
00:34:56,259 --> 00:34:57,385
You go to an event

805
00:34:57,385 --> 00:35:01,180
and I guarantee you we're not the only ones that we didn't start this.

806
00:35:01,179 --> 00:35:02,556
We're the last ones to do it.

807
00:35:02,556 --> 00:35:04,808
I think everybody's probably going to do this eventually.

808
00:35:04,809 --> 00:35:08,271
It just makes sense as a business model to be able to show

809
00:35:08,311 --> 00:35:09,230
proof is in the pudding.

810
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:11,773
You know, we do QR codes with stuff too,

811
00:35:11,773 --> 00:35:16,570
and lot of SEO is lots of testing involved with everything that we do

812
00:35:16,653 --> 00:35:18,030
convince shady businessmen.

813
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:18,948
There's a lot of work to do.

814
00:35:18,947 --> 00:35:22,201
There's so much, there's so much shadiness you don't even know what you got for

815
00:35:22,201 --> 00:35:24,954
12 weeks, like, you know, or a year or something.

816
00:35:24,954 --> 00:35:28,291
But the thing is, is I read a statistic somewhere

817
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:31,626
and so maybe somebody knows that's in the chat, but

818
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:34,296
75% of all seeds that are bought,

819
00:35:34,297 --> 00:35:39,050
retail are collected and not germinated, which I totally believe,

820
00:35:39,135 --> 00:35:44,140
but you may not ever know, like I believe it's a lot,

821
00:35:44,222 --> 00:35:47,518
but if you look at how many seeds I have in my seed collection, I get it.

822
00:35:47,684 --> 00:35:50,770
You know, I mean, like if you look at percentage wise of stuff,

823
00:35:51,021 --> 00:35:52,565
you consider a seed to be viable for it.

824
00:35:52,565 --> 00:35:56,235
Like if you store them correctly, you can store them for 20 years,

825
00:35:56,318 --> 00:35:56,943
maybe longer.

826
00:35:56,943 --> 00:36:00,572
I mean, I don't know about longer, but I know that they stay good.

827
00:36:00,572 --> 00:36:05,493
If you control the environment and you keep the humidity really low and

828
00:36:05,577 --> 00:36:06,536
basically take care

829
00:36:06,536 --> 00:36:09,539
of them, you don't want fluctuations in humidity like that to happen.

830
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:12,125
To note the freezers to cold.

831
00:36:12,126 --> 00:36:15,671
Yeah, you want to keep your so so everyone has a different opinion on this

832
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:21,217
but like that 55 to 60 degrees with really low humidity

833
00:36:21,302 --> 00:36:22,303
that's ideal.

834
00:36:22,302 --> 00:36:25,263
And the thing is is you don't want a big fluctuation in temperature.

835
00:36:25,264 --> 00:36:28,267
You don't want you don't want the extremes

836
00:36:28,476 --> 00:36:31,561
and the the you have it in a good environment

837
00:36:31,561 --> 00:36:35,523
like that, the longer it will be good for and there's embryo risk, you know,

838
00:36:35,608 --> 00:36:38,611
if you were to keep it in that environment and you were struggling

839
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:41,404
30 years from now, the embryo rescue 30 years from

840
00:36:41,405 --> 00:36:42,990
now is going to be a lot better than it is today.

841
00:36:42,989 --> 00:36:44,866
But it works very much embryo rescue.

842
00:36:44,867 --> 00:36:48,454
Oh, did it embryo or embryo rescue is an amazing thing.

843
00:36:48,454 --> 00:36:53,125
Big shout out to Justin, apical biotech, my partner, good friend.

844
00:36:53,208 --> 00:36:54,460
He does embryo rescue.

845
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,920
I got to witness the non-viable seed somehow.

846
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,214
Make it something that just doesn't pop.

847
00:36:59,215 --> 00:37:02,468
They do it in culture right and basically in a petri dish

848
00:37:02,467 --> 00:37:06,096
using hormones and use it.

849
00:37:06,347 --> 00:37:10,476
The thing is, is with embryo rescue, it's like a, you know, the game operation.

850
00:37:10,476 --> 00:37:11,519
It kind of feels like that.

851
00:37:11,518 --> 00:37:15,313
So they got a pair of tweezers where they actually

852
00:37:15,398 --> 00:37:18,983
crack the seed and then pop the coat off of the top

853
00:37:18,983 --> 00:37:23,405
and then remove the embryo like surgeons did.

854
00:37:23,489 --> 00:37:26,324
They do they they absolutely

855
00:37:26,324 --> 00:37:29,285
go extremely sterile.

856
00:37:29,286 --> 00:37:31,371
You know, I'll give you a tour of artsy lab.

857
00:37:31,371 --> 00:37:34,375
And that's also just this past season,

858
00:37:34,541 --> 00:37:36,501
you know, Rest in peace, my little Big Buddha.

859
00:37:36,501 --> 00:37:37,253
Yeah.

860
00:37:37,253 --> 00:37:40,005
I had actually was a Lisa McDonagh

861
00:37:40,005 --> 00:37:44,677
on former coworker from High Times had a

862
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,719
blister pack that he gave

863
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:49,347
us the year he won his first cup of the cheese.

864
00:37:49,597 --> 00:37:52,101
I still have one, I still have one.

865
00:37:52,101 --> 00:37:54,561
It didn't work out, but man, I really wanted that to work.

866
00:37:54,561 --> 00:37:56,396
Yeah, I mean, the cheese cuts around them.

867
00:37:56,396 --> 00:37:59,190
The real cheese cut is around rest in peace, Milo.

868
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:02,152
We lost a lot of friends in the last couple of years, but.

869
00:38:02,152 --> 00:38:03,528
But, yeah, Milo's good, dude.

870
00:38:03,528 --> 00:38:06,030
I always had a smile on his face. Nice guy.

871
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:06,824
Great weed.

872
00:38:06,824 --> 00:38:07,575
Yeah, I think.

873
00:38:07,574 --> 00:38:11,077
Had that good boy in England until I get my life

874
00:38:11,161 --> 00:38:12,120
totally in.

875
00:38:12,121 --> 00:38:13,497
That cheese is something special.

876
00:38:13,496 --> 00:38:14,373
Something special.

877
00:38:14,373 --> 00:38:17,376
Its own unique flavor profile.

878
00:38:17,543 --> 00:38:22,590
He when we had the cup we were talking about earlier on when we got busted.

879
00:38:22,715 --> 00:38:26,552
Yeah, they stashed a suitcase behind, like,

880
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:32,266
some art that had like $200,000 worth of seeds in it. And

881
00:38:32,349 --> 00:38:34,393
me and my wife, Melissa and Jen Bernstein

882
00:38:34,393 --> 00:38:38,646
from High Times smuggled out of there while the cops were put in a car.

883
00:38:38,731 --> 00:38:39,648
He didn't know any of this.

884
00:38:39,648 --> 00:38:42,776
And later that night, we found him at where was it?

885
00:38:42,775 --> 00:38:45,486
Maybe it was Barneys uptown or something like that. Go right.

886
00:38:45,487 --> 00:38:46,989
We were like, Oh, wait, hang on.

887
00:38:46,989 --> 00:38:47,990
Got it. And brought it out to him.

888
00:38:47,989 --> 00:38:51,034
And he started crying now, like the tears shed and they just could make out.

889
00:38:51,034 --> 00:38:52,744
It was gone. Like, I bet.

890
00:38:52,744 --> 00:38:55,788
I bet, you know, that would suck, you know?

891
00:38:55,789 --> 00:38:56,665
But it's happened.

892
00:38:56,664 --> 00:38:57,333
It's happened, you know?

893
00:38:57,333 --> 00:38:57,750
So cool.

894
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:02,045
Lost all his seeds in the fire years ago.

895
00:39:02,128 --> 00:39:05,048
Yeah, I always I always my piece of advice to people

896
00:39:05,048 --> 00:39:08,134
when I was in high times is like, if you want to win the Cannabis Cup

897
00:39:08,135 --> 00:39:12,348
and you don't have any connections to a breeder or court or something like that,

898
00:39:12,389 --> 00:39:14,016
the best place to start from ground

899
00:39:14,016 --> 00:39:17,728
Zero is just buy a package of cool online and pop around.

900
00:39:17,811 --> 00:39:21,190
And the first San Francisco Cannabis Cup, somebody actually did that

901
00:39:21,273 --> 00:39:22,358
and it was Vortex.

902
00:39:22,358 --> 00:39:23,692
You called it God's pussy.

903
00:39:23,692 --> 00:39:24,068
Yeah.

904
00:39:24,068 --> 00:39:28,197
And Valerie Corral had go up on stage and give this guy an award for God's pussy.

905
00:39:28,322 --> 00:39:30,157
All that's so amazing.

906
00:39:30,157 --> 00:39:35,496
And then we had to issue a formal apology and correction.

907
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:38,374
It's actually more taxes and more hypocrisy.

908
00:39:38,373 --> 00:39:39,500
So going do.

909
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,376
That's hilarious.

910
00:39:41,376 --> 00:39:44,587
The first San Francisco Cup was pretty exceptional.

911
00:39:44,672 --> 00:39:49,467
We were expecting eight or 900 people and it was more like five or 6000 people.

912
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:51,679
Like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

913
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:53,012
The police helped us manage the crowd.

914
00:39:53,012 --> 00:39:54,847
We thought the cops were coming to shut us down.

915
00:39:54,847 --> 00:39:59,394
We didn't know we were coming from New York to Yeah, we you hear stories

916
00:39:59,394 --> 00:40:03,356
about how liberal San Francisco is, as in New York, but we had no first experience.

917
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,900
I mean, I still have friends that I met at that event.

918
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,402
I'm still friend industry people.

919
00:40:07,402 --> 00:40:10,613
Mike from Gus House, Big Mike, you know, he's Russian,

920
00:40:10,614 --> 00:40:13,951
I'm Finnish, so are Finnish ancestors.

921
00:40:14,076 --> 00:40:16,744
And yeah, so him and I hang out still.

922
00:40:16,744 --> 00:40:20,081
But we met at that event and yeah, cool dude.

923
00:40:20,081 --> 00:40:24,085
Like a lot of good people, we were doing like crazy dabs back then

924
00:40:24,085 --> 00:40:27,088
to like the rigs were completely different than they are now.

925
00:40:27,213 --> 00:40:29,590
Working the front desk at that event, it was like

926
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:32,552
me and my wife and Mary McEvoy, who was a publisher in High

927
00:40:32,552 --> 00:40:35,596
Times, was sitting at the front desk scanning every ticket of people coming in.

928
00:40:35,764 --> 00:40:36,140
Yeah,

929
00:40:36,139 --> 00:40:39,143
and we were all expecting like 800 people, so we didn't think it was going to be

930
00:40:39,268 --> 00:40:40,144
the crush it was.

931
00:40:40,143 --> 00:40:43,020
And now we got a line of like 4000 people right in front of us.

932
00:40:43,021 --> 00:40:43,522
Right?

933
00:40:43,521 --> 00:40:45,898
Basically at that time, if you came up to the desk,

934
00:40:45,898 --> 00:40:48,277
look me in the eyes and said, I'm on the list,

935
00:40:48,277 --> 00:40:51,655
I pretended to find your name and said, All right,

936
00:40:51,737 --> 00:40:52,947
you know that for

937
00:40:52,947 --> 00:40:56,242
future events, guys like that, I'm sure they don't do that, you know?

938
00:40:56,242 --> 00:40:59,954
No, but when it's crazy, that's what people do, you know?

939
00:41:00,038 --> 00:41:01,039
Yeah.

940
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:01,874
Oh. Oh, man.

941
00:41:01,873 --> 00:41:04,417
But yeah, so that was interesting what I remember about that event.

942
00:41:04,418 --> 00:41:07,171
And it was it the is it the Segway?

943
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:10,173
It's in San Francisco in the furniture district.

944
00:41:10,382 --> 00:41:10,965
Yeah.

945
00:41:10,965 --> 00:41:11,257
Right.

946
00:41:11,257 --> 00:41:14,260
It, it was like a lot of cool couple of super cool

947
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:18,306
gay couple who ran a high end wedding space.

948
00:41:18,306 --> 00:41:20,892
It was just a wedding. Yeah. Furniture district.

949
00:41:20,893 --> 00:41:24,730
It was chill to give us our space to do our crazy shit and every little thing.

950
00:41:24,813 --> 00:41:27,148
Yeah, they were super cool, man. They helped us in every way.

951
00:41:27,148 --> 00:41:29,317
Yeah, I remember, though, there was, like, the poacher,

952
00:41:29,318 --> 00:41:32,278
the guy who didn't pay for a booth that was selling

953
00:41:32,278 --> 00:41:34,114
medical recommendations because they wanted you

954
00:41:34,114 --> 00:41:36,782
to get the medical recommendations to smoke at the event.

955
00:41:36,782 --> 00:41:40,661
And so there was a dude that was in a bus in

956
00:41:40,746 --> 00:41:44,583
my buddy had a medical booth and he was so pissed

957
00:41:44,583 --> 00:41:47,586
because this dude was making all the money because of the one there provider.

958
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:50,880
So they were just pumping out medical cards as a high times employee,

959
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,634
we had to act like we hated it, but we really loved that shit, man.

960
00:41:53,634 --> 00:41:56,802
Like, yeah, to me, if the High Times Cannabis Cup

961
00:41:56,802 --> 00:42:00,723
felt like the parking lot of a Grateful Dead shows and, you know, yeah.

962
00:42:00,806 --> 00:42:04,727
For you know, Yeah, some shakedown street action

963
00:42:04,769 --> 00:42:06,146
the whole day man.

964
00:42:06,146 --> 00:42:09,775
Yeah and it's interesting the flower back thing because that was like buffet.

965
00:42:10,025 --> 00:42:14,238
I mean Girl Scout cookies was a little it was there around, but it was like

966
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,906
just but GSC didn't win

967
00:42:16,907 --> 00:42:20,077
until I won with the Cross in 2012.

968
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:24,038
That cup was also the very first time I wasn't competition

969
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:27,876
coordinator and that, yeah, they finally gave me opportunity to judge.

970
00:42:27,876 --> 00:42:31,755
It was the first time I ever judged which emotional immigrant in San Francisco.

971
00:42:31,755 --> 00:42:32,798
Yeah, Francisco.

972
00:42:32,797 --> 00:42:35,299
Like I was responsible for ticketing.

973
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,719
Yeah, but I wasn't responsible for running that contest.

974
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:39,887
It was like one of the only ones in the whole time I worked at that.

975
00:42:39,887 --> 00:42:42,391
That wasn't responsible for running to. Yeah.

976
00:42:42,391 --> 00:42:44,893
So I could judge and kind of get some in.

977
00:42:44,893 --> 00:42:46,103
This is my pitch to the corporate.

978
00:42:46,103 --> 00:42:48,480
Let me judge so I can see from the inside how judging works.

979
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,483
I'll make competition better. Nice.

980
00:42:51,692 --> 00:42:53,235
That's awesome.

981
00:42:53,318 --> 00:42:56,196
Those old school judge's kids were awesome, too.

982
00:42:56,195 --> 00:42:57,489
It was great. Yeah, great.

983
00:42:57,489 --> 00:43:00,492
But it was the first time I ever doubted my

984
00:43:00,659 --> 00:43:01,159
Phillips.

985
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:04,079
Our ex entered.

986
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:05,956
I want to say it was Ingrid.

987
00:43:05,956 --> 00:43:07,332
I think I remember that.

988
00:43:07,331 --> 00:43:08,416
Yeah. Oh, my God.

989
00:43:08,416 --> 00:43:10,876
I had to take it afternoon off. I took it down.

990
00:43:10,876 --> 00:43:13,587
It was the first time I ever did. Yeah, we didn't.

991
00:43:13,588 --> 00:43:15,215
We had hookah calls.

992
00:43:15,215 --> 00:43:17,509
Oh, yeah, for sure.

993
00:43:17,509 --> 00:43:19,885
Next that

994
00:43:19,885 --> 00:43:21,346
most people don't even know about us.

995
00:43:21,346 --> 00:43:24,724
We should probably talk about the ways we used to dab before dabbing.

996
00:43:24,807 --> 00:43:27,601
There was an atom smasher, which was one of the ways

997
00:43:27,601 --> 00:43:30,312
that we was a glass pipe that had holes on the side.

998
00:43:30,313 --> 00:43:33,150
And then you heat up the element and push it down on your hash.

999
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:35,860
Right from British Columbia sent us

1000
00:43:35,943 --> 00:43:36,862
a swing.

1001
00:43:36,862 --> 00:43:39,905
It was basically like a down stem with a titanium plate.

1002
00:43:40,072 --> 00:43:41,240
Yeah. Yeah.

1003
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:44,326
And you didn't get the titanium red hot and put your dabs on it.

1004
00:43:44,327 --> 00:43:46,580
You suck it up. I think they call those bells.

1005
00:43:46,579 --> 00:43:49,540
They had the bell's the one, the bell that you would put the smoke.

1006
00:43:49,541 --> 00:43:52,043
I know you put it in there and yeah, that those were cool.

1007
00:43:52,043 --> 00:43:52,586
One of those.

1008
00:43:52,585 --> 00:43:55,546
And we started bringing some down back to New York from these

1009
00:43:55,547 --> 00:43:56,840
because that you couldn't find.

1010
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,885
Well the first way we did DABS was definitely on coal like you'd

1011
00:43:59,925 --> 00:44:04,681
heat up a piece of coal and it'd be like an ashtray or a cool little dish, right?

1012
00:44:04,681 --> 00:44:08,434
And then you drop a little bit on and you either have a pen cap or

1013
00:44:08,476 --> 00:44:12,897
I even saw BHO like we were doing that with like bubble hash

1014
00:44:12,981 --> 00:44:14,566
or so it was even called.

1015
00:44:14,565 --> 00:44:17,359
So, yeah, know, people were making alcohol extraction stuff.

1016
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,988
Yeah, we were doing that back in the day for sure too.

1017
00:44:19,987 --> 00:44:23,782
So but, but even like the old school bubble house, that's how we smoked it

1018
00:44:23,782 --> 00:44:27,411
before there was rigs and stuff like that on the, on the stove.

1019
00:44:27,496 --> 00:44:29,456
Yeah, but I did the hot knives on the stove,

1020
00:44:29,456 --> 00:44:33,168
so those were great for old school house, but not real high quality bubble hash.

1021
00:44:33,168 --> 00:44:35,545
It would like completely ruin it. You wouldn't get the experience.

1022
00:44:35,545 --> 00:44:37,963
You got a fair, you remember that?

1023
00:44:37,963 --> 00:44:41,092
Oh, it's like a little black box with a ceramic stick.

1024
00:44:41,259 --> 00:44:41,927
Yeah.

1025
00:44:41,927 --> 00:44:45,555
Got red hot instantly when you plugged it in and there were no on off switch.

1026
00:44:45,554 --> 00:44:46,597
There was no deadman's switch.

1027
00:44:46,597 --> 00:44:49,808
So yeah, you plug it in and you do a dab that makes you call so hard,

1028
00:44:49,809 --> 00:44:51,561
you drop it, you're basically going to burn your house down.

1029
00:44:51,561 --> 00:44:54,564
You're like, Oh yeah, totally.

1030
00:44:54,813 --> 00:44:56,065
That's really cool. They were great.

1031
00:44:56,065 --> 00:44:56,482
They were great.

1032
00:44:56,483 --> 00:44:59,903
I think it burned like 550, 600 degrees something.

1033
00:44:59,985 --> 00:45:01,612
And then the rigs just got out of control.

1034
00:45:01,612 --> 00:45:03,322
So they had rigs and they kept getting big.

1035
00:45:03,322 --> 00:45:05,074
In the beginning. They were big monsters rigs.

1036
00:45:05,074 --> 00:45:08,327
And there still are cool, big monstrous rigs, but most of us small

1037
00:45:08,327 --> 00:45:14,166
got a small rigs or now, you know, these these e like rigs we get the perf

1038
00:45:14,166 --> 00:45:18,797
co we've the car to it was always 90%

1039
00:45:18,797 --> 00:45:23,092
or more of go and then we recently got the 3D Excel chamber.

1040
00:45:23,175 --> 00:45:24,385
Uh huh

1041
00:45:24,469 --> 00:45:27,179
it's like a whole different product that's really mad.

1042
00:45:27,179 --> 00:45:28,764
It's like

1043
00:45:28,764 --> 00:45:33,560
not, it's not as good as a high quality quartz banger.

1044
00:45:33,561 --> 00:45:35,271
I think it's better really.

1045
00:45:35,271 --> 00:45:41,068
I'm a huge fan so I haven't tried it, but I like the Carter two from Focus Focus V.

1046
00:45:41,152 --> 00:45:41,903
I think I got it here.

1047
00:45:41,902 --> 00:45:45,322
We can try it out right now, but yeah, dude.

1048
00:45:45,532 --> 00:45:45,865
Yeah.

1049
00:45:45,864 --> 00:45:50,494
I mean, I'm a huge fan and you know, you're not having to get a torch like this

1050
00:45:50,577 --> 00:45:52,496
in for. Yeah, you out in public.

1051
00:45:52,496 --> 00:45:55,582
You know, it's a little weird when you see people trying to fire up.

1052
00:45:55,791 --> 00:45:58,627
I always thought the the copycat

1053
00:45:58,628 --> 00:46:03,633
give a double plus for convenience and innovation innovation

1054
00:46:03,882 --> 00:46:05,759
they skipped a generation of product entry like

1055
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,679
like people were starting to make these e rigs

1056
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:10,472
and then they skipped a whole generation of them and came out with their product.

1057
00:46:10,472 --> 00:46:13,434
It's like a level beyond what anybody else was doing.

1058
00:46:13,434 --> 00:46:15,811
I believe personally, yeah, this.

1059
00:46:15,811 --> 00:46:20,650
But I still would prefer a perfect temperature finger to it.

1060
00:46:20,733 --> 00:46:21,650
Me too. Me too.

1061
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:23,986
So for sure I like, but I do slow starts, right?

1062
00:46:23,987 --> 00:46:26,530
So I do the cold start where it's like

1063
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:30,492
I put the extract in and I just heat it up as much as necessary to get it to smoke.

1064
00:46:30,492 --> 00:46:31,952
And then you get the most chirps.

1065
00:46:31,952 --> 00:46:33,079
That's my style.

1066
00:46:33,079 --> 00:46:36,916
I mean, everyone has their own way, but so this new 3D Excel, you can not only

1067
00:46:36,916 --> 00:46:40,711
control the temperature very accurately, you can control the airflow.

1068
00:46:40,711 --> 00:46:44,548
So you can kind of like tweak how hot or folded up is and how dense

1069
00:46:44,757 --> 00:46:48,927
like how much resistance you get when you put on the nice pretty nice hands.

1070
00:46:48,927 --> 00:46:50,804
Pretty nice. Yeah.

1071
00:46:50,804 --> 00:46:53,724
We're going to have to do it side by side on one of these shows like

1072
00:46:53,724 --> 00:46:56,435
Perfect versus car to

1073
00:46:56,518 --> 00:47:01,356
so that's hilarious.

1074
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,275
I feel like

1075
00:47:03,275 --> 00:47:06,862
as we've gotten older and as I've gotten older, but like looking at the industry

1076
00:47:06,862 --> 00:47:11,033
now with what the industry has become, we really need to be united

1077
00:47:11,034 --> 00:47:14,954
and not like, Fuck this person, fuck that person, the ones that are here.

1078
00:47:14,954 --> 00:47:15,997
Let's, let's fucking give

1079
00:47:15,996 --> 00:47:19,792
props to everybody for even being here for, for even being around this long.

1080
00:47:19,793 --> 00:47:22,253
If you're a legal brand, big ups.

1081
00:47:22,253 --> 00:47:24,672
Glad you're still doing it. Deal like that's what it's all about.

1082
00:47:24,672 --> 00:47:27,090
I mean, people talk about wanting to go back to the black market.

1083
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:28,717
It's like that doesn't make any sense.

1084
00:47:28,717 --> 00:47:31,678
We just need to figure out how to do it right with what we're doing now.

1085
00:47:31,762 --> 00:47:34,473
And I mean, I love seeing these seed companies thrive.

1086
00:47:34,474 --> 00:47:36,059
I love seeing new genetics.

1087
00:47:36,059 --> 00:47:38,978
I love seeing innovation, all the stuff.

1088
00:47:38,978 --> 00:47:43,358
But we need to like unite as a group seven people to jail for.

1089
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,567
Absolutely. You don't know.

1090
00:47:45,568 --> 00:47:47,320
No one belongs in jail for weed.

1091
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,447
And if you can and if you could.

1092
00:47:49,447 --> 00:47:51,950
Yeah, if you could fill a room full of cartons of cigarets

1093
00:47:51,949 --> 00:47:54,535
and another room for alcohol, you should be able to fill your house full

1094
00:47:54,536 --> 00:47:57,038
of as much fucking weed as you want and preserve it,

1095
00:47:57,038 --> 00:47:59,706
because weed can be preserved for a good amount of time.

1096
00:47:59,706 --> 00:48:02,292
I think it's silly to worry about anything, that kind of stuff.

1097
00:48:02,293 --> 00:48:06,548
There's so many other things like homeless that we should be worried about.

1098
00:48:06,547 --> 00:48:09,424
You know, the homeless situation is all fucked, but that's all.

1099
00:48:09,425 --> 00:48:13,012
I tried to talk about Too many depressing things, you know, but being in the bear.

1100
00:48:13,054 --> 00:48:13,512
Oh, yeah.

1101
00:48:13,512 --> 00:48:17,891
Especially when there's so many good things like the cannabis cups to discuss.

1102
00:48:17,976 --> 00:48:19,269
I don't

1103
00:48:19,351 --> 00:48:22,271
sense since I left, I can't really see

1104
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:25,607
you haven't experienced the Emerald Cups or anything like that that I go to.

1105
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:27,193
Yeah, I live and I go to

1106
00:48:27,193 --> 00:48:30,613
I like to buy there people running it or super cool Timberlake Those guys.

1107
00:48:30,697 --> 00:48:33,657
Yeah, they do a great job with everything they do, but

1108
00:48:33,824 --> 00:48:34,866
they really care about the weed.

1109
00:48:34,867 --> 00:48:37,036
I think that's, that's part of it for sure.

1110
00:48:37,036 --> 00:48:41,624
The passion and about the meeting the focus on the product

1111
00:48:41,708 --> 00:48:43,293
and not about our money.

1112
00:48:43,293 --> 00:48:43,584
Yeah.

1113
00:48:43,583 --> 00:48:47,587
As a former high Times employee, I want to put this on the record.

1114
00:48:47,672 --> 00:48:50,925
I know a lot of people claim that our contest may have been corrupt.

1115
00:48:50,925 --> 00:48:53,219
There's absolutely not.

1116
00:48:53,219 --> 00:48:55,137
Never, not once ever.

1117
00:48:55,137 --> 00:48:57,806
We made a system

1118
00:48:57,806 --> 00:49:01,643
to allow a group of people to pick out what the best weed was.

1119
00:49:01,728 --> 00:49:03,271
It was a system. Perfect note.

1120
00:49:03,271 --> 00:49:06,065
It got better every year for sure. Occasionally.

1121
00:49:06,065 --> 00:49:07,983
Are there things that one that I wouldn't have picked personally?

1122
00:49:07,983 --> 00:49:09,152
Absolutely.

1123
00:49:09,152 --> 00:49:13,322
But we never put our personalities into that decision.

1124
00:49:13,322 --> 00:49:16,158
The system decided. Right.

1125
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:16,658
Well,

1126
00:49:16,659 --> 00:49:19,494
but there was some incidents back in the day

1127
00:49:19,494 --> 00:49:23,498
with like where you could buy cups as a as a coffee shop every time.

1128
00:49:23,541 --> 00:49:24,334
Right.

1129
00:49:24,333 --> 00:49:26,376
Well, they're not even talking about another ball game.

1130
00:49:26,376 --> 00:49:27,961
The sure thing.

1131
00:49:27,961 --> 00:49:28,295
Right.

1132
00:49:28,295 --> 00:49:31,131
We allowed the somebody to buy a ticket.

1133
00:49:31,132 --> 00:49:33,592
Sure. And give an award. Yeah. Yeah.

1134
00:49:33,592 --> 00:49:36,053
This was it on you guys. I'm just saying that this is

1135
00:49:36,054 --> 00:49:39,014
just it became so corrupted by the manipulated, right?

1136
00:49:39,014 --> 00:49:41,558
It became a lesser reward. And that's how we treated it, Right?

1137
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:43,352
The real award in that forum was a secret.

1138
00:49:43,351 --> 00:49:45,480
Just right, judged by our prizes.

1139
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:48,065
Hey, I wouldn't be here today without it. Probably.

1140
00:49:48,065 --> 00:49:50,400
It's funny how impactful

1141
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,446
I think that was for me in my career and being featured in High Times.

1142
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:56,574
I love that man. I'm glad. Yeah, great guy.

1143
00:49:56,574 --> 00:49:58,076
So good times.

1144
00:49:58,076 --> 00:49:58,617
Good times.

1145
00:49:58,617 --> 00:50:03,038
And, you know, it's like we didn't go in thinking we were going to win the cup.

1146
00:50:03,121 --> 00:50:05,207
We went in there trying to put the best we could.

1147
00:50:05,208 --> 00:50:07,168
And the the thing is, is

1148
00:50:07,168 --> 00:50:11,047
I think the first time I entered, we, I lost a bunch of times to guys.

1149
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:14,925
So it's not like I won the first time out there we had lost.

1150
00:50:15,009 --> 00:50:18,804
And so I had this amazing extract that we had in it and they didn't

1151
00:50:18,804 --> 00:50:20,347
even know how to really judge it.

1152
00:50:20,347 --> 00:50:21,641
And I thought for sure we're going to win.

1153
00:50:21,641 --> 00:50:25,394
Drove out to Seattle, entered it in there with my buddy and fucking I was wrong

1154
00:50:25,393 --> 00:50:27,479
and we lost and I think I saw the other stuff.

1155
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,065
The other entries were better.

1156
00:50:29,065 --> 00:50:31,025
One thing we used to do also, like a guy like you.

1157
00:50:31,025 --> 00:50:33,402
Maybe Anthony would enter in the California market?

1158
00:50:33,402 --> 00:50:36,155
Yeah, I would go out of my way to try to get you to judge.

1159
00:50:36,155 --> 00:50:38,908
Maybe in Seattle or something like that.

1160
00:50:38,907 --> 00:50:40,159
Right. So you can see the sausage.

1161
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:42,244
I want you to see the inside of the sausage as a competitor,

1162
00:50:42,244 --> 00:50:45,580
a guy who's putting in for sure.

1163
00:50:45,664 --> 00:50:46,498
Yeah. It's so funny.

1164
00:50:46,498 --> 00:50:51,962
I could have probably won two cups in Amsterdam, but I didn't enter my O.G.

1165
00:50:52,045 --> 00:50:53,047
in the same year.

1166
00:50:53,047 --> 00:50:54,590
But if I would have entered my O.G.

1167
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:57,510
and I wouldn't have been able to share it with Marlin Asher

1168
00:50:57,510 --> 00:51:00,638
and me and him are good friends now, so everything kind of happens here.

1169
00:51:00,637 --> 00:51:02,973
Yeah. The guy's a farmer. He's doing great.

1170
00:51:02,974 --> 00:51:03,557
He's doing great.

1171
00:51:03,557 --> 00:51:06,601
Get a new album coming out and he's just a solid person.

1172
00:51:06,601 --> 00:51:10,647
But like I met him at that 2012 cup at the milk bag.

1173
00:51:10,898 --> 00:51:14,026
Actually, I think we met before, but I've got him some O.G.

1174
00:51:14,025 --> 00:51:16,152
and then they kept wanting all of my O.G.

1175
00:51:16,152 --> 00:51:19,990
Kush and I, if I were to enter that I probably could have won.

1176
00:51:20,074 --> 00:51:23,702
But I was happy with just winning one One thing, you know, it's like it was

1177
00:51:23,702 --> 00:51:27,123
pretty amazing the fact that we won it all because we had the smallest booth.

1178
00:51:27,331 --> 00:51:32,461
So the I can I can attest to the fact that you guys did a good job,

1179
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:35,672
especially there because we weren't the Kelley connection was across from us.

1180
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:39,467
And they had like this 50 or 60 foot long booth by 20 feet tall,

1181
00:51:39,552 --> 00:51:41,387
and we were a little ten by ten.

1182
00:51:41,387 --> 00:51:42,888
none of that, none of that matter.

1183
00:51:42,887 --> 00:51:46,641
And the thing is, is like my sales guys didn't even know what numbers

1184
00:51:46,726 --> 00:51:49,519
your entries were. Yeah, we kept it separate.

1185
00:51:49,519 --> 00:51:51,730
Two separate worlds and, like, untouchable.

1186
00:51:51,731 --> 00:51:52,273
Yeah.

1187
00:51:52,273 --> 00:51:56,110
one of the things we started figuring out so, like, you would come to the desk

1188
00:51:56,152 --> 00:51:58,320
with your entry and some people would see us

1189
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,530
write our number on the bag, the code number, right?

1190
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:01,489
And they started to it.

1191
00:52:01,489 --> 00:52:04,492
And then they try to figure out who the judges were and dropped.

1192
00:52:04,492 --> 00:52:06,536
Our number we call went to that early.

1193
00:52:06,536 --> 00:52:07,454
So when we started doing it,

1194
00:52:07,454 --> 00:52:09,623
you would come and I would tell you, All right, here's a table.

1195
00:52:09,623 --> 00:52:12,335
One is your entry right now would be the number I put in the system.

1196
00:52:12,335 --> 00:52:14,836
But then when we broke it down for the judges, that all got scrambled

1197
00:52:14,836 --> 00:52:16,588
with a second set of numbers. Right.

1198
00:52:16,588 --> 00:52:19,299
The team, along with becomes a team of 32 or whatever.

1199
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:19,800
Sure.

1200
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,344
Nobody knew that

1201
00:52:21,344 --> 00:52:24,889
how to scramble except for the three of us running the competition.

1202
00:52:24,972 --> 00:52:28,768
all kinds of things like that because you have to you have to do the job.

1203
00:52:28,768 --> 00:52:30,101
It was the best job I ever had, man.

1204
00:52:30,101 --> 00:52:30,560
And that to me,

1205
00:52:30,561 --> 00:52:33,564
the only way I can maintain job security, I thought was to run a clean competition.

1206
00:52:33,563 --> 00:52:35,315
That's all. That's all I care about.

1207
00:52:35,315 --> 00:52:39,277
You know, there were some years where Hype won the cup to do the hype.

1208
00:52:39,362 --> 00:52:40,653
So hype is a powerful thing.

1209
00:52:40,653 --> 00:52:44,032
So tanduay, which is so recognizable, that's the big thing.

1210
00:52:44,032 --> 00:52:45,992
Like it was so recognizable to the judges.

1211
00:52:45,992 --> 00:52:48,828
It was it was the most popular thing at the time

1212
00:52:48,829 --> 00:52:51,457
to put something in a box that nobody's ever seen before,

1213
00:52:51,456 --> 00:52:54,085
even if it's not the best thing in the box of judges.

1214
00:52:54,168 --> 00:52:55,753
I think there was one time in L.A.

1215
00:52:55,753 --> 00:52:58,756
where there was like ten tanduay entries to sometimes

1216
00:52:58,755 --> 00:53:01,759
you get that or it's such a popular cross.

1217
00:53:01,925 --> 00:53:03,052
Everybody's loving it.

1218
00:53:03,052 --> 00:53:05,887
The ten people in it. I mean, OG Cruz was kind of like that.

1219
00:53:05,887 --> 00:53:08,891
There was, you know, over the years, things hazes probably

1220
00:53:08,891 --> 00:53:11,936
five years were especially the indigo in the hybrid category.

1221
00:53:11,936 --> 00:53:15,981
If it if it wasn't like OG gas, you had no chance.

1222
00:53:16,023 --> 00:53:16,273
Yeah.

1223
00:53:16,273 --> 00:53:19,902
Over in Europe, the amnesia people were like, Everybody's got the amnesia.

1224
00:53:19,902 --> 00:53:22,278
Super lemon, one of those, you know, all of us.

1225
00:53:22,278 --> 00:53:23,114
Cannabis.

1226
00:53:23,114 --> 00:53:26,449
I've never been I cannot believe, my dad was.

1227
00:53:26,534 --> 00:53:29,077
He died in 2019.

1228
00:53:29,077 --> 00:53:30,788
Yeah, he was a world traveler.

1229
00:53:30,788 --> 00:53:32,581
It was really it was his main thing.

1230
00:53:32,581 --> 00:53:33,666
He was so mad at me.

1231
00:53:33,666 --> 00:53:36,585
He died mad at me because I've been to Europe eight times.

1232
00:53:36,585 --> 00:53:39,045
I never left the city walls of insurance.

1233
00:53:39,045 --> 00:53:40,213
Really?

1234
00:53:40,213 --> 00:53:41,840
Well, you get to come to Spain this year.

1235
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:43,299
2024. Let's do it.

1236
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,094
I got you know, I did my booth with Greenhouse,

1237
00:53:45,094 --> 00:53:47,054
and we're probably going to do a booth with greenhouse again.

1238
00:53:47,054 --> 00:53:49,431
But it's amazing experience. And you know, everybody.

1239
00:53:49,431 --> 00:53:50,182
It's all the same.

1240
00:53:50,181 --> 00:53:52,600
Yeah, literally, it's the same people.

1241
00:53:52,601 --> 00:53:55,104
And we, we all go out to dinner and hang out and

1242
00:53:55,103 --> 00:53:58,481
a lot of them, it's kind of like how Amsterdam was.

1243
00:53:58,481 --> 00:54:00,860
It's the one time of year I get to see a lot of people that.

1244
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:04,445
Maybe I only get to see that one time a year or less.

1245
00:54:04,697 --> 00:54:07,532
And as we're getting older, it's just great seeing

1246
00:54:07,532 --> 00:54:11,536
some of these people still doing their thing and, you know, all over

1247
00:54:11,619 --> 00:54:12,913
South Africa, we got friends

1248
00:54:12,913 --> 00:54:17,208
all over South America, South Africa, and it's just some of the stuff,

1249
00:54:17,208 --> 00:54:20,962
some of the magic of high times got carried on over in the span of us.

1250
00:54:21,088 --> 00:54:23,507
I love that. I love it.

1251
00:54:23,507 --> 00:54:25,342
And when we didn't answer, it was really special.

1252
00:54:25,342 --> 00:54:28,012
I think like, yeah, it was absolutely.

1253
00:54:28,012 --> 00:54:29,680
I mean, it was a game changing thing

1254
00:54:29,679 --> 00:54:33,766
and it was really special, especially the people.

1255
00:54:33,766 --> 00:54:35,101
I mean, we all have great memories.

1256
00:54:35,101 --> 00:54:38,187
It's kind of like how I can imagine how disco was like once it was gone,

1257
00:54:38,188 --> 00:54:40,023
it was gone and I'll never be the same.

1258
00:54:40,023 --> 00:54:42,400
That's the the real high times experience.

1259
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,777
Like after it was a perfect venue. Yeah.

1260
00:54:44,777 --> 00:54:49,407
We for whatever reason in an alternate universe, did the same progression.

1261
00:54:49,407 --> 00:54:50,784
But it was New York and not Amsterdam.

1262
00:54:50,784 --> 00:54:54,038
Like you would walk around New York for a week and never bump into another time

1263
00:54:54,121 --> 00:54:54,829
right after.

1264
00:54:54,829 --> 00:54:57,540
I was like, such a like a perfect tiny little capsule.

1265
00:54:57,541 --> 00:55:01,378
Like, Oh, yeah, every time I left the hotel room. All

1266
00:55:01,461 --> 00:55:04,422
right, when it's a small enough group that everybody kind of knows

1267
00:55:04,422 --> 00:55:07,759
everybody to like, I mean, everywhere you go, you see somebody with a.

1268
00:55:07,842 --> 00:55:10,219
Sure, yeah, I love it.

1269
00:55:10,219 --> 00:55:10,511
Yeah.

1270
00:55:10,512 --> 00:55:12,514
Good experiences and then celebrating afterwards,

1271
00:55:12,514 --> 00:55:14,599
celebrating Thanksgiving together with people.

1272
00:55:14,599 --> 00:55:18,686
And I would say the the high times because we're very tribal to a degree.

1273
00:55:18,686 --> 00:55:20,855
Like we were a tribe we had our own tribe of.

1274
00:55:20,856 --> 00:55:23,484
I give Steve Hager a lot of credit for that.

1275
00:55:23,483 --> 00:55:27,153
Yeah it's like ceded the idea that was his

1276
00:55:27,153 --> 00:55:28,989
he wanted this to be exactly what you were saying.

1277
00:55:28,989 --> 00:55:30,615
Yeah, that was what he wanted.

1278
00:55:30,615 --> 00:55:32,242
We were the tribe. Yeah.

1279
00:55:32,242 --> 00:55:35,204
And it's like this wasn't very rich.

1280
00:55:35,204 --> 00:55:37,289
It wasn't like an event. No.

1281
00:55:37,289 --> 00:55:40,626
And if you ever won the cup in Amsterdam, you would get to experience

1282
00:55:40,626 --> 00:55:44,213
the real, like, the ceremonial side of it, which was one of the most experience.

1283
00:55:44,295 --> 00:55:47,298
Amazing, profound experiences that I've ever had in my life

1284
00:55:47,465 --> 00:55:51,219
was winning the Cup and then the Cup party afterwards

1285
00:55:51,219 --> 00:55:54,138
for the people that had won previously and then the Cup winners

1286
00:55:54,139 --> 00:55:55,974
and nobody else does anything really like that.

1287
00:55:55,974 --> 00:55:57,476
And but very ceremonial.

1288
00:55:57,476 --> 00:56:02,356
Good people, you know, Amsterdam, old Dutch cannabis cups, too.

1289
00:56:02,356 --> 00:56:03,899
Like the sweet prayer.

1290
00:56:03,898 --> 00:56:04,650
Oh, yeah.

1291
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:05,608
It's like a piece of art

1292
00:56:05,608 --> 00:56:08,778
by a pretty famous artist that you can only obtain by winning it.

1293
00:56:08,778 --> 00:56:10,739
Kind of. It's. It's a pretty unique thing.

1294
00:56:10,739 --> 00:56:12,324
Totally. I still have mine.

1295
00:56:12,324 --> 00:56:14,617
We got a bunch of other really cool

1296
00:56:14,701 --> 00:56:17,454
new ones, the US ones that were, like, real thick.

1297
00:56:17,454 --> 00:56:18,872
Yeah, they didn't bend like that.

1298
00:56:18,871 --> 00:56:20,706
You got to be careful with the European ones.

1299
00:56:20,706 --> 00:56:23,835
Like, yeah, they're soft, but really amazing art.

1300
00:56:24,043 --> 00:56:26,045
So yeah. So tell me what you're up to now.

1301
00:56:26,045 --> 00:56:29,132
Oh, well, when the world fell apart

1302
00:56:29,132 --> 00:56:32,635
in 2019, I kind of pulled back from the working world.

1303
00:56:32,635 --> 00:56:37,056
I've been doing consultations and stuff, but yeah, I've been going fishing.

1304
00:56:37,141 --> 00:56:38,767
Fishing? I see you're fishing.

1305
00:56:38,766 --> 00:56:41,686
That's great. I love fishing as well. I just don't have time for it.

1306
00:56:41,686 --> 00:56:42,520
There's all kinds of stuff.

1307
00:56:42,521 --> 00:56:43,063
I love that.

1308
00:56:43,063 --> 00:56:46,275
I just don't have time for because I have 5 minutes from the carpenter straight.

1309
00:56:46,275 --> 00:56:48,902
So like I roll a joint in my living room, I put my pull in the car.

1310
00:56:48,902 --> 00:56:50,528
Yeah, one of the car, like the joint.

1311
00:56:50,528 --> 00:56:53,824
I'm still smoking when I'm standing in the water, throwing it.

1312
00:56:53,907 --> 00:56:55,826
Yeah. It's awesome.

1313
00:56:55,867 --> 00:56:56,951
Yes. Yeah.

1314
00:56:56,952 --> 00:56:58,120
I mean, there's all kinds of stuff out there

1315
00:56:58,119 --> 00:57:01,123
too, but yeah, the stripers servers are awesome.

1316
00:57:01,331 --> 00:57:04,543
I mean, as far as work stuff goes,

1317
00:57:04,626 --> 00:57:07,504
when I moved here, we started, what am I, a brand?

1318
00:57:07,503 --> 00:57:07,920
Yeah.

1319
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:13,134
And we decided to go the manufacturer rather than the IP licensing route.

1320
00:57:13,135 --> 00:57:14,970
You know, we're going to make it ourselves, right?

1321
00:57:14,969 --> 00:57:18,639
So I got thrown into managing a commercial kitchen for the first time in my life.

1322
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:20,558
Would be fun.

1323
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:23,019
Yeah. Oh, man. Yeah. Serious experience. Yeah.

1324
00:57:23,019 --> 00:57:24,646
There's a big learning curve, though, too.

1325
00:57:24,646 --> 00:57:27,608
I sure know more about it than I ever thought I would know in my.

1326
00:57:27,608 --> 00:57:28,275
Yeah.

1327
00:57:28,275 --> 00:57:31,653
And what I've gotten really good at is that, you know, back to the amazing

1328
00:57:31,652 --> 00:57:37,491
thing is how to take a home cooks recipe and turn it into an soapy

1329
00:57:37,576 --> 00:57:41,746
recipe calculator and something you can hand to a contract manufacturer

1330
00:57:41,829 --> 00:57:43,623
to start turning on product. That's awesome.

1331
00:57:43,623 --> 00:57:44,707
This is what I offer to people now.

1332
00:57:44,708 --> 00:57:47,210
You know, I yeah, I work with people. I know and stuff.

1333
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:49,670
I'm not really fishing for clients, but like,

1334
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:52,673
I help people bring products to market basically.

1335
00:57:52,882 --> 00:57:54,884
but yeah, the whole efficiency side of your past ties

1336
00:57:54,885 --> 00:57:57,387
in really well to restaurants because at the end of the day

1337
00:57:57,387 --> 00:57:58,680
it's all about efficiency

1338
00:57:58,679 --> 00:58:01,432
because the more efficient you are, the more money you make.

1339
00:58:01,432 --> 00:58:05,103
But that goes all over like that goes with grow rooms too, and cultivation,

1340
00:58:05,103 --> 00:58:06,146
even seed production.

1341
00:58:06,146 --> 00:58:09,816
It's like the more efficient you are, the more money you can make.

1342
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:12,027
And it's not about money, but at the same time

1343
00:58:12,027 --> 00:58:12,818
you get to keep your lights on.

1344
00:58:12,818 --> 00:58:14,112
You got to pay your bills

1345
00:58:14,112 --> 00:58:16,572
and if you're going to do it, you might as well do it right.

1346
00:58:16,572 --> 00:58:19,033
And that's the same mentality that you've had is like

1347
00:58:19,034 --> 00:58:21,827
you've also got to develop processes, don't burn people out,

1348
00:58:21,827 --> 00:58:23,788
and then you want somebody to work with you long term.

1349
00:58:23,789 --> 00:58:27,876
You can't, you know, and some people can work really hard for a short term. Yep.

1350
00:58:27,918 --> 00:58:28,876
But it destroys the man.

1351
00:58:28,876 --> 00:58:31,295
And then what do you end up with there, seriously?

1352
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:32,297
I mean, it's a struggle.

1353
00:58:32,297 --> 00:58:35,300
You got guys working 12 hour days or something like that.

1354
00:58:35,467 --> 00:58:37,594
No, it's sustainable.

1355
00:58:37,677 --> 00:58:39,429
It's totally sustainable.

1356
00:58:39,429 --> 00:58:43,474
But also as a business owner, as opposed to an employee,

1357
00:58:43,474 --> 00:58:45,643
I mean, there's no work life balance for what I do, really.

1358
00:58:45,643 --> 00:58:46,811
But it's okay.

1359
00:58:46,811 --> 00:58:48,813
I enjoy what I'm doing every day.

1360
00:58:48,813 --> 00:58:50,565
You know, I'm friggin blessed to have a job

1361
00:58:50,565 --> 00:58:52,233
and my blessing and probably in life

1362
00:58:52,233 --> 00:58:55,069
is whenever I get a job with somebody, I work for somebody.

1363
00:58:55,070 --> 00:58:56,822
Yeah. Take it on as the culture of my life.

1364
00:58:56,822 --> 00:58:58,448
It's not just my job, right?

1365
00:58:58,447 --> 00:58:59,115
That's it.

1366
00:58:59,115 --> 00:59:00,617
You embody, the whole experience.

1367
00:59:00,617 --> 00:59:02,160
Yeah, well, it is an experience.

1368
00:59:02,159 --> 00:59:04,413
And I feel like each time, as you go through life,

1369
00:59:04,413 --> 00:59:06,873
you can gain some more knowledge and some more experience.

1370
00:59:06,873 --> 00:59:10,751
And yeah, it makes you a better person to, you know, it's like better

1371
00:59:10,835 --> 00:59:12,002
learning who you are.

1372
00:59:12,003 --> 00:59:14,338
I think that's the big thing in learning where you belong in the world.

1373
00:59:14,338 --> 00:59:17,342
And the more experiences you have that you can put it into perspective.

1374
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:17,884
I don't know.

1375
00:59:17,884 --> 00:59:19,594
I think we were talking about data points earlier

1376
00:59:19,594 --> 00:59:23,764
and I believe that even data points with that, the more experiences you have,

1377
00:59:23,764 --> 00:59:25,975
the more data points you can collect on who you really are

1378
00:59:25,976 --> 00:59:27,853
and who you want to be and where do you want to be?

1379
00:59:27,853 --> 00:59:31,523
Do you want to be working 12 to 16 hour days or do you want to work

1380
00:59:31,606 --> 00:59:34,609
for hour days and hang out on the beach?

1381
00:59:34,775 --> 00:59:37,445
You know what I mean? Because all those things are possible.

1382
00:59:37,445 --> 00:59:38,195
That's the beauty of it.

1383
00:59:38,195 --> 00:59:42,241
All those whatever you want to dream of, it's possible in this day and age.

1384
00:59:42,242 --> 00:59:45,579
It's possible if you make the right moves

1385
00:59:45,661 --> 00:59:47,705
in your efficient

1386
00:59:47,706 --> 00:59:48,874
efficiency is the key.

1387
00:59:48,873 --> 00:59:51,459
Yeah. cannabis, you're mostly smoke in your home grow.

1388
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:53,003
Do you go to the dispensaries?

1389
00:59:53,003 --> 00:59:55,547
I try not to go to dispensaries.

1390
00:59:55,547 --> 01:00:00,217
When I do go to dispensaries, Um, I'm really into CBCs right now.

1391
01:00:00,427 --> 01:00:02,095
Antibiotics are great.

1392
01:00:02,094 --> 01:00:03,012
Nice.

1393
01:00:03,012 --> 01:00:04,389
Also high times down on there.

1394
01:00:04,389 --> 01:00:07,099
That's a nice good stuff.

1395
01:00:07,099 --> 01:00:08,851
with the smoke personally.

1396
01:00:08,851 --> 01:00:11,312
Like, even though it's not like I can a really good weed.

1397
01:00:11,313 --> 01:00:11,980
I know what I'm doing.

1398
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:12,438
Yeah.

1399
01:00:12,438 --> 01:00:14,690
It's not always the best way I that's.

1400
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:16,942
Well, let's dive into that

1401
01:00:16,943 --> 01:00:18,445
another level in the weeds.

1402
01:00:18,445 --> 01:00:20,197
So do you grow soil? Do you grow coca?

1403
01:00:20,197 --> 01:00:22,282
What are your preference for as far as substrate.

1404
01:00:22,282 --> 01:00:25,869
All right In a perfect scenario for me, what if I have a dream?

1405
01:00:25,869 --> 01:00:26,411
Growing room.

1406
01:00:26,411 --> 01:00:30,373
It's in the Northeast in December,

1407
01:00:30,456 --> 01:00:34,877
drawing in winter air to cool the room, growing in Morocco

1408
01:00:34,878 --> 01:00:38,632
with salts and and hydrogen peroxide.

1409
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:40,425
Are you serious? God.

1410
01:00:40,425 --> 01:00:41,343
Oh, man.

1411
01:00:41,342 --> 01:00:43,802
I know you're going to be. Yeah. No. Nope.

1412
01:00:43,802 --> 01:00:44,846
No comment.

1413
01:00:44,846 --> 01:00:47,766
I grew up as a poor guy.

1414
01:00:47,766 --> 01:00:48,767
Sure, Me too.

1415
01:00:48,766 --> 01:00:52,853
I think most of us at least use it through a Lucas formula guy

1416
01:00:52,853 --> 01:00:55,356
with that same three part I learned about Lucas formula,

1417
01:00:55,356 --> 01:00:58,485
which is just like basically cutting out the

1418
01:00:58,568 --> 01:00:59,819
the grow portion of the two

1419
01:00:59,818 --> 01:01:03,239
part and balancing with just the micro and the flora.

1420
01:01:03,364 --> 01:01:04,490
Mm hmm.

1421
01:01:04,490 --> 01:01:09,496
Lower panels and more often feeding, you know, and the end goal

1422
01:01:09,496 --> 01:01:14,000
is, is something that's not going to play a role in the expression of the turkey.

1423
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,003
And in this plant, like it's a neutral element.

1424
01:01:17,128 --> 01:01:17,711
Sure.

1425
01:01:17,711 --> 01:01:22,342
It's not always my theory and starting out in this and then I did this for a while.

1426
01:01:22,342 --> 01:01:23,385
I got the job in high times.

1427
01:01:23,385 --> 01:01:25,845
I got to try all kinds of products that I did, you know, Sure.

1428
01:01:25,844 --> 01:01:27,304
Of the kind of care pro line.

1429
01:01:27,304 --> 01:01:29,890
I had a good experience about and a couple other things.

1430
01:01:29,891 --> 01:01:31,309
A lot of these guys I don't really like anymore,

1431
01:01:31,309 --> 01:01:33,019
they all got sold to

1432
01:01:33,018 --> 01:01:37,147
Monsanto's or whatever, but at the time, things I really like sure,

1433
01:01:37,231 --> 01:01:40,485
I went to see Greg Can Dogs Grow,

1434
01:01:40,485 --> 01:01:43,488
which to me still to this day was the best we ever smoked in my life.

1435
01:01:43,737 --> 01:01:45,531
Really? That's awesome.

1436
01:01:45,532 --> 01:01:48,660
Fucking, you know

1437
01:01:48,702 --> 01:01:49,369
Cam Dog I

1438
01:01:49,369 --> 01:01:52,454
think does really well and it's very cultivar specific.

1439
01:01:52,454 --> 01:01:54,164
And also if I saw that.

1440
01:01:54,164 --> 01:01:55,333
Yeah, that's it.

1441
01:01:55,333 --> 01:01:57,460
That's it. That's what you're doing.

1442
01:01:57,460 --> 01:01:59,253
And I do an indoor outdoor right now.

1443
01:01:59,253 --> 01:02:00,630
you do it outdoor as well.

1444
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:01,673
Salts. Yes.

1445
01:02:01,672 --> 01:02:03,465
So it's

1446
01:02:03,465 --> 01:02:06,219
often more often much lower

1447
01:02:06,219 --> 01:02:10,514
GPM feeding so I feed them like so outside you prefer that over soil.

1448
01:02:10,639 --> 01:02:14,935
I grew up Oh you grow soil with three part in

1449
01:02:15,018 --> 01:02:18,480
luger's formula of GM

1450
01:02:18,565 --> 01:02:21,775
and you're adding any microbes with

1451
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:25,780
no earthworm castings in there with your stuff or teas?

1452
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:26,656
No tea?

1453
01:02:26,655 --> 01:02:28,782
Not that I disrespect any of it. Yeah.

1454
01:02:28,782 --> 01:02:30,201
No, definitely.

1455
01:02:30,201 --> 01:02:31,244
Whatever works for you.

1456
01:02:31,244 --> 01:02:33,913
And I feel like you don't grow with all that stuff.

1457
01:02:33,913 --> 01:02:34,706
Yeah, I appreciate it.

1458
01:02:34,706 --> 01:02:37,083
And I love the guys that do that when you're a real smoker too.

1459
01:02:37,083 --> 01:02:40,420
So I know that you're not bullshitting because that's just amazing gift

1460
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:45,008
for for you philosophy in that pursuit of what I'm going to grow my with.

1461
01:02:45,175 --> 01:02:48,470
Yeah, I just want something to let the plant do the work.

1462
01:02:48,552 --> 01:02:50,596
I don't want any I don't want molasses.

1463
01:02:50,597 --> 01:02:53,850
I don't want anything that's going to flavor the weed like, yeah,

1464
01:02:53,932 --> 01:02:54,266
I don't know.

1465
01:02:54,266 --> 01:02:56,560
I feel like that's lower ownership, you know?

1466
01:02:56,561 --> 01:02:57,228
Yeah, yeah.

1467
01:02:57,228 --> 01:02:58,021
Great genetics.

1468
01:02:58,021 --> 01:03:00,648
That's where you start. I like it. Yeah.

1469
01:03:00,648 --> 01:03:04,486
James Legendary sitcom.

1470
01:03:04,568 --> 01:03:04,902
Yeah.

1471
01:03:04,902 --> 01:03:06,403
It's for some strange others, too.

1472
01:03:06,403 --> 01:03:08,780
Like, I agree 100%.

1473
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:10,407
Things are big eaters, man.

1474
01:03:10,407 --> 01:03:11,784
Like strawberry cough.

1475
01:03:11,784 --> 01:03:14,077
You can dump nitrogen afterwards.

1476
01:03:14,077 --> 01:03:15,621
So what are you going right now?

1477
01:03:15,621 --> 01:03:18,625
What flavor? So in 2019.

1478
01:03:18,666 --> 01:03:21,669
Former coworker I like a lot of guys by Norman Cusick.

1479
01:03:21,878 --> 01:03:22,586
Yeah.

1480
01:03:22,586 --> 01:03:25,547
Was going through some serious health problems and

1481
01:03:25,547 --> 01:03:28,759
we had just started an outdoor crop.

1482
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:32,347
I had bought some clones, I had pumpkin seeds.

1483
01:03:32,429 --> 01:03:37,143
We let the males go intentionally to out the just left the females a little bit.

1484
01:03:37,309 --> 01:03:37,809
Yeah.

1485
01:03:37,809 --> 01:03:39,895
The next season we call those Q6 beer

1486
01:03:39,896 --> 01:03:43,900
Donovan Brook, who is recovering from some pretty bad stuff and

1487
01:03:43,983 --> 01:03:48,028
but still around zero so actually we grow

1488
01:03:48,237 --> 01:03:52,908
30 of them 19 females first the F1 round

1489
01:03:52,992 --> 01:03:53,743
we kept

1490
01:03:53,742 --> 01:03:56,578
all the males stored the pollen together.

1491
01:03:56,579 --> 01:03:57,789
Maybe we should have kept them separate.

1492
01:03:57,789 --> 01:03:59,290
We kept you homogenized.

1493
01:03:59,289 --> 01:04:01,041
All the pollen. Yeah.

1494
01:04:01,041 --> 01:04:03,418
So for the next four seasons

1495
01:04:03,418 --> 01:04:07,339
after that, we would lightly pollinate everything and only save

1496
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:11,219
the seeds from the female that we're trying to isolate the one that we like.

1497
01:04:11,427 --> 01:04:15,306
Yeah, and maybe, just maybe, I'm work a free consultation of you right here.

1498
01:04:15,389 --> 01:04:16,556
Is that even make sense?

1499
01:04:16,556 --> 01:04:18,558
Sure. Sure. I mean, it's not the worst thing.

1500
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:21,187
I was hoping that eventually I would get more and more seeds.

1501
01:04:21,186 --> 01:04:23,146
That expresses vino, but that's not really what happened.

1502
01:04:23,146 --> 01:04:26,025
I tend to get well using that same pollen.

1503
01:04:26,025 --> 01:04:29,988
Yeah, you're going to get you're basically using that same pollen.

1504
01:04:29,987 --> 01:04:34,408
And it's almost like a back process is what you're doing to a degree.

1505
01:04:34,492 --> 01:04:35,493
So I would

1506
01:04:35,492 --> 01:04:38,621
suggest, you know, like these are regulars and it's not feminized.

1507
01:04:38,621 --> 01:04:44,001
So it's yeah, so I would select a new male and a new female and

1508
01:04:44,085 --> 01:04:47,380
each each time through each generation, instead of putting that pollen

1509
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:50,383
that has all this diversity, because each year you're

1510
01:04:50,382 --> 01:04:53,385
incorporating all that diversity back into the genetics, right?

1511
01:04:53,427 --> 01:04:55,096
Half of Yeah.

1512
01:04:55,096 --> 01:04:59,516
So and not knowing and it's like it's almost it's very much an experiment.

1513
01:04:59,516 --> 01:05:02,227
You don't really know what what you're going to get. Yeah.

1514
01:05:02,228 --> 01:05:04,563
No, no, no, no. And there's but there's nothing wrong with that.

1515
01:05:04,563 --> 01:05:07,942
I think a lot of people frown on it and they talk about pollen checking.

1516
01:05:07,942 --> 01:05:08,650
There's nothing wrong.

1517
01:05:08,650 --> 01:05:11,194
Everyone should be experimenting with pollen and making seeds.

1518
01:05:11,195 --> 01:05:15,240
I don't think there's anything wrong with pollen checking like that at all.

1519
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:18,286
I think this product, this project is a pursuit of pure joy.

1520
01:05:18,369 --> 01:05:19,746
This isn't a commercial thing we're just doing.

1521
01:05:19,746 --> 01:05:20,704
Yeah, I've never done it before.

1522
01:05:20,704 --> 01:05:22,956
We never had the access to, a space that we could do something like this.

1523
01:05:22,956 --> 01:05:23,415
So yeah.

1524
01:05:23,416 --> 01:05:28,171
So my friend Gordon, what he does, he's in Grass Valley

1525
01:05:28,253 --> 01:05:28,755
and he

1526
01:05:28,755 --> 01:05:32,633
takes seeds every year and homogenize everything.

1527
01:05:32,632 --> 01:05:34,968
So it's like the true open pollination

1528
01:05:34,969 --> 01:05:38,472
and he's getting new stuff to throw in there every year and he's mixing

1529
01:05:38,472 --> 01:05:41,476
all the seeds together and he's, he's got his own reasons for it.

1530
01:05:41,476 --> 01:05:43,728
He'll be on the show one of these days to talk about it.

1531
01:05:43,728 --> 01:05:46,396
Really cool, really, you know, but nature

1532
01:05:46,396 --> 01:05:49,400
the most diversity possible, you know

1533
01:05:49,525 --> 01:05:52,528
so and everyone's got their own style and their own things and

1534
01:05:52,737 --> 01:05:55,490
but I would be selecting I would get rid of that pollen or or,

1535
01:05:55,489 --> 01:05:56,406
you know, save the pollen.

1536
01:05:56,407 --> 01:05:59,577
But like, it's probably not going to be viable for that much longer.

1537
01:05:59,577 --> 01:06:03,206
What are you freezing it or

1538
01:06:03,289 --> 01:06:03,915
Yeah.

1539
01:06:03,914 --> 01:06:06,918
Stored in the high forties, maybe 45 degrees.

1540
01:06:07,001 --> 01:06:10,129
Yeah. It's still viable after three years

1541
01:06:10,213 --> 01:06:12,173
and they keep You should just keep using the pollen

1542
01:06:12,172 --> 01:06:14,508
every year to see how long that pollen lasts. That's what I would do.

1543
01:06:14,509 --> 01:06:17,512
I think that's a good experiment because I don't have an endgame.

1544
01:06:17,512 --> 01:06:17,762
Right.

1545
01:06:17,762 --> 01:06:20,097
We've just been doing whatever comes naturally

1546
01:06:20,097 --> 01:06:22,892
when the feminized pollen doesn't last nearly as long, for whatever reason.

1547
01:06:22,891 --> 01:06:23,643
That's interesting.

1548
01:06:23,643 --> 01:06:26,436
So, I mean, we're working on some pollen preservation

1549
01:06:26,436 --> 01:06:29,440
techniques and using things cryo.

1550
01:06:29,481 --> 01:06:33,152
Question to I have for you in this free consultation, I'm sure

1551
01:06:33,235 --> 01:06:37,989
I've had more than one female that I wished I had kept a clone of.

1552
01:06:38,032 --> 01:06:41,160
What could I have done like once you're already like a week, three or four

1553
01:06:41,159 --> 01:06:42,827
or five of flowering and you start to get a sense

1554
01:06:42,827 --> 01:06:46,916
of what you're okay, You're okay, You can revisit the plant.

1555
01:06:47,041 --> 01:06:48,876
Well, I tried that and it never worked out.

1556
01:06:48,876 --> 01:06:51,379
Then someone has to show you how to revenge correctly. That's it.

1557
01:06:51,378 --> 01:06:52,837
You ravaging.

1558
01:06:52,838 --> 01:06:53,297
So they.

1559
01:06:53,297 --> 01:06:55,840
They say revenge and you lose potency and all these other things.

1560
01:06:55,840 --> 01:07:01,054
But a lot of

1561
01:07:01,137 --> 01:07:01,764
well.

1562
01:07:01,764 --> 01:07:02,807
So here's the thing.

1563
01:07:02,806 --> 01:07:05,308
You have a plant and you pop seeds and you grow those seeds.

1564
01:07:05,309 --> 01:07:07,019
Well, there's this thing called sexual maturity

1565
01:07:07,018 --> 01:07:09,479
that happens over a couple of generations.

1566
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:12,900
So that's why when you are doing your selection process, your final hunting,

1567
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:14,693
you should probably grow it out multiple times, right?

1568
01:07:14,693 --> 01:07:18,447
Because it changes from that initial seed run through the first

1569
01:07:18,447 --> 01:07:21,992
generation of clones to the second generation and the third.

1570
01:07:21,992 --> 01:07:25,663
And then they stabilize pretty good to where they express the same.

1571
01:07:25,746 --> 01:07:30,418
And so that difference that you saw that could have just been from

1572
01:07:30,501 --> 01:07:33,170
the maturity of the plant,

1573
01:07:33,170 --> 01:07:35,715
not that it was that different and maybe growing it out, but

1574
01:07:35,715 --> 01:07:38,175
but either way you would have probably got a different plant,

1575
01:07:38,175 --> 01:07:39,760
something slightly different.

1576
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,138
And so that's why you want to grow them out multiple times.

1577
01:07:42,137 --> 01:07:44,389
And yeah, it's a trip like that.

1578
01:07:44,389 --> 01:07:48,853
And so we when we're doing our selection process, we're doing the final hunting.

1579
01:07:48,936 --> 01:07:52,940
We, we're going now from the first clonal generation

1580
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:55,900
rather than from seed indoors, especially.

1581
01:07:56,110 --> 01:07:59,697
So it saves time for the long run and you start getting a better picture

1582
01:07:59,697 --> 01:08:03,075
of what that expression is actually going to be over time.

1583
01:08:03,159 --> 01:08:05,327
And that's what's important.

1584
01:08:05,411 --> 01:08:08,456
So When I was much younger, we just used to grow that once and that's the winner.

1585
01:08:08,664 --> 01:08:10,374
Or this is the winner or that's the winner. Now.

1586
01:08:10,373 --> 01:08:11,000
It's like grow it up

1587
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,836
multiple times to really see what the best one is and how they change.

1588
01:08:14,836 --> 01:08:19,007
And a lot of times you have one out of 20 or 100

1589
01:08:19,132 --> 01:08:22,385
and you're like, This is the one, this is the best.

1590
01:08:22,595 --> 01:08:24,346
There's no way anything could be better than this.

1591
01:08:24,345 --> 01:08:27,348
And then you go to again, you're like, no, this is this is different.

1592
01:08:27,349 --> 01:08:29,560
This is the one this is better than that one

1593
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:32,938
or the one you grew out that you thought was the best isn't quite as good.

1594
01:08:32,938 --> 01:08:36,525
So you'll get stuff popping up that's good and stuff that's not as good.

1595
01:08:36,524 --> 01:08:38,277
And they change. And

1596
01:08:38,359 --> 01:08:41,697
it's all about taking detailed notes and

1597
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:42,614
also smoking.

1598
01:08:42,614 --> 01:08:44,867
Your product helps the cross that we have

1599
01:08:44,867 --> 01:08:46,118
that I've been talking about what we call it.

1600
01:08:46,118 --> 01:08:54,335
Q6 Nice things like, Oh yeah, the mother was a Royal Highness

1601
01:08:54,417 --> 01:08:57,921
female clone that I bought from Dark Heart Nursery on the legal market.

1602
01:08:58,005 --> 01:09:01,425
And the father I bought a ten pack of lemons

1603
01:09:01,425 --> 01:09:04,929
from Source genetics, Breast cancer school.

1604
01:09:05,011 --> 01:09:07,222
Yeah. And intentionally let them die.

1605
01:09:07,222 --> 01:09:08,056
Yeah.

1606
01:09:08,056 --> 01:09:09,140
And how is it? Smoke.

1607
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:09,849
It's delicious.

1608
01:09:09,850 --> 01:09:13,229
I love it. It's super citrusy. It's hybrid.

1609
01:09:13,229 --> 01:09:15,773
I mean, the Royal Highnesses of Green Cross.

1610
01:09:15,773 --> 01:09:17,983
It's. Yeah, big.

1611
01:09:17,983 --> 01:09:20,277
Nothing special, but big resonating glands.

1612
01:09:20,277 --> 01:09:22,112
You know, a good person.

1613
01:09:22,112 --> 01:09:23,447
Well, you just mentioned Gigi.

1614
01:09:23,447 --> 01:09:26,449
I think it gives us a great time to talk about the High Times cup in L.A..

1615
01:09:26,449 --> 01:09:31,871
When they released the Clones, they did a really smart thing that I'm not envious.

1616
01:09:32,081 --> 01:09:34,250
I maybe a little bit. I think they did it right.

1617
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:37,586
And I think it's worth sharing with people, too.

1618
01:09:37,670 --> 01:09:38,378
You know, I

1619
01:09:38,378 --> 01:09:41,381
really held genetics tight and close, and I we didn't let genetics out.

1620
01:09:41,381 --> 01:09:42,799
We didn't like letting our stuff out.

1621
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:44,635
We didn't like sharing it.

1622
01:09:44,635 --> 01:09:46,136
We want to keep it in house because we didn't

1623
01:09:46,136 --> 01:09:49,890
want it to blow up like pale blue Dream did.

1624
01:09:49,974 --> 01:09:51,766
Yeah.

1625
01:09:51,766 --> 01:09:53,769
Jesse Weil's recipes.

1626
01:09:53,769 --> 01:09:56,230
He went to the cup,

1627
01:09:56,229 --> 01:09:59,774
him and his crew went to the cup that they won in LA,

1628
01:09:59,858 --> 01:10:03,695
and they were giving out clones of gorilla glue, like literally giving it.

1629
01:10:03,695 --> 01:10:05,113
I think I got five or six clones.

1630
01:10:05,113 --> 01:10:08,576
I don't remember how many, but I brought them to Sonoma.

1631
01:10:08,617 --> 01:10:11,912
My buddy Josh and other people, we all we were all growing gorilla glue

1632
01:10:11,996 --> 01:10:15,291
and it was the Sour Diesel people, especially because it grew so similar.

1633
01:10:15,291 --> 01:10:20,253
It had an awesome gas profile, but instantly within a season

1634
01:10:20,462 --> 01:10:25,384
it changed the game, especially 90% of the guys growing sour quicker on sour.

1635
01:10:25,466 --> 01:10:26,759
So yeah, and it was good.

1636
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:29,430
And like they shared it and they shared they wanted to get it out there.

1637
01:10:29,430 --> 01:10:30,972
It was a really

1638
01:10:31,055 --> 01:10:32,181
business model that I think

1639
01:10:32,181 --> 01:10:36,185
people should be aware of and it's like sometimes sharing is the way to do it.

1640
01:10:36,270 --> 01:10:39,273
Sometimes it's not about how long you hold it to your

1641
01:10:39,314 --> 01:10:43,234
and that that strategy might really saved them in the long run too.

1642
01:10:43,234 --> 01:10:46,529
Did they get nailed by Gorilla Glue Company for copyright?

1643
01:10:46,738 --> 01:10:49,490
They they did. And then they had to beg for it.

1644
01:10:49,490 --> 01:10:50,408
But then was everywhere.

1645
01:10:50,408 --> 01:10:55,038
So it wasn't even, you know, was like, yeah, they spread the risk.

1646
01:10:55,122 --> 01:10:55,372
Oh, yeah.

1647
01:10:55,372 --> 01:10:58,792
That's a whole nother conversation about using names that,

1648
01:10:58,876 --> 01:11:02,171
you know, are copyrighted that are owned by other Disney.

1649
01:11:02,171 --> 01:11:04,381
Be careful. I wouldn't use any Disney.

1650
01:11:04,381 --> 01:11:04,923
You did.

1651
01:11:04,922 --> 01:11:07,467
Seriously, you guys get some Star Wars names?

1652
01:11:07,467 --> 01:11:10,386
I don't know like and I think a lot of stuff.

1653
01:11:10,386 --> 01:11:11,679
When it was the black market it was fine.

1654
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:14,516
But then moving into recreational where you have businesses

1655
01:11:14,515 --> 01:11:17,143
in a business address to send a cease and desist

1656
01:11:17,144 --> 01:11:20,146
like a badge of honor, you contact George Lucas and get the paperwork.

1657
01:11:20,314 --> 01:11:21,273
Yeah, he's not going to get.

1658
01:11:21,273 --> 01:11:25,194
Yeah, no and I think a lot of guys were that you know

1659
01:11:25,194 --> 01:11:28,614
in business they wear like badge of honor where they get a cease and desist.

1660
01:11:28,613 --> 01:11:32,784
And I think it's cool, but it can also be bad and slow you down,

1661
01:11:32,951 --> 01:11:36,747
especially if you have something super popular and then you want to call it

1662
01:11:36,788 --> 01:11:41,918
whatever beer, name, Disney name, something that's already taken.

1663
01:11:42,002 --> 01:11:43,670
It could slow you down. So.

1664
01:11:43,670 --> 01:11:45,713
So it's a balance. Yeah, it could be expensive.

1665
01:11:45,713 --> 01:11:48,300
I mean, I don't think like even like Skittles.

1666
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:50,427
Those guys would change the Z.

1667
01:11:50,426 --> 01:11:53,889
But I think Wrigley, who's also in cannabis,

1668
01:11:53,971 --> 01:11:59,060
they basically went after them and then I don't think they had to pay anything.

1669
01:11:59,060 --> 01:12:01,688
I just think that they had to change it to Z.

1670
01:12:01,688 --> 01:12:03,815
So you might get lucky, you might not.

1671
01:12:03,815 --> 01:12:06,234
And Starbucks got some of that money there.

1672
01:12:06,234 --> 01:12:08,194
I think. So.

1673
01:12:08,194 --> 01:12:10,029
Comedy,

1674
01:12:10,029 --> 01:12:11,989
it's it's a hard loss, man. I get you, man.

1675
01:12:11,989 --> 01:12:14,158
You don't want to be in the courtroom across from corporate lawyer.

1676
01:12:14,158 --> 01:12:17,161
No. And the thing is, is what I think a lot of people

1677
01:12:17,162 --> 01:12:19,164
don't understand is lawsuits cost a lot of money.

1678
01:12:19,163 --> 01:12:22,333
So even even if you win,

1679
01:12:22,417 --> 01:12:26,963
it costs time and even, you know, losing whatever, even if you're right,

1680
01:12:27,046 --> 01:12:31,384
you can totally spend an arm and a leg and it bankrupts companies.

1681
01:12:31,467 --> 01:12:34,262
Right. So lots of fun. Lawsuits are no fun.

1682
01:12:34,262 --> 01:12:35,680
And you know who wins and losses?

1683
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:38,307
Lawyers. The lawyers. Every time.

1684
01:12:38,307 --> 01:12:41,144
Every time the lawyers win, they're the winners.

1685
01:12:41,144 --> 01:12:41,979
I should have been away.

1686
01:12:41,979 --> 01:12:45,106
My mom was right. Yeah. Great job. They do.

1687
01:12:45,106 --> 01:12:47,525
There's. There's a need for stoner laws in the Bay Area.

1688
01:12:47,525 --> 01:12:48,484
Sure.

1689
01:12:48,484 --> 01:12:50,444
Yeah. I still, even though I lived here

1690
01:12:50,444 --> 01:12:53,657
getting close to ten years, I still feel like a New Yorker visiting.

1691
01:12:53,739 --> 01:12:54,992
Really? Yeah.

1692
01:12:54,992 --> 01:12:56,618
You don't feel part of the community yet?

1693
01:12:56,618 --> 01:12:58,704
I am part of the community. Yeah. Yeah.

1694
01:12:58,703 --> 01:13:01,622
But you still feel that you get the New Yorker vibe to it.

1695
01:13:01,622 --> 01:13:02,957
And like, Yeah, In New York.

1696
01:13:02,957 --> 01:13:04,292
You don't even want to change. That's.

1697
01:13:04,292 --> 01:13:05,460
That's what makes you who you are.

1698
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:07,503
I think especially now, like New York is.

1699
01:13:07,503 --> 01:13:09,506
I don't know if you've been there recently. It's crazy.

1700
01:13:09,506 --> 01:13:11,091
I haven't been.

1701
01:13:11,091 --> 01:13:14,094
There's like three dispensaries unlicensed on every block.

1702
01:13:14,261 --> 01:13:18,765
I got arrested in Europe multiple times for smoking cannabis in the late nineties.

1703
01:13:18,849 --> 01:13:19,181
Yeah.

1704
01:13:19,181 --> 01:13:23,478
And now it's like you can literally smoke weed anywhere.

1705
01:13:23,478 --> 01:13:27,608
You can smoke a cigaret, which to me is it's a beautiful another really nice one.

1706
01:13:27,608 --> 01:13:29,735
All they need is 12 plants per person.

1707
01:13:29,734 --> 01:13:34,572
If you have three people living in the apartments, 36 plants, it's amazing.

1708
01:13:34,655 --> 01:13:36,490
There's nothing that your landlord can do about it.

1709
01:13:36,490 --> 01:13:38,534
It's like,

1710
01:13:38,534 --> 01:13:41,496
Oh man, it's going to be a home grown capital of the world.

1711
01:13:41,662 --> 01:13:42,580
It's amazing.

1712
01:13:42,581 --> 01:13:44,916
There's a company and

1713
01:13:44,916 --> 01:13:47,918
I wish I can remember names of companies I would love to give a shout out to.

1714
01:13:48,127 --> 01:13:50,380
You know, Raekwon, the chef from the Wu-Tang

1715
01:13:50,380 --> 01:13:54,259
Clan, is an investor in a company that is trying to put

1716
01:13:54,342 --> 01:13:58,346
grow boxes in people's houses in mass that basically do everything.

1717
01:13:58,346 --> 01:14:01,432
So you pay this company to let you grow

1718
01:14:01,432 --> 01:14:04,435
your plant, count in your house for each year.

1719
01:14:04,519 --> 01:14:05,395
That's amazing.

1720
01:14:05,395 --> 01:14:06,355
It's like a service, like having

1721
01:14:06,354 --> 01:14:09,357
maybe a home, like a maid or something like that, you know?

1722
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:13,028
So do you remember speaking of Wu-Tang Clan High Times Cup?

1723
01:14:13,028 --> 01:14:16,030
I think it was 2012. It might have been 13.

1724
01:14:16,030 --> 01:14:19,658
Wu-Tang was on stage and they called Rico up.

1725
01:14:19,826 --> 01:14:20,284
Yeah.

1726
01:14:20,284 --> 01:14:24,747
And he he had been drinking and yeah,

1727
01:14:24,872 --> 01:14:28,793
he basically he replaced old Dirty Bastard in Lincoln.

1728
01:14:28,835 --> 01:14:30,045
It's on you, dude.

1729
01:14:30,045 --> 01:14:31,630
We should definitely put the link on the show.

1730
01:14:31,630 --> 01:14:34,382
But it was it was an amazing performance.

1731
01:14:34,382 --> 01:14:36,967
He threw up Mid-performance and kept going.

1732
01:14:36,967 --> 01:14:40,221
And it was it was Ghostface Killah was the headliner.

1733
01:14:40,221 --> 01:14:40,596
Yeah.

1734
01:14:40,596 --> 01:14:43,641
And he called five, four or five people from the audience.

1735
01:14:43,641 --> 01:14:44,225
Yeah.

1736
01:14:44,225 --> 01:14:47,978
Each do verses of the other Wu-Tang Clan members in the song.

1737
01:14:48,063 --> 01:14:48,980
Rico is one of them.

1738
01:14:48,979 --> 01:14:49,271
Yeah.

1739
01:14:49,271 --> 01:14:53,943
And like he was possessed by old Dirty Bastard for about 3 minutes.

1740
01:14:54,152 --> 01:14:55,487
It was amazing.

1741
01:14:55,487 --> 01:14:56,113
Yeah.

1742
01:14:56,113 --> 01:14:59,199
Oh, bastard him through the mouth, was he?

1743
01:14:59,198 --> 01:15:00,741
Literally if you go on stage

1744
01:15:00,742 --> 01:15:02,828
at night, man, like we went to the whiskey bar

1745
01:15:02,828 --> 01:15:05,539
and everyone was like kind of a popular late night spot.

1746
01:15:05,538 --> 01:15:07,666
Yeah We didn't even know he was in there.

1747
01:15:07,666 --> 01:15:10,377
The whole High Times crew was in there and we're reminiscing about all that.

1748
01:15:10,377 --> 01:15:11,128
That was so awesome.

1749
01:15:11,127 --> 01:15:13,420
It was like one of the greatest high times moments ever.

1750
01:15:13,421 --> 01:15:15,715
And he kind of sheepishly came over to us and was like,

1751
01:15:15,715 --> 01:15:17,384
So glad you said that, because he was embarrassing.

1752
01:15:17,384 --> 01:15:18,760
Like an asshole in my ear.

1753
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:20,137
Yeah, totally.

1754
01:15:20,136 --> 01:15:21,929
He was an amazing guy, man. Rest in peace.

1755
01:15:21,930 --> 01:15:23,265
One of the finest guys.

1756
01:15:23,265 --> 01:15:26,268
Totally best personality. Happy.

1757
01:15:26,434 --> 01:15:30,313
Some people, some comedians, some comedians in your joint.

1758
01:15:30,313 --> 01:15:32,858
And certainly these are right.

1759
01:15:32,858 --> 01:15:35,819
Totally. He was definitely one of those.

1760
01:15:35,902 --> 01:15:36,735
Yeah. Sad.

1761
01:15:36,735 --> 01:15:38,195
All the people were losing.

1762
01:15:38,195 --> 01:15:39,573
were losing.

1763
01:15:39,573 --> 01:15:42,284
what do you see happening with High Times?

1764
01:15:42,283 --> 01:15:42,951
What's your opinion?

1765
01:15:42,951 --> 01:15:45,912
High times now? What do you see happening with high times in the next five years?

1766
01:15:45,912 --> 01:15:48,373
I mean it's they have a great name still.

1767
01:15:48,372 --> 01:15:49,707
I mean, they tried the dispensary model

1768
01:15:49,707 --> 01:15:52,418
and it didn't seem like it worked out so well, at least here in California.

1769
01:15:52,418 --> 01:15:53,086
Let me say this.

1770
01:15:53,086 --> 01:15:55,463
I don't know. I don't know anybody who works for them right now.

1771
01:15:55,462 --> 01:15:56,088
Yeah.

1772
01:15:56,088 --> 01:15:57,215
Have no connection to any of them.

1773
01:15:57,215 --> 01:15:59,592
I don't it's I'm a I'm an observer.

1774
01:15:59,592 --> 01:16:01,677
And like, where I started when I was 15.

1775
01:16:01,677 --> 01:16:01,970
Right.

1776
01:16:01,970 --> 01:16:05,307
Well, every now and again, whatever, whoever did

1777
01:16:05,390 --> 01:16:08,935
the design on the storefronts for the High Times dispensaries now.

1778
01:16:08,935 --> 01:16:10,645
But I think you did a great job.

1779
01:16:10,645 --> 01:16:12,439
I don't know who you are managing a really good

1780
01:16:12,439 --> 01:16:14,190
totally a cover of a magazine

1781
01:16:14,189 --> 01:16:16,108
I drive past and I'm like, Holy shit, that's a fucking.

1782
01:16:16,109 --> 01:16:17,277
Yeah. Yeah.

1783
01:16:17,277 --> 01:16:18,944
I think they just closed in Oakland, right?

1784
01:16:18,944 --> 01:16:19,820
I don't know.

1785
01:16:19,820 --> 01:16:22,239
Yeah. Yeah, me either. I'm not really following along.

1786
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:24,909
I went in there once too, and it was kind of like going into a high times museum.

1787
01:16:24,909 --> 01:16:25,284
I was really.

1788
01:16:25,284 --> 01:16:27,912
I had a really proud former employee moment.

1789
01:16:27,912 --> 01:16:28,621
Nice.

1790
01:16:28,622 --> 01:16:31,833
I have mixed emotions about where I am in the world right now.

1791
01:16:31,875 --> 01:16:34,293
Yeah. Out of that, when I went to those shops.

1792
01:16:34,293 --> 01:16:34,877
Good job, man.

1793
01:16:34,877 --> 01:16:36,962
Heard Totally, yeah.

1794
01:16:36,962 --> 01:16:39,215
Michael Cerrone I haven't heard his name in a while.

1795
01:16:39,215 --> 01:16:42,135
He's, he's got sweet leaf grinders,

1796
01:16:42,217 --> 01:16:44,261
sweet leaves, the original that was there.

1797
01:16:44,261 --> 01:16:45,429
That's the problem with that grinder.

1798
01:16:45,430 --> 01:16:47,057
Unless you lose it, you never buy another one.

1799
01:16:47,056 --> 01:16:49,059
Like I still have one I bought like 30 years ago.

1800
01:16:49,059 --> 01:16:50,351
Totally.

1801
01:16:50,351 --> 01:16:52,269
Yeah, I like both. So there's two grinders.

1802
01:16:52,270 --> 01:16:54,356
I like there's only two grinders elegance.

1803
01:16:54,355 --> 01:16:56,733
Sweet Leaf is my classic.

1804
01:16:56,733 --> 01:16:58,193
And then I like the flour mill.

1805
01:16:58,193 --> 01:16:59,152
I think that's pretty cool.

1806
01:16:59,152 --> 01:17:01,904
Is that the one where the teeth kind of whirl around? Yeah.

1807
01:17:01,904 --> 01:17:03,739
And they have different plates that you can use

1808
01:17:03,739 --> 01:17:07,284
on their more expensive model, and so you can get different grinds.

1809
01:17:07,284 --> 01:17:10,954
I kind of like that is a fun little feature and kind of Yeah,

1810
01:17:11,038 --> 01:17:14,041
yeah they're, they're super cool but of a sweet leaf, you know.

1811
01:17:14,042 --> 01:17:17,045
I mean that's classic like, that's the original original grinder.

1812
01:17:17,045 --> 01:17:20,047
Before that, we were using scissors or we were using our hands.

1813
01:17:20,047 --> 01:17:22,050
We, I was breaking up stuff with my hands.

1814
01:17:22,050 --> 01:17:24,761
I went through a scissors, the shot glass. Totally.

1815
01:17:24,761 --> 01:17:25,678
That was where I graduated.

1816
01:17:25,677 --> 01:17:28,597
Who like the whiskers?

1817
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:30,933
The whiskers, The fiscal scissors.

1818
01:17:30,934 --> 01:17:31,266
Yeah.

1819
01:17:31,266 --> 01:17:33,936
And you go as fast as you can with this spring, chopping it up.

1820
01:17:33,936 --> 01:17:38,358
And but, you know, back then we were smoking like point 75 gram joint still.

1821
01:17:38,565 --> 01:17:39,400
Yeah.

1822
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:42,862
It would suck to do in a whole life to get it perfect.

1823
01:17:42,904 --> 01:17:44,489
Oh God.

1824
01:17:44,488 --> 01:17:48,117
Where you smoke in the joint in the seed pops and shoots out like you can see

1825
01:17:48,326 --> 01:17:50,619
if it's dark. You could see him shoot across the room.

1826
01:17:50,619 --> 01:17:51,912
Yeah. Good times.

1827
01:17:51,912 --> 01:17:54,832
So if people are looking to get in touch with you,

1828
01:17:54,832 --> 01:17:56,250
they're interested in consulting you.

1829
01:17:56,251 --> 01:17:57,502
So you're not taking on really clients,

1830
01:17:57,502 --> 01:18:01,256
but how can they find you on Instagram or social media?

1831
01:18:01,338 --> 01:18:05,801
I mean, I'm on Facebook and stuff, but honestly, I find my clients, I'm not,

1832
01:18:05,885 --> 01:18:08,887
so don't go looking for them because he's not there and that's it.

1833
01:18:09,012 --> 01:18:13,393
You know, that's how you, me, I tell you, you make them and you become exclusive.

1834
01:18:13,393 --> 01:18:15,645
Yeah,

1835
01:18:15,728 --> 01:18:16,729
yeah, yeah, yeah.

1836
01:18:16,729 --> 01:18:19,065
That's the false limited figure.

1837
01:18:19,064 --> 01:18:20,482
False limited marketing.

1838
01:18:20,483 --> 01:18:22,652
Yeah, that's totally.

1839
01:18:22,652 --> 01:18:23,694
I'm like, I'm a vibe worker.

1840
01:18:23,694 --> 01:18:25,195
Like, if I'm not into your project, I don't.

1841
01:18:25,195 --> 01:18:26,738
It's not that I don't care about your project

1842
01:18:26,738 --> 01:18:29,408
if I'm not into it personally, at some personal level, just

1843
01:18:29,408 --> 01:18:33,621
I don't see how I fit in and I don't do it totally, really cool, you know?

1844
01:18:33,704 --> 01:18:35,998
And that's great, great way to to be able to do that.

1845
01:18:35,998 --> 01:18:38,208
I don't think everybody is fortunate that they can

1846
01:18:38,208 --> 01:18:40,836
in a project that I didn't personally feel different.

1847
01:18:40,837 --> 01:18:42,922
That's nice.

1848
01:18:42,921 --> 01:18:44,965
Yeah. I mean I hope that

1849
01:18:44,966 --> 01:18:47,177
some I mean, I think Cup is doing a great job

1850
01:18:47,176 --> 01:18:50,179
Spano is is doing good and I think to do some cool stuff too know

1851
01:18:50,305 --> 01:18:56,269
Yeah a few guys from my era were like, Oh yeah, doing some of that so

1852
01:18:56,351 --> 01:18:57,604
I think you can call it.

1853
01:18:57,604 --> 01:18:59,439
Yeah.

1854
01:18:59,439 --> 01:19:01,983
And then there's Doug, Big shout out to Doug.

1855
01:19:01,983 --> 01:19:06,445
He hit me in Glass Chalice Masters like he threw the chalice.

1856
01:19:06,445 --> 01:19:08,155
That was, you know, all those events.

1857
01:19:08,155 --> 01:19:11,743
And I never got to judge a challenge by as a guy to run competitions.

1858
01:19:11,743 --> 01:19:15,747
I was super impressed with what he did, especially the presentation

1859
01:19:15,747 --> 01:19:19,667
in his judges kits that, yeah, he kind of set the bar for that.

1860
01:19:19,833 --> 01:19:22,086
Just yeah, just hit it out of the park with that.

1861
01:19:22,086 --> 01:19:24,380
I don't know. He's got an eye for detail too.

1862
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:25,632
Like on a different level.

1863
01:19:25,631 --> 01:19:28,009
On a different level than I have an eye for detail.

1864
01:19:28,009 --> 01:19:29,092
Like when it comes to genetics,

1865
01:19:29,092 --> 01:19:31,386
I love my genetics and stuff, but with logos and stuff.

1866
01:19:31,386 --> 01:19:34,724
Doug, Doug is all over that, so he's always had that eye.

1867
01:19:34,890 --> 01:19:37,851
So my business partner also that came up with the James Lab logo,

1868
01:19:37,851 --> 01:19:40,939
he's got that same eye for, Oh dude.

1869
01:19:40,939 --> 01:19:45,902
And just to know what's going to be what's going to look good and very stylish.

1870
01:19:45,984 --> 01:19:47,235
Not that I'm not that stylish.

1871
01:19:47,235 --> 01:19:50,238
I'm just I'm a genetics guy, so.

1872
01:19:50,238 --> 01:19:51,573
But yeah, lots of fun.

1873
01:19:51,573 --> 01:19:53,784
Well, dude, I really appreciate you coming on the show.

1874
01:19:53,784 --> 01:19:56,328
It's been great. Yeah, like you do. That's awesome.

1875
01:19:56,328 --> 01:19:57,287
Yeah. We'll have to do this again.

1876
01:19:57,287 --> 01:20:00,290
We'll get you in the wife next. So awesome.

1877
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:06,296
Thank you very much.

1878
01:20:06,381 --> 01:20:16,516
