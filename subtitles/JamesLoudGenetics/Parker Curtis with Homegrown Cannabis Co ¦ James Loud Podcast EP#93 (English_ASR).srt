on very recently totally how was that

19
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:12,158
experience working with him you know

20
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,719
it's um I I was a home grower myself and

21
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,080
uhu was growing in my spare room for

22
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:19,200
about 10 years and so kind of um working

23
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:22,759
in dispensaries and then finally for

24
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,600
homegrown yeah um you know I I didn't

25
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:28,680
work in media to begin with there and so

26
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:31,118
I've been kind of uh my role has been

27
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,000
expanding and developing so I think I've

28
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:36,599
been working with Nate now for about 5

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,438
years so yeah it's uh I get to rub

30
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:41,078
elbows with all kinds of cool people in

31
00:01:38,438 --> 00:01:42,919
the industry and it's been a great time

32
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:45,239
well this industry is so community-

33
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,478
based it it you know working in this

34
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:47,839
industry I don't feel like we're working

35
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:50,118
with celebrities even though some of

36
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,719
these guys are big names and but but a

37
00:01:50,118 --> 00:01:53,680
lot of them don't have egos some of them

38
00:01:51,718 --> 00:01:56,798
do some of them don't but a lot of great

39
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:00,320
people yeah it's um I I agree with that

40
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:02,360
I I I'm not um as in the scene as some

41
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:04,118
other people so I'll go to these events

42
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:06,519
and I'm meeting people and hearing about

43
00:02:04,118 --> 00:02:08,479
them for the first time and sure uh some

44
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:11,079
people get a little offended you haven't

45
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,640
heard of them before but a lot of really

46
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,440
great people you get to meet in passing

47
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:17,279
and and then I find out who they are of

48
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:18,959
you know after doing some research yeah

49
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,280
if it's Mike Tyson that's one thing but

50
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,400
guys in the Cannabis scene it's like

51
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,598
we're tomato Farmers potato Farmers I

52
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,239
think like we're not special in my

53
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:28,560
opinion we're special in our own right

54
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:30,439
for the stuff that we're doing but as

55
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,400
individuals we're just part of something

56
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:34,159
much bigger than ourselves yeah well I'm

57
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,920
I'm more comfortable getting my hands

58
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:39,239
dirty you know um uh transplanting stuff

59
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:41,238
building things and and I do like to

60
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:44,480
teach as well so I'm I'm trying to find

61
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:46,920
my my niche in the in the space you know

62
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:49,359
yeah and so we get to tour a lot of

63
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:51,479
really huge really nice facilities I

64
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,360
mean you got a great thing going on here

65
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:55,679
but um I was likening it to painting and

66
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,200
drawing you know when you're starting

67
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,719
out sketching you you might uh throw

68
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:02,479
some of your sketches in the trash but

69
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:04,878
uh and you can you can look to somebody

70
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:06,280
that's a master painter you know yeah

71
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:08,000
somebody that's got this perfect

72
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,680
portrait and it's it can almost be

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,199
discouraging right right and uh and the

74
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,879
thing that you hear a lot of times with

75
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,679
Instagram you just see the final

76
00:03:15,878 --> 00:03:19,719
beautiful finished product and you don't

77
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,799
necessarily see all the nitty-gritty the

78
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:26,158
problems along the way so um uh since I

79
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:27,599
started working with Nate we did a

80
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:30,120
greenhouse and that was my first time

81
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:32,518
growing outdoors and you know it's a

82
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,438
totally different skill set agreed you

83
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,280
uh I I see bugs out there that I've

84
00:03:34,438 --> 00:03:38,560
never seen in my life every time I go

85
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,239
out there and there beneficial bugs

86
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,080
there's all kinds of you know insects

87
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:46,560
and things for sure yeah yeah we had um

88
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:49,760
there's a guy um uh Matt Gates he's a

89
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,438
sink angel on Instagram and he's a bug

90
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:55,078
expert cannabis IPM specialist and we'll

91
00:03:52,438 --> 00:03:57,039
have him over and just walk and talk and

92
00:03:55,079 --> 00:04:00,799
you know there's plenty to find out

93
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:02,519
there it's uh yeah growing Outdoors is

94
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,438
um every year has been different for me

95
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:06,799
you know it's like a couple of years ago

96
00:04:04,438 --> 00:04:10,519
we got hit really hard with caterpillars

97
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,799
and um I hate tomato horn worms they are

98
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:15,680
the worst they get huge too they they

99
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,840
don't affect cannabis too much but they

100
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,358
do really they totally [ __ ] you I've had

101
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,198
the worst years of my life because of

102
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,478
tomato hornworms especially here in the

103
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,478
Bay Area you know and the thing is is if

104
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:28,360
you don't get them early enough they'll

105
00:04:25,478 --> 00:04:30,918
do severe damage and they'll eat on the

106
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,000
inside you you'll end up getting

107
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:34,560
Bettis right so yeah you get like a

108
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,680
secondary infection because they'll

109
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,038
they'll burrow they'll not only they're

110
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,519
eating your buds but then your plant

111
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:41,159
gets infected and you're like looking

112
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:42,799
for them and then the cola breaks off in

113
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,960
your hand and you have all this gry mold

114
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,160
on the inside it's like yeah it's it can

115
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:48,599
be a nightmare well it it gets a little

116
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,880
tough to show because you don't

117
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,120
necessarily want to broadcast that but

118
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,600
it's those are problems that a lot of

119
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,038
people deal with and so when you when

120
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,000
you look out and you just see the you

121
00:04:57,038 --> 00:05:01,879
know the the pretty finished Buds and

122
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,600
you don't NE necessarily see that most

123
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:06,079
people have to deal with that so it's

124
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,479
always the biggest best looking Bud too

125
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:09,639
you'll go out the next day and that

126
00:05:07,478 --> 00:05:11,359
thing is just wilted over it's a lot of

127
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:13,199
times it's the loudest plant too so it's

128
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,199
like the one that you love the most and

129
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,199
then it just gets attacked and then you

130
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,639
have to go yeah there's some people that

131
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,000
have nets for them there's all kinds of

132
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:23,360
preventative things you can do some

133
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,120
people use BT as a preventative a

134
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,199
parastic wasps are another one but uh

135
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,879
it's it's a difficult thing to deal with

136
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:31,240
and then also you know you got the head

137
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:32,639
lamps you get the headlamp you go out

138
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,680
before the sun rises you look for the

139
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,160
snail Trails basically your's been to a

140
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,120
strip club I've been using a UV light

141
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,759
too and they tend to come out on a full

142
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,639
moon and so the UV light you can spot

143
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,199
either the damage or the actual

144
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,400
caterpillars but some of those

145
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,360
strategies like with the BT like when I

146
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:52,758
got hit really hard it was when I was

147
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,720
spraying the most BT and you'd get these

148
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:56,439
things burrowed into the center stocks

149
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,080
and so you can douse these plants as

150
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:00,038
much as you want and they I you know

151
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,198
couldn't get rid of them you're manually

152
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:04,639
picking them off um so at this point

153
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:06,160
I've I have a a little garden planted

154
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,280
just outside of my Greenhouse where I

155
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,319
try to attract some of those predatory

156
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:13,279
species and I'll I'll throw a couple of

157
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:15,759
kind of sacrificial plants out that way

158
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:18,638
so eat them up uh you know just don't

159
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,479
get in the greenhouse and um it it

160
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,840
seemed to have helped a little bit but

161
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:24,399
yeah it's just kind of part of growing

162
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,439
Outdoors for sure and there's so many

163
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:27,439
things like that and there's so many

164
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:29,639
more variables growing Outdoors or in

165
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:31,719
green houses than there is indoors and

166
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,199
each season from one or one year to the

167
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,639
next can be completely different you get

168
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,000
a different amount of rain the different

169
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:40,240
amount of light yeah temperature swings

170
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,918
all these things can change yeah and um

171
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,639
you know Nate was talking about some of

172
00:06:42,918 --> 00:06:46,598
those plants that I had and they were I

173
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,240
think about seven and a half fet tall

174
00:06:46,598 --> 00:06:50,759
and they started getting over my fence

175
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,759
line and catching light from Neighbors

176
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:55,120
you know backyard porch lights and stuff

177
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:57,120
like that so yeah all these things that

178
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,800
I'm able to control in an indoor setting

179
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,560
where you know I don't have light leaks

180
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,439
I can I can m with the temperature and

181
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,639
humidity Outdoors you're just kind of at

182
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:06,759
the mercy of the elements yeah and you

183
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,680
know what I love indoor weed I love

184
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:11,960
smoking really good quality indoor

185
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:14,560

187
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,879
all this good flower I I love we just

188
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:22,680
had an event not so long ago TP namami

189
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:25,160
and I saw the most amazing collections

190
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,918
of sativas that I've i' ever in one

191
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,639
place in California especially maybe in

192
00:07:26,918 --> 00:07:32,519
Europe you see more right but all these

193
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:34,478
amazing flowers all these really pungent

194
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:36,399
pungent flowers and I love smoking the

195
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:38,719
pungent stuff I love it when it burns my

196
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:40,279
nose you know and you you don't get that

197
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,599
as much with indoor especially these

198
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:45,119
days uh you will find some stuff but

199
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:48,639
like especially those pungent nose

200
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,399
burning you know loud THS right we get

201
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,840
the skunks we get the Amon a little bit

202
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:55,758
of ammonia I saw and just like those

203
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:59,000
nose burning almost chemical smells

204
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:01,520
really good stuff yeah we did a series

205
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,038
up that Swami's place and you you can

206
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:07,198
see that especially for outdoor location

207
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:08,318
plays a big part in it like you know up

208
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,960
there where the humidity and

209
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,199
temperatures just right you get the fog

210
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:14,560
rolling in and seems where down down

211
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:17,280
where I am I'm in San Diego and we've

212
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:21,120
had a really humid couple of last years

213
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:23,478
and you know it's listening to Swami

214
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,879
talk about all that with u you know all

215
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:26,399
the different turpins that are produced

216
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,560
with natural sunlight you know the

217
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,799
lights have gotten a lot better now but

218
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,599
there is something to that it it's it's

219
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,120
a bummer that the market doesn't always

220
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:36,680
support that cuz uh it's a big

221
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,200
accomplishment to pull down a harvest

222
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:41,158
Outdoors well in in from one

223
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,719
microclimate to the next your plant can

224
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:44,559
perform completely different and a lot

225
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,000
of people don't understand that white

226
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:49,958
Thorn Rose growing on Johnny's farm at

227
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,399
Huckleberry Hill Farms versus Ridgeline

228
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:53,838
you can get a different expression of

229
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:55,919
the same plant and they're they're close

230
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,640
to each other but one Ridge to the next

231
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:59,078
you can get different environments and

232
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:00,278
with with different results for the

233
00:08:59,078 --> 00:09:01,679
flower

234
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:03,879
yeah and we'll have uh you know we have

235
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:05,719
a lot of new States just going legal and

236
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:08,559
and with homegrown we're we're shipping

237
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:11,000
seeds all across the US and so we give

238
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:13,838
Growers as people that are brand new to

239
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,039
it in places like uh Maine in the

240
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,440
midwest maybe a bit north where they

241
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:20,599
have a short growing season and they

242
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,399
they always have questions like you know

243
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,399
what's what's the best plant for this

244
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,519
and that and it's um I I wrote an

245
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:29,440
article about that kind of explaining it

246
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,959
because it's uh or at least from my

247
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,959
perspective right uh we get a lot of

248
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:36,639
indoor Growers tent Growers you know um

249
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:40,958
people kind of have to make use of the

250
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:42,240
space that they have so um it's like the

251
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:44,078
plants can be grown anywhere they're

252
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,799
hearty they want to live but you know if

253
00:09:44,078 --> 00:09:48,000
you're up north you want something with

254
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:52,399
a shorter flowering time it tends to be

255
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,839
indicia or an autof flower but um and

256
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,759
same thing with some of these tents and

257
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,680
stuff you might be limited on space but

258
00:09:55,759 --> 00:10:00,838
if you apply the the right techniques

259
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:03,078
like with training uh certain trimming

260
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:05,640
techniques you can you can make it work

261
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:07,359
with any cultivar that you really want

262
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:09,120
like it's it's about finding the right

263
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,360
plant that works for you and then

264
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,560
finding out a way to a way to grow it

265
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,839
there's a lot of right ways and there's

266
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:15,359
a lot of wrong ways to do it and it's

267
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,000
just finding your own path and that's

268
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,560
the beauty of it is like learning how to

269
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,519
grow you back in the day you really

270
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:23,278
needed a mentor I feel like most people

271
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,039
weren't just like oh I know how to grow

272
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:26,679
cannabis or I just get in my backyard

273
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:29,360
put it in my backyard I get good results

274
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:30,919
buy some seeds now with technology and

275
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,079
the internet if you're really passionate

276
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:34,838
about it you can watch podcasts you can

277
00:10:33,078 --> 00:10:38,120
watch videos on YouTube and really learn

278
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:40,000
how to grow yeah I used to be very

279
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,839
protected information kind of locked

280
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,839
down there I mean you could go read on

281
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,040
the forums or you could have a buddy

282
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,839
teach you but it used to be you know

283
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:49,679
even going to the hydro stores you had

284
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,839
to I've been around since before they

285
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:53,638
had internet I was cultivating you know

286
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,120
so yeah yeah you have to find somebody

287
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:58,039
and show you the way U some of these

288
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:00,039
hydr you know you have to go talk about

289
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:02,599
I want to grow very Tomatoes yeah

290
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:04,000
exactly if you said weed or cannabis or

291
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,079
anything they're kicking you out of the

292
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,039
store there us be Feds that would sit at

293
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:10,359
these hydro stores and follow people

294
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:12,159
people home and stuff so oh literally

295
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,079
yeah and I mean they were trying to get

296
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:15,879
store owners to turn on their [ __ ]

297
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:18,278
customers and stuff like that and I mean

298
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:20,360
it was a really strange world you know

299
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:22,838
and people went to prison for that kind

300
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:26,480
of stuff yeah well I I started growing

301
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:29,000
in 2010 or 2011 so you know we would

302
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,039
bring in our our supplies at night you

303
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,480
know bringing my hydro tables all my

304
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:35,278
rock wals that we would wait till the

305
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,720
sun came down and you're you're throwing

306
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:39,919
away your your spent material offside

307
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,839
like finding a dumpster doing it very

308
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:44,759
secretively because i' friends getting

309
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:47,040
their doors kicked down and so kind of

310
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:49,120
um and I like I talked to you earlier I

311
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:51,838
I worked in some dispensaries I actually

312
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,240
took back our first recreational patient

313
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,200
and so kind of being in it and when it

314
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,240
was full black market to uh

315
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,040
transitioning into recreational and now

316
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,360
I am you know we're making videos

317
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:04,480
showing people how to grow and it's uh

318
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,278
it's been quite the development it's

319
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,639
interesting to kind of be along for the

320
00:12:06,278 --> 00:12:11,000
ride yeah well San Diego is a fun place

321
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:13,039
I I worked in Fall Brook for a little

322
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,360
while which is San Diego County yeah

323
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:18,838
yeah but like the year after I was there

324
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,278
they had 120 degree day and I heard the

325
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:21,519
the seeds were they're making seeds in

326
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:24,480
the field hemp seeds and they were

327
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,560
popping like popcorn so it's it's got

328
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,360
some interesting climate

329
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:31,838
issues yeah I'm I'm south of downtown

330
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,759
San Diego it's it's like um a little bit

331
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:37,160
it's across the bay from cornado yeah so

332
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:38,799
um I have a small bubble that's where

333
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:40,759
I've lived my whole life and you know

334
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:42,399
there's challenge I mean you go up you

335
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:45,439
go up north where you have ideal

336
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:48,320
conditions and uh as you find out with

337
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,560
growing cannabis you rarely have ideal

338
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,480
conditions you have to roll with the

339
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:53,759
punches you have to mver things and it's

340
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,278
all about problem solving and you life

341
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:56,519
is all about problem solving this so if

342
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:58,399
you're a good Problem Solver you can

343
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:00,198
grow good cannabis for sure yeah it's

344
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,799
like setting up a grow you have to be

345
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:04,958
you have to be good at doing drywall of

346
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:06,519
Plumbing of you know sourcing all these

347
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:08,319
things literally back in the day when it

348
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:09,879
was super legal you had to do all that

349
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,079
stuff you had to be an electrician a

350
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:14,720
carpenter you know you had to figure

351
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:16,359
stuff out on your own and we mcgyver the

352
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,079
[ __ ] out of stuff you know what I mean

353
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,600
not not the safest ways either but it

354
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:21,638
was the only way we knew how to do it

355
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,759
without having help where we could

356
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:25,680
potentially get in trouble yeah and

357
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:29,000
that's um like we talked about kind of

358
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:30,599
finding my my space in the industry um

359
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,679
that that's that's still my life right

360
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,720
now I I'll do all that stuff myself I

361
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:38,919
got a I I I was growing in my spare room

362
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,720
and I've moved to a 10x 20 sheds so I've

363
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:43,519
converted that all into a grow room I

364
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:46,199
did uh insulation drywall I I did

365
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,320
concrete floors and water proofed it and

366
00:13:46,198 --> 00:13:50,078
so we've done videos kind of uh

367
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,120
renovating that and and setting it up

368
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:54,198
for a grow and you know it is nice

369
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,679
getting into these huge facilities and

370
00:13:54,198 --> 00:13:59,399
seeing everything just Immaculate like

371
00:13:56,679 --> 00:14:01,838
um Hospital quality right but for the

372
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:05,159
homeg grower it's uh how do I get this

373
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:07,560
done where do I go for this and um you

374
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:09,360
know because even when I'm fixing a pro

375
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:10,919
like you know trying to put together a

376
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,199
piece of furniture I got you'll end up

377
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:15,919
youtubing it right you'll end up looking

378
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:18,159
for somebody like an instructional video

379
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:20,838
on YouTube showing you how to do it yeah

380
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:23,719
and so I I tend to like that more you

381
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:26,000
know my my background before I got into

382
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:28,759
cannabis was in the medical field so I

383
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,639
would was an X-ray tech and a FLOTUS and

384
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:34,079
we would teach students on site and so

385
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:36,320
it kind of um you know I was hiding the

386
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:37,958
fact that I was growing while I was drug

387
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,160
testing people at work and then going

388
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:43,838
home and harvesting yeah so um you know

389
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:46,159
being uh going from instructing students

390
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,680
in the field to you know kind of making

391
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:50,198
instructional videos with how to grow

392
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:52,359
weed it uh it seems to have fallen in

393
00:14:50,198 --> 00:14:56,078
line well and I'm enjoying it good stuff

394
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:59,759
and so you are also I've heard a Jehovah

395
00:14:56,078 --> 00:15:01,599
Witness yeah yeah so uh you know funny

396
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,278
enough I was more more afraid about

397
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,680
being uh you know kind of caught and

398
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:10,480
shunned by the family than being caught

399
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:12,599
by the law yeah so um yeah they the you

400
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,560
know friends and family involved in that

401
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,278
didn't look too kindly on that you know

402
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:17,958
you weren't weren't supposed to smoke

403
00:15:16,278 --> 00:15:22,000
weed you weren't supposed to have long

404
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:24,000
hair no facial hair even yeah and um

405
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,198
yeah so you went in the other direction

406
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,120
on that one a little bit a little bit

407
00:15:26,198 --> 00:15:33,078
and so yeah well and I got my own place

408
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,879
and and started growing and you know

409
00:15:33,078 --> 00:15:37,958
family kind of distanced themselves from

410
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:40,198
me and then my dad came down with cancer

411
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:44,359
and you know they was always very very

412
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:46,278
against it and so we started making RSO

413
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:50,000
and and different extracts for different

414
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:51,838
applications and you know it's towards

415
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,078
towards the end you know I was smoking

416
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,160
weed with him and making medicine for

417
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:58,679
him from my own garden right and so to

418
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,799
see it kind of come full circle and and

419
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:01,799
find

420
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:03,719
have the appreciation for and uh you

421
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:06,318
know to produce your own medicine and

422
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,959
help others it it was a little

423
00:16:06,318 --> 00:16:11,838
vindicating the circumstances were a bit

424
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:13,518
sad but it it did uh it was a powerful

425
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,920
way to kind of close that chapter you

426
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,000
know get some recognition finally yeah

427
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:19,799
it's great when your parents can

428
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,879
recognize what you're doing is positive

429
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:24,958
or positive has positive impact in the

430
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:27,679
world I think it took my parents a while

431
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:28,758
to come to that conclusion you know they

432
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:30,519
I told them I was growing when I was

433
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:32,560
young younger they come home and visit

434
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:35,000
and I had to tell my dad I got plants in

435
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:38,278
the garage you got plants in the garage

436
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,120
no I got plants in the garage coming

437
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:42,639
home I gotta let you know I have plants

438
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,879
in the garage and you know because this

439
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,639
is in the 90s too so in the 90s it was

440
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:50,399
much more dangerous much more illegal

441
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:51,680
yeah and uh you know but I feel like my

442
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,240
parents are proud of me now in the

443
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:55,599
direction I've gone especially with

444
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:58,120
cannabis and I think they recognize that

445
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,079
it makes the world a better place and

446
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:04,279
the stigma for so long they demonized

447
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:06,558
cannabis and it it it was the General

448
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:10,199
thought that cannabis was bad marijuana

449
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:12,038
was bad dope dop yeah it's like uh reer

450
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:14,038
Madness and then pushing that agenda for

451
00:17:12,038 --> 00:17:16,759
a long time and really we've kind of

452
00:17:14,038 --> 00:17:17,879
done a 180 for the most part I think

453
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:20,798
more than half of the people in the

454
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:23,000
United States especially are predal

455
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:25,519
cannabis recreational whatever but I

456
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,199
feel like it's hard to argue that

457
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:28,599
cannabis isn't beneficial and people

458
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,600
shouldn't be able to use it as medicine

459
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:32,599
if

460
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:35,279
choose yeah you know have like like I

461
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:37,798
was telling you earlier so in in the

462
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:41,519
medical field it was kind of um started

463
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:43,038
in 2007 with that and that was um I I I

464
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:45,639
don't know if it was the peak but it was

465
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:48,798
definitely deep into the uh kind of over

466
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:51,640
overprescribing of opioids and you you'd

467
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:54,240
watch patients totally spiral with it

468
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,799
and you know they would um the doctors

469
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,960
would send them home with with buckets

470
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:00,839
of pills and you'd see these people just

471
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,319
take a nose dive with it and if they had

472
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:05,480
another option and if it wasn't

473
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:07,960
stigmatized uh they some of those people

474
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,679
might be alive today and it's it's uh

475
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,600
kind of sad to see but watching the

476
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,798
industry kind of unfold and and the

477
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:18,079
stigma kind of uh uh being Shed from

478
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:19,519
that is is quite special yeah I mean I'm

479
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:21,279
happy they're not putting as many people

480
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:23,038
in prison for cannabis you know it's

481
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:25,158
like on a federal level we need a change

482
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:27,079
stuff but I think there's definitely

483
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:29,039
less people going to prison for cannabis

484
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:31,678
Richard delisi

485
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:33,759
32 years and a 98e sentence we talk

486
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,240
about him a lot on my show I love his

487
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:37,038
story I love being able to share his

488
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,440
story the fact that he's out

489
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:42,240
now you know and you're working on a

490
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:45,320
project yeah well um just last week we

491
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:48,558
were out in at MJ biscon with 40 ton

492
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:51,038
representing Richard elisi uh and you

493
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:54,319
know he's got quite the story and it

494
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:56,759
it's people like that that have had to

495
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:59,240
sacrifice that we can all benefit from

496
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:01,558
it and it's it's tragic

497
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:05,240
and I've had uh friends get locked up as

498
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:07,079
well and you know it's now we're sitting

499
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:09,880
across the table talking about weed

500
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:12,119
smoking about weed and U showing people

501
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,480
how to grow weed and and um you know

502
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:15,759
you're always standing on the shoulders

503
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,038
of giants to get where you are well yeah

504
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:18,798
I mean the whole industry is on the

505
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:19,558
shoulders of giants if you look at all

506
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:22,158
these

507
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:23,558
breeders so-called breeders and Seed

508
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:25,480
producers and people that are working

509
00:19:23,558 --> 00:19:27,079
with genetics we're all on the shoulders

510
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,360
of giants and these guys

511
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:30,879
that did it before us and there was

512
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:32,839
people that did it before them and you

513
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,520
know these some of these guys went and

514
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:37,038
did some stuff that was super dangerous

515
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:38,839
and brought this stuff over here and did

516
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:43,359
some really amazing foundational

517
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:45,639
breeding in the 60s 7s 80s and even

518
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:49,639
stuff today which is pretty impressive

519
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:51,679
yeah it's um you know like I've been I

520
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:54,480
think I've been growing for 15 years now

521
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,120
so it was at the tail end of the black

522
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,400
market but yeah some some of these

523
00:19:56,119 --> 00:20:00,479
stories you hear you're like oh oh my

524
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,720
God but you know a lot of the people

525
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,440
just getting into it now aren't ever

526
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,079
going to know a time like that it's it's

527
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,960
like after um alcohol prohibition

528
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:11,000
totally we have short memories too and

529
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,200
even the people that experienced it they

530
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,079
may not have experienced it at that

531
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,720
level but people that were never in the

532
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:18,199
industry when it was really illegal

533
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:20,440
never understand you know their friends

534
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,679
getting murdered or people going to

535
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,880
prison for a plant and we're talking

536
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:26,759
about a plant that makes the world a

537
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:28,799
better place right I mean uh you get

538
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:31,319
people driving down from Humble and you

539
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:33,798
halls and uh you know they're risking

540
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:36,200
the next couple of Decades of their life

541
00:20:33,798 --> 00:20:40,798
and I think it was that's when it was

542
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:43,640
like between 48 and uh 44 or 48 to 4500

543
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:46,599
a pound you know yeah and U I had to

544
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,679
close down for about a year or so after

545
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:50,798
it went legal so it's it's great that it

546
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:54,038
went legal it's great that the access is

547
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:55,679
there but as a grower you know you're um

548
00:20:54,038 --> 00:20:57,798
you're subject to the market like that

549
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,320
you have to you have overhead you have

550
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:02,119
power Bells you have supplies you need

551
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:03,759
to get right and uh when the price drops

552
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:06,239
out the bottom you have to make some

553
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:08,640
tough decisions to try to get by yeah

554
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,359
and I mean I think a lot of us were used

555
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,960
to live in one Harvest to the next and

556
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:14,119
you'd almost run out of money by the

557
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:16,120
time depending but yeah I was one of

558
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:17,798
those people especially early on with

559
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:19,918
cannabis where you would almost run out

560
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:21,639
of money and you'd have to scrape by for

561
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,038
a couple weeks till your next Harvest

562
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,360
and I wasn't one some of my friends went

563
00:21:24,038 --> 00:21:28,919
really big and I was really afraid to go

564
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:30,158
big uh I had you know I I was one of

565
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:32,200
those guys with eight lights in the

566
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:34,760
house when some of my friends had 12

567
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:37,759
houses yeah yeah the the guy that I

568
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:39,798
learned from uh each brother had I think

569
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:42,359
like a three or four bedroom house with

570
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:44,359
the garage and you know they they had

571
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:46,278
clones and mothers in the bathroom they

572
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:48,839
sleeping in the kitchen and every room's

573
00:21:46,278 --> 00:21:51,319
blown up yeah so um you know that that

574
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:52,399
was the person that I learned from and

575
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:55,839
you know you go through all these

576
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,919
iterations of of uh different styles of

577
00:21:55,839 --> 00:22:02,399
growing I went from tried to do living

578
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:05,480
soil first run um ended up with you know

579
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,640
uh tables and aeroponics and all these

580
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,200
different things and it it takes a while

581
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,840
to sort through some of those because

582
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,278
you research and there's so much

583
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:14,918
information out there it can almost be

584
00:22:12,278 --> 00:22:17,079
overwhelming right so you kind of uh

585
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:19,038
having having a mentor having somebody

586
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:20,798
uh guide you and show you what has

587
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:24,720
worked for them and kind of building off

588
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:26,759
of that and perfecting it it uh that

589
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,679
that lesson took me years to

590
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:34,038
learn yeah I was so soil for the longest

591
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:36,080
time and now I use cocoa but I also love

592
00:22:34,038 --> 00:22:38,158
smoking soil and I also did soil in my

593
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:40,319
backyards at house but we have a sterile

594
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,960
facility right so like as sterile as

595
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:46,000
possible so we're really trying to

596
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,840
combat pests fungal pathogens stuff like

597
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,240
that start clean stay clean as our motto

598
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:52,199
we use rock wool in our Nursery we use

599
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,679
cocoa for pheno

600
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,278
hunting but I do love the way soil

601
00:22:54,679 --> 00:23:00,400
tastes same that's the nice thing about

602
00:22:57,278 --> 00:23:03,079
having the space that I have I have um

603
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:06,720
we'll do a bit of soil a bit of rock wo

604
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:08,759
a bit of cocoa and kind of um showcase

605
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,000
some of these different styles and U

606
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:13,038
help people find what works for them but

607
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,159
right uh for my indoor I've done pretty

608
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:18,038
much the same I'll I'll start in

609
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:20,559
Rockwall I'll transfer to Cocoa I can

610
00:23:18,038 --> 00:23:23,919
keep my lines clear you know I I'll run

611
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:25,519
U mineral-based nutrients so it keeps

612
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,000
all those drippers clear and then I can

613
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:29,960
still add my inoculant and my organic

614
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,038
inut and stuff like that as yeah but

615
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,840
I'll I'll hand I'll hand water or hand

616
00:23:32,038 --> 00:23:35,158
apply all that so it doesn't get in the

617
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:38,158
lines or anything I'm the same way we

618
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:40,480
flushed hand water but you know at scale

619
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,278
it's really difficult to do and I think

620
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,120
that's the hard part handw watering

621
00:23:42,278 --> 00:23:47,359
anything at scale is difficult to do um

622
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:49,079
but I find that putting beneficials in

623
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:50,439
that they're going to clog your lines a

624
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:52,319
lot of times so you can't really run

625
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:55,120
them through your lines and so Hand

626
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:57,000
watering our last week we've in Coco we

627
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:59,158
flush and it's all handw waterer flush

628
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,919
once a day and we go pretty heavy

629
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:04,000
but that creates an amazing product um

630
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,840
and and I love Coco I use Kayak Coco

631
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
right now but I've used Charco cor Cana

632
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:12,399
and gotten great results with both those

633
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,400
as well um and then nutrients I've tried

634
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,919
everything and I like I like a bunch of

635
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,600
different what have you settled on uh

636
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:20,559
right now we're using United and I'm a

637
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:23,759
big fan of United and their nutrients I

638
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:26,558
love the the end product really is the

639
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:28,480
best in my opinion that I've seen um but

640
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:31,440
I've used Athena and I've used cutting

641
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,200
Edge and I've used front row I I've been

642
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,159
thinking about using them I I talked to

643
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,360
one good yeah it's really good there

644
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:39,120
there's so many good ones out there

645
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:40,879
Cutting Edge I love John and Sean uh I

646
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:42,918
think they have a great product and I

647
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,679
think the flower comes out really

648
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:47,360
amazing uh you know and there's so many

649
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,278
you know Cana is a great company you

650
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:52,558
know I I work with Cana so I work with

651
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:54,919
Cana on Advertising I use Cana for my

652
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:56,879
clones I have a nutrient mix I use

653
00:24:54,919 --> 00:24:59,640
Canada they have can start it's really

654
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:03,120
great um and I like it because before I

655
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:05,120
I was using just United or Cutting Edge

656
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:06,719
or whatever I'd basically take three EC

657
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:09,158
I'd cut it down to

658
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,720
1.5 um and I just use a less

659
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:12,039
concentrated dose but the problem with

660
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,038
that is in the micros like you're

661
00:25:12,038 --> 00:25:17,079
getting half the micros really what you

662
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:20,398
want is more micros and so you want full

663
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:22,119
strength micros with a lower EC and so

664
00:25:20,398 --> 00:25:23,359
that's why I use that product and I feel

665
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:25,599
like there's going to be more products

666
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:28,918
out like that but I really like that

667
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:31,119
special product right now yeah it's

668
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:32,640
um like you can walk into the hydro

669
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:34,038
store and it gets a little overwhelming

670
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,720
right there's you walk down these aisles

671
00:25:34,038 --> 00:25:37,240
and there's just Endless Options all

672
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:40,159
these different lines that you maybe

673
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:41,759
haven't heard of yeah so um and and

674
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,000
sometimes I'll jump around you know I'll

675
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:46,398
get maybe some silica from one line

676
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,599
that's maybe a bit more affordable but

677
00:25:46,398 --> 00:25:50,678
for the most part I I try to keep it

678
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:52,798
simple because uh there's lines that you

679
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:56,960
can get you can customize every little

680
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:59,759
thing and for for me personally i' I'd

681
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,640
rather kind of uh work with a formula

682
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:02,919
and then and tweak that a bit rather

683
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,360
than having all these different

684
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:08,200
variables that are endlessly changeable

685
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:10,439
14 years ago I used to use 18 different

686
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,200
things you know and I was also using

687
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,798
soil too but I used 18 different things

688
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,759
Dark Energy one of my favorite products

689
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:18,440
of all time uh it's a seelp product but

690
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:22,000
we used to use Liquid Karma and then I

691
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:24,240
used Flora Nova and Botanicare together

692
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,759
yeah and I do like Simplicity I like

693
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,679
Simplicity and I like being able to get

694
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:30,720
repeated results and so and but Al I

695
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:33,038
have a R&amp;D facility what we do is R&amp;D

696
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,000
we're not growing flower for sale we're

697
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:37,319
we're testing stuff I'm literally doing

698
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,038
pheno hunting when I'm growing flow

699
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:42,599
strictly phenoh hunting and R&amp;D so we

700
00:26:40,038 --> 00:26:45,038
test one Nutri line against another we

701
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:48,558
test one light against another light we

702
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:51,599
we test under canopy versus Light Lift

703
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:54,158
versus uh you know the control and so

704
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:56,319
well you have to kind of um standardize

705
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,640
certain things to cut out the variables

706
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:59,200
that you don't want to test so you can

707
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,520
actually see the results of what you do

708
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,278
want to test right and we we usually

709
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:05,079
test one thing at a time so we only have

710
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:08,519
one variable that we change whether it's

711
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:10,158
soil versus cocoa or you know we the the

712
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:11,879
new one is really that the Light Lift so

713
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,600
we got the Horizon Light Lift versus the

714
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,600
Under canopy versus them together and

715
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:18,079
then we have the control that has none

716
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:20,319
it just has the standard light a

717
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:22,839
standard height and uh we're we're

718
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:27,639
looking for yield potential we're

719
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:29,678
looking for uh cannaboid Improvement uh

720
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:32,600
turpine Improvement all these things

721
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,159
we're comparing tpes versus canabo and

722
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:35,480
then we have coas where we're running

723
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,000
the same cultivar so we're really going

724
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:40,000
to be able to go okay this is better for

725
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,759
this reason and it's very scientific I

726
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,200
feel like that's the way to do it well

727
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:46,759
you have the right space to uh get some

728
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,679
Dependable results with that yeah and

729
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:51,359
it's at the end of the day so the reason

730
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:53,159
I like R&amp;D for myself is because I'm a

731
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:55,158
genetics guy right we sell seeds we sell

732
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:57,720
clones we sell germ plasm if I can

733
00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:59,440
Empower my customers and and the people

734
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:02,000
that buy our genetics to get better

735
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,600
results they're going to want to rely on

736
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,798
me in the future so it's not going to be

737
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:07,959
just a transactional relationship it's

738
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:09,398
going to be more of a long-term

739
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,200
relationship and I like those kind of

740
00:28:09,398 --> 00:28:13,359
relationships a lot more than oh here

741
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,840
just buy my seeds it's like oh yeah so

742
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:16,359
you bought those genetics last year well

743
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:18,720
look at what I found out about this we

744
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:20,319
can get better results with under canopy

745
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,399
you know if you can afford the lights

746
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:24,158
you have the electricity for it you can

747
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:25,359
get under canopy and basically we're

748
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,000
doing this this and this and you're

749
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:28,639
going to get this type of an improvement

750
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,359
on your yield

751
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,440
yeah well I think things like that are

752
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:34,439
what is going to set companies apart you

753
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:36,360
know like with homegrown that's what I

754
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,919
try to do I try to interface with

755
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:41,398
customers as often as I can I get all

756
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:43,159
kinds of people reaching out for advice

757
00:28:41,398 --> 00:28:46,798
uh sending me pictures of their plants

758
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:50,320
with uh a myriad of questions and you

759
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:52,440
know it's um you you have to have done

760
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:54,359
it before and and maybe even failed

761
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:56,640
before to to identify some of those

762
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:58,639
problems and be able to offer some type

763
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,960
of constructive help well making

764
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,038
mistakes is one of the best ways to

765
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,840
learn I feel like the the some of the

766
00:29:02,038 --> 00:29:05,640
smartest people and the people that are

767
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:07,839
doing it the best have made the most

768
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,200
mistakes I've learned from my mistakes

769
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:11,720
I've made tons of mistakes over the

770
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,319
years you know it's cultivation

771
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:16,640
everything business mistakes business

772
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:18,240
partners right learning from my mistakes

773
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,038
is you know one of the best ways I've

774
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,880
learned things and not I've learned as

775
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:26,158
much on what to do is what not to do you

776
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,320
know and also learning from other people

777
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,559
some of my friends have made crazy

778
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:30,158
mistakes where I'm like I don't ever

779
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:32,158
want to do that that's I'm glad they

780
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,559
made that mistake yeah there there's

781
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,880
some Pitfall I mean just like in any

782
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:39,599
industry any field there's some pitfalls

783
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,559
and there's some personalities that uh

784
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:44,599
kind of are archetypal they'll always be

785
00:29:41,558 --> 00:29:47,158
there no matter uh what aspect you're in

786
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:49,439
you know whether it's cannabis or any

787
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:51,720
other form of business but you know

788
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,600
cannabis it uh it seems like there's

789
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,839
there's enough space for everybody and

790
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:57,798
it should be yeah this overall positive

791
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:59,079
and uplifting thing and right you know

792
00:29:57,798 --> 00:30:01,278
some sometimes it can be a bit of a

793
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:03,798
mindfield try to navigate some of the

794
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:05,599
interpersonal relationships but they're

795
00:30:03,798 --> 00:30:08,639
out there in every industry though oh

796
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:10,798
exact out there and uh you know the

797
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,000
plant is supposed to help with the ego

798
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:15,599
so one of those things yeah just take a

799
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,200
grandma RSO and see how your ego is yeah

800
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:18,319
yeah exactly it'll really put your ego

801
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,000
in check and that's the beauty of the

802
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:21,269
plant and it kind of tunes Us in which

803
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,599
is so

804
00:30:21,269 --> 00:30:26,158
[Music]

805
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:28,558
beautiful yeah I think um you know it it

806
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,720
should just be this I think kind of

807
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:34,079
where the culture started with it is is

808
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:37,519
uh well to a degree but uh sharing

809
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:39,199
communal uplifting yeah and uh I you

810
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:41,159
know meeting people like you it's nice

811
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,038
to see that that that sentiment is

812
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:47,000
shared and still alive

813
00:30:44,038 --> 00:30:48,519
yeah so if you had some advice for

814
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,319
people learning you got any tips or

815
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:53,240
tricks on growing I mean I'm sure you

816
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:55,200
get to experience so many cool things

817
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:58,000
let's share some tips on cultivation

818
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,919
with the with the crowd yeah so for me

819
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,240
personally I I just kind of a lot of

820
00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:04,720
times I'll use things I have laying

821
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,759
around my house you know like um like

822
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,278
instead of a buying a a reservoir I

823
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:12,038
pulled an extra trash can back there I'm

824
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:14,798
I'm running that it's about 7500 gallon

825
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:17,079
or something so you you

826
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:18,839
know sometimes you'll talk to people and

827
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:20,398
they'll they'll give you a full list of

828
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:23,158
things that you need to get before you

829
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:26,439
even think about growing and you know

830
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:28,600
sometimes that can tally 5,000 plus

831
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:31,000
dollars if you look at every

832
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:34,000
somebody tells you you need to grow yeah

833
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,038
but uh realistically you can you can

834
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,159
grow with probably things that you have

835
00:31:36,038 --> 00:31:40,000
laying around your house right now and

836
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,399
so all these new customers just getting

837
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,759
into the field or you know getting into

838
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:46,719
growing for the first time it's easy to

839
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:48,879
get discouraged and there's never that

840
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,600
distracted and discouraged for sure yeah

841
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,360
and you know if you're going to wait and

842
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:55,119
push it off to the next season to get

843
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:57,359
started that's um not necessarily going

844
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:59,158
to help you like you were saying U

845
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:02,319
failing and building upon those

846
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:04,519
experiences is important so um if you're

847
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:06,319
thinking about growing and and I'll tell

848
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:09,679
people you don't you don't even need to

849
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:11,839
be consuming cannabis to appreciate the

850
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:14,080
process of growing it like I'm not uh

851
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:16,000
people that grow roses aren't smoking

852
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:17,759
them but uh they grow them because most

853
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,159
of them yeah they're they're beautiful

854
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:21,960
to grow and you can appreciate the

855
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:24,278
flowers on them right and so the you

856
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:26,000
know what I love about my role with

857
00:32:24,278 --> 00:32:28,798
homegrown you know I get to share seeds

858
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,919
with people I get to give advice to

859
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:32,798
people and encourage people to get into

860
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:34,840
growing for the very first time you know

861
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:37,440
I do love a good white Thorn Rose and I

862
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:38,959
love rosewater turt those TPS rosewater

863
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,440
turps are my favorite turps actually if

864
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:44,480
you were to say what's your favorite

865
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:47,840
TPS um I love rosewater like if it was

866
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,159
to be one flavor profile like I love I

867
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:51,519
mean I love so many different things but

868
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:54,080
rosewater Skittles like that's a great

869
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:56,759
combo yeah there you go yeah are you

870
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:57,839
going to get that in the breeding the

871
00:32:56,759 --> 00:32:59,359
yeah yeah we've been chasing that for

872
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:00,558
for a while there's a long story there

873
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:03,398
but like yeah that's something we've

874
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:05,119
been chasing my friend Tim humiston and

875
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:07,359
Kyle from can Organics had this

876
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:10,199
rosewater Skittles that was just it was

877
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:13,398
a creme Ros times Skittles and it was

878
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:15,399
rosewater turps it was the best and then

879
00:33:13,398 --> 00:33:17,479
that was from the initial seed run and

880
00:33:15,398 --> 00:33:18,879
then it changed and then I've been

881
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,558
chasing those turps ever since and I'm

882
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,320
gonna find them again well that's that's

883
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:24,839
the nice thing about sharing you know I

884
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:27,359
I know there's a couple of strains down

885
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:30,879
in my neck of the woods like yeah a bull

886
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:32,199
rider right so you know the more I mean

887
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,480
you don't want to give it to everybody

888
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,000
but you certainly want to share it

889
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,839
enough to where if you lose it you can

890
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,359
possibly get it back from a friend but

891
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:41,199
right you know that that was one of

892
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:43,479
those strains I'll see the name around

893
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:46,200
but that strain was was lost and it was

894
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:48,679
just this U it's kind of like blue dream

895
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:51,000
or something right it's once you've

896
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:53,159
grown it and smelled it and smoked it

897
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,599
you'll never not be able to identify

898
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:57,399
that you could Afghan bull rider yeah so

899
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:59,278
you could smell somebody smoking that 10

900
00:33:57,398 --> 00:34:01,079
years later and you'll know exactly what

901
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:02,440
it is it'll bring you back to this it's

902
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:04,240
like listening to a song you haven't

903
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,080
heard in years it'll bring you back to

904
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,039
this moment in time and you're like I

905
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:10,719
know what that is I smelled that before

906
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:12,519
that's another like debatable San Diego

907
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:14,759
NorCal thing there's definitely a San

908
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:17,039
Diego There's Tom cat piss Tom and his

909
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,760
cat piss from San Diego and I believe

910
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:21,759
there's a different one from the

911
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:23,320
bay uh but there it's a it's one of

912
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,839
those unmistakable things for me it's

913
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,240
like catpiss I know exactly what it

914
00:34:24,838 --> 00:34:27,799
smells like I haven't smelled it in

915
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:30,878
years and I can't wait till I get to

916
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:32,519
smell it again but it's unmistakable and

917
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:34,639
I you know same thing with rosew water

918
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:37,159
chirps yeah they stick with you they

919
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:39,159
imprint on you and and you uh you're

920
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:41,639
like I know exactly what that is or even

921
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:43,440
if you even if you come across a hybrid

922
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:44,878
that has that mixed in oh yeah Lamb's

923
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,000
bread is another one I'm like oh [ __ ]

924
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:49,118
Lambs bread I love that I love that

925
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,480
Aroma like when you just start out you

926
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,440
know there's there's so many different

927
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,119
cultivars but once you start um kind of

928
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,240
experiencing some of those and smelling

929
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:59,160
them and smoking them you it's you

930
00:34:57,239 --> 00:35:00,838
you'll Ur yourself at how you're able to

931
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:02,799
identify some of those when you look at

932
00:35:00,838 --> 00:35:05,440
new crosses and stuff you're like that

933
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,760
smells like uh this you know they'll be

934
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,519
like hey that's that's quite the guest

935
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:13,000

936
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:14,519
well and you know it goes you can look

937
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,119
at food like that is collecting data

938
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:17,400
points over time you want to be a really

939
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:18,880
good breeder you want to be a really

940
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,559
good Chef collect a lot of data points

941
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,240
by trying different things experiencing

942
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:24,279
different things and store those in the

943
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:26,479
back of your mind and then you revisit

944
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:29,359
them they almost become nostalgic I

945
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,358
have uh smells from childhood my mother

946
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:33,880
was a baker so she had a bakery and she

947
00:35:31,358 --> 00:35:36,400
used to bake bread and I get nostalgic

948
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:39,000
when I smell certain smells uh

949
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,559
coriander uh when people break yeah

950
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000

951
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:44,239
like that's just you know it's like one

952
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,039
those oh brings me back to Childhood

953
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:47,598
candy canes we used to do gingerbread

954
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:49,358
houses when I smell Ginger I have a I

955
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:52,880
have a genetic that has gingerbread on

956
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:53,960
the nose like heavy heavy gingerbread

957
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,400

958
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,720
oh my God it's Ginger I've never smoked

959
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,240
gingerbread on cannabis and it's like

960
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:59,799
yeah I've seen it before too but this is

961
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:01,000
the strongest I've seen it well it's so

962
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,039
responsive you know you get all these

963
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,760
tur profiles that you wouldn't think a

964
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:06,559
plant would be able to produce and

965
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,319
you're like smell this it smells like

966
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:10,679
you know exactly like fried chicken or

967
00:36:08,318 --> 00:36:12,880
exactly like this and there's so so many

968
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:14,639
things the plant is so diverse and

969
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,640
there's so many different things that

970
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:18,719
you can go in these different directions

971
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:20,400
and green tea you know you can go all

972
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:23,439
these Savory things to all these dessert

973
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,559
strains to all these fruits uh you know

974
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,760
tropical fruits even too it's like it's

975
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:30,279
wild when you get into these guavas and

976
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,280
these mangoes I wonder how much is the

977
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:34,839
power of suggestion versus you know

978
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:37,240
because some of them you're like you're

979
00:36:34,838 --> 00:36:38,920
like I you'll they'll tell you what it

980
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:41,239
is and you'll smell it and you're like

981
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:43,079
this smells exactly like like what you

982
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:46,279
just described and it's it's a little

983
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:49,920
trippy well I coming from someone who

984
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:51,880
has experience with food and with flavor

985
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,400
profiles there's a lot of that that's

986
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,519
real it's not just the power of

987
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:58,358
suggestion I I could I pick up these

988
00:36:55,519 --> 00:37:00,800
notes and I feel like you know we studi

989
00:36:58,358 --> 00:37:02,759
Tarpin and now flavorant that's another

990
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,200
abstracts tech did a bunch of white

991
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:08,560
papers they had white papers published

992
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:10,879
uh 2024 that talk about flavorants

993
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:13,920
sulfur based compounds we call them THS

994
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,680
as well and they contribute heavily to

995
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,200
the aroma now it's a flavor molecule

996
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:19,879
that's much smaller than a turpine so

997
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:22,000
it's been harder to study but these guys

998
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:23,760
have you know taken it outside the box

999
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,199
and really from an outside the box

1000
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,680
perspective gone in did scientific

1001
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:29,719
studies and now we can start start

1002
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:31,838
having these conversations it's not just

1003
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:34,598
about tpin well and all those molecules

1004
00:37:31,838 --> 00:37:36,960
they modulate the high as well right so

1005
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:39,480
um like you would you were talking to

1006
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,679
Nate about beers and stuff you know so

1007
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:43,880
you know like hops is a cousin yeah

1008
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:46,159
hoppy beers you know one one of the one

1009
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:48,200
of the predominant tpping in hops is

1010
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:50,838
mercing right and you know you drink a

1011
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:52,799
Corona versus a a heavy IPA you get a

1012
00:37:50,838 --> 00:37:55,358
little tired right I mean aside from

1013
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,800
just the alcohol so it's all that mering

1014
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:59,318
in there that you're that you're

1015
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,839
intaking and so you can kind of see that

1016
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:02,639
uh you know the mercing that's in a lot

1017
00:38:00,838 --> 00:38:04,559
of indiga strains you know you end up

1018
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:07,199
being get more of that couch lock

1019
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:09,719
sedated feel yeah and so when you see

1020
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:12,039
how some of these and even like lemoning

1021
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:13,639
right it's a a bit it kind of wakes you

1022
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:16,199
up it's a bit more vibrant and when you

1023
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:18,199
get that present in cannabis a lot of

1024
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:20,039
times that's in sativas and it has this

1025
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:23,399
kind of energizing effect kind of wakes

1026
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:26,519
you up right oh and I wanted to mention

1027
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:28,000
too um I I was ask you about that did

1028
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:30,119
you find that outside the parking lot

1029
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,280
where did you get that I was looking for

1030
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:34,720
you at MJ biscon but I brought a bucket

1031
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:37,119
of these and you know yeah just like uh

1032
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:39,799
just like sharing strains and stuff uh

1033
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:41,519
I've been you know there there's a few

1034
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,640
different plants that I've been

1035
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:45,838
cultivating in my garden there's other

1036
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:48,159
uh you know other classes of plants that

1037
00:38:45,838 --> 00:38:50,078
are magical that have um unique

1038
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:52,480
properties and so well these are fully

1039
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:55,400
legal they're ornamental absolutely in

1040
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,880
the US I see them at Home Depot for sale

1041
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:00,400
exactly um but yes the San Pedro Cactus

1042
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:02,119
is very common in the East Bay yeah once

1043
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,920
you get the eye for them you you're able

1044
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:06,160
to identify them there are a bunch of

1045
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,639
species that at first glance you might

1046
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:10,960
think that are Sedro have five sides

1047
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:14,559
seven seven sides to a San Pedro correct

1048
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:17,240
so um that that's like uh they can vary

1049
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:19,960
they can even vary on one column oh

1050
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:22,559
really but it's kind of like saying oh

1051
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:26,280
cannabis has this many uh lobes on a

1052
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:28,799
leaf yeah and you know it can vary but

1053
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:30,960
um I did bring some Pedro but this one

1054
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:34,680
is a little bit less common this is the

1055
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:37,079
Peruvian Torch wow it's the tras serus

1056
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:38,960
brii and uh but yeah they grow really

1057
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:40,440
well so I brought a few that you can

1058
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,880
plant in your garden here and maybe you

1059
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:44,559
can share with other people down the

1060
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:46,599
road as well we normally don't even let

1061
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:48,639
plants in the building no one's allowed

1062
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:51,079
to bring fresh fruit in so they they you

1063
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:53,759
snuck by security oh I'm have to

1064
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:55,359
confiscate that you can confiscate I'll

1065
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,079
toss it across the table too yeah yeah

1066
00:39:55,358 --> 00:39:58,920
no no no it's it's okay no I think it's

1067
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:01,119
great the podcast yeah normally just so

1068
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:03,639
people know yeah we don't let any fruits

1069
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:05,480
or vegetable that that basically are

1070
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:07,679
uncooked in the building you have some

1071
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:10,400
stuff in a tupperware whatever for

1072
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:11,480
employees but uh yeah we don't allow we

1073
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,599
everything I was looking for a

1074
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:15,159
tupperware that would fit this but I I

1075
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:17,519
didn't have any luck I have some glass

1076
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:18,759
jars that might work yeah that's really

1077
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:21,920
cool I'll definitely put that at the

1078
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:24,079
house I I love uh Cactus and watching

1079
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:27,119
cactus grow it's just they have the the

1080
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:28,800
most beautiful flowers too but yeah they

1081
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,680
uh they tend to grow faster than any

1082
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,000
other Cactus you'll plant and it's it's

1083
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:33,879
a nice thing to have how many inches a

1084
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,358
year do they roughly grow uh this one's

1085
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:38,599
a little slower growing than the regular

1086
00:40:36,358 --> 00:40:40,719
Sedro that one's like I think anywhere

1087
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:43,880
from 12 to 18 Ines a year once it's

1088
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:45,439
happy but this one I've had growing I

1089
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:48,960
got them all in my front yard I've had

1090
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:51,599
this one growing for probably 12 years

1091
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:54,880
and this one's never flowered the other

1092
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:58,280
one flowers a couple of times a year so

1093
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:01,039
yeah but um yeah this this one's uh I

1094
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:04,160
think this one has about 20% masculine

1095
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:06,000
so it's legal to grow legal to own but

1096
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:08,960
if you process it it turns into a

1097
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,880
schedule one substance right yeah but

1098
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,440
you know pretty flowers and it's nice to

1099
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,160
grow in the garden they're beautiful

1100
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:17,079
yeah Cactus is just amazing to watch and

1101
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:19,799
I mean I like growing everything so I'm

1102
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:21,800
I'm super into growing vegetables too

1103
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:23,800
that's my main focus besides cannabis I

1104
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:26,400
love growing tomatoes and peppers and

1105
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:28,680
zucchini and you name it if you can eat

1106
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,920
it I love growing it it's just I love

1107
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:31,919
consuming stuff that I grow especially

1108
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,240
that's like one of the things that

1109
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,200
excites me the most is to be able to

1110
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:36,399
grow a tomato even though I don't eat a

1111
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:38,919
lot of tomatoes and I definitely don't

1112
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,599
eat them off season but they taste they

1113
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,400
taste better they taste different milon

1114
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:45,240
times better and even cannabis you know

1115
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:47,838
it might not be the uh the next Cannabis

1116
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:50,358
Cup winter but the fact that you grew it

1117
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:52,279
you put the time and the energy into it

1118
00:41:50,358 --> 00:41:54,159
it it tastes it tastes different to

1119
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:56,359
smoke your own your own weed that you

1120
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:57,920
grew it's pretty amazing I love plant

1121
00:41:56,358 --> 00:42:00,679
medicine and all it forms too and

1122
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,440
there's so many forms that we are

1123
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:05,000
revisiting now that have been used for

1124
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:07,838
thousands of years you know it's it's

1125
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:11,960
pretty wild uh you know

1126
00:42:07,838 --> 00:42:14,719
how Western medicine uh has really like

1127
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:16,519
they basically went like monochem we're

1128
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:19,318
having this one thing that cures this

1129
00:42:16,519 --> 00:42:21,920
one element where where a lot of these

1130
00:42:19,318 --> 00:42:24,279
full spectrum products like cannabis

1131
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:26,760
they do a lot they do so many things

1132
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:28,839
when I worked in the medical field you'd

1133
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:30,880
get you get medicines like uh

1134
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:33,719
antiemetics that help with nause and

1135
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,920
things like that and there's always a

1136
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:37,759
there's always an a natural option you

1137
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:40,240
know you can eat ginger instead of

1138
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,520
waiting in a a a waiting room with a

1139
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:45,519
bunch of sick people because you're

1140
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:50,000
nauseous and uh some people you know

1141
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:52,318
tend to trust doctors more and you know

1142
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,920
modern medicine is a wonderful thing and

1143
00:42:52,318 --> 00:42:58,239
there's lots of advantages to it but

1144
00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:00,400
there's U there's so many s you can fix

1145
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:01,879
just with things that you can grow

1146
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,079
things you're able to produce on your

1147
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:07,358
own and you don't always you know just

1148
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:10,559
having the ability to you know if you

1149
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:12,838
have joint pain or you're suffering from

1150
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:16,599
a number of ailments cannabis covers

1151
00:43:12,838 --> 00:43:18,239
like I I think cannabis will cover more

1152
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:20,599
uh more symptoms than just about

1153
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:22,838
anything yeah and you don't even have to

1154
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:25,880
smoke it or eat it necessarily you can

1155
00:43:22,838 --> 00:43:28,400
make it into topicals uh there's so many

1156
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:30,280
applications you can use for so to be

1157
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,240
able I mean and with the least amount of

1158
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:34,760
side effect right so we can talk about

1159
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:36,879
stuff that cures cancer and and we can

1160
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:39,040
talk about stuff that cures all these

1161
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:41,358
different things with heavy side effects

1162
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:43,759
with Western medicine whereas you have

1163
00:43:41,358 --> 00:43:47,759
minimal side effects with cannabis or

1164
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:51,440
with plant medicine yeah we um one of uh

1165
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:53,440
one of my friends he's um I I grew up

1166
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:57,159
with him he's like my dad's age but yeah

1167
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:59,280
came down with with cancer yeah and we

1168
00:43:57,159 --> 00:44:03,118
showed him how to make RSO on his own

1169
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:06,480
and he decided to take that and monitor

1170
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:09,680
with his doctor he forent surgery or

1171
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,679
chemotherapy and was able to cure his

1172
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:14,558
cancer with with no surgical

1173
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:16,078
intervention no chemo no radiation yeah

1174
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:18,680
and I think he's been cancer-free for

1175
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:21,359
about six years now and that's with the

1176
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:23,919
RSO that I had grown and showed him how

1177
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:26,318
to extract and stuff so so let's take a

1178
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,800
deep dive into RSO I would love to I

1179
00:44:26,318 --> 00:44:29,358
would I think a lot no one's really

1180
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:31,079
talked about on the show we've filmed

1181
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:33,239
over 90 episodes and we haven't really

1182
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:35,079
talked about an RSO recipe and I think

1183
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:36,759
there's a lot of curious people that

1184
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:41,599
watch this show that would love to hear

1185
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:44,240
about making RSO yeah so when I um I

1186
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:47,160
hadn't produced it prior to finding out

1187
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:50,639
that my dad had uh come down with cancer

1188
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:55,039
yeah so Rick Simpson uses denatured

1189
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:58,799
alcohol which is not not great you know

1190
00:44:55,039 --> 00:45:00,759
it's um uh it's poisonous right like you

1191
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:04,599
can't drink that like an Ever Clear or

1192
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:06,400
something so I opted going blind right

1193
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:10,000
yeah so when I was making it I think it

1194
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:13,280
was um 2014 that I was making that for

1195
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:16,559
him and we started to go with uh you can

1196
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:20,480
either use ever CLE or U most recently

1197
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:23,119
I've been using a 200 proof food grade

1198
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:25,119
ethanol yeah so you have to be careful

1199
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:27,480
with that I I would suggest doing it

1200
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:31,200
outside if you're able to but you

1201
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:34,318
basically make like a a big um tea bag

1202
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:35,960
that you'll steepen it right so um if if

1203
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:37,800
I'm telling people how to make it at

1204
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:39,400
home I'll just use one of those like a

1205
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:42,720
French press that you would make coffee

1206
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:45,519
in and you I think you you blend it up

1207
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:48,919
and you can usually get about maybe 3 to

1208
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:50,960
4 ounces in a container like that mhm so

1209
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:53,800
when you're normally making hash you

1210
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:55,720
don't want to agitate it too much you

1211
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:57,800
don't want that chlorophyll to bleed

1212
00:45:55,719 --> 00:46:00,439
through into your extracts right but

1213
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:02,079
with RSO some of those chlorophylls and

1214
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:03,679
and some of those enzymes in the plant

1215
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:07,640
tissue is exactly what you're looking

1216
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:10,239
for so RSO or whole plant extract you

1217
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:12,759
know you're you're not looking for your

1218
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:15,039
top quality buds necessarily although

1219
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:17,040
you can have those mixed in but a lot of

1220
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:19,400
times it's the things that people throw

1221
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:21,079
away You're I mean you're you're

1222
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:24,119
processing and extracting things like

1223
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:25,559
the stems and the leaves and the trim

1224
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:27,519
and if you wanted to take it a step

1225
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:29,079
further you can also process the roots

1226
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:30,599
in that as well there's tpin in The

1227
00:46:29,079 --> 00:46:32,240
Roots as well as people know from

1228
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:34,559
watching my show yeah there's Turpin in

1229
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:36,598
the roots that normally people are not

1230
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:38,000
able to interact with because they're

1231
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:40,720
they're not dealing with those they're

1232
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,719
not extracting those but cannabis

1233
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:46,519
cannabis root that's like an old uh

1234
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:49,279
folklore uh medicinal recipe so if if

1235
00:46:46,519 --> 00:46:51,759
you were going to go that route um you

1236
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,519
know usually you can make it with the

1237
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:56,280
the byproduct that the things that you

1238
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:59,559
would throw away so I'll I'll soak it

1239
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:02,079
I'll do two soakings for about I'll let

1240
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:05,319
the the material sit with every um like

1241
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:07,960
the alcohol for about 15 to 20 minutes

1242
00:47:05,318 --> 00:47:10,318
I'll strain that off into a pan I'll

1243
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:13,280
soak it again and you you're left with

1244
00:47:10,318 --> 00:47:15,679
this like really rich green looking

1245
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:18,400
extracted alcohol and then you're just

1246
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:21,399
reducing it like a sauce so if you're

1247
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,639
going to make RSO I think in a French

1248
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:25,760
press like that with about a/4 pound or

1249
00:47:23,639 --> 00:47:28,358
so in it and what I'll do is I'll blend

1250
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:31,079
it up so you powder it it's it ends up

1251
00:47:28,358 --> 00:47:32,799
looking like flour right you you don't U

1252
00:47:31,079 --> 00:47:34,680
it's not like making water hash where

1253
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:37,720
you you don't want to break it up too

1254
00:47:34,679 --> 00:47:39,159
much so you you'll powder it in a um

1255
00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:42,399
like a food

1256
00:47:39,159 --> 00:47:44,558
processor and then um yeah you reduce it

1257
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:47,240
like a sauce and like making shitty

1258
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:50,880
pre-rolls with the food process yeah

1259
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:52,598
exactly yeah yeah um so yeah I think

1260
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:56,079
from start to finish I can make a batch

1261
00:47:52,599 --> 00:47:57,960
of RSO in about two hours or so oh

1262
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:01,079
that's really fast yeah and some people

1263
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:03,119
do the longer process yeah I I've seen

1264
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:05,400
you know Ju Just like anything it's

1265
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:07,160
there are some different uh techniques

1266
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,079
out there and it kind of depends on how

1267
00:48:07,159 --> 00:48:11,519
much you're scaling it right but when

1268
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:14,160
you go to the dispensary and it's it

1269
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:17,318
ends up being anywhere from $60 to $100

1270
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:19,759
a gram and if you look at our um Rick

1271
00:48:17,318 --> 00:48:21,880
Simpson's recipe or how much he

1272
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:24,440
prescribes to take you end up taking

1273
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:26,559
about a gram a day so you start out with

1274
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:28,960
a grain of rice and you ramp it up kind

1275
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:33,359
of depending on trying to hit that

1276
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:35,199
Target of a gram a day yeah and so like

1277
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:37,318
my tolerance is kind of dropped out

1278
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:38,960
lately and so even a grain of rice of

1279
00:48:37,318 --> 00:48:42,119
that is when we're talking a th

1280
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:44,280
milligrams right not just a gram of

1281
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:46,318
material you want a th000 milligrams

1282
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:48,920
right and you know a th000 milligrams of

1283
00:48:46,318 --> 00:48:52,199
RSO is much different than a th000

1284
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:54,358
milligrams of uh other extracts that you

1285
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:56,480
might take you know the it doesn't

1286
00:48:54,358 --> 00:48:59,239
necessarily translate it's it's way more

1287
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:01,599
power powerful and so it it can get a

1288
00:48:59,239 --> 00:49:04,239
little tough especially with people

1289
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:07,079
still trying to be functional throughout

1290
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:10,759
the day yeah so what we've started to do

1291
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:13,680
is um use CBD isolate to kind of

1292
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:14,559
modulate that so you will take your dose

1293
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:17,919
of

1294
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:19,559
RSO and uh and then basically once you

1295
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,680
start feeling the effects you'll take

1296
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:24,480
your CBD isolate and that's that's going

1297
00:49:21,679 --> 00:49:26,798
to kind of let the THC set in and start

1298
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,519
doing its thing but uh allow you to

1299
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:30,239
still be functional but it also competes

1300
00:49:28,519 --> 00:49:32,079
with those receptors right so that's

1301
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:34,318
part of the benefit was competes with

1302
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:36,760
the receptors so you don't get this

1303
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:38,400
extreme psychoactive effect it mows it

1304
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,760
down a little they'll actually unseat it

1305
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:43,119
like you like you were saying it's it's

1306
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:45,440
kind of like the Naran of of cannabis so

1307
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:48,000
those um the CBD will actually go in and

1308
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,519
unseat that THC that is locked into

1309
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,960
those receptors and it can actually get

1310
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:56,798
you UNH high right so um you know and

1311
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:58,159
then it's there are some dabbing cvd is

1312
00:49:56,798 --> 00:50:00,400
a great way for that to happen right

1313
00:49:58,159 --> 00:50:02,358
away it's funny because i' I think snap

1314
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,720
you out of it yes a lot of people are so

1315
00:50:02,358 --> 00:50:05,039
high that they're scared to take a dab

1316
00:50:03,719 --> 00:50:07,798
but if you were to take a dab of

1317
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:10,400
straight CBD isolate you would be

1318
00:50:07,798 --> 00:50:14,400
feeling pretty amazing right after that

1319
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:17,798
yeah yeah it's um I think right now even

1320
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:19,798
a 10 milligram edible is uh you know I

1321
00:50:17,798 --> 00:50:22,039
think that's done for me for the day I I

1322
00:50:19,798 --> 00:50:24,159
go right to sleep so yeah when when you

1323
00:50:22,039 --> 00:50:26,318
start talking about RSO there there are

1324
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:29,440
some consumption methods too that can

1325
00:50:26,318 --> 00:50:31,599
help to kind of modulate that so when

1326
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:33,838
you when you ingest it you know you

1327
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:35,838
activate the liver and it turns into a

1328
00:50:33,838 --> 00:50:38,239
whole another compound with the liver

1329
00:50:35,838 --> 00:50:41,400
getting involved to break down that um

1330
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:44,358
that substance yeah so sublingual

1331
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:47,960
application uh there's even yeah I've

1332
00:50:44,358 --> 00:50:50,358
even seen so my mom had helped make

1333
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:52,240
coconut oilbased suppositories and

1334
00:50:50,358 --> 00:50:54,679
things like that so just like when you

1335
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:56,719
take it sublingually you're absorbing

1336
00:50:54,679 --> 00:50:59,719
into the mucus membrane you're byass

1337
00:50:56,719 --> 00:51:02,318
passing the liver and it doesn't affect

1338
00:50:59,719 --> 00:51:04,558
you quite as heavily and that would be

1339
00:51:02,318 --> 00:51:06,119
the same thing with uh you know um

1340
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:11,920
anything other than ingesting it

1341
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:14,440
basically right so um I I've even had

1342
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:18,000
friends people that I've known that uh

1343
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:19,798
you know hospice uh kind of end of life

1344
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,519
care that have been prescribed some

1345
00:51:19,798 --> 00:51:24,318
pretty heavy duty opioids and things and

1346
00:51:22,519 --> 00:51:27,159
and that's just

1347
00:51:24,318 --> 00:51:30,000
uh it's just basically to to knock you

1348
00:51:27,159 --> 00:51:31,598
out and so we we've made different

1349
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,639
applications for people like that in

1350
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:37,920
that boat as well and uh it's it it's

1351
00:51:35,639 --> 00:51:39,639
heavy but it's nice to be able to help

1352
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:42,440
people when they really need it you know

1353
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:45,199
CU a lot of people aren't familiar with

1354
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:47,318
it and and so you would think with weed

1355
00:51:45,199 --> 00:51:49,159
being as talked about and as open as it

1356
00:51:47,318 --> 00:51:51,159
is now you would most people would know

1357
00:51:49,159 --> 00:51:52,558
a little bit but you would you would be

1358
00:51:51,159 --> 00:51:54,159
so surprised at the amount of people

1359
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:56,798
that I talked to that are coming in

1360
00:51:54,159 --> 00:51:59,358
completely cold they they' uh they're in

1361
00:51:56,798 --> 00:52:01,519
the same mindset of the last you know 20

1362
00:51:59,358 --> 00:52:02,798
years too especially doctors right I

1363
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:04,400
think they a lot of doctors I have

1364
00:52:02,798 --> 00:52:06,318
friends with their surgeons and they are

1365
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,920
informed but I think there's a lot of

1366
00:52:06,318 --> 00:52:10,358
people that are uninformed in the

1367
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:12,159
medical field yeah it it's with the

1368
00:52:10,358 --> 00:52:13,960
system we have you get their hands tied

1369
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:16,480
you know they have when you interface

1370
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:19,280
with insurance companies you have to

1371
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:21,599
follow the prescribed line of treatment

1372
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,280
and so there there are some people that

1373
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:25,640
are aware of it but they're just not

1374
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:28,000
able to talk about it or prescribe it

1375
00:52:25,639 --> 00:52:29,480
yeah and so it it it gets a little

1376
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,559
discouraging and that's part of the

1377
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:34,119
reason that I uh left it and let my

1378
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:37,240
licenses lapse uh there are things that

1379
00:52:34,119 --> 00:52:39,760
I miss about it but there's also a lot

1380
00:52:37,239 --> 00:52:41,358
that um you know you can see that it's

1381
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,359
not going to change and you can see that

1382
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:46,239
people are still going to suffer so I

1383
00:52:43,358 --> 00:52:49,679
can be involved with an industry and a

1384
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:52,118
company where I'm able to empower people

1385
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:54,440
and and uh help educate people and

1386
00:52:52,119 --> 00:52:57,039
encourage people to use cannabis as they

1387
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:58,880
may nice yeah

1388
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:01,480
so tell me something the world doesn't

1389
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:04,240
know about Matt

1390
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:07,400
Hammer oh man well you know he's from

1391
00:53:04,239 --> 00:53:09,118
England right yeah yeah um Australia

1392
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:12,480
Australia

1393
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:14,039
yeah oh gosh uh well I mean half of the

1394
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:16,838
reason I come out to these shoots with

1395
00:53:14,039 --> 00:53:19,719
him I bring a a tool bag with zip ties

1396
00:53:16,838 --> 00:53:20,679
and duct tape and um you know before I

1397
00:53:19,719 --> 00:53:23,759
got

1398
00:53:20,679 --> 00:53:26,919
into uh the medical field I used to work

1399
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:29,040
in theater doing stage management so I'm

1400
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:31,440
used to setting up cameras and sound and

1401
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:33,279
lights and uh just like with with

1402
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:35,559
growing weed you end up macgyvering

1403
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,079
things and Jerry rigging things so

1404
00:53:35,559 --> 00:53:39,798
that's half of the reason I cruise out

1405
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:42,240
sometimes it's mbering but yes I totally

1406
00:53:39,798 --> 00:53:43,880
I agree yeah so I I come with the zip

1407
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:47,000
ties and the duct tape and and we'll

1408
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:49,119
make a lot happen but um you know it's

1409
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,798
it's been quite an honor to work with

1410
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:53,960
him and I've got to rub elbows with all

1411
00:53:50,798 --> 00:53:57,039
kinds of famous people that I see on on

1412
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:58,760
TV or videos and stuff and I'll cruise

1413
00:53:57,039 --> 00:54:01,440
around with this guy and get to hang out

1414
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:02,480
with him so it's been quite the pleasure

1415
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,798
yeah and then you've got to work with

1416
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:07,119
Kyle kushman as well yeah you know I I

1417
00:54:04,798 --> 00:54:08,880
started working with him and I think it

1418
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:12,200
was a couple of months into it and I was

1419
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:14,318
like oh I because I you know I'm not

1420
00:54:12,199 --> 00:54:17,358

yeah that's right and I mean I love when

1446
00:55:09,519 --> 00:55:12,280
people are passionate about cannabis

1447
00:55:10,838 --> 00:55:14,838
because I'm passionate about cannabis

1448
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:16,400
and I I love that it's just contagious

1449
00:55:14,838 --> 00:55:18,679
and when you can share that experience

1450
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:21,240
with people you know especially people

1451
00:55:18,679 --> 00:55:22,960
like Kyle he rubs off on you and you

1452
00:55:21,239 --> 00:55:24,919
know it's like uh whether it was his

1453
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,920

another one too he's a character and

1455
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:30,720
Kyle is another character and it's like

1456
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:33,078
they've helped build this cannabis world

1457
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:35,519
that we all get to experience and I love

1458
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:37,559
that about these guys and you know Kyle

1459
00:55:35,519 --> 00:55:41,440
kushman's had the name Kyle kushman for

1460

it's like these guys help make the world

1463
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,159
a better place because I believe

1464
00:55:47,079 --> 00:55:51,480
cannabis makes the world a better place

1465
00:55:49,159 --> 00:55:52,719

1515
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:45,160
well that's the beauty

1516
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:46,599
of what people like Matt and and Ryan

1517
00:57:45,159 --> 00:57:49,440
you know they they're able to make us

1518
00:57:46,599 --> 00:57:51,680
look better than we are most of the time

1519
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:55,880
yeah but but I feel like the editing is

1520
00:57:51,679 --> 00:57:57,919
so technical uh to do right right and

1521
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:59,480
have there's so there's so many I mean

1522
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:02,079
people see what they see they see this

1523
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:05,519
one finished product but there's so many

1524
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:07,640
things in so many people that it takes

1525
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:09,440
to get there you know and it's like not

1526
00:58:07,639 --> 00:58:10,920
only the stories that we have that took

1527
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,760
you know lifetimes to build that we're

1528
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:15,960
talking about on our show but like the

1529
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:17,720
editing the lighting the sound like the

1530
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:19,079
I didn't realize going in it's like you

1531
00:58:17,719 --> 00:58:20,519
know writing a book I had no idea what

1532
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:22,798
it was like to write a book until I did

1533
00:58:20,519 --> 00:58:25,400
it but until I did a podcast I had no

1534
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:27,559
idea how important lighting was or sound

1535
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:29,200
was um well you can't look at a

1536
00:58:27,559 --> 00:58:31,039
production the same once you saw the

1537
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:32,558
behind the even a movie like I don't

1538
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:34,359
look at movies the same you know and

1539
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:36,160
it's like you have more of an

1540
00:58:34,358 --> 00:58:38,598
appreciation after you've experienced it

1541
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:41,199
from the inside for sure yeah I mean

1542
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:42,838
like I I did theater for a few years

1543
00:58:41,199 --> 00:58:44,719
stage management we would set of lights

1544
00:58:42,838 --> 00:58:47,159
and the whole point of that is to go

1545
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:49,159
unnoticed right like you don't want them

1546
00:58:47,159 --> 00:58:51,159
to be aware of what you're doing because

1547
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:53,598
it's part of the show right and so when

1548
00:58:51,159 --> 00:58:55,159
you I mean you you see us on screen here

1549
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:56,960
and then you look over and you got

1550
00:58:55,159 --> 00:58:59,159
cameras and lights everywhere you got

1551
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:01,079
like the control center with all the uh

1552
00:58:59,159 --> 00:59:03,078
the TV monitors and stuff so yeah

1553
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:05,240
there's a lot that goes into it and it's

1554
00:59:03,079 --> 00:59:07,440
it's beyond me I'm more comfortable you

1555
00:59:05,239 --> 00:59:09,318
know uh filling up a pot of dirt and you

1556
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:11,960
know talking about some plants but these

1557
00:59:09,318 --> 00:59:15,038
guys uh that's a that's a totally

1558
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:16,880
different world for sure well and it's

1559
00:59:15,039 --> 00:59:18,599
just as important as every other

1560
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:20,160
component of the Cannabis industry you

1561
00:59:18,599 --> 00:59:22,160
know all these things it's like we're

1562
00:59:20,159 --> 00:59:24,558
all part of this bigger picture and and

1563
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:27,159
making this thing amazing

1564
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:29,400
right yeah it's so um I I mean being

1565
00:59:27,159 --> 00:59:30,920
able to share that with people cuz uh

1566
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:33,000
getting out on the farm and up in the

1567
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:35,200
mountains and stuff uh you know people

1568
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,838
are doing it you're not able to see them

1569
00:59:35,199 --> 00:59:39,239
you're not able to hear their stories so

1570
00:59:36,838 --> 00:59:41,038
you got people like Matt and Ryan

1571
00:59:39,239 --> 00:59:43,199
running out into those Hills getting

1572
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:45,200
getting their interviews and being able

1573
00:59:43,199 --> 00:59:48,159
to see exactly what they're doing and

1574
00:59:45,199 --> 00:59:50,480
and it is encouraging for people because

1575
00:59:48,159 --> 00:59:51,598
um you know you'd be yeah you'd be

1576
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:54,039
surprised at how many people are

1577
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:55,640
starting out cold they don't know who to

1578
00:59:54,039 --> 00:59:58,440
talk to they don't know which route they

1579
00:59:55,639 --> 01:00:00,558
should go so uh getting this information

1580
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:02,599
out encouraging people hearing people's

1581
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:04,480
stories hearing people like Rick delisi

1582
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:06,440
and what he went through that those are

1583
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:08,798
important stories that need to be told

1584
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:10,639
for sure so if you had one piece of

1585
01:00:08,798 --> 01:00:14,280
advice for your younger

1586
01:00:10,639 --> 01:00:17,558
self what would that one piece be oh one

1587
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:20,280
piece of advice well I think the pre

1588
01:00:17,559 --> 01:00:24,240
Jehovah Witness oh yeah well I got out

1589
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:26,359
of that as soon as I could um I think um

1590
01:00:24,239 --> 01:00:30,558
being tied to the status quo you know

1591
01:00:26,358 --> 01:00:32,798
like I you get into a career and the the

1592
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:35,400
path of Life rarely leaves you at that

1593
01:00:32,798 --> 01:00:37,759
same place so it it's really easy to get

1594
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:40,200
tied in and sentimental to where you are

1595
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:42,480
at that particular moment maybe uh

1596
01:00:40,199 --> 01:00:46,118
walking away from a job and and mourning

1597
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:48,039
it and um trying to figure out what's

1598
01:00:46,119 --> 01:00:49,680
going to happen next but uh for

1599
01:00:48,039 --> 01:00:52,079
everybody you'll hear this time and time

1600
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:53,118
again it ends up falling into place and

1601
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:55,280
