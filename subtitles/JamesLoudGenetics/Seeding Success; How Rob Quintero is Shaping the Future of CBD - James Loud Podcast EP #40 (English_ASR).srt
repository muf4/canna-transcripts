9
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:24,118
long time shareed genetics yeah anyone

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,480
want to hear where I got the cookies cut

11
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:27,719

2010ish is yeah give or give or take a

14
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,200
little bit and uh we got it you I got it

15
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:37,719
from you but you had got it from our

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,640
good friend Paulie yeah who uh he got it

17
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:42,280
from a store in Berkeley off fourth it

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,280
wasn't Berkeley in Garden it was the one

19
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:47,558
on the side streets right from from a

20
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,640
cat that was working there and the

21
00:00:47,558 --> 00:00:51,799
cookies cut was a big deal back then

22
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,878
sure sure uh not many other genetics

23
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:55,159
actually it was probably the first

24
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:57,519
genetic you could call an exotic in the

25
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:59,919
whole industry and um super sought after

26
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,559
I mean when we when we dropped those uh

27
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,079
dropped the flower at the dispensary at

28
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:06,679
my at my club uh rip to the club um we

29
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:08,239
had a line down the street no one in San

30
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,680
Jose had it yet so it was like super

31
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:11,679
cool for us to have something unique

32
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,840
even though our dispensary looked like a

33
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,240
you know little trap shop yeah it was a

34
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,079
pain in the ass to grow it sure was it

35
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:21,759
sure was uh not a lot of yield not very

36
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:23,679
big colas prone to some some some issues

37
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,118
kind of grew a little sideways but when

38
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,040
the cut that we had it it grew a lot

39
00:01:26,118 --> 00:01:30,560
like OG in the sense that the node

40
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,560
spacing was really bad y uh it didn't

41
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,320
produce a ton of leaves but the node

42
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,600
spacing was bad and you'd get buds that

43
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:39,398
were growing you know 4 inches apart

44
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:42,199
yeah uh and it would fall over it SP it

45
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:44,280
was it was like spaghetti you had to tr

46
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,840
if you didn't it would just I bet it

47
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,478
would grow along the ground yeah what if

48
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,640
you let it yeah if you would we had we

49
00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:51,280
double trellis everything uh not much to

50
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,159
defoliate because there just wasn't much

51
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,879
there stay on top of some PM depending

52
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,039
on your environment but yeah when this

53
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:58,519
wasn't the Forum cut it we had it as

54
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:00,840
Girl Scout cookies the first thing that

55
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:02,200
we had the there was one girl scout

56
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,799
cookies in the beginning and that was

57
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,439
the one that we had that I had SE from

58
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:08,080
other people as well and then you know I

59
00:02:06,438 --> 00:02:10,399
think some people say you know there's a

60
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,239
lot of confusion around stuff but

61
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,878
there's the Forum cut and Forum cut was

62
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:16,439
different than the cut that we had I

63
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:17,959
believe a little bit yeah I mean there

64
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:20,359
was a thin min's cut that everyone kind

65
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:22,239
of ran with the thin Min was the spear

66
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,080
sure so they grew up like Spears and you

67
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:27,400
grew like longer Buds and then the Forum

68
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,239
was nice big chunky big chunky this was

69
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,519
kind of neither of those and I feel like

70
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:34,439
it was just it was is similar and you

71
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,800
know I who knows I I wasn't there in the

72
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:39,519
circle of the guys that made the cookies

73
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,519
there's a lot of mystery behind the I

74
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,080
spoke to a couple of those guys and um

75
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,800
they were you know they're always very

76
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,239
eager to have figure out how'd you get

77
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,920
your hands on that I'm like oh a

78
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:54,000
gentleman never tells right

79
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:56,359
right yeah so you know 14 years later

80
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,479
we're still rocking yeah and I still

81
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,360
like cookies I still think it has its

82
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:02,359
place um you you know a lot of people

83
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,400
don't even understand how impactful Girl

84
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,519
Scout cookies was um you know I feel

85
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,760
like a lot of the stuff that has bread

86
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,519
in it you get that bread from your

87
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:11,919
wedding cake it came from the cookies

88
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,959
sure you know any sort of you know that

89
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,518
that doughy kind of bready character I

90
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:18,158
like that

91
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,239
yeah well you know um cookies like I

92
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:21,519
said was the first one you could really

93
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:23,480
call an exotic of the available genetics

94
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,560
that were around and cookie fam and

95
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:28,318
those guys um they did a fantastic job

96
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,438
and all the all the dessert strains that

97
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:33,280
came after once aut hit and then then

98
00:03:31,438 --> 00:03:34,598
boom it's been uh it's been non-stop

99
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,239
since there he kind of flipped the whole

100
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:38,318
industry on his head as far as you know

101
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,840
all the Herms in the industry we can

102
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:43,318
think but yeah I mean I I think that was

103
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,200
the beginning of a new phase because

104
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:47,598
before that there was a lot of diversity

105
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:50,598
too and there was we had AR kushes we

106
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:51,919
had the OG's we had the sour we had you

107
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:54,919
know there was the varieties of like the

108
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:57,598
Bubba the Hindu we saw those the Master

109
00:03:54,919 --> 00:04:00,280
Kush I love that sure and then you know

110
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:02,039
the but it wasn't well modern day

111
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,840
Exotics are you know the purple candy

112
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:07,199
gas or the purple right gas as cookies

113
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:10,200
was cuz cookies had like a nice Cherry

114
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:12,919
nose on it yeah uh it was it was bready

115
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:14,438
and a little bit creamy and gassy and it

116
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:16,918
it smoked and it's it could smoke down

117
00:04:14,438 --> 00:04:18,159
to the roach totally yeah uh one thing I

118
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:19,918
would say it's kind of a double-edged

119
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,919
sword with all the desserts coming in

120
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,000
and all that is you know before that

121
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:27,560
before Girl Scout cookies in general we

122
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,720
had we had sativas and we had indas and

123
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,160
we had you know we had some hybrids but

124
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,560
because of sativas right nowadays like

125
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,039
you know how hard is to find a sativa

126
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,280
out there God it's crazy like so they're

127
00:04:36,038 --> 00:04:39,199
out there everything is a hybrid

128
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:40,959
nowadays they' because they everyone

129
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,199
wanted to have the prettiest weed and

130
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,918
throw as many names they can in there

131
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,080
towards the middle totally yeah we've

132
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:50,560
losts we go far left far right and with

133
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:52,680
cannabis it's been okay everything's a H

134
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,478
middle you know and there are some super

135
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,519
amazing indicates that you can find

136
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:59,680
sometimes there are some super amazing

137
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:02,319
sativas you know we we can go like these

138
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,800
amazing kushes on that far end and then

139
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:06,599
we get these uh you know Durban Poison I

140
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,840
still see oh once in a while you know

141
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:12,280
like uh yeah red congales and durans and

142
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:13,719
yeah some Colombian stuff and we see

143
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:15,079
stuff that has hints of it in there but

144
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,600
you don't see the land race stuff very

145
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:19,159
often no you know some of the companies

146
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,000
that I was super excited that were

147
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,400
growing it they've gone out of business

148
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,800
but you know like Redbeard's got some

149

comeback I want to just I'd rather say

160
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:50,439
OG cush is make it a comeback because it

161
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,960
is but I I prefer that and there's

162
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:54,478
nothing wrong with blue dream it has the

163
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:56,879
most amazing structure it's probably the

164
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,079
single most demanded you know genetic

165
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,439
Oliver it's probably because Justin

166
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,839
Bieber talked about it but yeah that's

167
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:04,879
right but yeah so let's dive back into

168
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:07,279
your history man so you have a long

169
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:10,038
history with the plant when did you get

170
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:13,399
started smoking oh man wow all the way

171
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:15,360
back to that that was God I

172
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:17,638
guess

173
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,960
1991 right that's I think that's for me

174
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,759
the first time I sat down that was my

175
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:22,799
year too yeah well I sat down at the

176
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:24,479
table in my my friend's house and had

177
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,560
the purple Graphics bongs remember the

178
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:30,079
old Graphics oh yeah plastic Graphics B

179
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,560
plastic Graphics man thing Telegraph

180
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:34,079
yeah and I just remember like taking

181
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,439
this first big milky rip and coughing my

182
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:36,560
ass off and everyone's laughing I just

183
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:37,759
assume that's how you're supposed to do

184
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,720
it and I just kind of put my head down

185
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,319
on the table and I'm seeing I can still

186
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,160
see it to this day like checkerboard

187
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:46,479
black and white and like this blue and

188
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:48,680
purple sky just flickering I'm like whoa

189
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:50,519
what the [ __ ] is this this is great we

190
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,759
low of cuss on here yeah okay good sorry

191
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:53,478
you can say where the [ __ ] you want [ __ ]

192
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,479
yeah that's I like to hear but uh but

193
00:06:53,478 --> 00:06:55,639
yeah I remember just sitting at that

194
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:57,199
table and then they're like all right

195
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:59,560
rob you need to go go lay on the couch

196
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,280
for a while and I'm like man that was

197
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,918
that was [ __ ] fantastic and you know

198
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,638
and then I was hooked from there um but

199
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:09,198
as far as cultivation goes that that

200
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:11,240
started back in about 2003 2004 for me

201
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,199
yeah uh you know anything p a closet

202
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,519
growth like you know was we did we did I

203
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,639
did that probably back in 99 but like in

204
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:19,680
terms of actually setting up a real grow

205
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:22,478
and like playing the game of getting the

206
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,879
U-Haul freaking truck and having to like

207
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:24,878
take all these side streaks you're

208
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:26,319
worried they're watching you with the

209
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:28,840
helicopters and not to sound like a

210
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,919
paranoid but they really did do that uh

211
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:33,198
and just being super underground and

212
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:35,198
like having to hide every inch of

213
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,598
everything about it and uh but you know

214
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:41,199
we did it and and then by 2009 I bought

215
00:07:38,598 --> 00:07:42,918
my dispensary wow yeah so I was just

216
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,960
just growing up into that point until I

217
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:48,240
finally I'm like ah I think I want a

218
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:50,198
dispensary worst decision of my life but

219
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,918
you know also also the best because it

220
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:54,240
opened up the doors to everything we've

221
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:56,439
been you know that I've been doing now

222
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,000
uh so it's you know it's it's been a

223
00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:02,240
good run not lot lots of of ups and

224
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,959
downs you know uh the the UPS are really

225
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,639
fun the Downs are pretty tragic but

226
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:06,719
that's that's just the nature of the of

227
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:08,918
the business you know we're in an

228
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,199
industry that is still gray area and

229
00:08:08,918 --> 00:08:13,120
some of us like ourselves have been in

230
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:15,400
it since it was totally totally dark and

231
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,879
uh you know you just you just keep

232
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:18,038
running hope for the best roll with the

233
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,000
punches roll with the punch we're still

234
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:22,279
here so that's uh that's fall down seven

235
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,800
get up eight that's the that's the plan

236
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:26,758
or nine or 10 or 11 it's just it is what

237
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,478
it is you fall down you get back up yeah

238
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:30,240
and unfortunately the past couple years

239
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:32,559
two and a half years

240
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,560
I I hope I'm exaggerating but I feel

241
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,679
like 90% of the business the industry is

242
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,399
gone like I go to the shows I'm just not

243
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:40,399
seeing the brands I used to see back in

244
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,080
the day it's changed it's changed

245
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,320
Everything's changed yeah everything's

246
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,000
change yeah just not even in cannabis

247
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,160
but everything things have changed since

248
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,759
covid you can't even barely go out in

249
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:52,360
San Francisco and find a meal late at

250
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:54,679
night unless you're homeless

251
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,240
night but but good food you used to be

252
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:58,120
able to get food in the cities and oh

253
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,600
yeah I feel like you can still find some

254
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,679
food but it's not like it used to be

255
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,480
where you could go out midnight and

256
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:04,199
there's restaurants open a lot of them

257
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,360
sure sure sure sure yeah the world's

258
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,278
changing and we just got to roll with

259
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,800
the punches like you said and yeah uh

260
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:10,919
I'm happy to still be here fighting the

261
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:13,399
fight with cannabis um it it's my

262
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:15,759
passion I've got a couple you know I

263
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:18,519
guess real careers to fall back on and

264
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:20,078
I'm just dying I'm just dreading the day

265
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:22,240
that that might ever come so I'm pushing

266
00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:23,799
as hard as I can to to keep this dream

267
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,360
alive because I don't want to I want to

268
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:28,639
go back to Selling Houses

269
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,680
yeah yeah so tell us I mean you've done

270
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:32,199
so much in the industry so let's let's

271
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:34,359
uh talk about how you got your start in

272
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,759
the industry I I guess that would be the

273
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,919
the dispensary right cuz before that I

274
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:40,639
was just cultivating uh living a good

275
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:42,919
life man I was over in Scotts Valley

276
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:45,480
because back then uh Santa Cruz County

277
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:47,559
allowed 99 plants and so I rented this

278
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,039
cool house in Scott Valley and it was

279
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:50,599
like me and my three dogs in this big

280
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:53,519
old house and had a 20 lighter

281
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,278
underneath downstairs and so you know my

282
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,959
my day-to- day is get up go for a jog on

283
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:58,600
the beach have some breakfast and pull

284
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:00,639
out weed maps and be like all right well

285
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,240
where are we stop by today and grab a

286
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:05,879
few packs and back then you know 4,000 a

287
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,959
pound for Blue Dream 3,800 with no

288
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:10,559
questions asked right and so uh you know

289
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:12,518
you get 40 pounds out of a grow and it

290
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:16,039
it was good times I'm like you know what

291
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:19,360
this is so much fun I should buy a

292
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:22,278
dispensary uh that was that was uh an

293
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,959
experience um so anyway but I guess uh

294
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:25,799
what led me to The Dispensary with I

295
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:27,799
used to train Jiu-Jitsu with this guy he

296
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:29,639
was a he was a programmer for a big

297
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:32,039
Fortune 500 company

298
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:33,319
and he had taken some of his IPO money

299
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:36,799
and said you know what I want to try

300
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:39,160
cannabis out um but turns out he wasn't

301
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:40,278
a cannabis guy and so he didn't really

302
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:41,480
he didn't do too well they dumped a

303
00:10:40,278 --> 00:10:44,838
bunch of money into the starting the

304
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:47,200
dispensary and uh his wife wasn't big on

305
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,839
customer service and so they had bad

306
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,680
product and bad reviews and uh long

307
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,959
story short he said he said well

308
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:55,799
technically I was actually about to open

309
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:57,518
a bar I'd put money aside for the build

310
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:59,958
out negotiated lease found a liquor

311
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,600
license the whole thing and literally

312
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:03,759
about a week before I pulled the trigger

313
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,639
on that he comes like hey Rob and I've

314
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:07,159
been vending to him for you know a year

315
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:09,399
or whatever he's like you know I'm just

316
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:11,240
over this uh I think you'd be a better

317
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:13,600
fit for for what we're trying to do over

318
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,360
here you want to buy it and I said you

319
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,200
know [ __ ] it let's do it and so I took

320
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,639
it over and that's when uh I started

321
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,519
learning what the industry was really

322
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:24,879
about you know dealing with uh the city

323
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:26,919
council with city of San Jose and them

324
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:29,879
trying to put uh you know trying to band

325
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:32,439
the SP all all together we referendums I

326
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:34,320
took I started taking a real major role

327
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,480
in the fight against the city council

328
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,278
city of San Jose as a whole um trying to

329
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,879
ble the dispens we won the first one we

330
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:42,240
they F we fought a referendum went out

331
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:44,399
and raised a bunch of signatures to uh

332
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,320
to overthrow the ballot and they went

333
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,120
into a moratorium right like after a

334
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,120
couple they wanted to do a moratorium

335
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,480
but they also wanted to do a Flatout ban

336
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:56,000
right right and so the first time we

337
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,920
beat them and so um the second time they

338
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,519
went about it with a land use thing

339
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:02,360
right they said Okay so

340
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,639
a dispensary can't be within a th000

341
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:07,440
feet of a school a park a daycare a

342
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,759
rehab a church like anything from a city

343
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,760
planning standpoint you they put all

344
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:15,240
these things in places for accessibility

345
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:17,519
for the people right um and they do it

346
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,198
uh they call it as the crow flies so

347
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,198
even if there's a freeway and all these

348
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:23,439
natural barriers in between where you

349
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:25,799
are in that dispensary uh it's a

350
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,000
straight line on a map not how far away

351
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:29,639
is actually physically get there and so

352
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,360
they just found this kind of loophole

353
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:34,079
way of going about it and then it

354
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,240
restricted the available land that a

355
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:39,239
dispensary could be on to what may

356
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,560
worked out to be about 1% of of the city

357
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,198
right and of course it's in the worst

358
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,879
places because why wouldn't there be uh

359
00:12:43,198 --> 00:12:45,879
you know churches and daycares and all

360
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:48,519
these things unless you're in some

361
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:49,759
crappy industrial or high crime area so

362
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:51,000
everyone was crowded and then there was

363
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:53,639
also rules about how close the

364
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,559
dispensaries could be to each other um

365
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:58,480
and then you also had to like kind of

366
00:12:55,559 --> 00:13:01,599
have a build out that was the equivalent

367
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,159
of like Fort Knox right if your facility

368
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,079
you had to have the land you had to have

369
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:06,480
the building you had to have this crazy

370
00:13:05,078 --> 00:13:08,159
buildout before you could even get the

371
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,320
permit right so there's companies

372
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,120
spending millions of dollars to make all

373
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,120
this happen and then didn't get the

374
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,600
permit right it was just a city of San

375
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,839
Jose was really difficult to deal with

376
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,159
and so um this

377
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,240
was when I saw this happening I'm like

378
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:25,120
all right this is my time to kind of

379
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:28,240
check out so I sold the dispensary in

380
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:31,000
2012 and jumped into the brand side of

381
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,079
stuff I said okay well um you know when

382
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,159
it comes to being a retail dispenser you

383
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:35,759
have to deal with all the headaches of

384
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:37,480
the city when you have when you're a

385
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:41,078
cultivation you deal with all the

386
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:43,480
headaches of a grow um brands are kind

387
00:13:41,078 --> 00:13:45,239
of insulated from all of that right we

388
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,519
the the more saturated the market gets

389
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,120
with flour the cheaper it gets the

390
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:50,480
better it is for the brand to acquire

391
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,120
flour right uh it just seemed like a

392
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,399
smarter bet so I I dived in and then I

393
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,799
uh became a partner in California finest

394
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:58,399
we were America's first marijuana

395
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:00,519
cigarette company in terms of a

396
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,600
cigarette pack um won a bunch of High

397
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:05,480
Times Awards and HC con cups and Jack

398
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,040
herrer cups and all these things kind of

399
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,519
went across the whole country pushing

400
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:11,120
our our cigarette pack and that was a

401
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:14,360
lot of fun uh that was me that was Baby

402
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,959
Bash that was uh burner for a short time

403
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,560
uh Scott are the guy that kind of

404
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:20,239
founded the company and uh yeah so we we

405
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:22,000
ran with that for years that was a

406
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,879
really good thing unfortunately all good

407
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,600
things coming to an end and uh you know

408
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:28,360
California fin is kind of chilling there

409
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,959
still still alive but not really doing

410
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:35,000
anything time um I launched West Coast

411
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:38,159
Cana in 2018 we lost launched West Coast

412
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:42,799
Cana as West Coast canar and we made a

413
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:45,039
uh 3.5 gram cigar right and uh they're

414
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:47,078
great you know I love the canar but a

415
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:48,759
3.5 gram cigar is almost kind of a

416
00:14:47,078 --> 00:14:50,559
novelty product so there's been a lot of

417
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:52,399
refining over the over the years and we

418
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:53,919
came up with what our Flagship product

419
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,839
is our our canillo our West Coast

420
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:59,559
canillo which is a diamond infus hemp

421
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:01,880
cone with a you know exotic flower and

422
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:04,039
whatnot and it's a it's a size that's

423
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:05,919
more palatable you know people will blow

424
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:08,159
through these and enjoy it and not have

425
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:11,599
to waste half of it right you put out it

426
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:13,240
how big are they uh 1.1 and 1.2 grams a

427
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,120
quarter of that or three of that is

428
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,639
diamonds and the rest is exotic flow uh

429
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:21,120
we'll smoke one here in a little bit

430
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:22,440
nice and these are thca diamonds these

431
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,399
are now we're now we're getting to that

432
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:27,320
so yeah so the thca diamonds we've been

433
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,839
using for years now yeah uh long before

434
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:33,240
the thca craze that we're seeing now

435
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,560
this uh it's huge thca is huge it's wild

436
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,039
and so yeah we'll just jump to that part

437
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:39,758
of the conversation because thca let me

438
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:43,399
back it up for us personally you know I

439
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:45,519
saw um there's a lot happening federally

440
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:46,799
right with cannabis there's there's talk

441
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,799
of

442
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:50,799
rescheduling right there's talk of flat

443
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:53,399
out either a flat out legalization not

444
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:55,599
going to happen deschedule deschedule

445
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:57,839
not going to happen but a rescheduling I

446
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,440
think is going to happen and what

447
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,720
they're talking about is going from a

448
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,680
schedule one to schedule three but you

449
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,720
know schedule one's PCP and schedule 3

450
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:07,078
is aspirin right so um that just means

451
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,040
they get to regulate the hell out

452
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:11,719
everything everything has to be FDA labs

453
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:14,000
and etc etc but that's fine but the

454
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,040
second that that happens and it's no

455
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,399
longer the threat of a felony and then

456
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:20,278
and then banking opens up we're no

457
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,278
longer competing with each other we're

458
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:24,000
comp competing with big Pharma and you

459
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:26,159
know fiser we're competing with anheiser

460
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,600
bush we're competing with with everybody

461
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:29,360
meta anyone Google anyone that's got

462
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,360
money that wants to make money is going

463
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,720
to see the opportunity that is in this

464
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,159
industry um and then we're all getting

465
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,680
blown away if we don't have something to

466
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:40,480
offer right it's a it's a sad truth and

467
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:42,519
so you know five years ago I said hey

468
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,440
I'm you know I'm 40 years old I could

469
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:46,679
work this business until the day I die

470
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,480
and be totally happy and I always kind

471
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:49,758
of did everything for the brand as if

472
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,800
we're never selling out and we're going

473
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,480
to just run this forever but then you

474
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:54,879
know recently it's past year or so I'm

475
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,920
like man if they're really going to

476
00:16:54,879 --> 00:17:00,198
reschedule this and do the schedule 3

477
00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:02,599
thing um we're all in big trouble so how

478
00:17:00,198 --> 00:17:04,639
do I get West Coast Canada everywhere so

479
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:07,480
that we own enough shell space enough

480
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,240
real estate uh Nationwide that when this

481
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:12,558
happens you know they come and approach

482
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:14,439
us and they try to buy us rather than

483
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:16,119
strangle us to death and then you know

484
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:18,519
keep us on board to be able to work it

485
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:21,678
because they're not cannabis people so

486
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:23,199
it it creates the opportunity for us to

487
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,959
to have that in that career in the

488
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,439
industry forever and ever instead of

489
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,600
having to you know go back to doing

490
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:33,640
something else so then uh

491
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:36,439
thca The thca Craze kind of hits and you

492
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:38,679
know thca is is hemp right until it's

493
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:41,279
DEC carboxilate is hemp yeah and that's

494
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:43,080
beautiful right so that means that we're

495
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:45,000
just selling hemp and we can sell it

496
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:48,678
everywhere and it's a craze under

497
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:54,960
Federal regularization thca is hemp so

498
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:58,440
is CBN correct so is Delta cbv thcv thcp

499
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,159
all of them um 2018 Farm Bill States

500
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:03,400
that you know every other canab oid can

501
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:07,600
be can be worked with aside from Delta 9

502
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:09,600
but thca is uh is awesome like so 2018

503
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:10,959
farm bill says that if it's not Delta 9

504
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:12,918
then you're good to go essentially I

505
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:17,038
don't that's kind of the obviously the

506
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:19,880
short version of it but um every

507
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:21,679
cannaboid has had a craze attached to it

508
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,039
right like CBD came out and boom Oh

509
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,038
everyone's on CBD and right Delta a came

510
00:18:24,038 --> 00:18:27,919
out oh you know Delta all these canab

511
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:30,359
come out and because they're not really

512
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:33,120
affective in so many ways as that people

513
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:34,759
are looking for AKA getting high it kind

514
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:37,599
of Fizzles out and there that little

515
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:39,158
that little wave you know crashes but

516
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:41,678
they all have their place they just kind

517
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:44,120
of settle in there's a big spike yeah

518
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:48,159
CBD I mean CBD is still around CBD is

519
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:49,959
amazing C CD it's super useful right

520
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:51,320
super useful for a lot of things I'm not

521
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,880
allowed to make any medical claims and

522
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:54,399
we don't do that but there's a lot of

523
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,039
things you can do some research I'm on

524
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,519
on to find out what CBD is good for and

525
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:00,200
i' take it to this day every single day

526
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:01,960
I give it to my dogs every single day I

527
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,759
give it to my family members it has a

528
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:07,519
use but the masses that are out spending

529
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:09,798
money every single day unfortunately

530
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:11,519
buying CBD right and then Delta 8 has a

531
00:19:09,798 --> 00:19:14,599
little wave and it spikes and it finds

532
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:17,519
its place oh there was Delta 10 for a

533
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:20,240
hot H second that then people realize

534
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:23,879
wait a second that's just n yeah that's

535
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:25,880
just but there's like thco and thcp and

536
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,600
all these other thcp is very interesting

537
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:31,760
yeah that's that's crazy you add 5% of

538
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:34,480
some thp thcp dis toit and you've

539
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:36,240
supercharged it to an you supercharge

540
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,038
your regular dis toit to an

541
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,240
uncomfortable State I mean right it gets

542
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:43,158
really strong and you're like wait a

543
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,798
minute how so um thcp is an interesting

544
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:48,480
one but

545
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:51,038
thca all those to back up a little bit

546
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,880
I'm sorry uh all those canabo had their

547
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:54,359
had their Heyday right and they kind of

548
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,159
like slowed down and found their place

549
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:58,839
as you said and there is a place for all

550
00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:02,799
of them CBD especially I I've watched

551
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:04,079
some amazing things uh CBG CB CBN you

552
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:05,558
know my buddy makes a product called a

553
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:07,759
night night and and his pre-rolls and

554
00:20:05,558 --> 00:20:09,279
puts the CBN in there and everyone loves

555
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:11,919
them they're fantastic they they sleep

556
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:14,558
so hard they sleep hella hard no uh no

557
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,440
sleeping pills no NyQuil no uh ambient

558
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:18,480
or any that crap hit a night night

559
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,798
you're good so they all have their place

560
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:24,480
but because they don't get you high um

561
00:20:21,798 --> 00:20:26,879
they the um the wave kind of crashes a

562
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,640
little bit well the one

563
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,080
canabo that legs to it in my opinion is

564
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,038
thca right right because you know in its

565
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:36,158
raw form it is hemp you know you take am

566
00:20:34,038 --> 00:20:38,359
I am I am I telling too much on here am

567
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,360
I too much information to get us all in

568
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:42,399
trouble later no but I mean I think we

569
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:43,879
we can be straight with the TC I think

570
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,840
that's it's it's important because it's

571
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:49,360
the truth first of all right but

572
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:51,798
thca definitely has its value and you

573
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:53,199
know I'm seeing I was in Texas recently

574
00:20:51,798 --> 00:20:56,319
so you were in Texas you visited my

575
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:59,880
parents actually not so long ago but uh

576
00:20:56,319 --> 00:21:01,798
thca I go into the the the CBD shops

577
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,679
they've got thca under the counter it's

578
00:21:01,798 --> 00:21:05,158
it's like a dispensary but you're going

579
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,880
in there and you're looking at this

580
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:08,360
stuff and I look at it and the guy shows

581
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,679
me the flour I'm like it looks like

582
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:13,798
regular flour he's like no that's thca

583
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:17,519
flour it's considered hemp and I'm like

584
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:20,158
I can't believe that's THC smells

585
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:22,240
amazing doesn't it so it looks amazing

586
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,360
smells amazing and The Taste was

587
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,480
actually surprisingly not that bad I

588
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:28,119
wouldn't say it was amazing but has that

589
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,558
hemp flavor to a little bit this one

590
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:31,479
wasn't hemp flavored it just wasn't

591
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:33,119
super turpy I feel like it could have

592
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,038
been grown a little bit better A lot of

593
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:37,519
the thca they're pulling early but

594
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:39,278
technically most CBD that we growing if

595
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:41,519
you harvest it past a certain point

596
00:21:39,278 --> 00:21:42,839
it'll test hot anyway right so like

597
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:44,798
that's a trick of keeping the D that's a

598
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:47,399
trick you got to harvest early even with

599
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:49,440
CBD even pharmaceutical unless it has

600
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:52,320
zero T which there's a couple companies

601
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:55,640
that have germ plasm that has zero

602
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:58,558
THC um where the pathway is blocked from

603
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:00,880
CBG so it doesn't convert into TRC other

604
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:04,319
than that that stuff will all pretty

605
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:06,120
much get hot yeah yeah and and you know

606
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:07,639
the same time that D9 is developing late

607
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:09,519
in the term is also a lot of that

608
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,919
turpine production right all that flavor

609
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:12,759
we're getting so yeah you pull it a

610
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:14,720
little early and you get more of earthy

611
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:17,158
taste and then the what the genetic

612
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,798
would normally create right but yeah

613
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:21,760
yeah yeah so th falls into my lap and

614
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:23,519
I'm like and this is literally like two

615
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:25,679
weeks after I'm like oh no what are we

616
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:27,798
going to do how are we going to survive

617
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,759
if fizer comes in and has a half you

618
00:22:27,798 --> 00:22:32,000
know billion dollar marketing budget

619
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:33,000
just to destroy everybody in this path

620
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,159
they're either gonna buy him or they're

621
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,319
G they're just going to choke him out

622
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,400
it's like alcohol at the end of

623
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:40,200
prohibition yeah right so um you know as

624
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,000
I'm like trying to figure out mean know

625
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,360
making these crazy plans building this

626
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,159
bit this insane business plan kind of

627
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:49,959
our next few years of of uh of Life phca

628
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:53,159
hits and I'm like this is it because

629
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:55,480
this isn't a Delta eight or a CBG or a

630
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:58,559
CBD that will have a peak and then a

631
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:00,278
valley um this one will sustain because

632
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:02,639
you because of States like Texas and

633
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:04,278
Florida that don't have legal cannabis

634
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,278
the way we do here and these are huge

635
00:23:04,278 --> 00:23:09,319
huge markets and so this s will get

636
00:23:07,278 --> 00:23:11,759
access to the medicine uh without having

637
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:13,639
to deal with all the headaches of uh you

638
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:15,599
being in Texas and whatnot delivered to

639
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,559
their doorstep to their doorstep legally

640
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:19,079
right deliver to their doorstep yeah we

641
00:23:17,558 --> 00:23:19,759

legal so how do you get your brand in 50

646
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:31,119
states in a short amount of time

647
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:33,080
I personally think it's thca yeah so

648
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:35,639
this kind of been a godsent for for us

649
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:38,038
because it's uh it's given us an

650
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,559
opportunity to scale where we may where

651
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:42,879
we otherwise would have had to give up a

652
00:23:39,558 --> 00:23:44,678
lot to get there wow so how many

653
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,799
different flavors do you guys have right

654
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:48,600
now we only have packaging for one let

655
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:51,038
me sh gelato because that's what's hot

656
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:53,439
but we have about 15 different THC

657
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:55,640
trains of Exotics and there's about

658
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,480
another dozen of some indoor and then

659
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,159
down to the like the greenhouse stuff

660
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,159
there's a lot you know and every every

661
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:03,240
farm that I've been dealing with they're

662
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:05,080
constantly testing new genetics to see

663
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,240
which ones perform better and you know

664
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:08,558
how they test and etc etc but all the

665
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,839
stuff that we've got I mean it's

666
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:13,000
anywhere from like 0.1 to 02 and a half

667
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:14,879
and I mean the stuff's beautiful yeah it

668
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,038
looks really great then we make uh you

669
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,080
know we make our canillas and whatnot

670
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:20,558
and we're already using the th diamonds

671
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:23,319
in there and so now the only thing that

672
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:25,918
changes is we use thca flow right and

673
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:28,038
you got this like you know 50% thca

674
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,759
testing product pretty crazy pretty

675
00:24:28,038 --> 00:24:31,720
crazy yeah who would have thought you

676
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:34,038
told me 10 years ago I'd say [ __ ]

677
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,480
exactly exactly yeah and times have

678
00:24:34,038 --> 00:24:37,319
changed yeah and I I had I called my

679
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,079
attorney right when this kind of hit and

680
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:41,439
I'm like dumb I need you to like look

681
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:43,359
into something for me looking at thca

682
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,880
and First's like no now don't do it

683
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:46,719
you're risking everything be careful and

684
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,480
I'm like well that's why I'm calling you

685
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,759
but have you actually read the farm bill

686
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,558
like can you read into the farm bill and

687
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:54,038
uh he calls me like 4 days later and

688
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:55,960
he's like dude I've been like diving

689
00:24:54,038 --> 00:24:57,359
into this thing and I'm researching each

690
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,200
case because the farm bill is just a

691
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:00,558
summary of a bunch of different cases

692
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,759
and so he he's going through every

693
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:05,480
single case and at the end of three days

694
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:08,440
of research he lands back at three of

695
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:11,038
delta9 you know the the differentiation

696
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,200
of the government's view of what

697
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:14,798
constitutes cannabis and what

698
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,880
constitutes hemp and it boils down to3

699
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:18,798
of Delta 9 and like he went you know he

700
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,559
went down the rabbit hole deep and so

701
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:23,679
according to him who I put a lot of

702
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:25,599
trust in and pay him a lot for uh he

703
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,159
says we're good until we're not you know

704
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:28,240
and they they change the verbiage of the

705
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:29,840
the farm bill

706
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,558
which you I think we got about a year

707
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:34,199
before that happens no they just passed

708
00:25:31,558 --> 00:25:37,200
the latest Farm Bill four years

709
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,880
literally I believe uh two and a half

710
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,278
weeks ago three weeks ago now they

711
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:44,320
actually you know so I'm not sure when

712
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:46,119
this airs but uh based on the timeline

713
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:48,798
but yeah I mean they they just signed

714
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:51,038
into law the new farm bill and so we

715
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:52,319
should be good for another four years

716
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:54,158
excellent because I was told that they

717
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:55,278
pushed it out one more year and that we

718
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,159
weren't that they're still working on

719
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:58,919
the language I'm behind the times I

720
00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:00,840
guess I've been so had my head down so

721
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:02,640
buried so deep in this that I might have

722
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:04,879
missed that but I what I was under the

723
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,640
impression of is they we were supposed

724
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,240
to vote on it last year in 22 was every

725
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,038
four years right and then it got pushed

726
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,679
out six months and then at the most

727
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:15,000
recent um you kind of come come to Jesus

728
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,559
meeting they said we're we're still not

729
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,079
ready so we're going to push out six

730
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:21,879
more it's not just

731
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:23,439
how I hope it's me I hope it's I hope

732
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,120
it's you too I hope it's me I'm praying

733
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,759
it's me cuz I'll take four years over

734
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:28,558
two cuz I thought you know maybe we got

735
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:30,398
about two more years and then hope the

736
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:31,960
language comes in our favor and that

737
00:26:30,398 --> 00:26:34,199
kind of dictates and then by then you

738
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,200
know rescheduling might already occur

739
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,679
and that's why I don't even know why

740
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,440
they're worried about it because if

741
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:40,519
we're this close to where we are because

742
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,919
they're they're saying two to three

743
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:44,918
years on this rescheduling idea if we're

744
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:46,880
that close why do you guys give a [ __ ]

745
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:48,360
right why do you care yeah it's it's a

746
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,440
you know you're throwing money at this

747
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:52,119
War on Drugs nonsense for for no reason

748
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,798
go a lot of other problems you guys can

749
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:56,759
devote some energy to like the homeless

750
00:26:53,798 --> 00:26:59,278
and Fentanyl and Fentanyl right 100%

751
00:26:56,759 --> 00:27:02,679
yeah well I mean I think both are

752
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:04,960
contributing to you know it's it's tough

753
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:06,880
with both of those things fentanyl is a

754
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,278
is a really [ __ ] up thing yeah and

755
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,039
it's

756
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:13,319
affecting a lot of people everywhere

757
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:15,158
yeah homelessness is also affecting a

758
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:18,319
lot of people everywhere you look in San

759
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:19,760
Francisco it's rough you know and all I

760
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:21,319
don't know all major cities but I know

761
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:22,720
the major cities I've been to lately

762
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:24,359
it's it's been tough even like Los

763
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,120
Angeles you go up and down the West

764
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:27,918
Coast from Seattle all the way down to

765
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:30,119
San Diego and there's a homeless and

766
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,559
funny enough there's a consistency in in

767
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:32,519
in those three states and we don't got

768
00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:34,158
to talk about that it's a different

769
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:36,599
conversation but California in

770
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:37,919
particular has kind of created a magnet

771
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:40,038
uh because of a lot of the social

772
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:42,200
programs we've adopted and so for better

773
00:27:40,038 --> 00:27:45,240
or worse uh depending on how you how you

774
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:47,720
view things um when you offer you know

775
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,839
free health care and and free money and

776
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:53,720
free phones and free food and Free

777
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:56,480
Housing uh to people to illegal migrants

778
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:58,679
to to to homeless people and then you

779
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,079
have this huge opioid problem fentanyl

780
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:02,120
problem people are strung out I mean I

781
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:03,678
know what I would do if I was in that

782
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:05,759
scenario I'm going to San Francisco I'm

783
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,640
going to La um I spent a lot of time in

784
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:09,038
LA and downtown where you know a lot of

785
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,240
our packaging and Hardware if I don't

786
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:13,240
have time to wait for China to deliver I

787
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,880
go down there and Skid Row used to be

788
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:17,079
this big and now it's got its own ZIP

789
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,200
code yeah it's grown it's like it used

790
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:21,199
to be like one block and now it's like

791
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,558
blocks and blocks and like you know if

792
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,519
you're not if you don't have protection

793
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:25,918
with you when you're walking through

794
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:28,240
there soon they're going to assign the

795
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,080
addresses so you can get mail say put a

796
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,519
little post box next to the park bench

797
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:33,158
that that's not that's mean but you know

798
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:35,720
what I mean and it's really like that

799
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:37,679
like it's and we've mainstreamed H says

800
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:39,919
and the same thing that you in the same

801
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,240
street that someone's paying a million5

802
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:45,240
to be on yeah and paying crazy amounts

803
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,319
of taxes the guy living on his doorstep

804
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,839

868
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:04,679
hard to pinpoint one thing it's been you

869
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:06,720
know I've been in a so so long we've had

875
00:31:15,398 --> 00:31:20,199
so many cool things man

876
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:21,199
um yeah who was the biggest celebrity

877
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:25,240
you smoke

878
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:27,880
with o gosh Baby Bash

879
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:30,440
right um let me think about yeah let me

880
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:32,000
come back to that one uh I didn't get I

881
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,519
was in the rotation but I didn't get to

882
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,960
hit it I was a little bummed about that

883
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:38,359
actually uh Tommy Chong we did a lot of

884
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,278
uh a lot of stuff with Tommy um

885
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:42,519
obviously you know all the rappers you

886
00:31:40,278 --> 00:31:44,519
know smoked with all those guys but I

887
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:46,638
can't really pin who who I think the

888
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:47,798
biggest one would be uh without putting

889
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:49,359
them on blast or smoking weed I don't

890
00:31:47,798 --> 00:31:50,759
know if everyone knows what they do

891
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:53,599
there's a couple of them that are big

892
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:55,759
names but they may not uh want me drop

893

895
00:31:57,558 --> 00:32:00,879
probably now is like now he's all about

896
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:02,720
it right yeah I should try to see if he

when the California financing started

903
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:19,839
that's when the real fun began and the

904
00:32:18,038 --> 00:32:22,319
industry as a whole was a lot of fun

905
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:27,638
from about 2012 to about I want to say

906

00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:09,119
amazing the High Times cups in the US

926
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,360
when they first started but it was like

927
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:13,719
disco once it's gone it's gone it's you

928
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:14,918
can't bring it back chalice all those

929
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,759
like uh you know I mean there's been

930
00:33:14,919 --> 00:33:18,240
some really good events over the years

931
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:19,839
obviously the ones in Europe that still

932
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,638

933

landed maybe you should this year it's I

937
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,440
think you're right actually that would

938
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:33,240
be the perfect time yeah it would be the

939
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,759
perfect time Wheezy is probably one of

940
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,839
the biggest names I I smoke with it's

941
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:38,839

942
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:40,158
consumption yeah right yeah I didn't get

943
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:42,000
to smoke with Ice Cube I really wanted

944
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:44,320
to but that might just be because I'm 45

945
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,880

don't want to sound any sort of way but

954
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:05,599
I really it's hard to pinpoint one there

955
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:06,960
was like all gosh I guess uh we we we

956

like 100,000 people in the crowd but one

958
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:15,399

such a fun experience being out there

965
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:28,358
and just hearing him you know wrap out

966
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,199
some of the songs I grew up on and I'm

967
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:31,358
sitting there on stage with him or you

968
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:32,480
know Pitbull is another one but I didn't

969
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:34,398
get to smoke with pitbull he doesn't

970
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,199
really do that yeah um how about Mike

971
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:39,199
Tyson you smoke with Mike because I

972
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:42,559
smoked with Mike in 2006 of the doic cup

973
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:44,719
in La Mike came and I was there and he

974
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:46,878
ended up smoke I had a huge joint that

975
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:48,838
was like that long yeah he came over

976
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:52,239
with he had a plastic Graphics bong

977
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:54,039
pretty wild but uh I think the door was

978
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:55,799
another one where like I was there but I

979
00:34:54,039 --> 00:34:58,199
wasn't like in the rotation for whatever

980
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,720
reason I kind of miss out on that one uh

981
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:02,719

982

984
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,639
was a really cool experience you didn't

985
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,800
you don't have to be on stage with

986
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:11,838

1006
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:55,719

00:35:55,719 --> 00:36:00,318
guy over and I'm like oh yeah yeah yeah

1009
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:03,078
totally yeah yeah that's right that's

1010
00:36:00,318 --> 00:36:05,400
right I forgot my parents had a CBD shop

1011
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:07,160
in a CBD company that's no longer oh

1012
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,280
they shut it down they shut it down it's

1013
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:11,399
just you know it's it's a tough market

1014
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:14,359
and yeah you know I think you really got

1015
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,960
to love it to continue doing it and like

1016
00:36:14,358 --> 00:36:17,880
I said I hope that number I hope I'm

1017
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:21,679
wrong about the number I feel like 90%

1018
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:23,318
of everybody's kind of gone away well

1019
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:24,719
you know that's just unfortunately

1020
00:36:23,318 --> 00:36:27,039
that's how it goes but the ones that are

1021
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:28,719
around it's like they're they're the

1022
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:30,559
survivors they're the ones who just keep

1023
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:32,279
getting back up yeah well we're we're in

1024
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:33,838
the epicenter of cannabis right for the

1025
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:36,400
whole country you know we've been here

1026
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:37,920
for' here yeah and so we if anyone's

1027
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,079
going to survive it should be us because

1028
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,400
we're the ones that you know kind of

1029
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:42,200
fought the fight all the way through to

1030
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,400
even get to where we're at well and I

1031
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:45,000
think a lot of the ones that are still

1032
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,880
here they wouldn't be doing anything

1033
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,838
else it's like I I love doing what I'm

1034
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,640
doing yeah you know I mean I think I

1035
00:36:48,838 --> 00:36:52,159
could do other stuff but I choose to do

1036
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:53,039
this and I love it and I think I mean I

1037
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:55,000
don't know if you guys have eaten his

1038
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:56,559
food but this guy can cook this this is

1039
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,480
like a world class Chef right here thank

1040
00:36:56,559 --> 00:37:00,078
you very much yeah and I love cooking I

1041
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,000
love cooking too but it's different like

1042
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:03,920
I feel like cannabis is making a big

1043
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
difference the the stuff I can do in

1044
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,760
cannabis makes a big difference in the

1045
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,199
world whereas like cooking I can make

1046
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,240
people happy and I can make differences

1047
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:14,159
in people's lives by cooking regally

1048
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:15,879
whereas like working with genetics the

1049
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:18,000
potential of drug Discovery and some of

1050
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:19,680
the other stuff that is on the horizon I

1051
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,440
feel like you I got a breeding book that

1052
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:23,598
came out I feel like I can influence

1053
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,519
people to make the world a better place

1054
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:27,280
absolutely rather than just making

1055
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:28,719
people happy which you know that makes

1056
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,920
their worlds a better place and that's

1057
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:32,959
great but if I can do something for the

1058
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:35,400
masses I think that's [ __ ] amazing

1059
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,800
and it's like putting products out that

1060
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,920
are good I think that's another way of

1061
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,839
making the world a better place so it on

1062
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:42,358
some level what we're doing is making

1063
00:37:40,838 --> 00:37:45,039
the world a better place and being a

1064
00:37:42,358 --> 00:37:47,799
positive impact on society yeah and I

1065
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:49,239
think that's the thing that people some

1066
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,079
of the older generation they look down

1067
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:52,358
on cannabis but if you're doing it right

1068
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:55,000
you're making the world a better place

1069
00:37:52,358 --> 00:37:56,598
with cannabis yeah uh you're adding to

1070
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,079
the community rather than taking away

1071
00:37:56,599 --> 00:38:00,960
away from the community and sure there's

1072
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:02,880
a lot of smart people in cannabis too

1073
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,880
totally and you know I I as you

1074
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,519
mentioned I have a CBD company yeah

1075
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:10,318
called Vita drops and um you know the

1076
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:15,280
first two years I had Vita drops I had

1077
00:38:10,318 --> 00:38:16,838
met this uh oncologist um and he didn't

1078
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,880
know much about CBD but had some

1079
00:38:16,838 --> 00:38:21,960
questions and we were both tied to 420

1080
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:24,160
Evaluations as it would be he he knew

1081
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,240
the old manager there and he just had

1082
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:27,799
some questions and so he's like hey ask

1083
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:29,239
them

1084
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,160
find me someone that knows about CBD I

1085
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:33,919
want to hear about this right and so

1086
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:35,399
anyway him and I sit down and a 45

1087
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,720
minute conversation turns into a five

1088
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:39,880
hour conversation we're I'm talking

1089
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:42,399
about CBD and what you know what I knew

1090
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:44,920
of it you know and how that you know

1091
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,920
kind of contrasting as his his medical

1092
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,639
knowledge and background and fighting

1093
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,000
cancer and stuff and so I don't know

1094
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:51,879
what I said but I said something enough

1095
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,519
to convince him like okay I'm going to

1096
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:56,760
look more into this and what that led to

1097
00:38:54,519 --> 00:38:57,880
is for the first two years of my brand

1098
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,880
being out there I'd already been doing

1099
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:02,800
CBD stuff with revivid um they they gave

1100
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,000
me my start essentially I was doing a

1101
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,920
lot of stuff for their brand and that

1102
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,119
turned into me having my own brand which

1103
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:10,880
was powered by revivid and the whole

1104
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:13,640
Farm in Colorado anyway so I already

1105
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,800
knew a lot about CBD and so anyway I

1106
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:18,078
started working with him for two years

1107
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,839
I'm working with him and his patients

1108
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:23,079
and there's a cancer doctor right so I'm

1109
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:25,519
sitting down with families uh of people

1110
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:27,280
who are either in stage one or on the

1111
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:29,960
last L of their life

1112
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,200
and so whether it was a CBD or was the

1113
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,519
other therapies other stuff that they

1114
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:35,679
were doing I was taking part in these

1115
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:38,079
these people's therapies and I and I I'm

1116
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:39,598
happy to say that we only of the two

1117
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,480
years I was working with him only two of

1118
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:44,000
the people actually passed away um that

1119
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,960
he was working with one of them though

1120
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,639
was so far progressed in his in his

1121
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,960
cancer that there was just no coming

1122
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:53,719
back but U we were at least G able to

1123
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:56,800
give him some quality of life you know

1124
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:59,838
some some time uh to you know not be in

1125
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,039
pain at at those last those last months

1126
00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:02,599
um it's kind of hard to talk about

1127
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:05,318
because you know you watch you get to

1128
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:06,838
know a family um you who their their

1129
00:40:05,318 --> 00:40:09,199
their father their daughter their

1130
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:11,279
mother's dying uh you become kind of

1131
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:13,358
close to that family you see that person

1132
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,880
uh in their last days and so that was

1133
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:19,880
really difficult to to experience but

1134
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:22,760
like so valuable for in in terms of he

1135
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:24,079
uh the guy Ry in particular is the guy

1136
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:26,480
who I'm Who I'm thinking about when I'm

1137
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:27,599
talking about this beautiful wife

1138
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:30,000
beautiful daughter and a beautiful

1139
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:32,559
family the guy was a triathlete he was

1140
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,358
doing these subboard races across Lake

1141
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:36,838
Tahoe taking second place competing

1142
00:40:34,358 --> 00:40:39,639
against like 19 and 20 year olds guy was

1143
00:40:36,838 --> 00:40:41,239
an animal right and uh nothing he lived

1144
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:43,719
his life perfectly but ended up with

1145
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:46,199
this form of cancer that started down in

1146
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:47,679
his lower back and kind of Spread spread

1147
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:50,159
upwards instead of downwards

1148
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:51,679
unfortunately and uh and by the time

1149
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:55,078
he'd gone to he was from Southern

1150
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:56,879
California and they sent him up here to

1151
00:40:55,079 --> 00:41:00,200
Stanford hospital and and essentially

1152
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:02,760
what the doctors told him was hey look

1153
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:04,598
we've kind of done all we can do I mean

1154
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,200
we don't we're going to keep keep doing

1155
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:09,240
these therapies on you but maybe find

1156
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:11,480
some CBD we hear some things about that

1157
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:14,239
uh they'd given him like three weeks to

1158
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:15,760
live um whether or not it was a CBD or

1159
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:17,838
they were just off on their clock we

1160
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:21,040
kept them going for a handful of months

1161
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:22,559
right so um but it gave him some quality

1162
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:24,440
of life he was able to get some food

1163
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:25,559
down he was able to you know sleep

1164
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:28,039
through the night without you know

1165
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:31,000
waking up 100 s in pain it gave him some

1166
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:33,039
quality of life that's a very extreme uh

1167
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,440
version but all the way down to you know

1168
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:37,559
to people who are just using it for

1169
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:39,480
basic pain inflammation anti-convulsive

1170
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:41,719
disorders um there's a plethora of

1171
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:44,559
things I've seen it work on myself with

1172
00:41:41,719 --> 00:41:45,959
my own eyes and that's why I keep the

1173
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:48,199
CBD thing going even though it's not

1174
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:50,318
super profitable you know it's not it's

1175
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:51,879
not about the money with CBD it's about

1176
00:41:50,318 --> 00:41:53,480
giving people quality of life and so

1177
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,000
that's why I still do that dump money

1178
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,559
into the company to make sure it keeps

1179
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,440
going because I want to keep keep making

1180
00:41:56,559 --> 00:41:59,759
sure that people have access to it so in

1181
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,440
terms of what you're talking about like

1182
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:04,440
kind of changing the world for the

1183
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:07,358
better and giving people um quality of

1184
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:09,559
life making people happy cannabis is

1185
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:11,559
that it is that in a variety of ways CBD

1186
00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:14,400
is just one of those things so um I I

1187
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:16,440
1,00% uh agree with you that that you

1188
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,079
have a platform and guys like us who

1189
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:20,880
have fought this out and really know

1190
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:22,599
what the plant is capable of doing um we

1191
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,318
have the opportunity to make the world a

1192
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:26,838
better place it's Our obligation to make

1193
00:42:25,318 --> 00:42:30,000
a difference cu I feel like we're

1194
00:42:26,838 --> 00:42:31,679
stewards of the plant and also we have

1195
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,639
this one opportunity now you know we

1196
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:37,639
have Corporate America coming in uh to

1197
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:39,960
cannabis wanting to sell the the steak

1198
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:41,838
and lobster dream and then there's the

1199
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:44,358
whole medicine side of it and everything

1200
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:46,920
in between sure and I think it's our job

1201
00:42:44,358 --> 00:42:49,279
to get the story out and you know

1202
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:51,119
obviously there's the extreme medical

1203
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,079
side for people like with cancer and

1204
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,480
there's nothing wrong with the the

1205
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:56,680
people that are using it for

1206
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:59,280
recreational I think Dennis said it's

1207
00:42:56,679 --> 00:43:00,919
medical whether you know it is or not

1208
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,400
and there's absolute truth to that I

1209
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:04,119
think a lot of people that use it

1210
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,240
recreationally it benefits them

1211
00:43:04,119 --> 00:43:08,800
medically absolutely well think about

1212
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:13,239
this I mean let's just say life's a

1213
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:15,680
[ __ ] right and so people suffer from

1214
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:17,719
anxiety and they've got pain and they've

1215
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:20,039
got stress they say the number one

1216
00:43:17,719 --> 00:43:23,358
killer is heart disease heart attacks

1217
00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:26,679
right and so you know what contributes

1218
00:43:23,358 --> 00:43:29,440
to that I mean well

1219
00:43:26,679 --> 00:43:31,279
people drink alcohol people use illicit

1220
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:34,639
drugs people use pharmaceutical drugs

1221
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:36,720
they do all these things to kind of

1222
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:38,358
offset the stresses they have in their

1223
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:40,519
life but those are actually compounding

1224
00:43:38,358 --> 00:43:42,679
the things that are killing them right

1225
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:45,400
absolutely whereas cannabis is something

1226
00:43:42,679 --> 00:43:48,440
that can alleviate anxiety and stress

1227
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:50,160
and pain and all these things um you

1228
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,639
know in a healthy way with with very

1229
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:52,598
little side effects you know maybe

1230
00:43:51,639 --> 00:43:54,879
gaining a little weight from the

1231
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:56,440
munchies or you know sleeping too long

1232
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:59,400
you're not killing people you're killing

1233
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:01,559
cheeseburgers yeah exactly yeah exactly

1234
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:04,079
For Better or Worse better worse we know

1235
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:06,119
that it doesn't cause lung cancer right

1236
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:08,039
so helps to fight those cancer cells

1237
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:09,119
right yeah it's it's really interesting

1238
00:44:08,039 --> 00:44:11,079
and I mean we're just scratching the

1239
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:13,559
surface of it I think there's so much

1240
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:15,240
potential with this plant and we're

1241
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:17,400
going to find out a lot over the next

1242
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:19,679
five to 10 years all the medical side of

1243
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:21,960
it and once they start really being able

1244
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:24,960
to analyze it and study it properly once

1245
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:27,159
it goes off of Regulation where whether

1246
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,760
it's descheduled or rescheduled I mean I

1247
00:44:27,159 --> 00:44:30,598
would love for it to be descheduled I

1248
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:32,359
think that's the right decision sure

1249
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:34,800
just like we have alcohol and we have

1250
00:44:32,358 --> 00:44:36,400
tobacco those are descheduled y there's

1251
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,280
no reason to schedule it don't even

1252
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,639
schedule it like aspirin well it's a

1253
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:43,280
control thing yeah control the dollars

1254
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:45,199
right exactly yeah and and the reason we

1255
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,839
had to wait so long is because they

1256
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:50,039
recognize the value of it and it poses a

1257
00:44:47,838 --> 00:44:52,519
threat to Pharma poses a threat to

1258
00:44:50,039 --> 00:44:54,358
Timber POS a threat to Cotton POS a

1259
00:44:52,519 --> 00:44:56,119
threat to kind of the major industries

1260
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:58,000
that built America and kind of the

1261
00:44:56,119 --> 00:44:59,559
magnets of those Industries are like

1262
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,318
I'll put this half a billion aside just

1263
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:03,079
to Lobby against this as long as

1264
00:45:01,318 --> 00:45:04,838
possible well you know the people are

1265
00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:07,839
realizing that it's not the devil's

1266
00:45:04,838 --> 00:45:09,639
lettuce it doesn't make craze Negroes

1267
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:11,318
rape white women right that was that's

1268
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:12,639
what they said back in the 20s right

1269
00:45:11,318 --> 00:45:14,558
we've we're we're at a time where

1270
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:16,118
information freely flows and we know

1271
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:17,760
that these aren't these aren't facts

1272
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:19,559
anymore we enough people have used

1273
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,359
cannabis to know that the worst thing

1274
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:23,559
that comes of it is a a cheeseburger

1275
00:45:21,358 --> 00:45:26,078
attack at 2 A.M right this isn't there's

1276
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:28,720
nothing bad for you so their their fight

1277
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:30,359
is uh is in vain at this point because

1278
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:32,598
they know they know they either get on

1279
00:45:30,358 --> 00:45:35,039
board or you know or lose time it's a

1280
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:36,760
matter of time yep so yeah if you had

1281
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:38,318
one piece of advice for your younger

1282
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:41,200
self that was just starting off in the

1283
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:44,318
industry what would that one piece be oh

1284
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:47,439
that's uh that's dark no that's dark um

1285
00:45:44,318 --> 00:45:47,440
trust nobody in this

1286
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:53,639
industry um you

1287
00:45:51,239 --> 00:45:56,519
know God my young the younger version of

1288
00:45:53,639 --> 00:45:58,279
myself I would probably tell him to

1289
00:45:56,519 --> 00:46:00,880
stick with one thing and run with it you

1290
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:03,280
know because I because the industry was

1291
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,599
so wild wild west that you know I used

1292
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,880
to actually preach this as a matter of

1293
00:46:04,599 --> 00:46:08,440
fact I would tell people like oh you

1294
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:10,559
know if if you're in whatever the Auto

1295
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:12,559
industry you focus on your one craft and

1296
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:15,200
you perfect that craft you don't be a

1297
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:17,000
jack of all trade focus on one thing but

1298
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:18,358
you know as these years have come along

1299
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,358
like there are so many different

1300
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:24,039
opportunities in cannabis right that I I

1301
00:46:22,358 --> 00:46:25,358
squirreled off on all of them I want to

1302
00:46:24,039 --> 00:46:27,558
try you did a little bit you had a

1303
00:46:25,358 --> 00:46:29,440
software company had a software comp you

1304
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:31,280
did a lot I mean you you were definitely

1305
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:34,519
spread out but I think part of the thing

1306
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:37,640
is is with cannabis when you're doing it

1307
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:40,159
uh at your house in your garage in your

1308
00:46:37,639 --> 00:46:42,799
closet whatever all of a sudden if you

1309
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:44,480
want to do it right you have to be the

1310
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:47,318
construction guy you have to be the

1311
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:49,119
electrician the HVAC you have to be the

1312
00:46:47,318 --> 00:46:50,480
HVAC guy I was on a roof yesterday you

1313
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:52,240
have to be you know and then you want

1314
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,000
your your genetics there's a lot of guys

1315
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:57,358
they were breeders they were Growers

1316
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,358
they were all of the the the above yeah

1317
00:46:57,358 --> 00:47:00,440
because you had to be extract artist on

1318
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:03,759
top of that you know because I used to

1319
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:07,039
make bubble hash oh yeah we tubes yeah

1320
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:09,480
tues the old school with Micah yeah like

1321
00:47:07,039 --> 00:47:12,000

1322
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:15,760
tubes and this is you know this is yeah

1323
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,199
15 years ago yeah yeah yeah uh wild

1324
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,359
times and but but we had to do

1325
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:20,759
everything and that that's part of the

1326
00:47:18,358 --> 00:47:22,719
beauty of the regulated market too is

1327
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:24,599
like you can really stay in your lane

1328
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:26,480
now you can really be a specialist and

1329
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:27,720
get yeah you almost have to be you have

1330
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,159
to whatever you're good at you want to

1331
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:31,000
be the best at you want to be better

1332
00:47:29,159 --> 00:47:32,000
than a thousand other people right and

1333
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
if you can do that you're going to be

1334
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,880
successful it used to be like one in 100

1335
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,838
like the 99% as long as you're better

1336
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:39,119
than them you're usually okay now it's

1337
00:47:37,838 --> 00:47:40,799
almost like you want to be better than a

1338
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:42,358
thousand other people at that totally

1339
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,960
yeah especially where we're at now for

1340
00:47:42,358 --> 00:47:46,759
me like if I had have stayed with the

1341
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:47,880
software I mean I I've no offense to

1342
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:49,480
anyone listening that's part of one of

1343
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:51,358
these canabas software companies but

1344
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:52,880
I've played with all of them they suck

1345
00:47:51,358 --> 00:47:55,039
dude they're so overly complicated

1346
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:57,720
there's these systems just built to run

1347
00:47:55,039 --> 00:48:00,440
like chains of Safeways with a million

1348
00:47:57,719 --> 00:48:03,480
products and not like a re realistic

1349
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:05,920
dispensary shelf and uh so we we

1350
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:07,280
designed our system to be user friendly

1351
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,280
and and be you know kind of

1352
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,200
all-encompassing for the whole business

1353
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:13,480
and that as a dispensary owner it was

1354
00:48:11,199 --> 00:48:14,919
easy for me to design this because I

1355
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,960
knew what my needs were I knew what I

1356
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:18,920
had to like get to get people in the

1357
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,240
door and out the door and that whole

1358
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:22,159
process and everything that's how we

1359
00:48:20,239 --> 00:48:24,039
built the system and we built it I hate

1360
00:48:22,159 --> 00:48:26,078
to say it we built it for stoners to use

1361
00:48:24,039 --> 00:48:28,039
right for our operators to be owners you

1362
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:29,599
know and uh like some of the other

1363
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:31,358
companies I won't drop their names they

1364
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:35,599
built it for you know Engineers to

1365
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:37,838
operate and so um had I stuck with that

1366
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:39,400
um we'd we'd be like the standard in the

1367
00:48:37,838 --> 00:48:41,000
whole country had I stuck with

1368
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:43,480
California finance and we hadn't had the

1369
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:46,519
issues that that we had uh in the in the

1370
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:47,880
end of it all um we'd have been you know

1371
00:48:46,519 --> 00:48:49,318
we'd have been the number one in the

1372
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:51,720
whole world right there's just certain

1373
00:48:49,318 --> 00:48:53,239
things that I did along the way that

1374
00:48:51,719 --> 00:48:55,078
kind of shot me in different directions

1375
00:48:53,239 --> 00:48:56,679
and I really wish that I'd have maybe

1376
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:58,039
stayed focused on one thing at a time

1377
00:48:56,679 --> 00:48:59,798
and saw it all the way through that's

1378
00:48:58,039 --> 00:49:02,159
what I would tell my younger self find

1379
00:48:59,798 --> 00:49:05,719
that one thing and do it and do it well

1380
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:08,039
and yeah so that's a good one for sure

1381
00:49:05,719 --> 00:49:10,798
yeah yeah yeah kick myself a little bit

1382
00:49:08,039 --> 00:49:12,318
but I uh I think we're back on track and

1383
00:49:10,798 --> 00:49:13,960
I think we're doing pretty good but I've

1384
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:16,358
never seen you just do something for a

1385
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:17,559
few months it's always committed you've

1386
00:49:16,358 --> 00:49:20,119
always had commitment to everything

1387
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:22,599
you've done whether it's growing cookies

1388
00:49:20,119 --> 00:49:24,039

1389
00:49:22,599 --> 00:49:26,119

when you think of jackar today most

1408

people think of Jack Herer is this thing

1409
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:09,400
that's not that great this thing that

1410
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:11,280
tastes okay but the real Jack if you get

1411
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:15,559
to experience the real Jack it is

1412
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:18,480
amazing it's very complex it's not just

1413
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:20,559
limine and terpinolene it's it's not

1414
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,400
just a very linear thing it's a very you

1415
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:25,599
know and it's strong it was strong

1416
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:27,079
flower yeah absolutely and uh just cuz

1417
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:28,880
you didn't try the real Jack doesn't

1418
00:50:27,079 --> 00:50:30,359
mean that the real Jack wasn't good

1419
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,559
right and so many people get and same

1420
00:50:30,358 --> 00:50:33,159
thing with blue dream I feel like a lot

1421
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:35,559
of people have tried some inferior Blue

1422
00:50:33,159 --> 00:50:37,440
Dream but the real blue dream it tasted

1423
00:50:35,559 --> 00:50:39,160
really good it looked good smoked good

1424
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,480
everything I smoked it for years it was

1425
00:50:39,159 --> 00:50:43,920
a one strain that I didn't get immune to

1426
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:45,358
like it kept working yeah like I J1 I

1427
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,119
loved it but after about a month of

1428
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:48,480
smoking it like it didn't work anymore

1429
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:51,119
yeah I get immune to it quick a lot of

1430
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:52,480
strains I get immune to OG cush headband

1431
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:54,480
whatever we had the headband back in the

1432
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:57,760
day and that [ __ ] was strong that was

1433
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:59,760
strong chunky nugs chunky nugs and it

1434
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,520
would get you super ripped totally a lot

1435
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:03,440
of PM problems with that one though yeah

1436
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:05,400
but it tasted so good and it was one of

1437
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:09,318
those ones it was gas down to the roach

1438
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:11,079
yeah 100% 100% so yeah there there was a

1439
00:51:09,318 --> 00:51:13,440
bnch the slew of different things that

1440
00:51:11,079 --> 00:51:15,079
we grew over the years that were all

1441
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,599
really good and we went through phases

1442
00:51:15,079 --> 00:51:19,839
with stuff I mean cookies was just a

1443
00:51:16,599 --> 00:51:21,838
phase of one of many uh man it all

1444
00:51:19,838 --> 00:51:24,358
started with for me with the blue dream

1445
00:51:21,838 --> 00:51:26,920
and when I got the cookies I was like oh

1446
00:51:24,358 --> 00:51:29,880
man now it's on and uh you went polar

1447
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:32,920
opposite though as far as structure like

1448
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:35,079
uh well Skittles and cookies have the

1449
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:37,159
you know I mean th thin Min has a good

1450
00:51:35,079 --> 00:51:39,519
structure yeah yeah yeah yeah but uh

1451
00:51:37,159 --> 00:51:41,279
yeah but as far as like I mean I guess

1452
00:51:39,519 --> 00:51:43,519
Skittles is a step down

1453
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:46,319
structure-wise you know for as good as

1454
00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:49,719
Skittles tastes and how blasted it gets

1455
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:51,079
you it really is an ugly plant yeah I'm

1456
00:51:49,719 --> 00:51:53,798
I don't get too high I feel like it has

1457
00:51:51,079 --> 00:51:56,318
a ceiling but I love the effect of it MH

1458
00:51:53,798 --> 00:51:58,280
but it definitely tastes absolutely

1459
00:51:56,318 --> 00:52:01,079
amazing but it is an ugly plant yeah I

1460
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:03,640
actually ran into menot tone uh out at

1461
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:05,559
MJ Biz nice we went to that uh that

1462
00:52:03,639 --> 00:52:06,759
Afterparty was it seedless I can't

1463
00:52:05,559 --> 00:52:08,440
remember whose Afterparty it was but

1464
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:10,000
yeah I ran out there we caught him for a

1465
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:11,798
while I hadn't seen him in years and he

1466
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,480
gave me a stick he's he had a pre-roll

1467
00:52:11,798 --> 00:52:14,599
there and it was a skittles pre-roll I

1468
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:16,559
was like is this the original one he's

1469
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:18,920
like this is the one and man I lit that

1470
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:21,960
thing up and that stole about a half of

1471
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:24,559
a day for me I was so ripped it was it

1472
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:26,440
was a good cut it was a good one yeah

1473
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:28,400
yeah I'm I'm I love the turps from it I

1474
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:31,280
just I like turps I chase flavor

1475
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:33,440
constantly chasing different flavors and

1476
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,760
uh yeah I mean so what are your thoughts

1477
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,599
of all these gelato crosses where

1478
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:39,640
everything has to be purple oh man like

1479
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:41,519
I said I'm a blue dream guy I hate it

1480
00:52:39,639 --> 00:52:42,679
you know I'm I remember back in the day

1481
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:43,920
there was a couple strains that were

1482
00:52:42,679 --> 00:52:46,919
purple and we thought that was a big

1483
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:49,880
deal um but granddaddy granddaddy right

1484
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:52,039
yeah lavender uh lavender Grandaddy

1485
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:54,200
purple Urkle purple Urkel there was one

1486
00:52:52,039 --> 00:52:55,719
of that was a sativa dominant too trying

1487
00:52:54,199 --> 00:52:57,879
to remember which one that was I think

1488
00:52:55,719 --> 00:53:00,639
they called it Black Pearl there was

1489
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:02,000
black PE Pearl there was black Cadillac

1490
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:05,598
or purple

1491
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:09,920
Cadillac uh meno perss yep

1492
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:12,559
yep yeah the meno cough I think you know

1493
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:14,880
we we look at cannabis as you know a

1494
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:17,920
flavor profile and an effect and uh

1495
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:20,519
what's the high like what does it do and

1496
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:22,599
the market just said purple

1497
00:53:20,519 --> 00:53:24,519
candy they didn't give a [ __ ] about

1498
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:25,920
anything else right if it was purple and

1499
00:53:24,519 --> 00:53:28,318
if it had a cand knows I didn't care

1500
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:30,760
what the name was and like as a purist

1501
00:53:28,318 --> 00:53:32,679
it's like offensive right it's like I

1502
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:34,760
just showed you the most amazing bag of

1503
00:53:32,679 --> 00:53:36,719
what's actually really good quality weed

1504
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:39,359
and you took this two steps down thing

1505
00:53:36,719 --> 00:53:41,078
because it was purple and candy and that

1506
00:53:39,358 --> 00:53:43,598
stuff doesn't get I'm sorry bottleneck

1507
00:53:41,079 --> 00:53:45,480
the industry into purple candy right so

1508
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:47,760
there's this big array of different

1509
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:50,119
things and then everyone got fixated on

1510
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,640
this and those became the qualifiers

1511
00:53:50,119 --> 00:53:54,480
that checked the boxes for a lot of

1512
00:53:51,639 --> 00:53:57,159
people unfortunately and all of it has

1513
00:53:54,480 --> 00:54:00,880
its place I like all of it abely I like

1514
00:53:57,159 --> 00:54:03,558
if it tastes good tastes good yeah I

1515
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:06,880
mean I even like Tangi I mean I'm not

1516
00:54:03,559 --> 00:54:08,440
the biggest it's not my favorite yeah we

1517
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,880
we work at lemon tree for a long time I

1518
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:11,400
like okay so lemon tree I feel like

1519
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:14,640
lemon tree is amazing because that's got

1520
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:16,599
gas and lemon and that's got nice dude

1521
00:54:14,639 --> 00:54:18,279
that's got it's TPS it's heavy turps all

1522
00:54:16,599 --> 00:54:19,838
turps you taste in your mouth long after

1523
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:22,319
the hit yeah yeah we had Crockett on

1524
00:54:19,838 --> 00:54:24,440
here talking about Tangi and you know

1525
00:54:22,318 --> 00:54:27,400
the real Tangi man how's he doing I

1526
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:29,559
haven't se Cito his son he came on here

1527
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:31,119
we were talking about strawberry banana

1528
00:54:29,559 --> 00:54:33,160
and Tangi and I got to smoke some of

1529
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:34,960
their strawberry banana was really good

1530
00:54:33,159 --> 00:54:36,558
nice I just got some of that recently

1531
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:37,599
actually I have some it's light that but

1532
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:38,599
I have some strawberry banana right now

1533
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:41,160
I think it's making it comeback it's a

1534
00:54:38,599 --> 00:54:43,079
good washer yeah yeah you have a wash it

1535
00:54:41,159 --> 00:54:44,879
has to wash well to totally yeah yeah

1536
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:47,960
get that good yield that good return

1537
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:51,119
back yeah yeah no doubt no doubt so

1538
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:54,599
where do you see the industry in 10

1539
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:57,079
years like in all honesty my heart um

1540
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:59,920
like I said our whole our whole thing

1541
00:54:57,079 --> 00:55:02,920
right now is is hoping that we can

1542
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:04,838
achieve as as much shelf space and a

1543
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:07,760
enough excuse me enough brand

1544
00:55:04,838 --> 00:55:09,400
recognition that we're here in 10 years

1545
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,599
yeah and five years ago I would have

1546
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:14,280
said that we can do that by our own

1547
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:16,720
means uh but now with where we're at I'm

1548
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:19,359
I'm fearful that it's going to be a

1549
00:55:16,719 --> 00:55:23,118
overly overly commercialized overly

1550
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:25,400
overly regulated National thing and um

1551
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:27,760
once everyone in their mother jumps in

1552
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:31,119
uh from a corporate standpoint I think

1553
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:33,760
it's going to get ruined uh I'm hoping

1554
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:36,760
that how it ends up there's there's room

1555
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:38,400
for like a kind of Winery model right

1556
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:39,559
where you have Boutique stuff you have

1557
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,039
Boutique Wineries and you have your

1558
00:55:39,559 --> 00:55:43,000
Charles Shaws you have your Two Buck

1559
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:45,160
Chuck and you've got your $60 bottle of

1560
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Groth or whatever you're into I hope

1561
00:55:45,159 --> 00:55:50,519
that it's like that um I don't know that

1562
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,119
it will be yeah I think that everything

1563
00:55:50,519 --> 00:55:55,480
that we've fought for for all these

1564
00:55:52,119 --> 00:55:57,680
years is going to go to the Wayside and

1565
00:55:55,480 --> 00:56:00,000
the market is going to dictate and the

1566
00:55:57,679 --> 00:56:01,440
people with the money you know the big

1567
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,318
companies that come in and [ __ ]

1568
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:05,318
destroy everybody or buy everybody are

1569
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:07,920
going to dictate how it moves you know

1570
00:56:05,318 --> 00:56:11,279
similar to any any other commodity

1571
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:12,680
that's out there um it's I don't know I

1572
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:15,000
I wish I could say I saw rainbows and

1573
00:56:12,679 --> 00:56:18,000
butterflies but I just don't you see

1574
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,719
Bats see Bats you know H I'm not a

1575
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,280
pessimist I'm a glass half full kind of

1576
00:56:19,719 --> 00:56:23,639
guy but the reality of the situation is

1577
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:26,599
a second that Biser has anything to do

1578
00:56:23,639 --> 00:56:28,400
with cannabis or even meta or Google or

1579
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:30,160
or Ford Motor Company or any of these

1580
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,760
guys that well fizer's already got their

1581
00:56:30,159 --> 00:56:34,358
hands 100 yeah that's what I'm saying

1582
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:36,880
they're just uh yeah it's it's G to get

1583
00:56:34,358 --> 00:56:39,960
ruined I think I don't I guess I don't

1584
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:41,440
mean to be dismal but 10 years I I think

1585
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:42,720
five years we're still G to be you know

1586
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:45,798
it's still going to be in a good place I

1587
00:56:42,719 --> 00:56:47,159
think the longer that go that it goes um

1588
00:56:45,798 --> 00:56:49,880
well they'd have the vaccine and the

1589
00:56:47,159 --> 00:56:52,078
cure for covid right you know like you

1590
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:56,640
said disco had its time but it'll never

1591
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:59,160
be disco again right no so uh 2012 2018

1592
00:56:56,639 --> 00:57:01,118
were the best years in this industry

1593
00:56:59,159 --> 00:57:03,239
anything past that I don't know you know

1594
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:05,119
I me and you have been we've been

1595
00:57:03,239 --> 00:57:08,399
talking about this for a long time 2012

1596
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:09,680
like that era 2012 to 2014 amazing but

1597
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:12,160
then I'm hearing stories from Steve

1598
00:57:09,679 --> 00:57:15,199
D'Angelo I'm hearing stories from Rick

1599

delisi Uncle Rick Y and man I feel like

1600
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:19,558
the 60s were the that was the time right

1601
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:21,240
and that was the time it was a different

1602
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:23,079
time we just weren't there you know and

1603
00:57:21,239 --> 00:57:26,000
each one of those guys Rick he was

1604
00:57:23,079 --> 00:57:27,960
smuggling you know you smuggling 10 tons

1605
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,639
on boats and stuff like that over 10

1606
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:33,798
tons and so you know there was that day

1607
00:57:30,639 --> 00:57:35,279
in that era and I would be alive back

1608
00:57:33,798 --> 00:57:38,358
then yeah and I mean all these things

1609
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:40,960
led up to it being legal today so a lot

1610
00:57:38,358 --> 00:57:42,798
of people want to shun him or these guys

1611
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:44,318
that did prison like say you know these

1612
00:57:42,798 --> 00:57:46,358
Smugglers and these guys were bad for

1613
00:57:44,318 --> 00:57:48,279
selling we we wouldn't be around today

1614
00:57:46,358 --> 00:57:50,358
if it wasn't for them they PVE the way

1615
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:52,440
yeah I mean absolutely way not us but

1616
00:57:50,358 --> 00:57:54,558
the entire legal industry is thanks to

1617
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:55,519
these guys 100% you that broke the law

1618
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:57,519
that

1619
00:57:55,519 --> 00:57:59,400
ended up doing time and that ended up

1620
00:57:57,519 --> 00:58:01,480
pushing back I mean you know and some

1621
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:03,200
people call them Outlaws and in some

1622
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:04,719
ways you know if you look hundred years

1623
00:58:03,199 --> 00:58:07,239
in the future 100 years in the past

1624
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:09,199
they'd say no man it's it's not the

1625
00:58:07,239 --> 00:58:10,479
people that were messing around with

1626
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:12,038
weed that were the problem it was

1627
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:15,240
everybody else that was looking at it

1628
00:58:12,039 --> 00:58:16,480
the wrong way totally yeah absolutely

1629
00:58:15,239 --> 00:58:17,719
abely yeah know those guys are

1630
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:20,599
definitely the the ones that paay the

1631
00:58:17,719 --> 00:58:22,480
way so 1996 could even happen yeah you

1632
00:58:20,599 --> 00:58:24,400
know I knew Dennis I I can't say I know

1633
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:26,760

1634
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:29,200

so many so many that are gone too and

1638
00:58:34,679 --> 00:58:38,639
it's like that's why I love the podcast

1639
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:41,039
to be able to capture these types of

1640
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:43,598
stories there's so many special people

1641
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:45,400
man and there's so many stories that

1642
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:47,079
haven't been told or that never will be

1643
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:50,960
told because the people have passed on

1644
00:58:47,079 --> 00:58:52,480
and you know like Simon and Arian and

1645
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:55,400
Franco from Strain Hunters they're

1646
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:58,039
storytellers as well in a different way

1647
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:59,720
World rest in peace oh yeah I mean but

1648
00:58:58,039 --> 00:59:01,160
also telling the story of like all these

1649
00:58:59,719 --> 00:59:03,279
different regions and some people hate

1650
00:59:01,159 --> 00:59:05,159
on him for it but really I mean they're

1651
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:07,119
they're doing an amazing job at

1652
00:59:05,159 --> 00:59:09,519
documenting places where most people

1653
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:12,318
wouldn't even go yeah and then Franco

1654
00:59:09,519 --> 00:59:14,400
rested rest in peace Franco was amazing

1655
00:59:12,318 --> 00:59:16,239
and you know he's lucky that he was able

1656
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:19,440
to tell his story through those channels

1657
00:59:16,239 --> 00:59:23,199
and you know my breeding books dedicated

1658
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:25,159
Franco yeah he he passed in Africa right

1659
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:27,519
um I don't believe he passed

1660
00:59:25,159 --> 00:59:31,279
yeah he did pass from from uh his trip

1661
00:59:27,519 --> 00:59:33,920
to Africa yeah he had a cerebral menitis

1662
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:35,559
in 2017 in past he put it all on the

1663
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,240
line for cannabis because you go to some

1664
00:59:35,559 --> 00:59:39,559
of these places in the world and you

1665
00:59:37,239 --> 00:59:40,598
know we're used we're we're used to like

1666
00:59:39,559 --> 00:59:42,359
doesn't matter what kind of infection

1667
00:59:40,599 --> 00:59:44,440
you get here it's gone in three days

1668
00:59:42,358 --> 00:59:46,038
right but there's things that uh exist

1669
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:47,838
in the rest of the world that you know

1670
00:59:46,039 --> 00:59:49,359
he he put all on the line and he paid

1671
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:52,519
the price and he did what he loved to

1672
00:59:49,358 --> 00:59:54,358
the very last day yeah and he he loved

1673
00:59:52,519 --> 00:59:55,719
cannabis more than anybody I've ever met

1674
00:59:54,358 --> 00:59:58,519
i' i' met a lot of people that love

1675
00:59:55,719 --> 01:00:01,279
cannabis absolutely conversations and

1676
00:59:58,519 --> 01:00:04,798
the way his eyes would light up uh you

1677
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:07,798
know unparallel to anybody I've ever met

1678
01:00:04,798 --> 01:00:10,280
um the term passion for the sacred plant

1679
01:00:07,798 --> 01:00:13,838
the hashtag that that I used for the

1680
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:16,280
last since 2012 since hashtags even were

1681
01:00:13,838 --> 01:00:17,639
created uh is thanks to Franco him and I

1682
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:20,400
were sitting down and I said it and he's

1683
01:00:17,639 --> 01:00:22,679
like that's it that's it you know and uh

1684
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:25,318
so yeah rest in peace Franco it's like

1685
01:00:22,679 --> 01:00:26,558
uh without people these pioneers

1686
01:00:25,318 --> 01:00:28,079
you know that have come before us we

1687
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:29,559
wouldn't be here and there's just so

1688
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:31,318
many of them and so many stories that

1689
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:32,680
haven't been told and that's that's

1690
01:00:31,318 --> 01:00:34,199
that's kind of a problem because those

1691
01:00:32,679 --> 01:00:35,879
are the real Pioneers you know we we

1692
01:00:34,199 --> 01:00:39,318
call ourselves Pioneers lightly but

1693
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:41,760
that's because we're we operate in the

1694
01:00:39,318 --> 01:00:43,000
in the space that they created right

1695
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:45,799
well we're standing on the shoulders of

1696
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:48,239
giants but we are in our own right

1697
01:00:45,798 --> 01:00:49,280
Pioneers you know in a different way but

1698
01:00:48,239 --> 01:00:51,038
yeah I mean we're standing on the

1699
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:53,559
shoulders of the guys who said really

1700
01:00:51,039 --> 01:00:55,559
did it [ __ ] you when it was really

1701
01:00:53,559 --> 01:00:58,599
illegal it was illegal and they were

1702
01:00:55,559 --> 01:00:59,559
looking at serious time and you know and

1703
01:00:58,599 --> 01:01:02,200
I

1704
01:00:59,559 --> 01:01:04,079
mean sad that we ever got to this point

1705
01:01:02,199 --> 01:01:06,078
it never should have been illegal no

1706
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:09,280
kenis never should have been illegal

1707
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:11,480
hemp especially hemp that's such a joke

1708
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:14,519
that hemp was illegal well like I said

1709
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:16,599
that it's a big threat to cotton paper

1710
01:01:14,519 --> 01:01:18,599
course and I understand the reasons if

1711
01:01:16,599 --> 01:01:20,559
you have any sense in you and you think

1712
01:01:18,599 --> 01:01:22,359
that hemp should be illegal you don't

1713
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:25,480
have sense because it doesn't make any

1714
01:01:22,358 --> 01:01:27,880
sense it's just hemp is such a good

1715
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:30,280
product it remediates the soil it it

1716
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:32,798
basically gives it's way better than

1717
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:34,440
trees for for paper and for so many

1718
01:01:32,798 --> 01:01:38,119
other things we're putting you know it

1719
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:40,599
puts a lot of oxygen back in y the for

1720
01:01:38,119 --> 01:01:42,400
jeans is kind of like well and and

1721
01:01:40,599 --> 01:01:44,318
compared to Cotton it's it's wild

1722
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:46,200
because the hemp shirts last so much

1723
01:01:44,318 --> 01:01:47,880
longer hemp Fabrics last so much longer

1724
01:01:46,199 --> 01:01:50,960
than just as soft and they last three

1725
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:53,278
times four times long yeah yeah 100% so

1726
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:54,920
yeah I'm a I'm a big Fe I love hemp I

1727

1730
01:01:59,358 --> 01:02:02,719
