24
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:06,959
gummies hey so those they're evolving

25
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:08,938
now you know that whole industry's

26
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,219
evolving it's coming up quick too huh

27
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:13,519
before it was what cap and stem and

28
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:15,359
drink your orange juice yeah yeah

29
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,759
there's like chewing cardboard

30
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,978
sunflowers yeah definitely yeah

31
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,600
but yeah so uh we have a little history

32
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:23,280
together we've been working together I

33
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:25,019
guess for the last four years with some

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,299
seeds you guys ran some of my gear a

35
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:28,798
while back and definitely so yeah what

36
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,900
do you think of the genetics we loved it

37
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,299
it was very consistent we ran it at one

38
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,000
of our Calaveras farms uh with sugar

39
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:38,579
bear farms and um had good results with

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,659
it uh smoked well extract well rolled up

41
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:42,000
well

42
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,799
um you know especially you know now with

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,420
things evolving you're talking about THC

44
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,100
getting higher so that's that's even

45
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,379
better I think around that time we were

46
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:52,259
low 20s somewhere or somewhere in there

47
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:54,719
in the in the THC range so did well for

48
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,159
us that's awesome yeah yeah so you guys

49
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,618
are vertically integrated as well right

50
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,479
you have dispensaries you have uh your

51
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:03,060
grows you have a lab you you work in the

52
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:06,239
lab yes sir so I handle all uh the

53
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,819
extracts song list solving and uh

54
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,739
everything in between there topicals and

55
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:12,780
stuff like that nice

56
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:15,000
yeah so so yeah vertically integrated

57
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,640
we're growing our own

58
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,500
um got our Nursery growing uh do our own

59
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:20,339
distribution got our own manufacturing

60
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,080
so

61
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,759
um if you got any any product that comes

62
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,800
from us it actually comes from us we

63
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,479
didn't go buy it from somebody else roll

64
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,760
it up put it just put it in our bag it

65
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:31,679
was actually grown by us processed by us

66
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:34,679
and distributed by us so completely

67
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,959
vertically integrated and of course Cali

68
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,120
kosher is kosher certified cannabis it's

69
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,739
pretty impressive yeah yeah so and

70
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,700
you've been doing this a while so tell

71
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:43,560
me a little bit of history about

72
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:45,000
yourself and how you got into the rec

73
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,400
world you know what were you doing

74
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,979
before wreck yeah let's go I guess let's

75
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,599
go way back uh I started selling

76
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:53,518
cannabis when I was in seventh grade

77
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:55,979
right I went to

78
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,180
15 different schools so you know after

79
00:02:55,979 --> 00:03:00,299
after going to all these different

80
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:02,700
schools my network was pretty Broad and

81
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,200
um you know going from country to in to

82
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:06,719
town you know a friend actually

83
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:08,699
introduced me to to some cannabis the

84
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,680
name of Stephen parks and uh in front of

85
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:12,419
me my first pound of good old brickweed

86
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,280
you know good old brick red bud you know

87
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:16,018
so

88
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,640
seated definitely seated picking those

89
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:19,739
bad boys out at that time I didn't smoke

90
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:21,238
so I was you know just bagging up little

91
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:24,180
10 sacks selling them in the apartments

92
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:26,158
that I lived in and was doing using the

93
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,659
money just to buy school clothes and

94
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:29,459
stuff like that obviously at that age

95
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:31,199
I'm not trying to buy a fancy car or

96
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,640
anything like that so that's kind of how

97
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,459
I got into the industry and then when I

98
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:37,259
was 17 I started growing indoor and uh

99
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:39,120
you know from there

100
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:41,158
started having you know having the pads

101
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,379
like everybody did and so on and so

102
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:45,598
forth and did that for a while and then

103
00:03:43,378 --> 00:03:48,959
here we are coming to the to the medical

104
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:50,639
uh to the medical side of it to make a

105
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,640
long story short did the oaksterdam

106
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:55,619
University thing uh down there in

107
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:57,779
Oakland and kind of followed that motto

108
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,640
and doing the doing the um

109
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,500
doing the non-profit and all that good

110
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:03,598
stuff you do the three-month course so

111
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,158
the longer course you do the weekend I

112
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,560
did the I did the short uh the short

113
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:09,000
course the the whole compacted course

114
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,140
did it real quick I think in like three

115
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,239
months or something like that yeah yeah

116
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:15,238
maybe less than that but I did that

117
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,978
thing and then uh got um got my

118
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,418
greenhouses up I got a dispensary

119
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:19,620
purchased the dispensary right there in

120
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:21,539
Modesto there was only a medical

121
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,340
dispensary at that time yeah ended up

122
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,139
getting a license getting my Greenhouse

123
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:26,879
license was on the Forefront right there

124
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:28,199
in Stanislaus County and getting

125
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,180
everything approved and doing the walk

126
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:32,280
throughs with the state and with the

127
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:35,579
with the local municipalities and stuff

128
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:37,439
like that so man here we are today push

129
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:38,758
to get vertically integrated so that we

130
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:41,160
could be

131
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:43,439
um you know more of what we wore on the

132
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,840
on the um on the black market side being

133
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,160
able to do everything right so my goal

134
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:49,739
was to

135
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,439
keep on doing what I was doing so I had

136
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,300
to get every license so we did

137
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:55,978
um very fortunate in doing that and I

138
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,780
think you know we're one of the one of

139
00:04:55,978 --> 00:05:00,659
the very few that have every license and

140
00:04:57,779 --> 00:05:02,879
it's just uh you know us and it's we

141
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,620
don't have no Canadian groups or any any

142
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,959
outside investors or anything like that

143
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,360
it's a group of friends and uh myself

144
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:11,339
and we own our land we own our license

145
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,780
and that's why we're still here today

146
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:14,399
yeah

147
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:16,379
yeah I mean especially when times have

148
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:18,478
gotten tough and prices have dropped and

149
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:20,699
it's so much more competitive I even

150
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:23,699
think the quality of this stuff in wreck

151
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:25,680
has gotten so much better you know over

152
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:27,300
the last three years and I saw some of

153
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,340
these guys coming into the rec Market

154
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,379
from the black market or the medical

155
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:33,119
market and they had good products and

156
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:35,219
then as soon as they jumped into Rec

157
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,959
they started scaling really fast and

158
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,120
then the product went to [ __ ] you know

159
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:41,159
there's a whole bunch of Brands and I've

160
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,379
seen your stuff and you had consistent

161
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,600
product over the years you know what

162
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:46,918
percentage of your product stays in the

163
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,360
company and then through your

164
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:50,099
dispensaries and then what percentage

165
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,400
goes out typically you know through our

166
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,660
dispensaries it's probably about 10 15

167
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:56,339
through our dispensary the rest of the

168
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,560
product goes out to the other

169
00:05:56,339 --> 00:06:01,198
dispensaries throughout California nice

170
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,579
yeah so awesome it's been good but you

171
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,439
know the one of the reason why you see

172
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:06,959
the uh

173
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:08,459
you know the the quality taper off in

174
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:09,959
the beginning is everyone was trying to

175
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:11,819
figure out compliance they were trying

176
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:14,819
to figure out how do we navigate through

177
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:16,860
just getting getting the license you

178
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:19,800
know or getting getting approved through

179
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,000
your local county or city or whatever it

180
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,259
is you're trying to do everyone was

181
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,819
trying to navigate through that and they

182
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:25,919
forgot that hey we still got to grow the

183
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:27,720
product and do all this stuff yeah kind

184
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:29,879
of what I saw is the first ones to get

185
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,380
the licenses weren't like the Legacy

186
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:32,879
guys they were like the big companies

187
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:33,899
with a lot of money and so of course

188
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:35,579
they're not going to have as good a

189
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:37,918
product right no you know and I think

190
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:40,680
people are definitely catching up

191
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:42,240
um in general I think like Seattle in

192
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,560
Washington I feel like their Market's a

193
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,900
little more stabilized although they've

194
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,699
had a recession lately yeah

195
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:49,560
um so yeah it's really interesting so

196
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:51,360
today what we're gonna do on the show is

197
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,978
we're doing a blind tasting so we have

198
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,379
three different products that I pulled

199
00:06:52,978 --> 00:06:57,599
we got Ace from cookies in Hayward big

200
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:59,038
shout out to those guys and what we're

201
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,139
going to do is a blind tasting we have

202
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:03,000
one of them it's a five dollar gram or

203
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:06,060
less one that's ten dollars a gram or

204
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,660
less and one that's 15 or more before

205
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:11,639
taxes and so it's just a fun way for us

206
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:13,380
to get involved with the you know the

207
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,759
industry and show kind of showcase

208
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:16,740
different products and sometimes the

209
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:18,538
more expensive ones aren't as good as

210
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,639
the cheaper ones and you know vice versa

211
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:21,839
it's kind of all over the place yeah so

212
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,439
yeah we're gonna start with this first

213
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:27,478
one you want to dry hit it yeah why not

214
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:30,500
see what we got here it's rolled nice

215
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:30,500
it's for damn sure

216
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:38,460
okay got a good dry head to it

217
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:41,579
so we got a professional joint roller

218
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:43,620
here we had a professional joint roller

219
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:45,060
to Instagram on our show that's what

220
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,098
that's what he does for a living and he

221
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:49,199
does all these tips and the guy does

222
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:50,759
some pretty amazing stuff so what's the

223
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,860
what's the specialty on this this one

224
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:55,020
that he rolled huh yeah so this is my

225
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:57,300
guy Joe that works with me who I've

226
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:58,918
known since he was 10 and this guy has

227
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,780
been rolling joints for 30 years I mean

228
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:02,698
I've been rolling about the same but he

229
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:04,318
crushes it and so I have him roll the

230
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:06,240
joints every week sometimes I do if he's

231
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,979
not around but he does a really good job

232
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,379
with it but yeah it's the the simple

233
00:08:07,978 --> 00:08:12,240
crutch and then I I do the reverse roll

234
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:13,800
you know but this guy the professional

235
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,660
joint roller this guy [ __ ] does 100

236
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,120
joints a day and they're all you know

237
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:20,220
like eighth size joints that one looks

238
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:23,519
pretty proper to me all hand rolled too

239
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:25,259
huh all head rolls yeah if I ever do a

240
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:28,139
pre-roll it's going to be hand rolled

241
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:30,379
I'm not doing the machine stuff

242
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:34,459
packing the dust

243
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:34,459
seriously using a blender yeah

244
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,259
let's see oh yeah yeah subject number

245
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,260
eight right here yeah tell me a little

246
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:45,958
about what you do okay so I'm in the uh

247
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:49,559
manufacturing side of things so

248
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:50,599
uh basically they grow uh fire flower at

249
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:54,000
the farm

250
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:56,339
they hunt it they uh get a dollar down

251
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,440
send it over to us and then from there

252
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:01,019
we'll decide whether we want to uh

253
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,459
process it in a solvent list or BHO

254
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:04,980
depending on

255
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:07,018
yield quality and everything and then

256
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,879
from there we could go another step

257
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:12,480
further and we'll either make it into

258
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:14,458
rosin rosin Jam uh solving this cards

259
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,800
there's a wide variety of uh

260
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:19,319
consistencies uh under each one you know

261
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,699
yeah so solventless carts have you know

262
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,560
over the last year have gotten really

263
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,360
popular people love their big they're

264
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:26,819
big yeah yeah yeah they're real big

265
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,100
right now uh they like the half gram

266
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,540
cards you know what I'm saying yeah I

267
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,440
don't really like the ground I don't

268
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:32,699
really like the gram cards either

269
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,959
because I feel like by the time you get

270
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,759
down to the end of them they don't taste

271
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:37,079
very good exactly what everybody says it

272
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:38,879
tastes burnt by the time you get to the

273
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,980
end of it so they'd rather just a quick

274
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:43,019
Bang Yeah are we talking solventless

275
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,539
here yeah yeah

276
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:46,860
a lot of them are got that burnt yeah I

277
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:48,120
mean you know there was those two gram

278
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,980
carts going around for a while and it's

279
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,240
like they're thinking more bang for the

280
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,180
buck you know they can charge a little

281
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,860
more I I don't like two gram cards no so

282
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:57,359
live resin two gram cards the concept

283
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,500
was good I mean whatever they were

284
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,659
thinking they could save some money and

285
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,278
put two grand but it just it starts

286
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:04,079
tasting bad halfway through on two grams

287
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:06,120
you got about a gram of good stuff and

288
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,459
then it seems like

289
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,259
with the rosin carts the solventless

290
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:11,579
cards it's like the half gram is the

291
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:13,019
perfect amount because I mean even if

292
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,339
you do throw away a little bit then or

293
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:16,259
you don't want to hit it anymore you're

294
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:18,000
not losing that much yeah what do you

295
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:19,139
guys think about the ash on look at the

296
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,600
ass on that thing though what do you

297
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:22,980
think about that I think the ash looks

298
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,600
really good what do you think it looks

299
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,519
pretty white man yes it looks pretty

300
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,920
white it's not the whitest of white but

301
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:30,899
it's pretty white

302
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:32,458
it tastes it it tasted okay it was

303
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:33,720
smooth

304
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:36,599
um

305
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,580
maybe not as good as a terp transfers I

306
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,220
would have liked from the dry hit to the

307
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:43,080
to the to the lit hit

308
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,459
but

309
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,579
it's not bad

310
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:49,500
it's not harsh it's not harsh here try

311
00:10:47,578 --> 00:10:52,559
another hit of it I actually

312
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,820
second it's better that's what I tell

313
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:55,078
him too I'm like let me hit things the

314
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,760
second thing sometimes I feel like the

315
00:10:55,078 --> 00:10:58,078
first time when I light it yeah I don't

316
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:00,419
know I mean it's got to make it to round

317
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:02,639
two so talking about like some of the

318
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:04,559
old school strains like cat piss back in

319
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:06,659
the day you could fire or sour diesel or

320
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:08,639
OG Kush like really good kush really

321
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:11,399
good genetics back in the day

322
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:13,078
not with everything but like the special

323
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:14,940
stuff you could fire it up a week later

324
00:11:13,078 --> 00:11:16,679
and it would still taste like that yes

325
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,120
exactly so you don't see that as much

326
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:19,679
anymore yeah we were trying some stuff

327
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,120
out yesterday you know we had some

328
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,379
friends over trying out different stuff

329
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,600

Tremors you know it was all Yeah Yeah

418
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:39,838
shush man you know when I first started

419
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,220
growing in the 90s we basically trimmed

420
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,320
at each other's houses we didn't really

421
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:45,180
have Tremors we didn't even pay each

422
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:48,420
other like I harvested everyone come

423
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:50,458
over we trim the weed we trimmed it wet

424
00:14:48,419 --> 00:14:52,198
yeah we did too we were trimming it wet

425
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:53,638
out the gate what was some of the first

426
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:56,639
stuff you were going into like well

427
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:58,139
there was a string called blueberry and

428
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,180
it was a sativa

429
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:01,320
before DJ shorts blueberry it grew like

430
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:02,578
Spears

431
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,160
and I actually have a funny story

432
00:15:02,578 --> 00:15:06,479
because one that I was high as [ __ ] and

433
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:09,179
the plants started growing I didn't

434
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,199
realize they would double in flour and

435
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:13,259
they totally double they were against

436
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:14,698
the lights and I fell into the plants

437
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:16,019
and I think I took out like three or

438
00:15:14,698 --> 00:15:18,419
four plants completely trying to move

439
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:20,399
the cola away from the lights slapped me

440
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:21,719
in the face in my [ __ ] face swole up

441
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,958
a little bit

442
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:27,240
but yeah we were growing like uh

443
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:29,458
oh man so there was stuff from Oregon

444
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:32,879
there was like the four-way there was uh

445
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:35,518
the Trinity the four-way

446
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:36,958
um the snow the snow Bud there was no

447
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,179
bad there was no cap obviously but

448
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:40,138
there's no bud we had this the strain

449
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:41,879
called the snow and there was a string

450
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,740
called the corn and those were coming

451
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:45,120
down from Eugene along with like a

452
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,980
little bit later than that was like the

453
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,720
dog bed we had dog coming from there

454
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,759
Trinity was really good and I think

455
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,440
there was this train called diamonds and

456
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:55,740
it was just super frosted but it was

457
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,480
like the Oreos of today okay okay and uh

458
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:59,100
we got a lot of our stuff from genetics

459
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,740
really high-end stuff from Oregon you

460
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,959
know really impressive uh I used to grow

461
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:06,000
in tables and then I went to octagons we

462
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:07,198
did this vertical grow how do you guys

463
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,799
start out

464
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:11,879
me I was a good old Jorge Cervantes

465
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:13,979
video

466
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:15,600
matter of fact back in the day tried to

467
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,759
see a green method you know just went

468
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,399
soiled and was feeding some good old

469
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:23,039
three-part GH you know that was my first

470
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,899
in a trailer out on Simmons Road and in

471
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,819
Turlock California

472
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:29,220
um had a buddy's house on a little ranch

473
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:32,720
that was the first go ago at the little

474
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:35,339
moving light uh rail you know

475
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,139
one gallon plant screw them just you

476
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:38,699
know a little foot tall flipped them and

477
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:41,100
just had little little shrubs that

478
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:43,979
worked you know and then from there

479
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:46,379
um went into a shed you know put it put

480
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:48,240
it on a tray did some flooding drain you

481
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:51,419
know with some with some groatan cubes

482
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,259
or some cultaline cubes back in the day

483
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:53,939
um

484
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:56,820
man and then from there just started

485
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:58,620
evolving and you know my strains were my

486
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,959
very first ones were Granddaddy Purp you

487
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:03,179
know that was our stuff that that we got

488
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:06,058
from uh back in the day got it from

489
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:07,379
Stoney and um that's what that's what we

490
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:09,660
grew and then got a hold of some Bubba

491
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:11,459
Kush and then was heading down to

492
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:13,740
heading down to Oakland and was going

493
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:15,660
over there to the to the bulldog and to

494
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,519

495
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:19,558

00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:31,740
Romulan yeah all those things like that

501
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:33,839
then come to find out all I needed to

502
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,900
grow was [ __ ] granddaddy you know

503
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:37,980
granddaddy granddaddy was hot you know

504
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:41,400
when they came out the best thing in the

505
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:43,200
octagons it was so um that's how that's

506
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,780
how that's how we started so I'm an

507
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,220
indoor guy that's what I was for for a

508
00:17:45,779 --> 00:17:49,079
long time and been trying to get back to

509
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:51,000
that you know been doing greenhouse and

510
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:52,379
outdoor I haven't had to you guys

511
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,940
crushed it on the greenhouse though it's

512
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,799
like yeah but it looks like an indoor

513
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:58,160
product right but you know you I want to

514
00:17:55,798 --> 00:18:01,019
get back into that indoor and for sure

515
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,519
you know you know growing greenhouse and

516
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:03,960
pulling tarp and doing it like the way

517
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:06,599
we're doing is

518
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,579
is old school you know yeah I I it's

519
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:10,558
it's respectable you know respectable

520
00:18:08,579 --> 00:18:12,659
but I think it's harder to get a better

521
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:14,038
product than it is because indoor you

522
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:16,200
can control the variables I make my

523
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:17,759
seeds indoors yep you know going back

524
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,319
real quick to the first grow that I ever

525
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:20,700
had which is a funny story though I used

526
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:22,079
to photo tron I don't know if you

527
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,960
remember photo tracks from High Times

528
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,639
magazines yeah so we got a bag seed from

529
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,340
something it was in one of the buds and

530
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,799
we grew it out and I used to [ __ ] cut

531
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:34,859
the top off and I stole a light from the

532
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:37,200
Sun Valley Mall little uh 400 watt

533
00:18:34,859 --> 00:18:39,058
[ __ ] put that up cut the top off the

534
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,740
photo charm put that on the top and have

535
00:18:39,058 --> 00:18:42,359
the plant grow up through it and it was

536
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:44,160
okay weed it wasn't like super

537
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:45,719
connoisseur Bud back in the day you know

538
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,400
I think the outdoor was I used to like

539
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,319
outdoor right and there was a time where

540
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,519
outdoor was more expensive than indoor I

541
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:52,859
remember there's four thousand dollar

542
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:55,259
pounds 4 500 or pounds of outdoor back

543
00:18:52,859 --> 00:18:57,538
in the 90s which uh you know it was more

544
00:18:55,259 --> 00:19:00,480
prized I think and it was sticky ass

545
00:18:57,538 --> 00:19:01,440
weed really sticky stuff yeah a lot of

546
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,120
people didn't know what they were doing

547
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,220
indoor either right like you said you

548
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:07,139
you know Photoshop got the top off did

549
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:09,240
this that came out all right outdoor you

550
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:12,000
take care of it you know right and you

551
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,798
you know dry it right is the main thing

552
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,599
right that's the big thing these days is

553
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:17,480
having the dry facility for you know two

554
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:19,859
acres or three acres

555
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,720
try and cure it properly yeah you can

556
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:23,579
grow something that's like one of the

557
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,620
biggest aspects and it gets overlooked

558
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,460
so much yeah dude what do you guys think

559
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:28,739
of this

560
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,600
I would say the ash is not super white

561
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:32,460
but it's not bad

562
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:34,619
um you got another hit of it

563
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:37,140
I'll take another here let me see I'll

564
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:40,038
have to take these what kind of chirps I

565
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,038
get some Terps on it

566
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:44,399
it's one of those trains that if you go

567
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:48,798
like [ __ ] it'd probably still be terpy

568
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,798
but that's grown that's grown decent

569
00:19:50,538 --> 00:19:56,240
I'll tell you for me I'll take it again

570
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,240
but I would have spiked it already

571
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:02,759
the second they say I'm hoping this last

572
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:05,460
one is the winner so I'll be right

573
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:07,140
because I would rank this one under the

574
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,700
first one yep I feel like the first one

575
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:11,100
had a little bit more Terps to it than

576
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,960
yeah this one has a specific type of

577
00:20:11,099 --> 00:20:15,000
term right it's a Tangy kind of chirp to

578
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,679
it like it's a TV yeah yeah yeah yeah

579
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,298
yeah when I dry hit it I can I can get

580
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:21,600
that little uh that little turp on there

581
00:20:18,298 --> 00:20:22,918
yeah faint faint faint but but like one

582
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:24,178
of those ones that if you grow them in

583
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:25,380
Morocco or something like that it would

584
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:26,940
probably still have that terp come

585
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:29,460
through even if it was like the ugliest

586
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:31,019
looking grown-like [ __ ] plant yeah so

587
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,660
you don't get too much Tangy off that

588
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:36,660
one right there I got more uh some more

589
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:38,100
bland uh I couldn't really decipher what

590
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,960
the Terps were in the beginning of it

591
00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:41,699
but it wasn't nothing nothing desirable

592
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,220
to me yeah

593
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,980
yeah some sativa in there for sure so

594
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:48,779
less than five on that yep all right so

595
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:52,700
we have less than ten less than five

596
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:52,700
yeah we're going for Gusto right here

597
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:57,120
this is either

598
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,220
better or worse you would you know the

599
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:01,439
thing is just like you can re-uh

600
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:04,079
reassign the different ones at the end

601
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,640
because well we'll see maybe maybe

602
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:06,839
either the one that we thought under 10

603
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,640
was going to be the winner you know we

604
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:11,279
had people on the episode and we we

605
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,020
found one that was like the 85 eighth

606
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:15,720
and it wasn't as good as the five dollar

607
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:16,918
one so you just never really know what

608
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,679
you're gonna get

609
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:22,320
life is like a box of chocolates this

610
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:26,120
one we didn't get to dry hit it oh [ __ ]

611
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:26,119
you already messed up all right

612
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:30,200
he's nice

613
00:21:30,298 --> 00:21:33,440
let's see what happens here

614
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:37,740
put some water on it put a little water

615
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:40,340
on the pallet there angel you know what

616
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,339
I mean dust It Off

617
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,720
I still taste that other one it's not

618
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,720
that

619
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:48,659
you still taste that second one or the

620
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:51,299
first one

621
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:54,500
still taste the second one like

622
00:21:51,298 --> 00:21:54,500
not a good taste

623
00:21:54,839 --> 00:22:00,740
yeah it's like they didn't flush it or

624
00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:00,740
if they flushed it I'm not sure

625
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,400
so what kind of nutrients do you guys

626
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:08,399
use

627
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:10,679
um we use a mission organic nutrients

628
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,059
use that with a little blend of some

629
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:14,460
vital

630
00:22:12,058 --> 00:22:15,899
it's got a little vital yeah so a little

631
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:18,360
little blend of both of those right

632
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,860
there I run vital the vital soil at the

633
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:21,240
house was the vital nutrients they give

634
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:23,699
me the vital nutrients Brian doesn't

635
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,919
right I really like their product good

636
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:28,980
people yeah we tried their we are in

637
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,820
some of our beds is is vital soil

638
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,919
um

639
00:22:29,819 --> 00:22:34,619
we got a couple different beds that we

640
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,538
tried out from from Mission as well but

641
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:38,599
for the most part

642
00:22:36,538 --> 00:22:38,599
um

643
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:43,979
for the most part after seven years you

644
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:45,720
know it's our own soil you know after

645
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:47,640
it's keeping the same soil keeping it

646
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,860
alive keeping it tested

647
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:52,220
this one is a lot tighter it is a lot

648
00:22:49,859 --> 00:22:52,219
tighter

649
00:22:53,099 --> 00:22:57,240
I'm gonna have to talk to Joe about that

650
00:22:54,659 --> 00:23:00,799
one did you roll this one no I do roll

651
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,798
tight joints like that but that was Joe

652
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:05,819
especially now I wouldn't be taking

653
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:09,140
credit for it

654
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:09,139
looks like it's burning ice

655
00:23:11,819 --> 00:23:15,558
my ears are popping

656
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:21,379
yeah it's gonna suck that hard let me

657
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:21,379
see

658
00:23:25,558 --> 00:23:31,019
oh so yeah so how is this weather

659
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:33,839
affected you guys because we had our

660
00:23:31,019 --> 00:23:35,099
wettest wettest year on record hands

661
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:36,720
down I've never experienced anything

662
00:23:35,099 --> 00:23:38,459
like this in my life I think that's

663
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,960
something I haven't got this much water

664
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:42,120
like in 30 years or something like that

665
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,679
something crazy yeah some crazy number

666
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:45,479
like that regardless of all that we

667
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,240
usually grow during the winter right we

668
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,919
usually got our heaters running and you

669
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,480
know our supplemental supplemental

670
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,520
lighting is very minimum it's just 100

671
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,259
history this year yeah it's just string

672
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:58,139
lighting this year there was no point to

673
00:23:55,259 --> 00:24:00,779
even attempt to battle you know with

674
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:02,520
with the weather Mother Nature one for

675
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:04,619
for our type of greenhouse for what

676
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:06,960
we're doing so this winter kind of shut

677
00:24:04,619 --> 00:24:08,819
us down so so your Growers are fresh and

678
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,919
ready to kick ass I bet I mean they're

679
00:24:08,819 --> 00:24:12,839
hot on it you know season is season now

680
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:14,759
right you know because they had the

681
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:18,058
downtime and now here we are when in a

682
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:20,640
full season so everybody's ready to go

683
00:24:18,058 --> 00:24:22,200
that's awesome

684
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,820
so what do you guys think of this one

685
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,819
you think this is better or worse

686
00:24:26,038 --> 00:24:29,579
I'll go ahead and say mine either right

687
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,679
I'm go uh

688
00:24:29,579 --> 00:24:34,798
the first one we smoke number one this

689
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:37,519
one too another one three

690
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:37,519
foreign

691
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,720
tastes pretty good

692
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,839
that tastes good

693
00:24:55,798 --> 00:25:01,220
so did you guys get more high after you

694
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:01,220
took hits off of the second joint

695
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,798
and pretty yeah that was kind of there

696
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,079
with the first one I didn't really feel

697
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:11,879
a change with the second one too much

698
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:14,460
I would say the first one is number one

699
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,679
the first one's the most expensive the

700
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:18,000
15 or more or the it's going to be the

701
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:19,940
best weed I can't tell you it was the

702
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,200
most expensive but yeah

703
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:27,200
so he's like how are you how you want it

704
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:27,200
the most expensivest or the most

705
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:32,038
it makes me think like old and dry

706
00:25:30,298 --> 00:25:33,179
I'm gonna go right down the line one two

707
00:25:32,038 --> 00:25:35,400
three

708
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:37,620
number one is number one number two is

709
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:41,159
number two number three was number three

710
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:44,339
so being most expensive or ten dollar

711
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:48,539
and our uh five dollar right here

712

00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:24,079
by sea junkie genetics

726
00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:28,558
shrub cake was actually

727
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:31,140
the middle one

728
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:32,778
ten dollars or less okay so we were

729
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:35,220
right the first time

730
00:26:32,778 --> 00:26:36,659
yeah you guys were absolutely right the

731
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:40,100
first time the last one through this in

732
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:40,100
the loop and the second one right here

733
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:44,940
this is out the trunk

734
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,480
out the trunk

735
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:50,100
five dollars or less per gram

736
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,079
all right so we all got that one right

737
00:26:50,099 --> 00:26:54,079
right no no no no no no no no no no

738
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:59,159
boom this is Discount

739
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,720
shout out to House of cultivar I really

740
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:03,419
like the genetics I just don't think it

741
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,880
was like a Super Fresh product right

742
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:07,919
um so Fountainhead that's uh my partner

743
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,659
is Jason and Gordon we have a company

744
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:12,778
together up in Seattle

745
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:14,159
and so the genetics are from Washington

746
00:27:12,778 --> 00:27:15,778
originally

747
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,220
and the genetic I think it smokes

748
00:27:15,778 --> 00:27:18,960
awesome usually but it just seems like

749
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:21,538
it was a little old

750
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:25,740
so one

751
00:27:21,538 --> 00:27:27,900
two three one most expensive

752
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:30,179
yeah it's got them all wrong but that's

753
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:31,980
you know it's it's interesting what do

754
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:33,840
you think that means you know as a

755
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,099
business owner that's in oh so this one

756
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:37,079
was the most expensive this is the most

757
00:27:35,099 --> 00:27:38,579
expensive yeah this one was the middle

758
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:41,099
and then the out the trunk was actually

759
00:27:38,579 --> 00:27:43,139
the cheapest yep

760
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:46,139
but which one do you think was the best

761
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:48,059
all of us I agree that

762
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,860
the shrub cake had the most chirps got

763
00:27:48,058 --> 00:27:52,278
it this out the truck we were all wrong

764
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:55,259
we were all wrong

765
00:27:52,278 --> 00:27:57,778
number one he said the Disco was the

766
00:27:55,259 --> 00:27:58,919
cheapest oh okay I said I said though I

767
00:27:57,778 --> 00:28:00,599
said why oh yeah that's right you said

768
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:02,340
one two three yeah they both picked the

769
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:04,079
same one as the best smoking was this

770
00:28:02,339 --> 00:28:06,178
one you and I both picked this one of

771
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:08,879
the best as the most expensive but it

772
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:10,919
was the middle yep and I picked this one

773
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,600
as the cheapest

774
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:16,259
right and it was the most the most

775
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:18,178
expensive I picked the cheapest one the

776
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:20,460
cheapest right I got that one right I

777
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:22,140
just got my one and two wrong but I got

778
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:24,500
my lower end one right looks like a

779
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:28,460
Ferrari drives like a pinto

780
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:28,460
sativa always gets the wrap

781
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:32,460
so what's your thought on sativas you

782
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:34,199
guys like sativas I think the market

783
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,880
doesn't really like him that much but I

784
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:38,159
think sativas are amazing like you know

785
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,080
equatorial genetics and they ask for

786
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,360
them a lot you know it's it's in demand

787
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:44,699
a lot by you know a lot of older people

788
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:46,259
if you could do a boutique at a boutique

789
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,940
level where it's a yeah I think it's

790
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:50,099
amazing I think there's a market for but

791
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,659
it's tough at scale it's funny because

792
00:28:50,099 --> 00:28:54,839
just a couple weeks ago we've seen two

793
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:57,720
people bring us some uh some jack indoor

794
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:59,699
you know and we're like what they say

795
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,900
it's growing in indoors in my bag I I

796
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,100
mean I don't smoke a lot of it but I

797
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,919
have European friends that come into

798
00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:06,658
town or whatever and so I and I like you

799
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:07,799
know Jack Jack's okay I like the old

800
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:09,600
Jack I don't know if you guys remember

801
00:29:07,798 --> 00:29:13,019
the old Jackson back in the day that was

802
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:14,219
like super funky and super pungent it's

803
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:16,440
a you know there's there are several

804
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:18,179
Jacks obviously Jack Flash was one of my

805
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,580
favorites that we had back in the 90s

806
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:25,440
and you know there's candy Jack there's

807
00:29:20,579 --> 00:29:27,359
you know j13 j26 yep remember the Jays

808
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,399
yeah and then there was a time where

809
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:31,379
people were confusing train wreck with

810
00:29:29,398 --> 00:29:32,759
Jack Herrera so you would buy Trainwreck

811
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:34,200
and it would be [ __ ] Jack and I'd be

812
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:36,119
like dude this is [ __ ] Jack Herer

813
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,860
that's a big confusion that's a big

814
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:39,239
confusion that's just I think that's

815
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:42,119
when the [ __ ] kind of started

816
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:44,220
actually yeah the first [ __ ] we ever

817
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:46,439
noted yeah strain fishing or whatever

818

819
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,380

820
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:52,259

getting uh Catfish by weed seriously you

822
00:29:52,259 --> 00:29:55,619
know what I'm saying you look at it it's

823
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:58,398
nice fish when you get genetics they

824
00:29:55,619 --> 00:30:00,859
give you the wrong [ __ ] thing

825
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:03,058
you know man it's out there it happens

826
00:30:00,859 --> 00:30:04,859
you'll look at something to look amazing

827
00:30:03,058 --> 00:30:06,480
you know smell amazing yeah and you

828
00:30:04,859 --> 00:30:08,658
smoke it and it's just like man no no

829
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,519
flavor kind of harsh on the throat yeah

830
00:30:08,659 --> 00:30:13,679
man I got a catfish by this weed man

831
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:15,418
yeah my partner Justin all the genetics

832
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:18,120
we do sequencing everything's

833
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:20,100
fingerprinted through my flora DNA and

834
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:21,959
so it's like we have the we have the

835
00:30:20,099 --> 00:30:24,240
data you know and I think moving forward

836
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,038
it's going to be a lot harder to

837
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,179
[ __ ] people exactly people you don't

838
00:30:26,038 --> 00:30:28,679
want to see the data you know that's

839
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:30,419
where the future is going it's going to

840
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:32,700
be able to identify everything like yeah

841
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:34,080
nope that's not what you what you think

842
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:36,740
it is sorry to break your heart you know

843
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:39,298
but yeah you've been cut fished

844
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:40,919
you could do a whole show yeah yeah you

845
00:30:39,298 --> 00:30:42,538
know what I'm saying spin off I want

846
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:45,538
credit all right we'll be in the credits

847
00:30:42,538 --> 00:30:45,538
seriously

848
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:01,910
[Laughter]

849
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:07,139
they have the video uh

850
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:08,700
so what do you guys think the industry

851
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:10,919
is going to do in the future where do

852
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:13,080
you see our industry going in the next

853
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:15,000
five years ten years we've gone through

854
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:16,740
this consolidation in California quite a

855
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,480
bit a lot of people didn't renew their

856
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:20,480
licenses what do you guys think

857
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:23,058
a lot of people didn't renew their

858
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:27,539
devices

859
00:31:23,058 --> 00:31:28,200
75 yeah here's what I think I think you

860
00:31:27,538 --> 00:31:31,140
know

861
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:33,000
indoor is indoors indoor you can grow in

862
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,679
indoor anywhere in the country right

863
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,019
yeah you can grow I could build the same

864
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:38,399
grow room here in California as I can in

865
00:31:37,019 --> 00:31:40,079
New York right and we could create the

866
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:42,418
same environment

867
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:43,918
with the outdoor and the greenhouse not

868
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:45,600
everybody can grow that across the

869
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,159
country you know you can't you see

870
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:48,959
people they tried you can't do it in

871
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:50,880
Florida like you can do it in Oregon or

872
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,980
in California for sure exactly at least

873
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,380
most of the state right so I think

874
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:57,839
that's you know if and when the the

875
00:31:55,380 --> 00:32:00,419
lines open up I think that's where it's

876
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:01,678
going to benefit the farmers uh here in

877
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:03,720
California because people are going to

878
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,700
want you know weed from Humble weed from

879
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:07,079
California just like our wine that's

880
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:10,319
that's what I think right then you're

881
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:12,298
going to get your indoor Boutique

882
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:14,339
um indoor Boutique Farmers right that

883
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:16,379
are going to be like your your micro

884
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:18,538
breweries per se that you have those

885
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:22,080
special drops that happen at a little

886
00:32:18,538 --> 00:32:23,819
store here in in Hayward or Modesto or

887
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:25,918
wherever there's only certain stores

888
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:28,139
that have these drops of this micro

889
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,538
Brewery that this certain person bred

890
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:32,700
that he only makes or this they only

891
00:32:30,538 --> 00:32:33,898
make and there's only so much of it so I

892
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,700
think that's where we're going with that

893
00:32:33,898 --> 00:32:36,599
right you're gonna have the big guys are

894
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,980
going to come in you're gonna have your

895
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:39,719
Marlboro you're gonna have those guys

896
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:42,240
that I mean there's a couple guys that

897
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:44,220
are already quote-unquote for sure that

898
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,538
with at that status

899
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:47,339
um so

900
00:32:45,538 --> 00:32:48,599
um I just think it's you know it's going

901
00:32:47,339 --> 00:32:50,519
to kind of go the direction of alcohol

902
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:51,298
right and have your Budweiser your Coors

903
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:52,500
Lights and then you're going to have

904
00:32:51,298 --> 00:32:54,119
your Sierra Nevadas but then you're

905
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,740
gonna have an even more Boutique guys

906
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:57,658
yeah the Russian Rivers as opposed to

907
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:59,460
Sierra Nevadas and like the Lagunitas

908
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:01,380
and I think is a great company I think

909
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:03,000
modeling it after somewhere between that

910
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:05,399
and the wine industry would be amazing

911
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,500
especially with things like avas the

912
00:33:05,398 --> 00:33:09,719
viticultural areas where they're

913
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:12,000
designated areas and so in that region

914
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,500
you can talk about terroir and then you

915
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,380
can uh

916
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:18,298
talk about how the soil affects the

917
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,799
taste of your Greenhouse or outdoor and

918
00:33:18,298 --> 00:33:22,319
you can have strain specific stuff where

919
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:24,720
you can go buy OG Kush that's grown in

920
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:26,639
the where you guys are or you can go to

921
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,200
Humble or Mendocino and maybe OG Kush is

922
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,038
grown in all three places it goes better

923
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,038
something foreign

924
00:33:38,339 --> 00:33:42,240
it's a good one that's the collab with

925
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:44,579
uh mosca seeds we got it's Australian

926
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,679
raspberry Boogie time series and it's

927
00:33:44,579 --> 00:33:48,720
got all the it's got all the fun stuff

928
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:50,399
as far as Terps and looks then it has

929
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,740
this nice eucalyptus smell definitely

930
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:54,178
unique definitely unique in a good way

931
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:55,919
you know

932
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:57,778
yeah so I think that's what I think it's

933
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,120
what's happened like you said terawa

934
00:33:57,778 --> 00:34:02,398
light spectrum where it's being grown at

935
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:03,239
so on and so forth and

936
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:06,000
um

937
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:08,579
and like you said 75 of licenses haven't

938
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,440
been renewed right yeah with that being

939
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:13,019
said that helps out the the farmers that

940
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:14,338
are still it does still growing today

941
00:34:13,019 --> 00:34:16,019
you know and there's not a lot of

942
00:34:14,338 --> 00:34:18,539
outdoor production no and then you know

943
00:34:16,019 --> 00:34:19,918
you've seen distillate take a take a

944
00:34:18,539 --> 00:34:22,019
increase you know people were getting

945
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:24,480
leaders for 600 bucks and overnight it

946
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:25,980
went to sixteen hundred dollars so you

947
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,599
know that's that's a huge hike you know

948
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:30,780
