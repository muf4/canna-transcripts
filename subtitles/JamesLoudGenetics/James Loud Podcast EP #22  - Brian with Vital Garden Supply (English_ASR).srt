25
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:03,399
even before before that how how did you

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,478
start with uh within the industry sure

27
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:08,519
I'll give you the quick rundown um

28
00:01:05,478 --> 00:01:11,759
industry-wise I mean cannabis you know

29
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:14,959
found me at a pretty young age and uh

30
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:17,040
nice I always felt you know drawn to it

31
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:20,798
you know young young age and then I

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,640
realized that it was also like a way to

33
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,720
really you know link with other people

34
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,478
and it was like a good common ground for

35
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:32,319
to meet people that may not be from your

36
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:35,478
exact same demographic and just be able

37
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:37,879
to like open up your like friends circle

38
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:39,840
on like a huge scale you know yes it's

39
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:41,679
like the one thing that unites us all

40
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,439
kind of like food does for people I feel

41
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,719
like is very similar you know like you

42
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:46,319
can have all these different backgrounds

43
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:48,798
of people that they would normally be

44
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,319
friends but because the plant we're all

45
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,000
connected in that way for sure and I

46
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:55,000
noticed that even at a young age like in

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,319
high school cuz you know all schools are

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,840
similar you know my I'm grew up middle

49
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:04,279
class Pennsylvania West Virginia uh East

50
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,680
Coast you know not much good weed ever

51
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,080
and uh you know but a lot of people

52
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,239
smoked weed yeah and it was it was

53
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,440
Mexican and it was pretty much it if it

54
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:15,560
was weed it's weed it wasn't like this

55
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:18,359
weed or that weed or it was just weed

56
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,080
right and uh you know it helped it

57
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,560
definitely helped connect with different

58
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,959
neighborhoods and different types of

59
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,719
people from the football players to the

60
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:29,360
burnouts to the smart kids to the jocks

61
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:31,759
to everybody you know so you were

62
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,959
smoking the ' 80s yeah oh yeah for sure

63
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:36,759
nice 82 83 really was that's awesome

64
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,800
yeah for sure yeah I was like 10 years

65
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:40,399
after that so it was it was I feel like

66
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,920
it was a little bit of a different scene

67
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,039
after you know in the 90s compared to

68
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:46,359
the 80s from what I've heard yeah I'm

69
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:48,439
sure I think the I think the 9s was more

70
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,120
of the like BC weed as far as like

71
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:51,479
commercial and maybe they were starting

72
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,000
to get some California and some

73
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:55,560
homegrown weed I think a lot of the

74
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,039
California hom I'm I'm from California

75
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,360
too so never saw that Mexican brick weed

76
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:01,598
no no I saw Mexican brick weed oh you

77
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,319
did okay sure well good I'm we used to

78
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,878
yeah we used to get pounds of it for you

79
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:07,719
know it was like $400 a pound or

80
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:10,039
something like that for sure and uh it

81
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:11,318
would get you really high and it would

82
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:13,000
sometimes you'd have like a joint and it

83
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:14,399
would pop seeds out of the joint you

84
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,318
know you forget to take them all out or

85
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,799
whatever and it was lot of the stuff was

86
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:20,598
seated but some of it was green some of

87
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:23,080
it wasn't Brown it was all pressed right

88
00:03:20,598 --> 00:03:24,719
you have to like break it apart and yeah

89
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,840
yeah I didn't start to see the better

90
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,878
Mexican weed until I was like more like

91
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:32,840
in college and then I finally started

92
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:35,438
seeing like I'd say by like 888

93
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,759
889 yeah on the East Coast I mean I'd

94
00:03:35,438 --> 00:03:39,919
occasionally see like go on go to a dead

95
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:42,039
show and like a different area and be

96
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:44,518
able to get a bag of weed that was like

97
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:47,039
amazing and and try to just hold on to

98
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,080
that as long as I could right because

99
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,120
that was like the only access to like

100
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,519
really high-grade weed you know I swear

101
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,719
every guest is interconnected with the

102
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:57,360
Grateful Dead not but not by you know

103
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:59,959
selection it's just oh I think Grateful

104
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,519
Dead cannabis very very highly tied

105
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:06,598
together for sure especially you know us

106
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:09,280
older Statesman you know around and like

107
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:11,119
let's face it like chem dog you know

108
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,840
that happened because of a Grateful Dead

109
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,360
concert you know and like so many

110
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,639
different you know Growers would like

111
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,680
take their craft weed and go hustle that

112
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,519
on on the dead lot yeah and that was

113
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,240
kind of like the open market then and

114
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:28,000
sure before that you know like I didn't

115
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:30,720
know of even good weed so like it opened

116
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,240
my eyes to you know see what the

117
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,880
possibilities were and then it just you

118
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,960
know what kind of genetics do you

119
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:38,879
remember any of the strain names not

120
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:41,680
that strain names are like any I

121
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:45,159
remember smoking real blueberry Bud like

122
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,280
like in like 87 88 but more of like a

123
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,840
sativa right like yeah it was definitely

124
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:52,279
sativa for sure so my first experience

125
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:54,079
with any sort of blueberry was a sativa

126
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:56,159
plant and there was one of the first

127
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:58,519
things I grew at my house when I got

128
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,120
eight lights in with my buddy and he got

129
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:02,560
these clones and and they were from

130
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,478
Oregon and it doubled in flower and they

131
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,800
were growing up into the lights and it

132
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:08,758
was like I didn't really know what I was

133
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,520
doing but we were yeah we were figuring

134
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:13,759
it out for sure so well I remember

135
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:16,079
buying bags of weed of this blueberry

136
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,038
and then always like been on the lookout

137
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:19,758
for it and like occasionally I would I

138
00:05:18,038 --> 00:05:21,800
think once or twice really only is all

139
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,759
that I ever got it and I think that was

140
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,240
the only time I really saw the true DJ

141
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:30,038
Short Blueberry yeah and then I just

142
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:32,280
recently got got his oh yeah so DJ is a

143
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:35,000
short is a very short plan and it's it's

144
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:35,959
blueberry but the one from Oregon you

145
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,720
don't think it's going to be the one

146
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:40,038
that I I've been having my memory I

147
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,479
don't think so I don't honest don't

148
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:44,000
think it might be maybe I'm wrong but

149
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:45,439
the one I remember is very different

150
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,079
than DJ shorts because I was so excited

151
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:48,680
to gr DJ shorts and I grew it and I was

152
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:50,399
like got a completely different plant

153
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,918
and not that it was bad it was just so

154
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,159
different that it was a let down for me

155
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:55,918
because I was expecting this SAA plant

156
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,240
that doubles in

157
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:00,680
flow these crazy Frosty nugs and it

158
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,280
didn't have the same profile it was

159
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:06,519
blueberry but like the one from Oregon

160
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:09,399
was like this crazy not fely blueberry

161
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:10,839
but it was like really complex and down

162
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:12,399
to the roach you could roll joints of it

163
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:13,478
and you would want to yeah smoke it down

164
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:15,159
you could pick the roaches up the next

165
00:06:13,478 --> 00:06:17,800
day this this was that and it was from

166
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,720
Oregon yeah but as far as the plant I

167
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,840
got it from somebody who says this is

168
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,840
the DJ Short Blueberry and I don't know

169
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,758
good no DJ Short Blueberry is great too

170
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:28,119
if you had the experience but the leaves

171
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:31,520
are super serrated yeah almost to the

172
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:34,319
point where they like fall the serration

173
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:36,560
yeah stay is goes inconsistent because

174
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,800
it's like such a a severe serration it

175
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,918
almost just Blends together almost wow

176
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,240
and then there's also even some

177
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:44,038
variegation in it V well that's cool

178
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,800
yeah so I'm curious to see how it's

179
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:48,560
going to come out I'm just try it for

180
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,120
sure yeah I I'll let you know for sure

181
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,519
so yeah so let's go into vital how do

182
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:56,959
you start vital vital um you know I was

183
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:59,038
I was a grower and I was like always

184
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:00,799
like lean to the organic Side of

185
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:03,399
Everything you know grew a lot of my own

186
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,520
vegetables and wanted to like have a

187
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:07,399
clean organic product and one day I

188
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:09,878
thought I was using an organic product

189
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:10,959
and I read the label and and I realized

190
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:12,560
that there were some ingredients in

191
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:15,478
there that probably weren't weren't

192
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,120
organic and uh so long story short I

193
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:19,279
started like just looking more and more

194
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,240
at labels and like realizing that

195
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:24,239
there's a lot of crappy products out

196
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:26,478
there that have this visual appeal that

197
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,319
that may like tend to think that the

198
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:30,199
grower who's looking at it would think

199
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,120
that it was organic right whether it's

200
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:35,360
like the name or or however they like

201
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,240
you know TST something in your head yeah

202
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,960
exactly so it kind of started to bother

203
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,240
me and I was like you know what I think

204
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:44,560
you know this is what I need this is

205
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:47,439
something I need to do and um around the

206
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,478
same time you brought up earlier Israel

207
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:52,240
yeah um he's a good old friend of mine

208
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:53,478
and he um was living up in Oregon and

209
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,960
they were they were kind of having

210
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:58,318
similar issues and you know like we were

211
00:07:55,959 --> 00:08:00,918
all kind of like comparing notes and and

212
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,360
those guys started company up up in um

213
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:07,758
Oregon at the same time relatively I

214
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:10,879
also had a um Landscaping um license so

215
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,720
I basically built my store in my U

216
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,039
manufacturing company off of originally

217
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,199
just getting that landscaping license uh

218
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:19,318
state contractor's license yeah so and

219
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:22,000
and my company was called vital

220
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:25,280
Landscaping nice um so anyway long story

221
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,639
short those guys up there you know there

222
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:28,519
was a couple of them they had a little

223
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,360
bit more Capital put together so they

224
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:33,559
were a little bit putting some products

225
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,800
out right and uh so we distributed their

226
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:38,598
products and then I would make products

227
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:40,399
that would be kind of like um a

228
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:42,440
companion to some of their products so

229
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,278
like wow their first products was they

230
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,560
had a potting soil and then they had a

231
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:51,039
grow in a bloom and then my first

232
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:53,239
product was a um it was a cumic acid and

233
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:55,439
which is Baseline and still one of our

234
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,000
leading selling products right a liquid

235
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,880
a liquid and a dry version yeah and then

236
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,958
the next product was fish cuz like we

237
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:05,120
were big on the whole compost tea thing

238
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:08,439
right so you know getting compost and

239
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,679
worm castings and putting them into

240
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:13,399
water and adding a few things and mixing

241
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:15,679
some oxygen into there and and trying to

242
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:17,440
see what we what came of it was like how

243
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:19,199
it started and then we kind of learned

244
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,959
about Elaine inham and so on and so

245
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:25,360
forth so basically 2006 um actually

246
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:28,439
officially open doors of vital Garden

247
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,399
Supply yeah and um started Distributing

248
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,640
a couple of those products from Oregon

249
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,679
the Vital Earth Brand and so he was

250
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,639
Vital Earth and you were vital Garden

251
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:37,799
yeah and and they were like they called

252
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:40,679
me one day and they're like I got a

253
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:43,078
great idea cuz I was already vital

254
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:44,639
landscaping and I and I was opening the

255
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:46,399
store as vital Garden Supply and they're

256
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,199
like we'll be Vital Earth and you'll be

257
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,039
our distributor and I'm like and we were

258
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,680
like I was like sounds good you know

259
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:53,838
looking back on it you know it

260
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:55,399
definitely created a little confusion on

261
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,399
the other hand we were all family and

262
00:09:55,399 --> 00:10:00,879
and friends and didn't we we represented

263
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,120
them as it was was our own and like we

264
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:05,600
were the California you know hub for

265
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,879
them cuz being in Oregon and shipping

266
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,240
and all that it didn't make sense and

267
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:11,559
you know they were caught up in in

268
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,959
Oregon building their companies and

269
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:15,319
lives and you know all that too so is

270
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:16,879
has gone on to do all kinds of stuff

271
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,560
he's down in Columbia right now with

272
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:20,439
Vital Earth down there and you know

273
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:23,239
phonics they did you know he's done

274
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,920
genetics we talk very often we're still

275
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,959
very close I've actually been down to

276
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:29,599
Columbia with him nice um I had a

277
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:31,838
project in Colombia that didn't all way

278
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,680
pan out but um we went down there

279
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,600
together and we're checking it out in

280
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:37,278
the early days probably like 5 years ago

281
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,920
almost six when when it was just

282
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:40,559
starting down there I think it's finally

283
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:42,919
now starting to click in there that's

284
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:45,599
actually when I met him was about five

285
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:47,919
years ago in Colombia at a restaurant

286
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,920
start talking yeah wow he we have mutual

287
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:52,360
friends and we all went to dinner and it

288
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:55,000
was like okay yeah really good guy yeah

289
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,680
super good guy for sure he's him him and

290
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,120

292
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,120
we're close they're super cool yeah

293
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:04,199
definitely we're hoping to retire and

294
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,519
grow old together somewhere together

295
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,440
yeah colia is not a bad way to go you

296
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:10,278
know I feel like yeah tropical Columbia

297
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,560
is tropical too Columbia is tropical

298
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:13,720
that's where he definitely wants to have

299
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:15,599
a place there yeah I'm not sure all way

300
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,399
committed to like being the third world

301
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,680
all the way but I can definitely spend

302
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:21,600
some time there yeah I'm the same way I

303
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,359
like visiting I think it's a beautiful

304
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,680
country I mean the cost of living down

305
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,720
there is nothing no doubt so cheap no

306
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:29,519
doubt food is so cheap yeah so fresh and

307
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,040
good

308
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:35,159
Uber was $2 the most anywhere when I was

309
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:38,278
in Bogota yeah you go anywhere in the

310
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:41,078
city and the city is 10 San Francisco

311
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:42,278
yeah something crazy like that so huge

312
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:43,479
and I was just blown away because I

313
00:11:42,278 --> 00:11:45,720
would take Uber but then you have to sit

314
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:48,720
in the front seat because Uber is

315
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,720
illegal so thex driver yeah you have to

316
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,240
make it look like you're friends with

317
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,560
the Uber driver so otherwise you might

318
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,200
get left on the side of the road and the

319
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:58,000
guy might get arrested so yeah good

320
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:01,040
experiences we're actually working on

321
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,240
with a group down there um who's got a

322
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:05,199
American partner up here that to get all

323
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,639
of our products registered cuz they're a

324
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,639
certified organic uh facility already

325
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:12,240
and they're struggling getting products

326
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:15,320
so um we're working hand inand with them

327
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,680
in the eeka which is uh Columbia

328
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:20,000
Department of a um to get all the vital

329
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:21,439
products registered down there so that's

330
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,559
awesome hopefully within the next six

331
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,279
months or so they'll be available too

332
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:28,319
wow so that'll be cool open our Horizons

333
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:29,480
a little more yeah it's a really cool

334
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,079
place and I think they're really

335
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:34,680
interested in cannabis agriculture all

336
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:35,879
of it yeah Organics I think there's a

337
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:38,958
lot of people that are pushing the

338
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:41,000
Organics down there for sure it seems

339
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:43,399
like that people are super conscious of

340
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,198
you know what they use and what they put

341
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:47,360
on the planet and they're you know

342
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:50,879
they're they care about their land and

343
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,278
right so yeah I love that yeah totally

344
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:54,000
yeah it's interesting all these uh

345
00:12:52,278 --> 00:12:55,919
different places we expanding all over

346
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
the globe totally I mean look at

347
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:59,759
Portugal right now Portugal's going full

348
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,399
bore for it you know I have a friend who

349
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:05,000
just left yesterday to go work over

350
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:08,120
there um but they they got 40 acres 40

351
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,039
acres uh full term wow which I saw the

352
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,560
videos I was like that's really cool you

353
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:15,679
know you know you hear about stuff and

354
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:17,198
that's THC yeah 40 acres it's quite a

355
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:19,198
few yeah I mean not compared to the

356
00:13:17,198 --> 00:13:21,639
United States really but but still I

357
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:23,639
mean 40 acres I mean I guess it is for

358
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:26,560
one plot 40 acres is pretty big it looks

359
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:28,879
pretty amazing too yeah awesome so yeah

360
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:30,919
love to visit that someday yeah I can I

361
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:32,159
arrange that anytime for sure awesome

362
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:33,319
but yeah and I mean it's all over the

363
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:34,958
globe so it's not just there I mean

364
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,199
we're talking about South Africa we're

365
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:40,879
talking about you know Thailand

366
00:13:37,198 --> 00:13:43,240
Thailand push yeah yeah I just read the

367
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:45,480
is the prime minister he he's not for

368
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,360
cannabis read that same article yeah I

369
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,959
was like wow it seems like it's doing

370
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,360
good for their economy a little late a

371
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:53,439
little late to make that call right

372
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,879
totally yeah it's an interesting time on

373
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,040
the planet for sure between what's

374
00:13:55,879 --> 00:14:00,879
already happening in the economy and

375
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:04,559
just like between technology and all the

376
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:06,600
just craziness and then cannabis being

377
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:08,758
okay in this community but not this one

378
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,920
and this one's good that one's not like

379
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:12,720
even in our own country yeah you know

380
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:15,278
it's just it's a strange thing well

381
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,800
we're in strange times yeah for sure and

382
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:19,720
and for it to be like something that you

383
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:22,359
know the that's going to be legal for

384
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,959
the whole country yeah is I'd like to

385
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:27,480
see it happen sure and and like see

386
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:29,039
California you know cannabis companies

387
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,079
be able to thrive a little bit better

388
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:34,480
and open their doors to like National

389
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:36,799
but I it just seems like such a long far

390
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,440
off thing to me because no one's roles

391
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:41,439
are even close to the same in the same

392
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:43,399
state let alone the same country look at

393
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,959
how crazy testing is all over the place

394
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:48,078
just within one state you know yeah as

395
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:49,399
far as I me we're so off base with a lot

396
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:52,159
of stuff

397
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:54,240
but it seems so far away but it's so

398
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:56,039
close true it is closer than it's ever

399
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,360
been yeah I mean in

400
00:14:56,039 --> 00:15:00,559
1996 it was like I knew it was going to

401
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,759
happen in our lifetimes yeah and now

402
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:04,399
it's looking like it's really going to

403
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:05,759
happen I mean but it's still like as

404
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,480
soon as we think it's going to happen

405
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,959
then we'll have a bunch of setbacks yeah

406
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,639
I'm curious to see what goes on with

407
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:14,399
this potential rescheduling I mean I

408
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,240
feel like it's it's a constant side I'm

409
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,039
not a fan of the whole resched they need

410
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,320
to Desu not

411
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:23,480
reschedule it doesn't make any sense to

412
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:26,040
consider it a schedule 3 drug that's

413
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,839
just in my opinion that's silly I mean

414
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:29,559
it's just going to complicate you see

415
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,800
this is this goes back to what I was

416
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:35,078
saying like how are we as one nation

417
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:37,599
going to even be able to agree upon one

418
00:15:35,078 --> 00:15:39,719
set of rules like yeah that's a terrible

419
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,199
route because all these people who are

420
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,319
already like way invested are basically

421
00:15:42,198 --> 00:15:45,519
going to have to throw away their

422
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:47,039
infrastructure and start over that

423
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,560
doesn't make any sense same thing what

424
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:50,039
are we going to start scheduling tobacco

425
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:51,719
and alcohol too then there schedule

426
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:55,240
three you know what I mean like I don't

427
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,839
know yeah you know it's it's a tough one

428
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,198
yeah but we're in very strange times

429
00:15:56,839 --> 00:15:59,839
because we're in you know it's hard to

430
00:15:58,198 --> 00:16:01,958
say going to happen next year Anything

431
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,959
Could Happen yeah you know it's amazing

432
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:06,679
we're at where we where we are right now

433
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:08,919
it's amazing that we've gotten here so

434
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:11,000
quickly in some ways that's true it's

435
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:12,759
true so it's a beautiful thing

436
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,720
technology is an amazing thing it's an

437
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:18,360
amazing tool it's scary at the same time

438
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,000
definitely so and it's it's Advanced you

439
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,000
know I mean look at cultivation and the

440
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,679
advances in cultivation it's made huge

441
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:29,039
differences in indoor cultivation crazy

442
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:30,958
evenig green houses and outdoor I was

443
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:34,559
actually at a facility in Watsonville

444
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:36,958
and um they were partners with a um a

445
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:39,119
vegetable farm like on the same property

446
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:43,198
yeah and they use they share equipment

447
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:46,440
and they just got this robotic AI

448
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:49,479
tractor that needs no human wow and it

449
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:54,240
could do anything from vacuum bugs off

450
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:57,720
of plants to spray them to harvest them

451
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,399
to to plant them yeah so that's

452
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,199
happening right now like I don't know

453
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:03,000
what to tell you facilities with people

454
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:04,399
that you and I both know yeah it's

455
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,359
pretty crazy yeah I mean they have

456
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,480
infrared now too they can detect uh dude

457
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:12,240
they can detect ethylene in the plants I

458
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,480
guess so they can have infrared sensors

459
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,558
and they'll they'll know if a plant's

460
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:19,160
going to express intersec traits Herm

461
00:17:15,558 --> 00:17:21,279
basically yeah so yeah I mean and this

462
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,319
is just the infancy of all this stuff

463
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:25,240
you know Ai and all you know we're we're

464
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:27,879
just starting to get AI involved with

465
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,919
stuff and you know it's a blessing and a

466
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,880
curse I think

467
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:34,720
yeah it's every day I feel like

468
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:37,320
something new is like showing its face

469
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:40,480
and I just shake my head every day like

470
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:43,359
holy crap we can do this now yeah like

471
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,400
in some ways it's good in other ways I

472
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:47,558
feel like it's speeding things up too

473
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,960
fast and kind of even just how they like

474
00:17:47,558 --> 00:17:52,798
made all these rules is like they made

475
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:55,000
rules without thinking of scaling or

476
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:57,599
without thinking of how it might be when

477
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
we're connected to the state next to us

478
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:04,158
or there's just so much like not wellth

479
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,720
thought outness if that's a word pollen

480
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:08,919
mitigation was never a big deal yeah for

481
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,558
sure yeah I mean you hear of it more and

482
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:13,480
more like especially in like Selenas and

483
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:15,319
oh yeah yeah I was at a facility last

484
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,759
not this week but the last my last trip

485
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:19,639
down there and they were like they know

486
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:22,038
that there's a facility next to them

487
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,960
that's doing some breeding and and they

488
00:18:22,038 --> 00:18:26,200
saw lights on at a certain hour and

489
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,519
they're like starting to like worry and

490
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,400
they're like I know you have males in

491
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:33,279
there and wow it's creating anxiety and

492
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,880
it's like that will create anxiety for

493
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:37,319
sure yeah so yeah I mean it's it's one

494
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,200
thing having one male but if you're

495
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:40,678
making Acres of seeds or something like

496
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,480
that you know it's like you're affecting

497
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:44,080
the people around you but you can make

498
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,240
them in the offseason what people don't

499
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:46,558
understand is seed production can be

500
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,079
done in the offseason there's a right

501
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,960
way to do it there's a wrong way to do

502
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:51,759
it for sure indoor production is a great

503
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,319
way to do it definitely for especially

504
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:55,038
for consistency because if you're making

505
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:56,918
seeds and your neighbors making

506
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:59,000
seeds they're going to get

507
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:02,280
cross-pollinated you're going to

508
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:06,000
have open pollination on large scale

509
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:08,079
acreage is Gary and it's happening it's

510
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,319
happening for sure people are doing it

511
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:13,038
so you guys are delivering soil all over

512
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:15,240
the US yeah more or less soil fertilizer

513
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:17,640
and NES I mean some things make more

514
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,880
sense to ship far than others yeah um

515
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,720
but on the other hand like we're

516
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,600
shipping soil as far as like Michigan

517
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,120
and New York it's it's less than more

518
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:26,599
yeah um we actually are look we need

519
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:28,359
strategic Partners in some of those

520
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:31,038
other states to help us like have

521
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:33,839
product on the ground there that's one

522
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:36,079
of my pushes for this this um winter and

523
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:38,119
spring is to try to just have more

524
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:39,960
availability cuz like so many people

525
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:42,879
seem to like reach out to us and say we

526
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,880
want to try your stuff yeah but to buy a

527
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,919
bag of our soil is super reasonable but

528
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,440
to ship it is like maybe 50 bucks right

529
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:53,320
like it could it could like quadruple

530
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:55,880
the cost of you know a bag of soil sure

531
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:57,519
just by like giving it to the postman

532
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:00,039
right so that's one that's one thing

533
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:02,558
that's always been a struggle with like

534
00:20:00,038 --> 00:20:05,000
moving soil worm castings compost humus

535
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:07,200
these heavy things bootprints yeah

536
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
moving things around is hard liquids are

537
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,840
a little bit easier but still heavy but

538
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
we've we now have some dry soluble

539
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:16,480
powders um and then we have you know

540
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,679
kelp right and we have smaller sizes for

541
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,798
the home gardeners so our web business

542
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:23,240
is definitely picked up nice but we do

543
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:26,639
need to figure out a way to get products

544
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:29,120
to you know further out um less

545
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,960
expensively and you know that's a trick

546
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:35,798
in itself yeah so yeah the home hom

547
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,558
Growers and living soil no tail living

548
00:20:35,798 --> 00:20:41,759
soil organic you know I think there's

549
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:43,359
been a big push more so lately in the

550
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:44,480
last year than I've seen in a long time

551
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:46,199
I think there's pushes in every

552
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,000
direction all the time but like I've

553
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,919
seen a lot of guys you know it's it's a

554
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,079
Hot Topic right now yeah um I'm glad you

555
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:54,919
brought this up because I agree I feel

556
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:57,000
like this year compared to last year

557
00:20:54,919 --> 00:21:00,880
there's a Resurgence for like people who

558
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:04,200
really care yeah and like the last two

559
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,520
years be the not this 2023 but 21 and

560
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,080
two was the years of everybody like

561
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:10,558
scaling back trying to figure out the

562
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:12,839
cheapest way to grow as much as they can

563
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:15,558
and cut their costs and what really

564
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:17,639
suffered is the tpin and what really

565
00:21:15,558 --> 00:21:19,319
suffered suffered is the smokers at the

566
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:22,320
end of the day because there's a lot of

567
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:23,759
really crappy weed and you know I don't

568
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:25,599
want to point any fingers any any

569
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:28,158
specific names but some of most of it

570
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:29,480
crap I mean honestly most of it's I I

571
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,159
don't know about crap but most of it is

572
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,240
not a great product not the type of

573
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:34,880
product that I enjoy consuming yeah you

574
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,200
know as a consumer I want to smoke

575
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,640
something that tastes good that gives me

576
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:41,000
an amazing pie for sure and I think the

577
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:44,520
effect is important but the taste it's a

578
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,319
full experience to me you know like yeah

579
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:49,038
we've been smoking this stuff so long

580
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:51,319
yeah it gets you high of course but the

581
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:53,158
experience the flavor the your mouth

582
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:56,119
getting coated with the Tarpin and the

583
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:57,640
smoke and right like that's that's what

584
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:59,879
we're looking for is something to be

585
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,038
like wow wow you know like we want we

586
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,880
want that experience that that wow Mark

587
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:08,440
you know and like I was saying earlier

588
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:11,480
is like organic and like well-grown weed

589
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:13,200
is like so much different than like a

590
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:16,558
nutrient company that's just trying to

591
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:20,319
tell you to increase your ppms and sure

592
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:23,480
push it push it push it push it yep and

593
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:26,119
what that created was like a whole upset

594
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:28,079
in our entire industry where like yeah

595
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:29,399
like people were trying to they'd rather

596
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:31,759
get it from their friend or their next

597
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,919
door neighbor because they would they

598
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:35,079
would have an experience where they

599
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:37,000
would go buy some weed at at a

600
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:39,119
dispensary and it may even have been a

601
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,839
brand that they trusted before yeah but

602
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:42,959
because that brand had to cut Corners

603
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:44,639
because it cost a lot to produce and the

604
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,558
state and I don't even want to blame

605
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,400
that brand like I don't blame them at

606
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:52,839
all because it's just to survive is is

607
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:54,600
where status quo right now but th those

608
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:56,558
people who went to the dispensary and

609
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:58,639
bought some weed and it was just like

610
00:22:56,558 --> 00:23:00,480
not that great and they're like dang 70

611
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,320
bucks for this it's crazy tastes like

612
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,240
cardboard well so I think there's three

613
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:06,359
types of consumers there's like the

614
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,159
social smoker that really doesn't care

615
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:09,839
one way or the other about it right they

616
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,039
just smoke socially then there's the

617
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:14,000
flavor Chasers yeah and then there's the

618
00:23:12,038 --> 00:23:15,679
dragon Chasers that chase the high yeah

619
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,640
you know I like those are the three

620
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:21,278
types of consumers out there and a lot

621
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,120
of guys that care about getting high

622
00:23:21,278 --> 00:23:25,400
that's really the main focus like if it

623
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:27,439
tastes good that's a bonus but they want

624
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,519
stuff that's super super strong and a

625
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,759
lot of guys smoke extract too most of

626
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:33,240
those guys have gone on to smoke an

627
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:34,839
extract because flow definitely most of

628
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:38,200
it has a ceiling although now we're

629
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:40,399
getting back into those uh like infused

630
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,480
products infused products sativas that

631
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,440
don't have a ceiling we're talking about

632
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,558
some of these you know the P coming back

633
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,798
and the hazes you know it's like they're

634
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:50,558
definitely making it comeback definitely

635
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:51,798
but it's interesting because I think

636
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:54,720
most

637
00:23:51,798 --> 00:23:56,319
people in the other two categories

638
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,558
besides chasing the flavors would

639
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:58,960
appreciate the flavor if they got to

640
00:23:57,558 --> 00:24:01,558
taste a lot of stuff that we get to

641
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,038
experience you know I think most people

642
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:05,319
would appreciate it because it's it's

643
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:07,319
just so distinct and when you smoke

644
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:08,439
something that taste amazing it's like

645
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:09,879
oh that's all I want to smoke you don't

646
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,480
want to turn back no you don't want to

647
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,799
turn back and once you smoke it for a

648
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,038
little while then it's like you smoke

649
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:15,359
everything else and it's just not as

650
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:17,440
good well that's why I think right now

651
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:20,399
is a good time for all the Cannabis

652
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,360
Brands and The Growers to like shine

653
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,880
yeah because we kind of went through

654
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:27,879
this period where like okay dispensaries

655
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,760
were just like this such a novelty where

656
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:32,799
just the fact that you could go in there

657
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:35,038
and actually go buy weed products and

658
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:37,200
and it was just like a mind-blowing uh

659
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:39,398
situation right but now that people are

660
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,798
kind of like used to that part they want

661
00:24:39,398 --> 00:24:43,798
to have an experience that where they

662
00:24:41,798 --> 00:24:46,278
like enjoy what they're buying and

663
00:24:43,798 --> 00:24:48,278
they're actually like happy with their

664
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:50,359
purchase and you know what I mean so at

665
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:53,440
this point they're the the consumer is

666
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:56,558
getting more educated which is a good

667
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,960
thing and it's I think it's the Grower's

668
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:00,558
job to put something in their hand

669
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,840
that's going to change the way that they

670
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:03,720
look at every time they make that

671
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:05,398
purchase right so well and I like what

672
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,919
you said about educated consumer because

673
00:25:05,398 --> 00:25:11,839
I feel like California is a little

674
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:14,080
behind as a whole because legalization

675
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:16,918
happened uh you know earlier in other

676
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:20,119
states Washington Colorado I feel like

677
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:21,880
I've I see it up in Washington that that

678
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:24,119
they're able to not just sell the high

679
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,720
THC stuff they can still sell stuff that

680
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:28,719
not quite as high a

681
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:30,720
THC um and they go on brands that they

682
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,240
trust and I think that's happening more

683
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,720
and more in California I think you're I

684
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,798
think you're right it's starting to

685
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,679
shift back to that where yeah the

686
00:25:35,798 --> 00:25:39,679
dispensary isn't necessarily making the

687
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,440
rule where it has to test 30% or you're

688
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,440
not bringing it in the door totally cuz

689
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,480
I think that mentality has gotten a

690
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,880
little bit evolved where people are you

691
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,919
know when it has to because I feel like

692
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,600
some of the best stuff doesn't test 30%

693
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:56,038
totally you know some of the best flavor

694
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:58,359
profiles that I like yeah OG rarely

695
00:25:56,038 --> 00:26:02,119
tests like in the in the play where some

696
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:04,038
of them just shoot up but yeah yeah yeah

697
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:05,678
I mean I I love good gas and I gas is

698
00:26:04,038 --> 00:26:07,359
making it comeback everybody's talking

699
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,600
about it and it's usually you hear

700
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:10,519
people talking about it a year later

701
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:12,798
it's like a big thing for sure so gas

702
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:17,359
will be back OG's gonna be back maybe it

703
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:20,519
won't be sfv or the Josh dog or the

704
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:22,439
Tahoe or the Diablo or the whatever it

705
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:23,679
is it's going to be these crosses that

706
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,840
are coming out that are really heavy in

707
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:28,679
the gas and then purple with gas where

708
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:30,079
it's like real Strong gas I mean I've

709
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:32,600
seen a bunch of it but it's it's going

710
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:34,480
to get even even better yeah I agree

711
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:36,759
people are going to take that those Josh

712
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,839
D's and yeah combine them with some

713
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:42,038
crazy amazing flavors that original that

714
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:45,079
is the part about where we are in this

715
00:26:42,038 --> 00:26:47,319
industry that is awesome is because like

716
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:50,720
people like yourselves are making like

717
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:52,359
amazing strains and just like opening up

718
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:56,000
you know tarpine profiles that have

719
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:57,798
never been you know exposed because of

720
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,519
combining things that you know that's

721
00:26:57,798 --> 00:27:01,918
part of the fun of it yeah you know what

722
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:03,759
I mean of the pheno hunting process the

723
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,240
selection process is going through and

724
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:09,558
finding stuff you've never seen before

725
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:11,798
uh we had fried chicken up in Washington

726
00:27:09,558 --> 00:27:13,200
my partner Jason up there big shout out

727
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:15,359

00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,399
good people for sure I remember early

00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:28,278
days going up there and meeting them and

734
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:30,079
talking to them and I they even came

735
00:27:28,278 --> 00:27:31,759

good friend too he crushes I forgot he's

738
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:38,798
does he have something to do with those

739
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:41,559
guys or so him and I and Jason work

740
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:43,480
together we've made some crosses I did

741
00:27:41,558 --> 00:27:45,000
some reversals up there with Jason and

742
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,278
we we made some we've made a bunch of

743
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,798
seeds together and Gordon's made a bunch

744
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:52,919
of genetics on his own in Grass Valley

745
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:54,798
that are all Epic yeah so some really

746
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:56,360
awesome stuff definitely definitely so

747
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:59,639
he's just he's another guy I really like

748
00:27:56,359 --> 00:28:01,319
Gordon he's a good guy and friend and so

749
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,320
just a very likable person and someone

750
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:04,918
who loves the plant definitely

751
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:07,918
definitely those are the people I

752
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:10,278
gravitate to now too is like when people

753
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:13,120
love the plant you know it and it's just

754
00:28:10,278 --> 00:28:14,640
obvious typically like you yeah people

755
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:16,479
that can't stop talking about it and

756
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,200
talking about flavor profiles and just

757
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,759
you know I think it's one of those

758
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:23,240
things like I'm I'm here because I love

759
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:24,839
it I love doing you know and yeah there

760
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,960
struggles along with it but I feel like

761
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:28,678
that's part of life's lessons and for

762
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,558
sure I mean if it was easy everyone

763
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:32,080
would do it right totally and you know

764
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:35,480
some of the struggles that we're all

765
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:36,918
faced with feel like they there's enough

766
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,120
other ones that they these ones

767
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:41,519
shouldn't be in that in the way yeah

768
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:44,158
which to me is like the regulation type

769
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:46,278
stuff and the ridiculous you know things

770
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:49,360
that they make us go through but on the

771
00:28:46,278 --> 00:28:51,240
other hand the rest of it is part of the

772
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:53,319
is you know the heart of the struggle

773
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:55,159
this sweeter the victory yeah and I

774
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:57,359
think you don't want an easy life I

775
00:28:55,159 --> 00:28:58,960
think it's it's a you know it's it's

776
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:00,759
it's counterintuitive almost you want

777
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,720
you you don't want your kids to struggle

778
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:03,960
or you don't want to you know your your

779
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,558
family you don't want your family to

780
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:08,440
struggle but I think struggle defines

781
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:10,319
helps Define who you are and what you're

782
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,960
capable of overcoming well if you never

783
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:14,038
have a struggle then it's hard to learn

784
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,600
anything cuz like well there's no

785
00:29:14,038 --> 00:29:17,679
contrast so like when you're really

786
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:19,519
successful you don't know the difference

787
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,440
I I think it's the the sour and the

788
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:23,720
sweet you kind of need both you need to

789
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,798
fail I think you fail and you learn a

790
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:29,360
lot if you fail well these last three to

791
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:31,398
five years just in selling like soil and

792
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:33,558
fertilizer and just dealing with Growers

793
00:29:31,398 --> 00:29:38,759
and you know we've had to completely

794
00:29:33,558 --> 00:29:40,639
evolve how like we communicate and like

795
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:42,720
help farmers so like one of the things

796
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,960
when when I first started all my

797
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,399
products the first thing I did you know

798
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,038
when I would test them before I would

799
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:50,439
even like bring them to Market it was to

800
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:52,879
see how much you could actually use

801
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:54,320
without burning the plant right cuz you

802
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,240
basically want to like come up with your

803
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:57,439
application rate and everyone was

804
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,880
worried you don't want to go over over

805
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,558
the line you don't want to tell people

806
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,278
to use too much and burn their plant

807
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:06,720
right right but now it's more like well

808
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:09,720
how little can we use and and recommend

809
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:12,159
it to somebody feel good about their

810
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:13,200
what their outcome's going to be yeah to

811
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,519
the point where we know they're going to

812
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,399
keep coming back so we've had to like

813
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:19,720
completely like figure out a way for

814
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:23,079
them to be able to use our products on a

815
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:25,159
less expensive you know basis yeah so

816
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:27,798
you know you got to know how to Pivot

817
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:32,480
you got to and we also have to work hard

818
00:30:27,798 --> 00:30:34,519
and longer and go further yeah to get

819
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,798
the sale so you got to first you got to

820
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:38,278
like make sure that the grower

821
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:40,879
understands how to use it then you may

822
00:30:38,278 --> 00:30:43,000
have to present something to the finance

823
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,240
department just to make sure that

824
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
they're going to approve the sale right

825
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,960
and at the end of the day there's like

826
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,398
all these different layers and and it's

827
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,319
just like turned into like all the

828
00:30:51,398 --> 00:30:54,038
where're I feel like we're always

829
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:56,000
quoting against somebody else but at the

830
00:30:54,038 --> 00:30:57,720
end of the day they need to look at what

831
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,558
we could do for you as a whole instead

832
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:02,240
of just like what the cost for this

833
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:05,119
bottle of whatever it is right well it's

834
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,720
so competitive in soil in genetics I

835
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:08,558
mean like if you look there's so many

836
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,480
seed companies out there what makes you

837
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:12,278
stand out compared to any other seed

838
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,880
company or me you know what I mean like

839
00:31:12,278 --> 00:31:17,759
what am I doing different you know and

840
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:19,159
so we really think hard all the time

841
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:20,679
about like how can we improve our

842
00:31:19,159 --> 00:31:22,480
product how can we make better genetics

843
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:24,038
using tissue culture parents making sure

844
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,159
our genetics are clean before we even

845
00:31:24,038 --> 00:31:27,679
start making seeds that's you know

846
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,960
that's a part of our goal

847
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,399
you know is like to be able to give

848
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,319
people the best product possible and not

849
00:31:31,398 --> 00:31:35,278
just so we can get the sale so you know

850
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:38,158
we feel good about what we're doing as

851
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:40,278
well well I'm in in for the Long Haul

852
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,760
it's not like this is the first year I'm

853
00:31:40,278 --> 00:31:43,119
just trying to get people introduced I'm

854
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:45,278

855

around on the nipple if you're still in

856
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:48,240
the industry I think at this point

857
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,519
you're in it for the long haul it's not

858
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,798
easy money you know it's it's hard work

859
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:54,440
and it's it's enjoyable work if you love

860
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:56,519

00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:49,080
through at Pacific reserve and checked

884
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:50,879
out their plants that's a huge facility

885
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:52,798
um now they're growing all the massive

886
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,559
genetics because he's now part of that

887
00:32:52,798 --> 00:32:59,119
whole um conglomerate now wow so we did

888

a nice feno hunt there and uh amazing

889
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:04,158
stuff's GNA come out from that

890
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:05,839
definitely eye out big yeah for sure not

891
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,039
messing around yeah I was one of the

892
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:10,240
original Founders there and I'm a

893
00:33:08,038 --> 00:33:12,319
shareholder now it's definitely a bigger

894
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,480
company now and they're also one of

895
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:16,599
vitals you know best customers and

896
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,798
they've stayed really true to keeping it

897
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:21,918
organic and doing a really good job with

898
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:24,000
their their product that's awesome um

899
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:26,720
and then so then after bouncing from

900
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,119
selenis we did this event in Ventura

901
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:32,639
which wasn't really cannabis based but

902
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:34,719
it's the um National heirloom seed Expo

903
00:33:32,638 --> 00:33:37,599
really cool which was like vegetable

904
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:40,038
seed you know fruits but it you know

905
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:42,278
that whole seed mentality is the type of

906
00:33:40,038 --> 00:33:43,720
people that we are like all those people

907
00:33:42,278 --> 00:33:45,599
that are looking out for the best of the

908
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:47,319
best and they really care about what

909
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:50,278
they're growing and like so we got to

910
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:52,519
talk to passionate Farmers passionate

911
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:55,880
gardeners and Growers people making

912
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:57,319
seeds people buying seeds and at the end

913
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,559
of the day I feel like there is is a

914
00:33:57,319 --> 00:34:01,759
really big movement towards people you

915
00:33:59,558 --> 00:34:04,200
know getting back to the land growing a

916
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:06,839
little bit more of their own food and

917
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,800
like sure technolog is coming into play

918
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:10,960
too but I think people still have that

919
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,720
like craving to like be have a

920
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,159
connection to the Earth and grow

921
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:17,279
something yeah you know house plants are

922
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:19,559
great but at the end of the day growing

923
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,639
food is very rewarding I mean I think

924
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:25,440
for sure that's that's my therapy yeah

925
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:27,440
like if I don't have a garden I feel

926
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,679
like I'd be like wouldn't know what to

927
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,960
do I'd be like what should I be doing

928
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:32,960
right now yeah and like let's say you

929
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,519
don't want to grow tomatoes or or you

930
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,358
don't want to grow vegetables you know

931
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:38,039
it's too much you can still grow herbs

932
00:34:36,358 --> 00:34:39,440
you can still grow herbs there's so many

933
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:41,559
little things that you can do that you

934
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,918
can eat you know in the winter it's not

935
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:44,480
too late right now you know what I mean

936
00:34:42,918 --> 00:34:45,918
it's never too late there there's always

937
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,918
stuff that can be grown that you can

938
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:51,598
consume for sure you can have a little

939
00:34:48,918 --> 00:34:53,960
plant of chives in your window to you

940
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,800
know a tomato plant under a grow light

941
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,280
if you wanted so I mean everything now

942
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,920
they make these LEDs that go and you

943
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,480
know you could put them in your window

944
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,079
or whatever you know I've seen people

945
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,119
have these little grow tents with a

946
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,480
veggie garden in it yeah instead of

947
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:07,800
their cannabis garden they have like

948
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:10,159
food and I think that's great yeah me I

949
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,880
think that's fun for sure it's good for

950
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:13,480
families too like if you live in a city

951
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,960
and you want your kids to be exposed to

952
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:18,039
that I was thinking if you lived in like

953
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:20,440
a big city right now there's such a huge

954
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:21,480
disconnection with like natural world

955
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,039
you know I guess that's better than

956
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,039
making your kids

957
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:30,039
trim but yeah I think I think a good

958
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:32,200
family experience for everybody you know

959
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:34,039
it's a great way to teach your kids

960
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:35,679
about produce and about vegetables and

961
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:37,679
also to be able to taste the difference

962
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:39,279
between stuff that you grow and stuff

963
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:42,319
you buy in the store because I think

964
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:44,040
most people have never experienced like

965
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,519
okay well yeah I wouldn't say most

966
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:46,719
people but there's a small percentage of

967
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:48,199
us that have grown a lot of stuff and

968
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:49,838
then a lot of people they've only eaten

969
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:52,358
store-bought vegetables yeah the

970
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:55,559
difference between a store-bought tomato

971
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:57,239
and a homegrown tomato even the heirloom

972
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:59,239
in the stores for sure those aren't

973
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:00,639
nearly as good as if you got heirlooms

974
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:01,799
yourself unless you go to Berkeley Bowl

975
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:03,358
you might find some good stuff during

976
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,920
the season sure there's some great farms

977
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:06,960
that put out some good produce but you

978
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:09,519
got to like nail it in that perfect

979
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,079
window it's been trucked it could be

980
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:13,519
have been on a shelf who knows how many

981
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:15,079
people put their grimy hands on it

982
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:16,960
totally you know there's nothing like

983
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:19,160
that experience of going picking

984
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,400
something ripe and carrying it into your

985
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:23,039
kitchen cutting it up and eating it or

986
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,680
putting it on a sandwich or well there's

987
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:26,279
so many places you can buy exotic seeds

988
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:28,598
so like you don't have to just grow a

989
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,280
plain cucumber you can and a lot of

990
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:32,160
places sell different cucumbers and

991
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:35,160
stuff like that but but we talk about

992
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:36,759
pumpkins cucumbers anything there's

993
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:39,239
there's multiple varieties that you

994
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:41,560
could buy seeds of at the very least

995
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:43,358
seeds I mean Peppers there's so many

996
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:45,440
tomatoes there's so many different

997
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:47,078
varieties even cucumbers now I grew a

998
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,599
bunch this year I I love those little

999
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:51,079
lemon cucumbers and those Armenian

1000
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:53,119
Armenian ones are my favorite those

1001
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:55,079
things would never get bitter so good

1002
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:57,358
they could be like 3 feet long and still

1003
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:59,640
bitter and still sweet

1004
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:01,279
still sweet yeah yeah yeah they love the

1005
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:02,559
sun those things Crush they're good

1006
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,200
those are good up in Grass Valley for

1007
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:07,159
sure nice yeah yeah I love all that

1008
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:08,318
stuff same thing with different lettuces

1009
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:10,078
I think different lettuces during the

1010
00:37:08,318 --> 00:37:12,039
winter there's so many different things

1011
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:13,519
and it's like that you couldn't even get

1012
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:15,519
in the store if you wanted to well

1013
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:17,358
lettuce is my favorite thing of anything

1014
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:20,039
to grow in the world yeah that's my

1015
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:22,119
favorite because it's a short crop yeah

1016
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:24,279
it's it doesn't even need fertilized

1017
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:27,160
ever right you know you just as long as

1018
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:28,880
you have some like rich soil it's it

1019
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:29,960
grows such a short period of time that

1020
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,960
it doesn't need

1021
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:34,679
fertilization and it's that is something

1022
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,920
of of all the things that you could grow

1023
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:37,879
yourself and notice the difference

1024
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:41,000
between store-bought yeah like fresh

1025
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:44,480
lettuce when you cut it wash it eat it

1026
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:46,679
compared to it like sitting at least if

1027
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:50,199
if you see in a store it's at least five

1028
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:51,679
days from being cut right so at least at

1029
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:53,118
least that's like probably a lot more

1030
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:54,559
than that that's if you live in like

1031
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,440
Santa Cruz or something where it's

1032
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:58,880
getting you know coming from Watsonville

1033
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:01,519
yeah but like most people throughout the

1034
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:04,358
country at least a week or two yeah if

1035
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:06,599
it's in a if it's in a sealed bag a week

1036
00:38:04,358 --> 00:38:08,480
or two for sure right so like growing

1037
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:09,880
your own lettuce harvesting that and

1038
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,318
eating it is like one of the most

1039
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:14,318
rewarding things I haven't done micro

1040
00:38:12,318 --> 00:38:16,800
Greens in a I mean I experimented a long

1041
00:38:14,318 --> 00:38:18,199
time ago but my buddy is crushing garden

1042
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,519
house farms they're doing micro greens

1043
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:22,879
now nice my buddy makes the best microG

1044
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:25,199
greens and they're super I mean and same

1045
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,880
thing with arugula too like arugula you

1046
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:29,838
get you get it from the store it just

1047
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:32,318
tastes green yeah it tastes plain but

1048
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:34,719
then you get some really good TPS yeah

1049
00:38:32,318 --> 00:38:37,679
it's got turps It's got pepper you get

1050
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:40,679
strong pepper flavor I love arugula yeah

1051
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:42,719
me too it makes me feel good yeah I need

1052
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:44,399
to eat more of it arugula is actually

1053
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:46,279
another Super it's even shorter than

1054
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,880
lettuce you know like 30 days you're

1055
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:52,000
like got baby arugula it's the best when

1056
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,800
it's small too micro greens 10 days yeah

1057
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,920
you know I love M 10 days you can yeah

1058
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:58,000
and you can set that up under

1059
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:59,559
fluoresence like super easy to do get

1060
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,960
those little prop trays and you get a

1061
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:04,719
little baker Rack in your kitchen so

1062
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:07,000
easy super easy yeah and you don't need

1063
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:09,759
much too I think they're super I mean

1064
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,400
like as far as nutrient DSE yeah dude

1065
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:15,160
like they're super amazing I mean if you

1066
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:17,318
buy not to just pitch my soil but if you

1067
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:19,039
grew microG Greens in my soil yeah you

1068
00:39:17,318 --> 00:39:20,318
definitely don't need to fertilize it

1069
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:22,119
it's not like my soil is tons of

1070
00:39:20,318 --> 00:39:24,719
fertilizer but it's Rich because it has

1071
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:28,000
worm castings compost humus yeah it's

1072
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:29,598
like got minerals so it's be you know

1073
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,800
nurture your plant but it's also going

1074
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:34,440
to put out some like tasty mineral rich

1075
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:36,280
food yeah yeah what's funny if you grew

1076
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,240
micro Greens in all the different soils

1077
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:40,599
they would with the same seed they would

1078
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:41,719
all taste slightly different definitely

1079
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:43,760
in fact that's a great experiment

1080
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:46,318
someone should do let's do it let's do

1081
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,880
it you you guys travel all over the US

1082
00:39:46,318 --> 00:39:49,880
for events what about are you doing

1083
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,358
International stuff soon as far A little

1084
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:53,519
bit like this Columbia thing starting to

1085
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:55,358
pop into place that it's a little tricky

1086
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:57,318
getting product out of the country

1087
00:39:55,358 --> 00:39:59,799
because of you know Department of a

1088
00:39:57,318 --> 00:40:02,838
regulations and especially the nature

1089
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:04,480
like I'm sure salt based fertilizers are

1090
00:40:02,838 --> 00:40:05,599
probably easy to ship because there

1091
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,519
they're not so worried about

1092
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:11,519
microorganisms yeah but with with

1093
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:14,079
organic stuff and just there super

1094
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:16,318
paranoia of like microorganisms that are

1095
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:19,280
going to like go into some country and

1096
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:22,079
like you know wreak havoc on some crop

1097
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:25,160
or people or whatever so you know there

1098
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:28,200
there's like it's kind of like that

1099
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:30,159
paranoia of of just germs in general

1100
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:31,960
uhhuh like there's bacteria everywhere

1101
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:33,639
if you're scared of bacteria then you

1102
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:36,280
shouldn't walk outside your door CU it's

1103
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:37,358
floating all around everywhere yeah but

1104
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:40,480
at the end of the day when you tell

1105
00:40:37,358 --> 00:40:43,078
someone that you have bacteria or fungi

1106
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,519
in a b in a bag or a bottle yeah then

1107
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:47,960
they're just like totally yeah well you

1108
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:50,358
know aspir jillis really screwed up the

1109
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:52,480
Colorado market for Organics and it

1110
00:40:50,358 --> 00:40:54,400
almost screwed up the organ market for

1111
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:57,240
sure but then the Growers fought back

1112
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,720
and we like aspergilus is on everything

1113
00:40:57,239 --> 00:41:00,279
yeah literally it's on pretty much

1114
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:02,639
everything it's probably on us right now

1115
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:04,200
exactly you know and it's it's just but

1116
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:06,000
you get these companies coming in saying

1117
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:08,639
dude we don't want aspil you guys need

1118
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,079
to make it illegal to have aspergilus we

1119
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:11,559
need to test for it and if it tests

1120
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,240
positive you guys shouldn't be you know

1121
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:15,880
consuming it's [ __ ] yeah th those

1122
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:18,799
same people who tell you to push that

1123
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:21,160
four point whatever ppms are the same

1124
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,560
people right trying to like get rid of

1125
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:24,399
you know Organics because they're

1126
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:25,719
worried about aspir jillis but in

1127
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,800
reality they just want to pound more

1128
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:30,239
salt and

1129
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:32,400
pollute the planet totally it's wild

1130
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:36,358
yeah it's the Wild Wild West still it

1131
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:38,639
sure is so as far as genetics you know

1132
00:41:36,358 --> 00:41:40,759
uh we saw some o or i saw some OG Kush

1133
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:43,400
that was pretty amazing yes sir what

1134
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:47,119
else my favorite yeah that Skittles is

1135
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:49,639
pretty baller that was a cut from that

1136
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:52,318
actually Brandon and Shiloh yeah that

1137
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:54,799
was third gen um when those guys were

1138
00:41:52,318 --> 00:41:56,838
still working together yeah been able to

1139
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,599
maintain the mom of it for for that long

1140
00:41:56,838 --> 00:42:00,078
of a period of time and take good care

1141
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:03,280
of it make sure it didn't get into the

1142
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:05,800
wrong hands and get pop Laden virus or

1143
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,880
something else weird because uh that's

1144
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:10,039
one thing that I feel like has H

1145
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:11,920
happened that has hurt the industry as

1146
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:13,639
far as like keeping good genetics around

1147
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,358
and I wonder if that's one of the

1148
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:19,239
reasons why like the real Sour is kind

1149
00:42:16,358 --> 00:42:21,400
of like this like unicorn that is just

1150
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:23,838
like super hard to find and you know

1151
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:25,559
what I mean cuz Sour's a tricky one

1152
00:42:23,838 --> 00:42:27,920
though like I keep seeing people say

1153
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:30,640
this is the one and it's a close but

1154
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:33,318
it's just I still have not all the way

1155
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:34,879
seen it you know I feel you you know I

1156
00:42:33,318 --> 00:42:36,440
feel you I mean I had the weasel's

1157
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,800
diesel that I got from my friend and

1158
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:40,159
that was pretty amazing but it was still

1159
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,400
a little bit different but it smoked

1160
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:45,039
amazing yeah I made some crosses with it

1161
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:47,240
nice we got some zour diesel yeah

1162
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:48,838
Skittles sounds really good yeah that's

1163
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:50,078
a good one I love those two for sure I

1164
00:42:48,838 --> 00:42:52,480
think that would be a good that would be

1165
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:54,839
a winner yeah for sure but yeah Sour

1166
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,599
Diesel I I think there's

1167
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:59,558
been you know a lot of a lot of [ __ ]

1168
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,880
copies but hoplon did a number on sour

1169
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:02,839
diesel

1170
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,079
especially we're talking about a really

1171
00:43:02,838 --> 00:43:07,199
old plant so you know from the 90s it's

1172
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:10,318
like 30 years old now yeah you know

1173
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:11,759
something like that yeah so the genetics

1174
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:13,800
aren't the same but I mean they's still

1175
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,720
good chem dog around still good old

1176
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:19,160
school Kim D around for sure there is

1177
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:21,959
some good sour I just don't have any ony

1178
00:43:19,159 --> 00:43:24,399
right now yeah it'' be better if I did

1179
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:26,480
but I'd like to see it for sure but yeah

1180
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,960
i' I've grown a couple that were close

1181
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:33,039
and I'm just

1182
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:34,760
like almost but yeah not quite there OG

1183
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:37,440
that one's just been able to be Banger

1184
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:39,760
for super long time so you've had that

1185
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:42,760
for long long time that's awesome OG is

1186
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:45,240
amazing but you know it's also like not

1187
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:47,160
commercial it's not like to grow that on

1188
00:43:45,239 --> 00:43:49,399
a large scale would be hard because it

1189
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:51,199
takes a long time to root it you know it

1190
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,559
grows funky so you probably don't want

1191
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:55,558
to be growing that in the same room as

1192
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:57,000
other stuff and you know like there's

1193
00:43:55,559 --> 00:44:00,160
Dynamics and that's why some of these

1194
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:02,679
strains have gone out of like popularity

1195
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:05,440
is because of it's easy to grow a bunch

1196
00:44:02,679 --> 00:44:07,639
of gelados that are like super uniform

1197
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:10,240
and they yield well they're not it's not

1198
00:44:07,639 --> 00:44:11,960
a pain in the butt it's consistent yeah

1199
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:13,919
it's good it's good production weed for

1200
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:15,440
sure yeah yeah and there's some fenos

1201
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,200
that are really good there some

1202
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:20,318
expression that I really like I love

1203
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:23,159
gelato 41 still you know the bachio cut

1204
00:44:20,318 --> 00:44:25,480
you know yeah yeah I like the 33 yeah 33

1205
00:44:23,159 --> 00:44:26,679
is good too 33 is great 30 33 is

1206
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,838
actually a really

1207
00:44:26,679 --> 00:44:30,919
about a gazillion other things too but

1208
00:44:28,838 --> 00:44:32,799
yeah and same thing with the 41 there's

1209
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:35,039
a bunch of names but 41's still really

1210
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:37,240
good and even the 45 had its place I

1211
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:41,119
think that was cool yeah yeah it's

1212
00:44:37,239 --> 00:44:44,078
trippy how many good Cult of ours came

1213
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:46,800
out of one cross yeah you know when you

1214
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:48,400
start thinking about it you know if if

1215
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,720
you like gelato yeah you know if you

1216
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:53,079
like gelato there's there's 10 bangers

1217
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:56,439
that came out of that least man I mean

1218
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:58,800
it's in a lot you know it's in a lot not

1219
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:01,358
all of them breed really well yeah and

1220
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:04,559
they don't wash so it's a little bit you

1221
00:45:01,358 --> 00:45:06,558
know yeah everybody hash people popular

1222
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:08,400
now for as far as breeders are concerned

1223
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:10,240
the whole washing thing like yeah does

1224
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:13,358
it wash does it not wash like need

1225
00:45:10,239 --> 00:45:15,838
5centers only only only five or six

1226
00:45:13,358 --> 00:45:17,799
percenters it's like and there's a

1227
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:20,400
handful of stuff that have a six

1228
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,640
percenter yeah CU they're out there for

1229
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,358
sure you know and I've I've actually

1230
00:45:21,639 --> 00:45:26,838
grown GM bonda GMO and banana cond both

1231
00:45:24,358 --> 00:45:29,799
wash over six but you know GMO I was

1232
00:45:26,838 --> 00:45:31,358
stoked at the time but everything's GMO

1233
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,960
though now but even the guys that have

1234
00:45:31,358 --> 00:45:34,960
like five different strains they're all

1235
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:38,199
like GMO based because they wanted to

1236
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:39,838
get that 6% right but in reality like

1237
00:45:38,199 --> 00:45:42,078
what tastes the best in rosin is

1238
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:44,078
something like Skittles which is like 2%

1239
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:45,960
Skittles maybe three if you're lucky it

1240
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:47,960
might be the best xjack I mean I love

1241
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:51,480
Skittles I love Rainbow belts is

1242
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:53,760
incredible um so is some good sour uh

1243
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:56,039
actually you know the best sour rosin

1244
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:58,359
that I've tasted comes from that J PL

1245
00:45:56,039 --> 00:46:00,519
Speaker Guy oh wow yeah it tastes I get

1246
00:45:58,358 --> 00:46:02,799
like an ounce every year yeah I like

1247
00:46:00,519 --> 00:46:05,119
trickle it out to myself yeah and it

1248
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,318
tastes great nice haven't seen the

1249
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:09,720
finished flower yeah but the rosin my

1250
00:46:07,318 --> 00:46:13,318
friend actually gets it and it's awes

1251
00:46:09,719 --> 00:46:15,759
it's amazing yeah nice tart there's this

1252
00:46:13,318 --> 00:46:18,079
H sour cherry that's like super tart

1253
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:21,400
from soal dank they make this rosin and

1254
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:22,680
that stuff is just tasty it's one of

1255
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,800
those ones that you want to keep smoking

1256
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:25,639
even after you're really high you're

1257
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:27,160
like I could still take one more you

1258
00:46:25,639 --> 00:46:29,679
know that's kind of how rainbow Bel is

1259
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:31,960
to me cuz it's that gas and that Z TP

1260
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:34,799
mhm and it's strong and it's just like

1261
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:37,960
man makes your mouth like well and it's

1262
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:40,599
it's like Skittle but not Skitty yeah

1263
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:42,920
yeah some of those crosses uh what's the

1264
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:44,160
rainbow belt it's the parent the moonbow

1265
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:46,000
and the moonbow is like one of my

1266
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:49,679
favorites yeah that old school like the

1267
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:52,318
75 or whatever was before the 75 some

1268
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:54,440
moonbo rosin with me it's so good yeah

1269
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:56,960
so yeah I know Adam from archive and he

1270

he crushes they their Ros is really good

1271
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:02,079
some of their I I kind of feel like

1272
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:03,440
they've done the best job yeah you know

1273
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:05,480
you know as far as like getting the

1274
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,720
hashers that are really like bangers and

1275
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,079
all round you know what I mean their

1276
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:10,279
flower is amazing if you go get their

1277
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:12,119
flower in Oregon it's super top- notot I

1278
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:14,079
believe it so yeah especially that

1279
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:18,440
moonbo I'm a huge fan of the I think the

1280
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:22,559
112 is is the one it's really

1281
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:25,000
good yeah you I'm a huge fan I'm this

1282
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:27,119
guy actually is a Nevada County grower

1283

00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:37,040
I don't like is Diet Skittles but what I

1287
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:39,558
do like is Skittles crosses that are

1288
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:41,279
complex I don't like a water down if

1289
00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:42,559
it's gonna you got to make it complex

1290
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,040
and different you don't want it just a

1291
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:45,680
lighter version of Skittles there's no

1292
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:48,318
point really you know what who does a

1293

1296
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:59,559
good strain it's like Vermont diesel

1297
00:47:56,119 --> 00:48:02,760
yeah to Skittles and it makes some

1298
00:47:59,559 --> 00:48:05,880
really good rousing really good yeah I

1299
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:07,559
saw some Afghan Skittles you it sounds

1300
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:10,000
good like I was like okay cool it's

1301
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:13,319
probably got like some hashy hashy

1302
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:16,599
funkiness to it like yeah it was just

1303
00:48:13,318 --> 00:48:18,880
like a skittles light very very like

1304
00:48:16,599 --> 00:48:20,440
you're like oh I I get a little bit but

1305
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:22,800
it wasn't like Skittles is supposed to

1306
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:25,679
be overpowering him you know where like

1307
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:29,039
it's so bright yeah I mean Skittles

1308
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:31,039
needs to be loud yeah and last year I

1309
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:33,880
actually grew a whole garden of it with

1310
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:36,838
a partner in Nevada County yeah so I

1311
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:39,119
thought and I was like it was growing

1312
00:48:36,838 --> 00:48:41,400
too good in my mind I was like the whole

1313
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:43,480
time I was doubting it yeah so the

1314
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:45,480
nurser basically gave us a skittles

1315
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:48,119
cross and we don't even know what

1316
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:49,519
exactly it was sure but it took until

1317
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:53,358
about week two or three and I was just

1318
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:55,039
like no that is not zps and sucks I grew

1319
00:48:53,358 --> 00:48:57,440
an entire Garden thinking that was going

1320
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:59,199
to all be for rosin and it ended up

1321
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,039
being this other strain that came out

1322
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:04,039
okay and it was a good producer for the

1323
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:05,719
guy and stuff but still what my whole

1324
00:49:04,039 --> 00:49:07,719
intention and the reason I even like was

1325
00:49:05,719 --> 00:49:11,399
involved on that exact Garden was to

1326
00:49:07,719 --> 00:49:12,598
like get a whole F of Z yeah know like

1327
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,798
those are the things you know there's

1328
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:16,838
certain projects that get me excited

1329
00:49:14,798 --> 00:49:20,719
that was one that did I want jars of Z

1330
00:49:16,838 --> 00:49:23,558
exact I want like years years Supply

1331
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:26,399
yeah so like multiple years so it didn't

1332
00:49:23,559 --> 00:49:27,680
work out last year yeah

1333
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,200
the good thing about time is there's

1334
00:49:27,679 --> 00:49:32,480
always next year for sure for sure well

1335
00:49:30,199 --> 00:49:34,639
what are we going to smoke oh you know

1336
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,559
what SM some of this Nemo Skittles

1337
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:39,000
sounds good so where do you see the

1338
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:42,000
market going I mean I think you said

1339
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:44,358
your uh internet has been doing pretty

1340
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,519
good as far as web stuff with home

1341
00:49:44,358 --> 00:49:48,358
Growers yeah you think that's gonna get

1342
00:49:46,519 --> 00:49:50,880
bigger and bigger yeah to be honest

1343
00:49:48,358 --> 00:49:54,960
that's another part of my uh winter and

1344
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:57,160
spring focus is like desize downsizing

1345
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:59,119
not getting rid of the big sizes of my

1346
00:49:57,159 --> 00:50:01,798
products that I have now yeah but we're

1347
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:05,200
going to offer like a four qu bag of

1348
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:07,639
soil a four qu bag of compost instead of

1349
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:10,078
like one and a half cubic feet that cost

1350
00:50:07,639 --> 00:50:12,039
50 bucks to ship across the country and

1351
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:13,920
not everybody needs that much anyway so

1352
00:50:12,039 --> 00:50:16,599
we're used to the NorCal grower like who

1353
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:19,079
needs like truckloads worth of stuff but

1354
00:50:16,599 --> 00:50:21,359
in reality this whole new wreck market

1355
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:23,920
and like legalization has opened up a

1356
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:25,639
lot of people to just growing their six

1357
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:28,358
plants or depending on what state they

1358
00:50:25,639 --> 00:50:32,159
live in you know 6 to 10 or whatever the

1359
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:34,358
number is in every state and not even

1360
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:37,039
just for cannabis but we're seeing home

1361
00:50:34,358 --> 00:50:38,798
vegetable gardeners like spend a little

1362
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:41,039
bit of money on their crop because they

1363
00:50:38,798 --> 00:50:43,039
care about you know what what their you

1364
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:45,318
know outcome is going to be well and the

1365
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:47,039
Bea beautiful thing about soil and like

1366
00:50:45,318 --> 00:50:48,480
your soil especially is it's not like

1367
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:50,880
you throw it out at the end of the

1368
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:53,079
season it keeps going and gets better

1369
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,160
and better and better every year yeah

1370
00:50:53,079 --> 00:50:56,599
that's something I should say about

1371
00:50:54,159 --> 00:50:58,679
Pacific Reserve too is like like we've

1372
00:50:56,599 --> 00:51:01,519
really been able to like dial it in

1373
00:50:58,679 --> 00:51:03,519
there to be able to you know use this

1374
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:07,199
product line at scale but also to be

1375
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:10,639
able to reuse soil and and and compare

1376
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:13,558
the numbers and look at the um yield

1377
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:16,039
compared to the fresh new soil and like

1378
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:19,000
look side by side plants with new fresh

1379
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:21,119
soil and Reus soil and we have a product

1380
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,318
that's called vital soil Builder that's

1381
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:27,920
biochar where I'm casting compost humus

1382
00:51:24,318 --> 00:51:29,880
nice and bat and seab beru so we

1383
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,838
basically at Pacific Reserve they've

1384
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:33,720
been

1385
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:35,719
doing uh two rounds in the same soil

1386
00:51:33,719 --> 00:51:38,798
amending with like a cup of the soil

1387
00:51:35,719 --> 00:51:40,719
Builder and a little bit of guano yeah

1388
00:51:38,798 --> 00:51:42,719
and stirring it up in the Ed soil and

1389
00:51:40,719 --> 00:51:45,879
replanting and the plants are actually

1390
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:49,159
even growing faster um thank you they're

1391
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:50,480
growing even faster in the ReUse soil

1392
00:51:49,159 --> 00:51:52,838
because there's still like leftover

1393
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,960
nutrients plus they added this like

1394
00:51:52,838 --> 00:51:57,519
fresh worm castings compost and humus

1395
00:51:54,960 --> 00:52:01,358
there's some biochar in there yeah so

1396
00:51:57,519 --> 00:52:04,239
it's like living soil mhm you know round

1397
00:52:01,358 --> 00:52:06,400
two you know it's not I'm not going to

1398
00:52:04,239 --> 00:52:08,479
go to the extreme of calling it no till

1399
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,639
which no till to me is a little bit of a

1400
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:13,519
just catchphrase anyway most of it's low

1401
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:15,639
till anyway yeah I mean who's busting

1402
00:52:13,519 --> 00:52:17,599
out a tiller but in reality you got to

1403
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:19,519
pull out the root ball and and if you're

1404
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:21,000
growing Outdoors like let's face it we

1405
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:23,039
got to like turn the soil we got to pull

1406
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,760
the weeds out we want to make the soil

1407
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:27,279
fluffy again so that the roots can

1408
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:30,000
penetrate yeah I'm all for reusing soil

1409
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:31,519
don't get me wrong like way all for it

1410
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,679
but the no till thing is a little bit of

1411
00:52:31,519 --> 00:52:35,838
a marketing thing that's like maybe it

1412
00:52:33,679 --> 00:52:38,558
helps sell weed or something but you

1413
00:52:35,838 --> 00:52:40,960
know let's face it like you know

1414
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:44,040
compressed soil isn't necessarily your

1415
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:47,280
your best friend yeah so giving a little

1416
00:52:44,039 --> 00:52:48,960
bit of fluff isn't isn't like isn't a

1417
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:51,200
sin it's not like dumping a bunch of

1418
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:53,920
salt on it yeah it's not going to take

1419
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:55,519
away from the value of the soil not at

1420
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:58,039
all and you know I don't want to offend

1421
00:52:55,519 --> 00:52:59,880
anybody but to me the noil thing is

1422
00:52:58,039 --> 00:53:01,440
something that came on like way late in

1423
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:04,640
the game when we were already into

1424
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:06,480
reusing an amending soil right and cover

1425
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:08,798
crop and companion crop and all that I'm

1426
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,880
all for it yeah but the term no till is

1427
00:53:08,798 --> 00:53:12,318
a little bit to me like not really

1428
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:15,200
describing what it is you're you're

1429
00:53:12,318 --> 00:53:17,079
doing living soil I'm all for that term

1430
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:18,399
yeah I love that term because that

1431
00:53:17,079 --> 00:53:21,160
that's what we're all about that's what

1432
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:23,160
it is microorganisms in the soil helping

1433
00:53:21,159 --> 00:53:27,159
your plant do a better job or helping

1434
00:53:23,159 --> 00:53:27,159
your soil do a better job for your

1435
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:33,519
nice what do you think of the smoke

1436
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:35,318
tastes good everybody likes the Z

1437
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:37,039
seriously so have you seen any other

1438
00:53:35,318 --> 00:53:40,719

1439
00:53:37,039 --> 00:53:42,039
like exciting stuff everything's purple

1440
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:45,279
yeah actually there is a little

1441
00:53:42,039 --> 00:53:48,318
Resurgence for green weed nice and I

1442

search for uh for the real Sour um it's

1445
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:59,519
seems like there's some Haz starting to

1446
00:53:56,798 --> 00:54:02,280
make a Resurgence um sh's doing that big

1447
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:04,798
project yeah um i' I gave him a a plan

1448
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:07,240
or two for that too nice the whole Haze

1449
00:54:04,798 --> 00:54:09,599
thing is really cool I think I did too

1450
00:54:07,239 --> 00:54:11,919
it's diversity right everybody just

1451
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:14,559
didn't grow Haze because it took too

1452
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:16,838
long there was there was a couple hazes

1453
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:19,359
that gave hay a bad name and it was like

1454
00:54:16,838 --> 00:54:20,798
the Jacks yeah but it's not like the old

1455
00:54:19,358 --> 00:54:23,239
school Jacks because those were very

1456
00:54:20,798 --> 00:54:25,358
good right it's that linear Jack that

1457
00:54:23,239 --> 00:54:27,279
doesn't get you high it's like that's

1458
00:54:25,358 --> 00:54:28,838
not how hazes hazes get you really high

1459
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:31,680
yeah totally you know hazes should get

1460
00:54:28,838 --> 00:54:33,239
you lit well I love the cough you know

1461
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:34,358
dude the four cins cough is ridiculous

1462
00:54:33,239 --> 00:54:36,159
so I did some breeding I did that with

1463
00:54:34,358 --> 00:54:37,838
the banana Skittles nice I got the fort

1464
00:54:36,159 --> 00:54:40,318
cins C from my buddy

1465
00:54:37,838 --> 00:54:43,279
Reuben and that plant is amazing it

1466
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:46,159
grows crazy though it's like super super

1467
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:48,640
thin and GRE we just grew a one plant of

1468
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:51,000
it over this winter yeah and it came out

1469
00:54:48,639 --> 00:54:53,519
phenomenal and it was during that whole

1470
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,760
period when like Nevada City got like

1471
00:54:53,519 --> 00:54:58,920
four feet of snow so

1472
00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:00,640
long story short there was no power for

1473
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:04,200
like 10 days so there were no lights for

1474
00:55:00,639 --> 00:55:07,239
10 days wow it flow it took 14 years 14

1475
00:55:04,199 --> 00:55:09,759
years 14 weeks to flower 14 years to

1476
00:55:07,239 --> 00:55:13,118
flower would be amazing but it didn't

1477
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:15,799
even like take a hit that 10day period

1478
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:18,160
of being you know out I mean maybe the

1479
00:55:15,798 --> 00:55:21,079
structure hazes don't structure great

1480
00:55:18,159 --> 00:55:23,199
anyway uhhuh but the the flower came out

1481
00:55:21,079 --> 00:55:25,920
amazing tasted amazing that has the

1482
00:55:23,199 --> 00:55:28,519
brait stack yeah it's pretty cool though

1483
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,559
yeah it's a good one it's it's super

1484
00:55:28,519 --> 00:55:33,559
unique as far as like the profile of it

1485
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:35,160
is you know yeah it's it's definitely

1486
00:55:33,559 --> 00:55:38,039
equatorial

1487
00:55:35,159 --> 00:55:41,159
haish little but it's it's its own thing

1488
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:43,280
for sure yeah so and I guess the like

1489
00:55:41,159 --> 00:55:45,920
and it's way different than the piff

1490
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:48,798
yeah which is another version of nl5 by

1491
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:51,440
hay M yeah so there's a lot of diversity

1492
00:55:48,798 --> 00:55:52,798
in that the cross for sure for sure so

1493
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:55,159
another thing I did with the shoreline

1494
00:55:52,798 --> 00:55:57,000
crosses M did a bunch of Shoreline

1495
00:55:55,159 --> 00:55:58,118
crossed it with some of the popular

1496
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:02,000
stuff

1497
00:55:58,119 --> 00:56:06,760
now the banana Skittles uh Skittles back

1498
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:10,000

1502
00:56:14,679 --> 00:56:18,598
yeah yeah that's that's what the cough

1503
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:20,440
has I feel like the basement for sure

1504
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:22,720

1505
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:24,119

awesome but I'm a I'm a huge I like

1512
00:56:37,679 --> 00:56:41,558
diversity in in the things I eat I like

1513
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:43,240
diversity in things I smoke so I'm not

1514
00:56:41,559 --> 00:56:45,280
just like this is the only thing I want

1515
00:56:43,239 --> 00:56:47,598
to smoke sometimes I'll get on like

1516
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:49,480
these fits with like Skittles or with

1517
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:51,079
yeah Pluto or with some of these other

1518
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,920
ones where that that's what I have and I

1519
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:53,318
have a whole bunch of different

1520
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:55,639
varieties that's all I want to smoke

1521
00:56:53,318 --> 00:56:56,719
yeah that one that one bag cuz it's so

1522
00:56:55,639 --> 00:56:58,159
good and then when it's gone I'll go

1523
00:56:56,719 --> 00:56:59,919
back to other stuff it's kind of like OG

1524
00:56:58,159 --> 00:57:01,679
to me I always want to go back to OG

1525
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:05,200
anytime I get good OG I'll smoke it all

1526
00:57:01,679 --> 00:57:06,639
just because I like the effect yeah so I

1527
00:57:05,199 --> 00:57:08,719
mean I like the taste of it too I like

1528
00:57:06,639 --> 00:57:11,078
that especially the good ogs that taste

1529
00:57:08,719 --> 00:57:13,558
piny where you got that nice Pine in

1530
00:57:11,079 --> 00:57:16,359
Earth yeah you know and the Citrus is

1531
00:57:13,559 --> 00:57:17,559
cool like really citrusy kind of OG like

1532
00:57:16,358 --> 00:57:19,838
that's that's all right but I really

1533
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:23,798
like that almost where you're tasting

1534
00:57:19,838 --> 00:57:27,239
pine needles yeah and that's the mercine

1535
00:57:23,798 --> 00:57:29,318
right I think so

1536
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:31,519
yeah I think so

1537
00:57:29,318 --> 00:57:33,038
too but yeah and then but it's stronger

1538
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:34,960
than others it's like a combination of

1539
00:57:33,039 --> 00:57:36,880
miren and something else because some of

1540
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:38,639
it have like sour has it but not to the

1541
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:40,240
extreme like some of those ogs have it

1542
00:57:38,639 --> 00:57:41,719
where you feel like you're standing

1543
00:57:40,239 --> 00:57:44,118
under some redwood trees or something

1544
00:57:41,719 --> 00:57:45,959
like that yeah which actually you can

1545
00:57:44,119 --> 00:57:47,039
eat the new the the new growth off

1546
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:48,838

1549
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:55,159

1559
00:58:13,199 --> 00:58:18,439
connection to everybody who's ever using

1565
00:58:28,119 --> 00:58:32,760
energy into what it is they're growing

1566
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:35,200
for sure and the outcome usually is is

1567
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:37,680
more than prevalent yeah um like as far

1568

01:00:00,679 --> 01:00:05,239
finished product yeah and and then have

1604
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,639
access to it whenever you want well it's

1605
01:00:05,239 --> 01:00:09,358
great being part of something that's so

1606
01:00:06,639 --> 01:00:11,440
much bigger than yourself for sure that

1607
01:00:09,358 --> 01:00:13,440
too that's I think that's what it is

1608
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:15,119
yeah because it it's like really it's

1609
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:19,000
just so much of a bigger like the stuff

1610
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:22,079
we do has impact on good or bad you know

1611
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,760
and I care so much too it's it's it's

1612
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:25,280
not just like an ego thing where I need

1613
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:27,680
to smoke the weed that's growing with my

1614
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:29,920
[ __ ] I also like check up on people

1615
01:00:27,679 --> 01:00:32,759
growing with my [ __ ] a lot like I love

1616
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:34,920
to visit farms and I love to like give

1617
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:37,000
my input or you know what I mean when

1618
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:39,358
you love flow too so that you know yeah

1619
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:41,599
so it's like you know I think something

1620
01:00:39,358 --> 01:00:44,358
you said earlier that really resonates

1621
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:46,119
like this is It's a lifestyle you know

1622
01:00:44,358 --> 01:00:48,318
like right now isn't the best economic

1623
01:00:46,119 --> 01:00:50,119
time to be in the Cannabis industry but

1624
01:00:48,318 --> 01:00:52,119
as far as like being a cannabis lover

1625
01:00:50,119 --> 01:00:53,599
it's probably it's the best time ever

1626
01:00:52,119 --> 01:00:55,920
like I get to drive around and go to

1627
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:59,079
huge farms and small farms Big Farms

1628
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:02,280
medium Farms talk about what I love help

1629
01:00:59,079 --> 01:01:04,039
give advice if if it's wanted or just

1630
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:06,240
learn and hear what they're doing you

1631
01:01:04,039 --> 01:01:09,119
know what I mean so fact that we can get

1632
01:01:06,239 --> 01:01:11,719
paid to do this stuff is pretty awesome

1633
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:12,640
just to BU that by itself to be able to

1634
01:01:11,719 --> 01:01:18,159
do what you

1635
01:01:12,639 --> 01:01:20,639
love for sure and we talk about our like

1636
01:01:18,159 --> 01:01:21,838
our 18yearold selves and our 80y old s

1637
01:01:20,639 --> 01:01:23,679
with the only two people that you really

1638
01:01:21,838 --> 01:01:25,719
need to impress and I think my 18yar old

1639
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:28,159
self would be pretty oh my 18-year-old

1640
01:01:25,719 --> 01:01:29,439
selfelf is blown away right now yeah now

1641
01:01:28,159 --> 01:01:31,279
I got to work on impressing the

1642
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:35,039
80-year-old and make sure that totally I

1643
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:37,920
can still be surviving then right so if

1644
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:40,799
you had one piece of advice to give your

1645
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:42,358
younger self that first started out in

1646
01:01:40,798 --> 01:01:44,400
the industry and doing the stuff that

1647
01:01:42,358 --> 01:01:47,199
you did with the soil what would be that

1648
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:50,440
one piece of advice I mean most of all

1649
01:01:47,199 --> 01:01:53,000
just be confident there's so many times

1650
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:54,838
where I was like had anxiety that you

1651
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,039
know something may or may not not work

1652
01:01:54,838 --> 01:01:58,920
out yeah and like even to this day I

1653
01:01:57,039 --> 01:02:02,480
have to remind myself that it's going to

1654
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:05,000
work out like whether it's trying to get

1655
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:08,240
a big account to buy stuff because sales

1656
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:10,079
aren't great or whether it's somebody

1657
01:02:08,239 --> 01:02:11,959
calls with a complaint and you want to

1658
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:15,200
make sure that there there's no reason

1659
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:18,599
for them to complain and you know

1660
01:02:15,199 --> 01:02:20,879
like sometimes I I think I care too much

1661
01:02:18,599 --> 01:02:23,359
and I don't want to tell my my uh

1662
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:26,960
younger self to not care yeah but on the

1663
01:02:23,358 --> 01:02:28,838
other hand believe in your cause and and

1664
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:31,079
just keep your eye on the prize and it's

1665
01:02:28,838 --> 01:02:34,159
going to work out because I think I

1666
01:02:31,079 --> 01:02:35,760
spent too many years like worrying yeah

1667
01:02:34,159 --> 01:02:37,920
like looking

1668
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:40,079
back me and my wife even have these

1669
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:42,278
conversations like I think we've spent

1670
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:43,480
too much time worrying you know I agree

1671
01:02:42,278 --> 01:02:44,880
I think those are the kind of lessons

1672
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:46,599
you learn when you're older right like

1673
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:48,920
we you know it takes time to learn that

1674
01:02:46,599 --> 01:02:50,920
you don't need to worry yeah because you

1675
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:52,278
have a stack proof of the stuff that's

1676
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:54,400
going on to where it's like all those

1677
01:02:52,278 --> 01:02:55,880
times I worried and I'm here for sure

1678
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:57,760
you know because really life you know we

1679
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:59,278
talk about data points on my show a lot

1680
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:01,799
you know through throughout life you get

1681
01:02:59,278 --> 01:03:03,760
data points on life and cannabis the

1682
01:03:01,798 --> 01:03:05,239
more you smoke the more things you try

1683
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:06,400
you you you know you learn what you like

1684
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:09,358
and what you don't like but you also

1685
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:11,119
learn all the the nuances and diversity

1686
01:03:09,358 --> 01:03:14,639
that's out there between each plant

1687
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:16,838
between each smoke all those things and

1688
01:03:14,639 --> 01:03:18,038
you know what else is like the amount of

1689
01:03:16,838 --> 01:03:21,798
people and the different types of

1690
01:03:18,039 --> 01:03:24,839
personalities and yeah like as I

1691
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:27,119
sometimes feel even though I've been a

1692
01:03:24,838 --> 01:03:29,078
grower my whole life a whole adult life

1693
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:31,200
since like I've I've always been

1694
01:03:29,079 --> 01:03:35,519
involved with growing cannabis since

1695
01:03:31,199 --> 01:03:38,318
1988 wow and never had a hiccup since so

1696
01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:40,880
I've always been had that connection but

1697
01:03:38,318 --> 01:03:43,599
sometimes I have different hats and if I

1698
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:46,240
go in as a vital Garden Supply and you

1699
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:48,519
know not every place knows my history

1700
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:50,558
and not every person does yeah sometimes

1701
01:03:48,519 --> 01:03:53,440
I feel like they look at me as like an

1702
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:55,760
outsider as like a sales guy that's just

1703
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:57,440
trying to push some product line MH like

1704
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:59,278
I can I could sense that energy like

1705
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:02,240
when I go to certain places you know

1706
01:03:59,278 --> 01:04:04,760
because they get that and like I respect

1707
01:04:02,239 --> 01:04:06,399
that they're used to that but it's my

1708
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:09,799
job to make them feel comfortable with

1709
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:12,039
me totally without like bragging or like

1710
01:04:09,798 --> 01:04:14,400
acting like I know it all yeah but just

1711
01:04:12,039 --> 01:04:16,000
like more like making observations about

1712
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:18,400
what it is that they've done and what

1713
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,000
they're doing and try to let them know

1714
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:22,278
that I respect where they're at you know

1715
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,920
what I mean cuz for sure it's it's a

1716
01:04:22,278 --> 01:04:26,079
tricky game right now and everybody's

1717
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:28,358
Terri torial everybody thinks they their

1718
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:30,160
systems better sure and like you get

1719
01:04:28,358 --> 01:04:31,880
back to that competitive thing you know

1720
01:04:30,159 --> 01:04:34,199
like there's a million nutrient

1721
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:36,720
companies right now trying to get a sale

1722
01:04:34,199 --> 01:04:39,000
and at the end of the day there's always

1723
01:04:36,719 --> 01:04:42,399
somebody behind me trying to get the

1724
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:44,358
next guy and I have to just believe in

1725
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:46,680
the fact that you know if they have

1726
01:04:44,358 --> 01:04:48,679
success with my product and the and the

1727
01:04:46,679 --> 01:04:50,838
finished product comes out as good as

1728
01:04:48,679 --> 01:04:53,038
it's supposed to yeah then they're not

1729
01:04:50,838 --> 01:04:55,599
going to go anywhere else right if it

1730
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:57,640
ain't broke don't fix it for sure

1731
01:04:55,599 --> 01:05:00,519
especially with something like

1732
01:04:57,639 --> 01:05:03,639
soil so but replacing your soil is a big

1733
01:05:00,519 --> 01:05:06,639
deal especially if you're reusing your

1734
01:05:03,639 --> 01:05:09,159
soil yeah I think a lot of people have

1735
01:05:06,639 --> 01:05:11,598
tried you know different things and seen

1736
01:05:09,159 --> 01:05:13,440
if they could you know skimp on soil or

1737
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:14,960
something and for sure they later find

1738
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:17,119
out that that was probably not the best

1739
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:19,880
route to go yeah I'm not a big fan of

1740
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:22,440
Rockwell one of our last guests is like

1741
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:25,400
hom grower and he loves Rock really yeah

1742
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:26,960
I'm not either I think more so the

1743
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:29,480
effect than anything like you can get

1744
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:30,960
some stuff that looks great smells great

1745
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:33,760
then you go to smoke it usually doesn't

1746
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:36,278
have the turbs and maybe every once in a

1747
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:38,200
while you find some stuff that does but

1748
01:05:36,278 --> 01:05:41,679
definitely doesn't have the same effect

1749
01:05:38,199 --> 01:05:43,960
I agree like I'm a I'm a soil fan but

1750
01:05:41,679 --> 01:05:45,838
I've also learned to appreciate some

1751
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:48,480
people growing just like cocoa parlay

1752
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:51,639
Blends and yeah cocoa because Coco can

1753
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:54,719
attach some microbes yeah it can like

1754
01:05:51,639 --> 01:05:57,480
hold some life I feel like rock wol can

1755
01:05:54,719 --> 01:05:59,838
right and like half the time I see these

1756
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:01,880
these rock wool grows in like these big

1757
01:05:59,838 --> 01:06:03,880
facilities and they're just pounding

1758
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:05,960
them with as much salt as they possibly

1759
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:07,318
can to try to get their like five pounds

1760
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:09,079
of light or whatever it is that they're

1761
01:06:07,318 --> 01:06:11,719
getting these days and there's algae

1762
01:06:09,079 --> 01:06:13,640
growing on it and it's just like just

1763
01:06:11,719 --> 01:06:16,639
doesn't seem right to me you know

1764
01:06:13,639 --> 01:06:18,278
totally at least the cocoa is like it

1765
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:20,879
kind of gives gives the plant like

1766
01:06:18,278 --> 01:06:23,119
enough space in a home you can get good

1767
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:24,519
flavor with cocoa for sure really good

1768
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:27,200
flavor there's some good there's some

1769
01:06:24,519 --> 01:06:30,278
good like I guess people call it

1770
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:32,118
nowadays Sanic you know cocoa grown weed

1771
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:34,278
people using some microbes combined with

1772
01:06:32,119 --> 01:06:36,720
some salt and yeah you know coming out

1773
01:06:34,278 --> 01:06:39,000
with something that actually has like a

1774
01:06:36,719 --> 01:06:40,959
happy in between like a good yield has

1775
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:44,159
that bag appeal but actually has some

1776
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:45,639
turps and some flavors and so yeah

1777
01:06:44,159 --> 01:06:47,480
that's another thing that you know I'm

1778
01:06:45,639 --> 01:06:49,679
starting to have some appreciation for

1779
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:53,318
and in my younger years I would have

1780
01:06:49,679 --> 01:06:55,598
been more critical say no way you can't

1781
01:06:53,318 --> 01:06:57,239
you can't I back in the day I thought

1782
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:58,760
that any amount of salt was going to

1783
01:06:57,239 --> 01:07:01,318
kill the microbes and it was just like

1784
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:03,400
throwing it out the window but through

1785
01:07:01,318 --> 01:07:05,239
years of experience and seeing people

1786
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:07,480
and different grows go through cycles

1787
01:07:05,239 --> 01:07:09,598
and like yeah sometimes facility will be

1788
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:11,599
all organic and then the next thing you

1789
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:13,240
know they make a switch because they

1790
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:16,318
want to save money or they hired a new

1791
01:07:13,239 --> 01:07:17,759
grower or whatever it is and so like

1792
01:07:16,318 --> 01:07:20,798
halfway through the crop they may switch

1793
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:24,278
from vital to whatever brand and then

1794
01:07:20,798 --> 01:07:26,920
next thing you know I go there and I see

1795
01:07:24,278 --> 01:07:29,920
still growing in the soil and I'm like

1796
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:31,680
wait the salt didn't kill kill the soil

1797
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:34,278
there's still fungus there it's still

1798
01:07:31,679 --> 01:07:36,159
alive so that's something I did learn

1799
01:07:34,278 --> 01:07:38,278
you know like the first couple years of

1800
01:07:36,159 --> 01:07:41,558
like seeing the commercial scale go from

1801
01:07:38,278 --> 01:07:43,920
like the backyard grower to Loud Pack

1802
01:07:41,559 --> 01:07:46,760
type you know what I mean

1803
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:50,159
so that that's definitely something also

1804
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:52,720
as like a grower and a you know from a

1805
01:07:50,159 --> 01:07:54,558
nutrient company standpoint to be able

1806
01:07:52,719 --> 01:07:57,239
to see the evolution

1807
01:07:54,559 --> 01:08:00,400
and learn how that you can combine

1808
01:07:57,239 --> 01:08:03,239
products and there isn't necessarily one

1809
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:05,920
recipe right and you got to got to like

1810
01:08:03,239 --> 01:08:08,919
do what works for you as a grower and me

1811
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:10,960
as a provider of products I got to help

1812
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:12,400
the grower understand how my stuff could

1813
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:14,440
fit into what it is they're already

1814
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:17,279
doing

1815
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:18,880
right

1816
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:22,520
totally what do you think of that

1817
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:24,920
Skittles now half still tasty yeah

1818
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:26,120
really nice I pref yeah I mean I prefer

1819
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:28,158
smoking stuff that burns down to the

1820
01:08:26,119 --> 01:08:30,399
roach

1821
01:08:28,158 --> 01:08:32,479
but if it doesn't something's wrong

1822
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:34,198
right you put it out I think there's a

1823
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:37,238
lot of genetics that just aren't capable

1824
01:08:34,198 --> 01:08:38,238
of it too where like you can get that

1825
01:08:37,238 --> 01:08:39,639
that's one of my favorite things where

1826
01:08:38,238 --> 01:08:41,559
you have a roach you fire it up the next

1827
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:43,960
day and it still tastes really good yeah

1828
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:45,279
makes me smile yeah doesn't have that

1829
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:48,560
stale

1830
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:49,960
flavor then something got done right yep

1831
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:52,920
you ever see the cat piss back in the

1832
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:55,000
day oh yeah definitely like ammonia

1833
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:56,560
ammonia and skunk not gas by the way it

1834
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:59,880
was it was

1835
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:01,798
amonia super skunky yeah a tenth of a

1836
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:04,679
would smell the whole room up and then I

1837
01:09:01,798 --> 01:09:06,838
also the shamp the champagne yeah around

1838
01:09:04,679 --> 01:09:08,798
the same time champagne from champelli

1839
01:09:06,838 --> 01:09:11,359
yeah I was his name came up we were

1840
01:09:08,798 --> 01:09:14,560
talking about it the other day like

1841
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:17,319
somebody that I originally like would

1842
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:18,960
work that the OG with yeah also was

1843
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:21,120
working with that champagne and he was

1844
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:22,560
friends with champelli this was like

1845
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:25,358
we're talking yeah no one has that cut

1846
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:28,679
it's long years ago yeah and that was

1847
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:29,440
bag seed from beaser oh wow of champ

1848
01:09:28,679 --> 01:09:31,920
pretty

1849
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:33,838
sure yeah cuz nobody has the champagne

1850
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:35,759
cut it does not exist as far as I'm

1851
01:09:33,838 --> 01:09:37,880
almost sure that's that that's from bag

1852
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:40,520
seed from beers yeah I I actually need

1853
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:42,119
to ask him that but back in the day

1854
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:45,880
there was tons of those beers in the Bay

1855
01:09:42,119 --> 01:09:47,278
Area and tons tons there there was some

1856
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:49,199
good stuff in there too there was a lot

1857
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:51,159
of stuff but they also used some of it

1858
01:09:49,198 --> 01:09:52,719
was good yeah that you know I'm not

1859
01:09:51,158 --> 01:09:56,759
saying it was a bad thing even though it

1860
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:58,359
was you know beaster but yep yeah long

1861
01:09:56,760 --> 01:10:01,000
story

1862
01:09:58,359 --> 01:10:05,759
short that all those worlds collided at

1863
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:08,960
one point and you know yeah genetics but

1864
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:11,679
OG Rose to the top OG was like all

1865
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:14,920
anybody longest time for such a long

1866
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:17,960
time like OG was was hard to get real

1867
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:20,039
good OG yeah it wasn't like unless you

1868
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:21,359
were growing it yourself or your friends

1869
01:10:20,039 --> 01:10:24,119
were growing it you didn't have it all

1870
01:10:21,359 --> 01:10:25,960
the time well and a lot of us who grew

1871
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:28,679
you know like we made packs with each

1872
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:31,520
other to not give it out totally so to

1873
01:10:28,679 --> 01:10:33,199
keep that value and it it did all right

1874
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:36,560
for a decent amount of time but

1875
01:10:33,198 --> 01:10:38,960
eventually everybody got it then it yeah

1876
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:40,679
then it like turned upside down and

1877
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:42,198
nobody grew it again what happens is

1878
01:10:40,679 --> 01:10:44,719
somebody gets a bag seed and then

1879
01:10:42,198 --> 01:10:46,759
everybody gets the bag seed so like even

1880
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:48,319
with OG a lot of people that had you

1881
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:51,360
know like there's a lot of bunk cuts of

1882
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:53,198
OG yeah like bag SE so many it's not the

1883
01:10:51,359 --> 01:10:54,639
no bag seed is never good with OG that

1884
01:10:53,198 --> 01:10:57,960
I've seen

1885
01:10:54,640 --> 01:11:00,640
