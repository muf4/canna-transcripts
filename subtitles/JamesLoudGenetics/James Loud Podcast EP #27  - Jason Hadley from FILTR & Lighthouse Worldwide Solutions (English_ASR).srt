11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,118
connected through Autumn carsy I think

12
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:27,719
that name maybe Autumn yeah that that

13
00:00:26,118 --> 00:00:30,240
sounds right she's been on the podcast

14
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:32,759
before right I isn't it crazy how just

15
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:35,600
like this huge industry but such a small

16
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,079
world I mean it's a little bit

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,520
incestuous but you know a good way in a

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,759
good way right yeah I mean you're right

19
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,840
I mean because Alabama's not legal right

20
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:46,198
at this

21
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,920
point they legalized

22
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:50,718
you so why don't you tell everybody a

23
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,719
little bit about yourself and how you

24
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,000
get your start in the Cannabis industry

25
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,079
yeah for sure um so again you know my

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,518
name is Jason Hadley I'm I'm currently

27
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:01,359
with a company called filter that's

28
00:00:58,518 --> 00:01:02,960
owned by Lighthouse worldwide Solutions

29
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,079
and it's just sort of a funny way that

30
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,079
you like fall into cannabis I was not

31
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:11,118
one of those I was not the cool kid in

32
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:13,798
class right and so at some point um I

33
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:17,000
didn't really discover cannabis until

34
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:19,920
probably like maybe my senior year of

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,519
high school you know and uh and it was

36
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,719
funny because like one when I first

37
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:26,078
started smoking like it was like close

38
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:27,840
to the last day of school in high school

39
00:01:26,078 --> 00:01:29,559
and wouldn't you know it who do I see

40
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,920
smoking weed in his park in the parking

41
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,600
lot school but like this rival guy that

42
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,920
used to bully me all the time right and

43
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:39,478
then it turns out I see him he sees me

44
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,359
we lock eyes and I look at him and I'm

45
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:42,920
like dude I'm not gonna bust you and we

46
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:44,640
sat there and we smoked a Dube in the

47
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,399
school parking lot together I've never

48
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,920
seen him since but everything was

49
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,159
squashed in that moment it was just oh

50
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,359
it was wonder that was like one of those

51
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:54,000
moments where I was like man this thing

52
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:55,519
really brings people together you know

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,200
what I mean like it's one of the few

54
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:00,118
drugs you do in a circle right for sure

55
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,399
nobody's ever nobody's ever like got

56
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:06,359

63
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,800
collecting unemployment a buddy of mine

64
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:22,719
was like hey do you want to come trim

65
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,519

69
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,080
and I meet this guy Sky Hank if you're

70
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:38,318
familiar with Sky Hank at all from smoke

71

and so uhh it turns out like I'm

74
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,080
trimming for him and because I had like

75
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,560
an actual working career outside of

76
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,200
cannabis it turns out I showed up on

77
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,959
time I knew how to read I knew how to

78
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:56,799
write you know I was Dependable I'd

79
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:58,560
follow through like you know stuff

80
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,280
that's like kind of valuable in in

81
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,759
cannabis you don't see a lot of that at

82
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,759
the time right and so then they're like

83
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:06,399
hey do you want to work for us and so

84
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:08,120

85
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,640

88
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:17,639
foot facility I mean you know by this by

89
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,959
today's standards you know practically

90
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:23,719

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,000
took over somebody else's problems for

96
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:39,000
lack of a better term right I mean it

97
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,519
was like the buildout was you know

98
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,719
designed by Dr Seuss and you know

99
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,759
anything that could go wrong would and

100
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:47,598
you know like grow M Gros would have

101
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,878
never passed compliance testing in

102
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:52,399
today's age but um you know and then uh

103
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:54,438
I was run I was running that for a

104
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,400
little while until the cops said yeah

105
00:03:54,438 --> 00:03:58,479
maybe you shouldn't be growing anymore

106
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,280
and uh came in and took the whole thing

107
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:04,000
down and so then I uh turned out at that

108
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,000
time Sky Hank had had uh invented smart

109
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,199
B

110
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,680
controllers and which was for those of

111
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,280
you that out there that may not know it

112
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,760
was a small it still is it exists it's a

113
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,640
small like wireless communication sensor

114
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,918
device think of it like a wireless troll

115
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:21,039
Master System for your 50 light and

116
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:23,680
underc crowd primarily but uh and then

117
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,680
smart B shut down I spent a little time

118
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,360
swimming around at Spectrum King until I

119
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,319
figured out what I wanted to do and it

120
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,680
turned out that the fil filter guys

121
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:35,519
wanted to buy smart b a long time ago

122
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,360
and I had met them back then and then

123
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:38,879
they invented this filter product so

124
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,080
they called me up and they said hey do

125
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,399
you want to make a change and they

126
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:43,319
didn't even have to put the question

127
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:45,758
mark on the end before I was like yes

128
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:47,159
let's do this and so I come to find out

129
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,160
that these filter guys who I know

130
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,759
nothing about are part of this much

131
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,439
larger company called Lighthouse

132
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:58,199
worldwide Solutions and their bread and

133
00:04:54,439 --> 00:05:01,038
butter is like think of it as like FDA

134
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:04,120
compliant troll master systems so their

135
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:06,759
primary uh Market is like pharmaceutical

136
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:09,079
semiconductor Aerospace clean room

137
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:10,639
manufacturing right and they they do the

138
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:12,918
systems for that I mean they're not

139
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,918
obviously me you know measuring like DLI

140
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:17,879

141
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:19,758
particles and air differential pressures

142
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:21,800
coming from different doorways and stuff

143
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,960

144
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,240
was a little was a little much you know

145
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:28,959
it's much for this industry at this

146
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,800
point in the industry at some point the

147
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,799
regulation may call for it but that's a

148
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,560
whole other we talk about that later

149
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,400

00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,478
practitioner in the world and so somehow

167
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,359
or another I don't know where this leap

168
00:06:23,478 --> 00:06:27,839
came from but at some point she's opened

169
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,319
up a karate school or Taekwondo school

170
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,758
you know she came to from with like

171
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,160
dollars in her pocket and did all of the

172
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:37,960
American dream stuff to get you know to

173
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,400
owning her own studio and then all of a

174
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:41,839
sudden she decided she wanted to start

175
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:43,120
like a particle counting business I

176
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:45,239
don't know where that comes from but hey

177
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,000
here we are right so it turns out all of

178
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,680
the C team is like her black belt

179
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,279
students so the president of the

180
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,360
company's like a fifth deegree black

181
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:56,318
belt my boss is a fifth degree black

182
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,840
belt his boss is a fifth degree black

183
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,439
belt inside the lobby of the building

184
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:01,758
like it was so okay it was a surreal

185
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:03,680
thing because it's just not used to the

186
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,919
like the corporate environment I've

187
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:10,478
worked in previously but the lobby had

188
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:13,198
um was lined with magazines uh Black

189
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:16,639
Belt Magazine Taekwondo magazine and

190
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:19,720
like they're all covers that Dr Kim and

191
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,960
all of the C team were like cover models

192
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,160
for like whatever you call that the

193
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:25,638
equivalent in martial arts publishing

194
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,560
but um you know they're like breaking

195
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:29,478
boards and catching arrows and stuff

196
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,079
like that even in the break room you

197
00:07:29,478 --> 00:07:33,038
know like the CEO of the company

198
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:36,120
standing on a rock you know shirtless

199
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:39,318
with a bandana like you know doing cool

200
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:42,120
like Mountaintop poses and and and and

201
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:44,039
with that though I will say that because

202
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,478
of that like that you know made me feel

203
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:48,519
really good as a company because you

204
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:50,758
know like typically uh martial arts is

205
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:52,918
very you know based in like honor

206
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:54,960
respect you know those types of things

207
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:57,839
that not not that like backbiting that

208
00:07:54,959 --> 00:08:00,079
you see it like other job environments

209
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:02,158
you know what I mean and so right

210
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:04,918
um and and they've been very nurturing

211
00:08:02,158 --> 00:08:06,839
and supporting along the way and help me

212
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:09,198
to develop my skills they're they're

213
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:11,158
allowing me to to get certifications in

214
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,280
certain things to grow my knowledge base

215
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:15,959
so that I can be more effective for my

216
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:18,239
customers and so you know four years

217
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:19,598
later here we are uh I think I'm in my

218
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,918
fifth year now now that I'm thinking

219
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:25,360
about it but uh the time flies by and

220
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:27,959
they've just been great and you know I I

221
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,439
figured it like this as it's like I

222
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:30,638
don't need to know more about growing

223
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:32,679
there's plenty of guys that know how to

224
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,839
grow fire I just need to know more about

225
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:37,038
one particular aspect of it that

226
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:38,560
everybody else doesn't right you know

227
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:41,278
what I'm saying and be able to

228
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:43,439
specialize in that because you know it's

229
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:45,439
not just like Haw and air filters and

230
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,200
particle counters it's like it's being

231
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,399
of service it's it's helping these you

232
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:54,759
know Growers like cut a learning curve

233
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:56,600
that state compliance through on them

234
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:58,159
and the problem that they're facing is

235
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,120
like the equivalent of being told you

236
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:01,958
have ghosts in your building yeah go

237
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,639
find the ghost in your building you know

238
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:06,159
what I mean um but luckily enough

239
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:08,519
there's actually a lot a lot of

240
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:11,480
commonalities between clean room

241
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:14,039
manufacturing and where cannabis really

242
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,639
should be operating at in order to

243
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:17,759
maintain consistent uh consistent

244
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,759
testing

245
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:23,720
success awesome so you work with Peter

246
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:26,919
Maguire too I do I do

247
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:29,720
work he is very much a black belt yeah

248
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:33,399
and he's a really wicked smart dude

249
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:36,600
anded me along the way and you know

250
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:37,639
Peter also is a member of the Cannabis

251
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,839
section

252
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:42,360
ofm so they're coming out with standards

253
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:45,040
because that's the thing about cannabis

254
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,639
is that as we know in our early days you

255
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:50,120
had to be part plumber part electrician

256
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:52,039
part Carpenter you know I almost

257
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,399
electrocuted myself cutting a pigtail

258
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:55,039
for a cord that was still plugged into

259
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:57,720
the wall right we we don't know what we

260
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:59,799
don't know sometimes right yeah and um

261
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,040
there's not a lot of standards in

262
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:04,958
telling you how you should operate you

263
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:06,360
know so I often tell my clients like if

264
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:08,518
sort of like if you were lost in the

265
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,680
forest you'd watch what the rabbits eat

266
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:12,560
you know and so if you're looking to

267
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:14,838
like kind of mimic a higher standard a

268
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:17,000
lot of people tend to kind of glom on to

269
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:19,560
hospital standard because it's what we

270
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,320
see more often we don't you know not a

271
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:25,919
lot of people are in clean rooms and

272
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:28,040
that's by Design actually um and so you

273
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,879
know with that though hospitals are

274
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:32,799
fighting different things in cannabis is

275
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:34,399
fighting so you know when it comes to

276
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:37,120
operating I tell people if you could

277
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,039
live at Pharma at the top end and uh

278
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,039
food manufacturing at the bottom end if

279
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,480
you could live in that butter Zone

280
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:43,719
you're usually going to be pretty good

281
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,240
from run to run and you should be

282
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:49,120
running a pretty tight ship

283
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,919
awesome I love what I do I mean that's

284
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,879
the funny part like I found a home in

285
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:54,639
cannabis as far as like you know maybe

286
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:56,679
one day I'll be at another company maybe

287
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:57,959
one day I'll start my own company you

288
00:10:56,679 --> 00:11:00,719
know who knows what the future holds for

289
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:02,958
me but what I do know is that that this

290
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,959
uh this environment is is very much

291
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:07,439
Feels Like Home to me compared to other

292
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:10,039
types of Industries I've worked in in

293
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,200
the past yeah I mean I think it's a

294
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:13,799
great industry and I think you know

295
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,560
we're lucky to have people like you that

296
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:18,879
do a lot of handholding in this industry

297
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:20,518
too like getting getting in and kind of

298
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:23,159
explaining because I feel like there's

299
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:24,399
definitely like a learning curve for a

300
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:28,000
lot of people that are coming from

301
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,720
Cannabis into clean room practices and

302
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,200
you got yourself and you got Peter that

303
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,800
are going around you know Peter's done

304
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,759
some lecturing I've been to some of his

305
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:36,120
lectures on clean rooms and you know

306
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:39,078
I've talked to you on the phone when we

307
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,919
were getting our filters installed um

308
00:11:39,078 --> 00:11:43,120
you know I think that that that's great

309
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:45,159
to be able to have that not just the

310
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,600
expertise but being able to walk people

311
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:49,319
through knowing that they're uh they're

312
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,040
in a place where they could use help and

313
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,440
to to get them the help that they need

314
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:55,439
that's going to improve the quality of

315
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:59,639
what they're doing yeah wholeheartedly I

316
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:02,079
mean you know it's so often that like

317
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:05,039
this the industry doesn't know what it

318
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:07,239
doesn't know you know what I mean and

319
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:09,679
the what's nice though is is that you

320
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,159
can feel as I was I was saying today to

321
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:14,559
a client I was like you can feel the

322
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:17,000
yearning for the learning you know and

323
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:18,919
um because you know like Legacy Market

324
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,958
Days from a cleanliness standpoint you

325
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:23,000
know it was more about vanity because

326
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:25,399
the accountability was you you were only

327
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,120
hold held to weight bag appeal and

328
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:29,600
potency you know other than that you

329
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,839
just used to cut the bad part off and

330
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,560
put the rest in the turkey bag you know

331
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,639
right and now it's like things have

332
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:38,879
changed I have to explain to my clients

333
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,480
like dude the reason you're allowed to

334
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:43,078
operate in the open is because and the

335
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,720
that the state is willing to let you

336
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:46,519
operate in the open is because you have

337
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,480
to meet a minimum product safety

338
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:50,399
standard you know what I'm saying that's

339
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,278
the tradeoff okay we'll let you operate

340
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,720
legally but you can't put like moldy

341
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:57,078
Bunko boof out on the market like that a

342
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,759
you know that's not how that's not how

343
00:12:57,078 --> 00:13:03,120
that's going not in this state no yeah

344
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:04,559
right overall yeah overall I mean that's

345
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,039
you know sort of the thing the

346
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:10,919
interesting part is is that while they

347
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:12,559
put these testing mandates in place you

348
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:15,439
know it just simply says they don't they

349
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:17,599
haven't really cared how you operate up

350
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,440
until the point of

351
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,560
testing right you know what I'm saying

352
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,120
in other words like they're not telling

353
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:24,439
you what you have to do on a day-to-day

354
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:27,278
basis they're just saying this bag this

355
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,720
turkey bag this pound has to be in X

356
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:32,720
state of compliance

357
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:36,040
you know right um and you know that's

358
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,240
starting to change a little bit now and

359
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:41,000
so it's hilarious because like Peter and

360
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,320
I have you know have been sort of like

361
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,919
I've always kind of felt a little bit

362
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,519
like Chicken Little like a little

363
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:48,240
alarmist going like stop using single

364
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:50,799
bucket mops you got to use double and

365
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,278
triple bucket mops you know and I know

366
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:55,399
sometimes I sound like a crazy person

367
00:13:52,278 --> 00:13:57,439
about it but at the same time it's

368
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:59,198
like there's not a lot of future

369
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,839
proofing that happens in Canabis because

370
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:04,719
it's it's not a very proactive industry

371
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,399
as much as it's a reactive industry or

372
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,320
it has been in the past yeah yeah we

373
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,559
correct right I mean yeah in my

374
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,920
observation most of the time like an

375
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:16,838
investor isn't necessarily Gonna Want To

376
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:19,360
Build The Grow Room of the cultivator

377
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:20,920
dreams right you know what I mean

378
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,399
they're they're just like no we want to

379
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:24,519
be able to make back our investment

380
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,919
maybe when we've made like 5x our

381
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:28,560
investment we'll start talking about

382
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:30,439
improvements or whatever that Benchmark

383
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:32,679
is is you know well and very few people

384
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,519
are prepared for what's coming with

385
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:36,319
Federal legalization and the

386
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:38,519
possibilities of you know the the

387
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,560
standards that they will have oh no

388
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:41,759
absolutely I mean so it's funny because

389
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:43,518
we you know we've always had these

390
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:45,120
conversations around the water cooler so

391
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,679
to speak I mean grant that I work at a

392
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,560
home office so it's a rather lonely

393
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:51,000
water cooler but I'm

394
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:53,000
kidding but you know just kind of like

395
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,159
as we've talked and strategized over the

396
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,078
years and you know the prevailing theory

397
00:14:55,159 --> 00:15:02,240
was you know that if Federal what if SL

398
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:04,719
when Federal legalization came that even

399
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,320
if it wasn't necessarily the FDA that

400
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,120
was going to be mandating um operation

401
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,959
standards it would be some sort of

402
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,440
organization under the FDA who would

403
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:17,479
probably still pull the current FDA

404
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:22,720
regulations a case in point like a lot

405
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:25,079
of State uh license criteria was pulled

406
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,560
from something called the US pharmacopia

407
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:28,278
I mean it was straight lifted right off

408
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:31,919
the page and copied and pasted right on

409
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:34,439
their website uh the US pharmacopia is

410
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:35,919
the organization that develops the

411
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:39,079
standards that are used in

412
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:42,078
pharmaceutical manufacturing the FDA is

413
00:15:39,078 --> 00:15:46,000
the enforcement body of the US

414
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:47,719
pharmacopia and so the US pharmacopia um

415
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,679
you know like I said they they they if

416
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,199
you look it up their St their testing

417
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:54,318
standards are the same as like Michigan

418
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:56,359
California you know several others that

419
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:58,439
have like you know four types of asilas

420
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,720
that are detect non-detect you know if

421
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,279
you if they're rocking that kind of

422
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,839
stuff it's usually like they lifted it

423
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:06,799
from the USP well so if they're going to

424
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,639
lift the testing standards from the USP

425
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,439
well what are the odds they're probably

426
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,600
going to lift the operating standards

427
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,199
from there as well right and so you're

428
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,120
starting to see a little bit of that

429
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:20,958
change start to creep in where it's not

430
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:23,159
necessarily taking the federal level

431
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:25,838
green light to make things happen some

432
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:27,679
of these states are starting to take uh

433
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,759
operating standards at a federal level

434
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:32,919
and apply them at the state level so

435
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:35,399
take take for example state of New York

436
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:39,198
just recently legalized and the state of

437
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:41,278
New York uh is requiring that you be

438
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:45,439
adherent to ready for this everybody out

439
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:46,799
in podcast land write this down 21 CFR

440
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,319
part

441
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:52,879
117 and that is the uh the the

442
00:16:50,318 --> 00:16:53,799
regulations set for the manufacturing of

443
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:57,519
human

444
00:16:53,799 --> 00:17:00,198
food wow yeah so that's how every cookie

445
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:03,679
factory operates that's how every Cereal

446
00:17:00,198 --> 00:17:07,038
Factory every you know potato chip one

447
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:09,599
cookie factory that doesn't operate

448
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:12,160
right we're not gonna mention them but

449
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:14,599
yeah fair enough but yeah so so so you

450
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,160
know but but by and large like those

451
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:18,438
levels of Standards so New York had

452
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,679
baked it right in from the jump as far

453
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:22,880
as like right when they legalized right

454
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:24,880
uh and then Michigan is currently

455
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,520
considering the deployment of

456
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:32,919
117 um specifically Parts a and parts B

457
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:34,918
Parts A and B um which isn't that big of

458
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:36,600
a deal at this point I'll say that

459
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:39,360
because part A is mostly like

460
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:41,639
definitions like what is a micro what is

461
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:43,719
you know this what is that part B just

462
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:46,000
basically starts to say that you are

463
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,400
becoming that you have to be cgmp

464
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,079
compliant Curr current good

465
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,200
manufacturing practice compliant and

466
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:54,558
then but they Reserve in the fine print

467
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,840
it says we reserve the right to enforce

468
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:59,879
later subsequent sections that's where

469
00:17:56,839 --> 00:18:02,599
it gets live um um because like for

470
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,480
instance part C you you're going to have

471
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:07,439
to start to understand something called

472
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:12,038
HP and HP stands for hazard analysis

473
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:14,640
critical control points which is uh it's

474
00:18:12,038 --> 00:18:17,440
it's a food safety philosophy and

475
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,720
practice um that originally came about

476
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,360
when uh NASA went to Pillsbury and was

477
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,919
like we need to make sure that there's

478
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:27,678
no food spoilage in space because who

479
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:30,280
wants the runs in a space suit right I

480
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:34,000
can't that got to

481
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:36,200
suck so anyway so Pillsbury develops

482
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,480
this like methodology of being able to

483
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,480
like analyze their process find faults

484
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,360
in it find Corrections preventative

485
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,599
actions those types of things and and so

486
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:48,000
you know you're going to start to see

487
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:49,719
this kind of Brave New World open up and

488
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,919
you know you got the old dogs that are

489
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,839
like well I didn't get into this

490
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:56,240
business to fill out paperwork it's like

491
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:59,079
yes but businesses and industries evolve

492
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,960
you know I mean we're not using wheel

493
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:03,798
spoked cars you know wheel spoked tires

494
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,600
because somebody's like vulcanization

495
00:19:03,798 --> 00:19:09,558
that devil talk you know like nobody

496
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:11,639
does that like things innovate so

497
00:19:09,558 --> 00:19:12,678
unfortunately most people got into this

498
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,360
industry because they didn't want to

499
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:17,919
work a day job or pay taxes and you know

500
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:20,319
so here you are you know yeah I mean

501
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,960
things have definitely evolved yeah no I

502
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:23,599
I would completely agree and that's

503
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:27,038
that's the beauty of it and that's where

504
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:29,678
I find um that I seamlessly slip right

505
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:33,079
in because you have these people that

506
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:35,440
want to be at a higher Echelon of

507
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:37,720
operation and but they don't know where

508
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,798
to turn they don't know where to look

509
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:43,319
and the good news is is all of that

510
00:19:39,798 --> 00:19:44,639
information is all out there so you know

511
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:47,879
it's funny because I sell an air

512
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,880
purifier but my my competition isn't the

513
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:53,559
guy making an air purifier across the

514
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:57,440
street it's change

515
00:19:53,558 --> 00:20:00,319
discipline uh my buddy says dot dot dot

516
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:03,038
you know Buddy says you should use this

517
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:04,960
Bro Science Bro Science and so I'm just

518
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:08,359
like dude you just need a better class

519
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,679
of buddy that's all right you know so

520
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:11,279
that's where I try to really pride

521
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,280
myself on I'm not going to put anything

522
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:16,599
out information wise that isn't backed

523
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:19,879
up by a source right you know what I

524
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:21,879
mean and the source is not your buddy

525
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,320
right it's Peter McGuire it's Peter

526
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,760
McGuire totally well he's he's in Oregon

527
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:26,519
so I'm wondering what your thoughts are

528
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:28,480
on

529
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:31,679
aspergillis and everything you know

530
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,759
because Oregon tried to pass the the law

531
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:37,720
that they were about regarding asilis

532
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:41,960
and not being and testing for it right

533
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:44,600
and well they found out they have around

534
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:48,400
and found out right I exactly everything

535
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:50,038
had aspergillus in it right exactly yeah

536
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,280
and and I I mean listen from a

537
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:55,279
cultivator standpoint I totally get it I

538
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:57,440
feel the pain Point um you know that

539
00:20:55,279 --> 00:21:00,119
that section of the country as far as

540
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:03,120
their growing methodologies it's it's

541
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:05,519
very well- entrenched in you know let's

542
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:08,239
let's call them oldw World methodologies

543
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:09,599
you know and I respect that I dig it I

544
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,240
you know you'd be surprised what I've

545
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:13,759
been willing to smoke in my day so I'd

546
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,759
smoke anything from Oregon because I've

547
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:17,919
smoked stuff from Mexico no problem it's

548
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:19,798
cool right you know I didn't even know

549
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,640
bud came like in a three-dimensional

550
00:21:19,798 --> 00:21:23,079
form I thought it came as a feather

551
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,720
because I had didn't understand what

552
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:28,960
Mexican bricks I didn't understand grew

553
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,720
in bricks grew in bricks was like cool I

554
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:35,360
got the corner of the brick that's

555
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:37,519
awesome it's like bounties it's like so

556
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:39,158
uh but anyway so yeah no in Oregon yeah

557
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:41,319
it's that's it's a tough one because

558
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:43,760
like I mean I have an unpopular but hot

559
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:45,759
take on it and and it goes a little

560
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:47,119
something like this w we can't grow

561
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:48,519
clean so we're going to try to reform

562
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:50,678
the laws back to where they originally

563
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:52,960
were I'm sorry if I pissed off anybody

564
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:55,840
in Oregon but you know I mean at the end

565
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,759
of the day it's like again that that

566
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:58,558
product safety standard is coming into

567
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:00,400
play

568
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:03,240
and you

569
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:06,000
know the the propensity for people

570
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:08,359
getting tainted weed is is not all that

571
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,200
high I understand that but when it hits

572
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:13,038
you it it's you know it can be

573
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,558
debilitating particularly because we've

574
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:18,720
been you know calling this medicine to

575
00:22:15,558 --> 00:22:23,918
make it legal for you know 20 30 years

576
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:26,440
right more right 96 right so it's

577
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,080
like if you're going to grow medicine

578
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,480
then you're going to have to make

579
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:33,158
medicine the way medicine's

580
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,759
made is kind of the my my take off like

581
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:37,840
I said hot take unpopular opinion very

582
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:39,278
unpopular very popular on this podcast

583
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:42,798
you're gonna get a lot of slack for it

584
00:22:39,278 --> 00:22:44,159
you know I think and I don't honestly

585
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:45,960
know what the balance is because I think

586
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,520
there's a balance I I want to support

587
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,558
Growers that are growing outdoors in

588
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:52,400
Oregon you know I mean I feel like

589
00:22:49,558 --> 00:22:53,879
there's a need to support and to support

590
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,919
small business right so at the end of

591
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,919
the day we want to support small

592
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:58,559
business obviously we want a safe

593
00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:00,320
product that's safe for every everybody

594
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:02,960
so maybe the thresholds need to be

595
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:05,119
adjusted I mean I think that's probably

596
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,159
what it's going to come down to I think

597
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:10,599
so too um you know I mean and especially

598
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,480
because you know if nothing else like

599
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:15,240
the states are starting to see like

600
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,120
Revenue spikes in in their tax revenue

601
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,919
and Absolut you know they don't want to

602
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:22,759
go that to go away so yeah if they do

603
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:27,080
have to like you know make it like

604
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:28,558
detect non detect or X number of total

605
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:30,278
coliform

606
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:32,440
uh you know from your total yeast and

607
00:23:30,278 --> 00:23:34,640
mole count or some some sort of give and

608
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,798
take I mean you know and not only that

609
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,840
but here's the thing is that that law

610
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:40,839
when it was put into effect was

611
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:42,879
basically like okay you guys have to

612
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:45,359
basically change everything you do now

613
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,600
you have an X number like Long window to

614
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:49,278
make that happen right and now

615
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:51,158
everything after that has to be tested

616
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:54,519
so it wasn't it's not fair to The

617
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:56,480
Growers right you know because like

618
00:23:54,519 --> 00:24:00,038
again you know like a lot of a lot of

619
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:03,919
the Legacy methodology just simply don't

620
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:07,240
translate into like a compliant world

621
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:10,360
you know um so yeah no I

622
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:12,558
mean you know I let me put it this way I

623
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:14,719
I I applaud Oregon for being able to get

624
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:16,519
that repealed yeah you know what I'm

625
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,880
saying I mean because think about it

626
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:20,679
like no other state is is getting that

627
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,159
kind of lobbying power that that they're

628
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:26,320
all of a sudden gonna start changing the

629
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:28,919
rules right you know so my hat's off to

630
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:33,200
them personally totally well you have

631
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:34,600
some amazing uh Clean Air Products I do

632
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,080
yeah you want to tell us a little bit

633
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:38,558
about the product line that you guys

634
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:41,839
have yeah sure so so we were talking we

635
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:44,759
mentioned earlier filter so filter is a

636
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:47,398
commercial grade HEPA air purifier um

637
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:49,158
it's the same type of HEPA technology

638
00:24:47,398 --> 00:24:51,319
that's used in pharmaceutical clean

639
00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:55,440
rooms um it's what you would call a

640
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:57,519
capture and removal type of uh device so

641
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,720
you know the philosophy in clean rooms

642
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:03,398
is is they don't care what's in your air

643
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,399
they just want it out of the air so they

644
00:25:03,398 --> 00:25:07,639
don't care if it's dust if it's mold if

645
00:25:05,398 --> 00:25:09,918
it's you know whatever it's like if you

646
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,759
remove all of the particles which

647
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,159
difficult to do admittedly difficult to

648
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:17,480
do but like if you reduce the particles

649
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:19,600
you reduce the threat so most of the

650
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:21,880
problems that start out in our

651
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:24,599
facilities typically tend to come from

652
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,640
the air um you know a lot of times our

653
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:28,918
our facilities are negatively pressured

654
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,600
so they're pulling outside air in

655
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:32,640
especially if you're near places like if

656
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:35,519
you're growing near like a garbage dump

657
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:38,320
or you're growing near other Growers or

658
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:40,319
other industries that have different uh

659
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:43,319
requirements around their output and

660
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:46,480
pollution levels um cereal factories for

661
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:48,000
example are widely known to you know

662
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,319
remember they get their corn and their

663
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,440
grains and all that stuff on box cars

664
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:54,558
that are just dumped in silos into the

665
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:57,960
factory so all of that stuff that's just

666
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:59,918
sort of rotting is uh it's still usable

667
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,880
for the purpose of making Lucky Charms

668
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:05,640
or whatever but like cereal has a kill

669
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,520
step in it so the production process so

670
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,200
they can take in like different types of

671
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:12,639
let's say stuff you wouldn't normally

672
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,399
necessarily eat raw you know under its

673
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,240
current state when it arrives there but

674
00:26:14,398 --> 00:26:19,319
by the time it's made into a box of

675
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,798
cereal it's perfectly edible because

676
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:23,398
anything that's been you know uh exposed

677
00:26:21,798 --> 00:26:26,119
to that stuff has been killed off in the

678
00:26:23,398 --> 00:26:29,239
production process meanwhile their

679
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:31,959
Material Handling is constantly like

680
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:34,240
pluming molds and such that are coming

681
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:37,079
off of those things and depending if

682
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,558
you're upwind downwind whatever you know

683
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:40,918
you you definitely there's a propensity

684
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:42,918
for you to be able to pull those

685
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:45,960
problems in and I've I've seen it in lab

686
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:47,759
testing so um so in addition to the HEPA

687
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,720
a purifier which is continually

688
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:52,278
remediating particles it's like you know

689
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,519
at the end of the day like you need to

690
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:56,759
be able to not just get rid of particles

691
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:59,679
but it's also very helpful to be able to

692
00:26:56,759 --> 00:27:02,200
detect them and identify them in your

693
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,360
air so one of the other devices we

694
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:07,519
manufacture is called an hand it's

695
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:09,479
called an air particle counter and what

696
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:11,720
it's designed to do is it's basically

697
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,159
pulling air in through a laser or

698
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,120
through a box it's running it past a

699
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:17,360
laser it's sizing it it's counting it

700
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:21,000
it's giving you a number you can then

701
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:22,439
start to use to understand the volume or

702
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,839
what you would call the particle

703
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:28,519
pressure the particle burden of of your

704
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:29,959
of your airspace um and that's something

705
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:32,519
that you can use to kind of understand

706
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:36,840
the general cless of your air but also

707
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:40,038
you can use it to um let's say like

708
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:42,678
start to capture or how would I say this

709
00:27:40,038 --> 00:27:46,200
uh potentially start to identify

710
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:48,159
problems that could be in your air um so

711
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:51,319
like for instance I'm trying to uh as

712
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:53,200
we're talking here trying to find a a

713
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:55,918
dock here that I wanted to show you if I

714
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:58,240
can I share a screen with you absolutely

715
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:04,038
sweet okay so check this out

716
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:06,399
so this is a falling particle chart so

717
00:28:04,038 --> 00:28:08,200
if you understand the concept that

718
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:11,199
heavier particles are going to fall out

719
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:13,759
of the air faster than smaller particles

720
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,759
you can see here that a 100 Micron

721
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:18,119
particle which would be like roughly the

722
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:19,960
width of a human air that's going to

723
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:21,879
fall out of the ground or just going to

724
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,360
fall to the ground in this particular

725
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,039
case they're saying it's it's falling

726
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:27,479
one meter so what they did was they took

727
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:29,200
a glass tube that's one meter long they

728
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:32,640
drop the particle in it they time to see

729
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:35,120
how long it takes to fall and so a 100

730
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,480
Micron particle the whd your human hair

731
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:40,839
like takes less than two seconds to fall

732
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:42,839
one meter but have to consider that in

733
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:46,678
cannabis your smallest particle thread

734
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:49,439
is actually one micron and larger so one

735
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:52,159
to two microns is like an aspila [ __ ]

736
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:55,480
Godus Spore probably one of the smaller

737
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:58,440
ones but a one micron particle will take

738
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:01,079
almost 5 hours to fall one meter in

739
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:03,558
perfectly still air undisturbed by

740
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:05,639
ambient air so if you think of if it

741
00:29:03,558 --> 00:29:07,798
takes five hours to fall in a tube where

742
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:10,759
it's nothing's disturbing it and then

743
00:29:07,798 --> 00:29:13,480
you go to an indoor facility and you're

744
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:17,158
dealing with fans on the walls doors

745
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:19,360
opening and closing HVAC that's you know

746
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:20,960
perhaps intermittently spaced you know

747
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:22,278
through the duct work and stuff like

748
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,319
that you're creating what's called a

749
00:29:22,278 --> 00:29:27,640
turbulent airf flow environment so these

750
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:30,119
one micron particles these smaller mold

751
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:34,880
spores they can stay a loft

752
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:38,119
for indefinitely frankly you know yeah

753
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,840
and so um that's where the idea and and

754
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:41,439
and all they're doing is swirling around

755
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:44,759
the air and they're succumbing to the

756
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,880
Seas of flow so every time like I'm sure

757
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:49,240
at some point if you've ever walked past

758
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,440
a like a candle or something like that

759
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:54,519
and like the wind from your you passing

760
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:57,960
by disturbs the flame you know that

761
00:29:54,519 --> 00:30:00,079
happens at the particle level too um um

762
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:02,640
as well those particles are also very

763
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:05,839
easy to adhere to our clothing and such

764
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,880
so even if somebody's in Scrubs you know

765
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:11,359
you got to remember like to a one micron

766
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:13,840
particle like you know threads are like

767
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:15,359
you know giant like anchor ropes or like

768
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:17,199
those ropes you use in the gym you know

769
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:18,918
a little thread that we see in a shirt

770
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,759
right to us it looks like a more like a

771
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:24,399
hair but to a one micron mold Spore it's

772
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:27,359
it's much larger so it's able to adhere

773
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:29,439
easier and uh and then travel about the

774
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:31,119
facility so with your particle counter I

775
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,080
think one of the coolest things that you

776
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:36,599
suggested is to actually use it to test

777
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:38,000
before you're do like when either dring

778
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:40,439
your build out before you actually have

779
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,519
plants in and then after once you have

780
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,159
the filter installed and you know being

781
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:46,839
able to test the difference yeah

782
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,559
absolutely so that's called baselining

783
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:51,158
and that that's the the technical term

784
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:53,319
is to Baseline a building so what

785
00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:55,399
happens is um you know like let's say

786
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:57,480
the last nail and screw goes in the

787
00:30:55,398 --> 00:30:59,759
construction crew leaves you do your f

788
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,839
clean up whatever that would be the time

789
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:03,359
where you would take uh particle counts

790
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:05,398
to figure out what's going on in there

791
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:07,918
you would take air samples to see if you

792
00:31:05,398 --> 00:31:11,599
can identify anything in your air uh I

793
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:14,600
would suggest swab samples as well water

794
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:17,398
samples um you know just test the just

795
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:20,199
test the Jesus out of that place right

796
00:31:17,398 --> 00:31:22,319
because you want to know a are there any

797
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,080
problems in there that you might be able

798
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:25,839
to catch and remediate before you ever

799
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:27,960
move plants in there because if you grow

800
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:30,000
plants on top of a problem

801
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,519
you're just proliferating a problem

802
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,519
right um but then the other side of this

803
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:37,440
too is that you then also have some

804
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:40,079
benchmarks for cleanliness so now that

805
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,399
you know what the building was like

806
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:44,398
before plants ever moved in you're

807
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:47,359
cleaning and testing regimens and stuff

808
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:49,319
you have something to compare against as

809
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:53,000
as you as you progress through cycle

810
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:55,158
after cycle so um you know and then not

811
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,519
for nothing but I I talked to some of my

812
00:31:55,159 --> 00:31:59,080
clients about like you know cuz I'm

813
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:01,200
always helping them to you know be

814
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:03,278
successful that so that they scale and

815
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,919
expand and if they're thinking about

816
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:08,720
buying a second building I'm like let's

817
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,519
go in and take some samples now if you

818
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,839
like the building that much but it's got

819
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:15,558
a problem and you can prove it then that

820
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:19,079
might maybe give you some negotiating

821
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:21,678
power on price totally yeah that makes a

822
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:23,519
lot of sense yeah yeah I mean you know

823
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:26,798
or or maybe that you might want to avoid

824
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,638
it all together you know right now

825
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:30,200
people as opposed to 5 years ago I think

826
00:32:28,638 --> 00:32:32,319
a lot of people are thinking like what's

827
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,360
in the building that I'm going into what

828
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:37,000
what kind of pathogens are already in

829
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:38,599
the building yeah oh that's a and and

830
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,440
not only that but understanding the

831
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:41,798
history of that building too if you're

832
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,399
not building from the ground up from

833
00:32:41,798 --> 00:32:46,240
scratch yeah you know I mean you find

834
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:48,038
like uh say for instance in the New

835
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,720
England states like your Massachusetts

836
00:32:48,038 --> 00:32:51,119
Rhode Island areas and stuff like that I

837
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:56,038
mean some of that construction's 100

838
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:58,599
years old yeah definitely asilis yeah

839
00:32:56,038 --> 00:33:01,079
definitely definitely asilis and you

840
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:02,558
know um and and so it's like you know

841
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:04,678
I'm telling them man you got to throw a

842
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:07,079
lot of epoxy around this place you know

843
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:08,559
you got to kind of hermetically seal all

844
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:10,398
these problems in because it's not like

845
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:13,480
you're going to be replacing wood beams

846
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:15,638
and stuff like that you know um but yeah

847
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,360
it's it's you know you have old

848
00:33:15,638 --> 00:33:20,158
construction but then you also have like

849
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:23,038
what was the building used for prior so

850
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:26,399
you know I might not necessarily want to

851
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:28,158
move a cannabis cultivation into like a

852
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:30,199
something that was manufacturing dog

853
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,120
food previously or something like that

854
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:35,399
you know right you wouldn't want to move

855
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:37,959
into a slaughterous right um you know

856
00:33:35,398 --> 00:33:39,959
you want businesses that didn't have

857
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:42,759
anything to do with organic products

858
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:45,079
prior you know what I'm saying uh

859
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:48,000
because those things will leave residual

860
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:50,158
imprint in the building long after that

861
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,480
business has closed and moved on and

862
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:57,080
it's just waiting for the next client

863
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:59,319
you know but if I don't know like more

864
00:33:57,079 --> 00:34:00,798
nous business buys an old dog food

865
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:03,000
factory they're not as susceptible to

866
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:05,200
the problems it's the plants that are

867
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
the issue the plants are are so

868
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,280
sensitive you know and so that's why I

869
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,039
have to explain to people you're not

870
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,119
you're not growing you know cucumbers

871
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:15,519
and tomatoes that have skin that you can

872
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:17,280
wash and you can take like some sort of

873
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:18,960
spray to or something like that you know

874
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,720
you're growing something that's sticky

875
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,320
and catches anything that passes by it

876
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:26,118
yeah the remediation starts before you

877
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:28,119
get the plants in yeah absolutely I

878
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:29,559
couldn't agree with you more yeah yeah

879
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:31,679
and then you know the other side of it

880
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:33,559
too is it's it's not even necessarily

881
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:36,960
like the building has an illness it's

882
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:40,519
like you know our day-to-day lives from

883
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,480
a microb standpoint are are pretty

884
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:45,119
Savage by comparison to like the

885
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,440
cleanliness level you you you want in in

886
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:49,679
a cannabis facility I mean you know both

887
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:52,358
you and I sitting here right now we have

888
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:55,240
100,000 skin cells sloughing off of our

889
00:34:52,358 --> 00:34:57,598
body per minute yeah like you know what

890
00:34:55,239 --> 00:35:00,719
I mean like we look like uh we look like

891
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:02,240
the top of a glass of sprite at like the

892
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:04,879
you know at the at the we're

893
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:08,078
effervescent you know at that uh at that

894
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,880
microscopic level and so you know with

895
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,920
that we pick up a lot of things in our

896
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,599
day-to-day lives sitting on the couch

897
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,480
you know ASP perillis spag godess

898
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:18,000
largest producer of it is our or you

899
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,880
pick up a lot of it from your own

900
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,599
bedding right yeah so you know with that

901
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:27,039
in mind it's

902
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:29,280
like people tend to become almost as

903
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:31,239
much if not more so a danger to the

904
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,640
process compared to the environment that

905
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:35,838
you're growing in you know totally it's

906
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:37,400
one thing to grow like in a barn but

907
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:38,759
it's another thing to grow in street

908
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,160
clothes in a barn you know like you're

909
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:43,920
just kind of adding to the problem and

910
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:45,719
so a lot of it has to do with you know

911
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:48,159
how what are you doing

912
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:51,639
around you know keeping a barrier

913
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:53,239
between yourself and your plants right

914
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:56,519
so can we talk a little bit about using

915
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:58,479
igar plates and how uh you can test for

916
00:35:56,519 --> 00:36:00,159
path pathogens and and problems in your

917
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,920
buildings let's say let's say you're

918
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:04,239
moving into a building and you want to

919
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:08,119
figure out what the problems are this

920
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:10,519
here is a lighthouse ac100 air microbial

921
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:12,400
sampler this may look familiar to you I

922
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:13,960
think in fact you may have used this one

923
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,720
I think I do send this one to you but I

924
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:17,880
think I see my thumb print on it so so

925
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:19,039
what you see here and I just want to

926
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,720
make sure that the background doesn't

927
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:25,079
obscure it but basically you got a cover

928
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:27,000
for the sampler you have a sampling head

929
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:29,599
and you can see as I hold it up to the

930
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,639
camera there's a bunch of holes uh that

931
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:33,800
are embedded in it and then what you

932
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:36,000
would do is you'd put a petri dish here

933
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:38,280
you'd snap the cover on you set the

934
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,480
buttons up and you would draw a specific

935
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:43,359
amount of air for a specific amount of

936
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,639
time onto the petri dish which then you

937
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:46,358
would cap and then send off to a lab to

938
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:51,239
have

939
00:36:46,358 --> 00:36:54,039
analog um you know it's it's and we use

940
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:57,199
malt extract agar you know it it would

941
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:59,440
be what's suggested um because that's

942
00:36:57,199 --> 00:37:02,399
that and uh I think there's another one

943
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,880
tryptic Soy Agar or potato dextrous I

944
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:07,720
have to look that up but I always I

945
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:11,599
always use mea um but you know certain

946
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:14,519
agars do not play do not capture the

947
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:17,000
things that you're looking for right you

948
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:18,559
know um for instance powdery Milo

949
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,358
doesn't play it at

950
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:23,358
all interesting I know you have to use a

951
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:26,799
different kind of device in order to to

952
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:28,119
capture uh powdery mildew um so that

953
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,000
device I don't we don't sell them we

954
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:33,720
don't make them but we made an adapter

955
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,920
for their testing media and uh so they

956
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:37,480
used something called I don't know if

957
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:40,119
you've ever heard of like a zon biop

958
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:43,240
pump um they take something called an

959
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:44,960
Aeros cell cassette which is essentially

960
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:46,559
just to boil it down to like explain

961
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,559
like on five terms it's it's like a

962
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:51,559
hockey puck small hockey puck shaped

963
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:53,519
plastic disc uh air can go in and flow

964
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:56,639
out and inside the center of that is

965
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:59,039
like an little adhesive Circle and so

966
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:00,838
air impacts the particles you know the

967
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:03,639
air flow impacts the particles on an

968
00:38:00,838 --> 00:38:05,960
adhesive uh Circle and that can be

969
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:08,679
looked at under a microscope for visual

970
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:10,480
study so you can't necessarily incubate

971
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:14,039
it and grow something out on it think of

972
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:17,838
it like a lift tape sample y it's like a

973
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:20,119
lift tape sample of your air cool yeah

974
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:21,599
so really good stuff yeah yeah and then

975
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:24,559
you know I mean obviously I'm a big fan

976
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:26,000
of swabbing as well um because you know

977
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:27,358
I just want to know as much data as

978
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,159
possible Right when you open up your

979
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:30,880
troll Master you open up your aoya or

980
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:32,358
whatever you want to be able to see like

981
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,440
the graphic representation of the

982
00:38:32,358 --> 00:38:35,598
heartbeat of your garden right you want

983
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,159
to be able to look at that and you can

984
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:39,760
start to see the interplay between

985
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:42,358
systems in here so it's like I mean if I

986
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,760
was able to you know for instance uh you

987
00:38:42,358 --> 00:38:45,799
know I can even show you what a lab

988
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,920
report looks like to kind of give you an

989
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:51,680
idea of what somebody can expect from a

990
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:55,480
data standpoint I'll share this with you

991
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:57,719
so this is a uh a lab report where I've

992
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:00,519
redacted the name to protect the

993
00:38:57,719 --> 00:39:03,358
innocent and uh but you can see here

994
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:06,039
like if you look at column one does my

995
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:07,960
mouse show up on this too yes it does

996
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:12,039
okay if you look over here you see we

997
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:14,599
tested Hall one Hall two dry cure the

998
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:16,519
attic area and the reason that Hall this

999
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:18,960
hallway was actually just one hallway

1000
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:20,358
but I took two tests at it because I one

1001
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,199
day when I was there I saw them

1002
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:25,920
transplanting cocoa because they didn't

1003
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:28,078
have any other available workspace and

1004
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,599
so they they have to do their work in

1005
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,920
the hallway and I was like I want to see

1006
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:33,480
if there's a difference because they're

1007
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:35,960
paying for the testing why not um I want

1008
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:37,920
to see is there a difference between the

1009
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:40,639
area that they work in and the area that

1010
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,480
they don't work in uh and then so you

1011
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:44,358
can see here like what it's listing is

1012
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:49,159
then it's listing the sample volumes so

1013
00:39:44,358 --> 00:39:51,639
we took 500 liters of air um and I don't

1014
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:53,279
think it has the time on here but you

1015
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:56,000
typically want to note how long of a

1016
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,560
sample you took so then you can see

1017
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,280
under the the fungal identification list

1018
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:03,599
this is all of the things that they were

1019
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:05,319
looking for if you have specifics in

1020
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:07,359
mind you know you can always mention

1021
00:40:05,318 --> 00:40:09,039
them to the lab and and they can make a

1022
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:11,920
note on it to add it to their list of

1023
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:14,079
things to look out for um because some

1024
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,480
molds are very industry specific you

1025
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:19,800
know so as you can see in Hall one we

1026
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:23,679
found five Colony forming units of of uh

1027
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:25,839
aspergillis Niger and then the other end

1028
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:27,960
that wasn't being used for transplanting

1029
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:30,559
we only found too but you can see where

1030
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:32,559
the concentration lies um and then we

1031
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:34,480
found some in their dry cure we found a

1032
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:36,279
little up in the attic you know which

1033
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,318
kind of says that maybe there was maybe

1034
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:41,599
a leak up there that might start be

1035
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:42,880
beginning to proliferate and then uh by

1036
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:44,519
the way for what it's worth this one

1037
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,039
down here cladosporium I don't think

1038
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:47,920
I've ever been in a facility that I've

1039
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:49,358
tested that's ever not had

1040
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,880
cladosporoides

1041
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:54,318
oh it's just a common plant pathogen

1042
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:55,800
it's it's everywhere here's where it got

1043
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:57,440
really interesting in this particular

1044
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:59,640
lab report for and this was what was eye

1045
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,039
opening was this one here is pen

1046
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:03,799
penicilium

1047
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:06,639
citrome and you can see here this is off

1048
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,560
the charts compared to aspergilus Niger

1049
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:13,159
right

1050
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:15,078
192 Colony forming units 302 102 300 I'm

1051
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:16,759
just going like what is this and where

1052
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:19,880
is it coming from because that's not why

1053
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:21,200
they called me to come in oh wow yeah

1054
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,920
they called me to come in about because

1055
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:24,199
they were failing for aspir gillus Niger

1056
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:26,559
and I was like well let's just see what

1057
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:28,000
this thing captures right and you could

1058
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:31,159
see they found a few other things like

1059
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,719
yeast colonies and and stuff like that I

1060
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:35,519
went to look back at this penicilium

1061
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:40,078
citrinum and discovered that it is a

1062
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:43,800
mold that is on uh decaying matter and

1063
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:45,960
um uh typically grain it it's found on

1064
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,920
grains like corn and rice and wheat and

1065
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,920
as I think i' mentioned earlier you know

1066
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,480
having a cereal factory nearby it turns

1067
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,280
out this is where I kind of came up with

1068
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,519
this realization and use it as a talking

1069
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:58,440
point was these guys because when I did

1070
00:41:55,519 --> 00:42:00,159
a Google over overhead search I

1071
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:02,960
discovered that they were like a quar

1072
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:06,759
mile downwind from a general Mill cereal

1073
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:08,440
processing Factory wow yeah and then at

1074
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:10,480
another point in time I took another

1075
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:12,480
test from the outside of the building

1076
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:16,838
and the penicilium

1077
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:18,519
Citron uh was just as elevated so you

1078
00:42:16,838 --> 00:42:20,358
know it's like that's the level of eye

1079
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:23,960
opening this because when you get like a

1080
00:42:20,358 --> 00:42:26,358
total yeast and mold count report like

1081
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:28,720
you want to know what total what the

1082
00:42:26,358 --> 00:42:32,318
yeasts and the molds are because that's

1083
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:35,078
going to be a key in being able to

1084
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:36,800
figure out the root cause of it you know

1085
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:38,920
what I mean so you know when you get

1086
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,800
your asparagus fagas as I said you know

1087
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:43,720
the biggest you know producer of it is

1088
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,960
our bedding and you know that might

1089
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:48,358
speak to like a cleanliness issue you

1090
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:52,159
know where like like a a facility

1091
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:54,239
culture hygiene culture issue you know

1092
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:55,838
um very easy for someone to scratch

1093
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:57,000
their head and then go back to touching

1094
00:42:55,838 --> 00:42:59,639
plant

1095
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,440
oh yeah people t or touch your phone or

1096
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:04,118
touch your pH yeah people do this stuff

1097
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:06,838
all the time yeah your phone has 25,000

1098
00:43:04,119 --> 00:43:08,240
microbes per square inch so everybody

1099
00:43:06,838 --> 00:43:09,679
that's watching make sure to sanitize

1100
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:12,118
your phone regularly that's what I'm

1101
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:13,598
saying yeah wipe it down I mean you know

1102
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:15,318
obviously best case scenario you leave

1103
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:17,039
it out uh leave it out of the critical

1104
00:43:15,318 --> 00:43:19,880
area but I understand that's not

1105
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:21,800
reflective of reality so it's like what

1106
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:24,680
are the measures that you can take some

1107
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:26,680
people will wipe down their phones right

1108
00:43:24,679 --> 00:43:29,480
some people will put it in a plas bag

1109
00:43:26,679 --> 00:43:31,279
like a ziplock bag for sure I'd be good

1110
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:34,039
with that you know because here's the

1111
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:37,720
other thing about like wiping down your

1112
00:43:34,039 --> 00:43:39,480
phones what is contact time right so

1113
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:42,000
contact time for those that don't know

1114
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:44,960
is the minimum amount of time that a

1115
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,960
disinfectant needs in order to achieve

1116
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,159
the

1117
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:50,159
eradication so if you're wiping down

1118
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:53,159
your phone and you just wipe it wipe it

1119
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:54,639
wipe it and uh you didn't necessarily

1120
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:56,558
like leave it wet for a certain amount

1121
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:58,440
of time or you took another tow and you

1122
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:00,240
dried it off you're not getting the full

1123
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,720
potential of that

1124
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:04,759
disinfectant so let's talk about alcohol

1125
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:06,519
because not alcohol all alcohol is

1126
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:09,000
created equal especially if you're

1127
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:10,759
sanitizing surfaces with alcohol which I

1128
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,679
would say that bleach is probably a lot

1129
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:15,599
better for hopl and viroid yes but uh as

1130
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:17,199
opposed to alcohol but I learned

1131
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,920
something from Peter McGuire a long time

1132
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:23,799
ago and it was the difference between

1133
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:26,440
90% And 70% yep um which I've used that

1134
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:28,559
over and over and over uh in in

1135
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:30,000
conversation but I think it's important

1136
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:32,480
thing for everybody to learn the

1137
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,239
difference 90% is great for cleaning

1138
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:38,240
your pipes and bongs all day right but

1139
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:40,919
like the reason that it's 90% alcohol is

1140
00:44:38,239 --> 00:44:44,519
because it's only 10% water so if you

1141
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:46,400
dumb down the alcohol uh to like 70% you

1142
00:44:44,519 --> 00:44:48,559
have 30% water which means that the

1143
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:51,639
cleansing agent takes longer to

1144
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:54,240
evaporate from the surface and there go

1145
00:44:51,639 --> 00:44:56,440
therego gives you more uh a longer

1146
00:44:54,239 --> 00:44:58,679
contact time for it to achieve the

1147
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:01,480
eradication because here's the fun thing

1148
00:44:58,679 --> 00:45:04,159
about you know contact time if you will

1149
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:06,920
is that you might read on a label that

1150
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:09,679
it says like spray and leave wet for 10

1151
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:12,519
minutes but you have to know how long it

1152
00:45:09,679 --> 00:45:14,440
takes for it to dry too because if you

1153
00:45:12,519 --> 00:45:15,960
spray it and walk away and go do

1154
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:17,318
something else and it hasn't met that

1155
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,440
contact time you're not again not

1156
00:45:17,318 --> 00:45:21,239
getting the Full Potential from that

1157
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:24,119
disinfectant so you actually would need

1158
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:26,558
to go back and wet it again you know

1159
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:28,079
like do a SE second application right

1160
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:31,200
that's the stuff that's all buried in

1161
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:34,079
the back on the labels and stuff so um I

1162
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:36,759
mean I I use that example all the time I

1163
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,920
mean here I just I have a canal Lysol

1164
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:39,880
right here right because I just carry

1165
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,760
can Lysol around that's what I do right

1166
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:44,760
on these labels here it literally says

1167
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:47,000
like you know for uh you know leave

1168
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:49,720
leave uh for SARS Co too on hard

1169
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,800
surfaces two minutes killed Roto virus

1170
00:45:49,719 --> 00:45:54,558
uh you know left wet for 30 seconds like

1171
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,519
so all of these things it depends on

1172
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:58,880
what you're trying to kill surface

1173
00:45:56,519 --> 00:46:01,639
contact time is so important yeah no

1174
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:04,200
absolutely absolutely and so uh you know

1175
00:46:01,639 --> 00:46:06,598
I'm a huge proponent of reading your

1176
00:46:04,199 --> 00:46:09,118
labels I'm a huge proponent of

1177
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:11,559
contacting manufacturers I get questions

1178
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:14,559
all the time like do you recommend this

1179
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:18,079
cleanser or this cleanser and it's

1180
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:20,359
like if you use them properly both of

1181
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:22,160
them should work yeah you know as well

1182
00:46:20,358 --> 00:46:23,838
if you use them properly and they're

1183
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:27,318
designed to kill the thing you're trying

1184
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:29,078
to kill then they should both do the job

1185
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:32,639
so but then I always tell people I'm

1186
00:46:29,079 --> 00:46:35,640
like call the manufacturer I assure you

1187
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:37,279
a a a a disinfected manufacturer

1188
00:46:35,639 --> 00:46:39,159
definitely wants to speak to their

1189
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,599
customers because they want to make sure

1190
00:46:39,159 --> 00:46:42,759
that their customers are using their

1191
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:44,800
product correctly that they're using it

1192
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:46,960
often so that they can sell you more of

1193
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,640
it you know and they they want to make

1194
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:51,119
sure you are as knowledgeable as

1195
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:52,480
possible on their product yeah and most

1196
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:55,440
of them have pretty good customer

1197
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,639
service yeah as they should and you know

1198
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,720
and I can could tell you like here in

1199
00:46:56,639 --> 00:47:01,879
cannabis like man customer service is

1200
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:03,759
key you know I mean people in cannabis

1201
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:05,640
aren't used to customer service though I

1202
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,400
think like uh you you have a problem

1203
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:08,679
with your weed or who grew your weed or

1204
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,440
whatever you have questions about it a

1205
00:47:08,679 --> 00:47:13,159
lot of times Instagram you might you

1206
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:14,599
might be able to get a reply but you

1207
00:47:13,159 --> 00:47:17,480
know back in the Legacy years that was

1208
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:20,200
all there was yeah I get it and and it's

1209
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:21,960
like you know and the other thing is is

1210
00:47:20,199 --> 00:47:23,399
like you know remember I speak primarily

1211
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:27,519
to cultivators but you know and

1212
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:32,519
cultivators like have historically been

1213
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:35,920
big fish in their Pond you know

1214
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:38,119
and I mean when I was growing I like the

1215
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,599
Sinatra treatment you know who doesn't

1216
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:43,440
like the Sinatra treatment just in life

1217
00:47:40,599 --> 00:47:45,680
you know and so it's like if these

1218
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:48,119
Growers you know that I speak to on a

1219
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:50,558
day-to-day basis they feel like I know

1220
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:53,358
what I'm talking about they feel like I

1221
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:55,280
I I can answer their questions and that

1222
00:47:53,358 --> 00:47:59,159
I pick up the phone and I'm prompt in my

1223
00:47:55,280 --> 00:48:01,960
response to them like it's it says

1224
00:47:59,159 --> 00:48:04,598
worlds to like building trust you know I

1225
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:07,720
mean because you know I I I I'll say

1226
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:09,519
that it's one thing to get into a

1227
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:11,159
facility and get a bunch of filters up

1228
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:14,039
on the walls and in the ceilings and

1229
00:48:11,159 --> 00:48:16,039
stuff like that but that's not much of a

1230
00:48:14,039 --> 00:48:18,000
career where the career comes in is

1231
00:48:16,039 --> 00:48:19,759
helping these guys get to all the other

1232
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,199
questions that are related to microb

1233
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:25,400
control outside of my filter and that

1234
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:28,439
way they scale and expand to site number

1235
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:30,358
two two and then site number three and

1236
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:31,838
then they recommend me to their friends

1237
00:48:30,358 --> 00:48:34,400
and then now I'm starting to get into

1238
00:48:31,838 --> 00:48:37,078
their Network and you know all for just

1239
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:39,318
being this guy that's like trying to be

1240
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:41,039
of help you know in a day and age where

1241
00:48:39,318 --> 00:48:43,759
if you have a problem with Instagram you

1242
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:45,480
can't call Instagram no you know you're

1243
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:47,760
the prodct they make it near impossible

1244
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:50,039
meta makes it near impossible to contact

1245
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,520
them you know it's there's there's ways

1246
00:48:50,039 --> 00:48:53,199
to contact them and you know through

1247
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:54,599
through chat you're a pain Advertiser

1248
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:56,199
they're more apt to talk to you but

1249
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:57,920
remember like I said the users of

1250
00:48:56,199 --> 00:49:01,000
Instagram are the product that's what

1251
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:02,519
they sell right so as far as from a

1252
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,760
customer service standpoint if my

1253
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:07,159
account got flaggs because I can't get

1254
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:10,200
shown to non-followers you know because

1255
00:49:07,159 --> 00:49:13,199
my content is a little you know toes the

1256
00:49:10,199 --> 00:49:16,000
line of good taste let's say that racy

1257
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:19,558
yeah little racy

1258
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:21,239
right we can talk about that ver like

1259
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:24,440
that's the one thing I noticed is that I

1260
00:49:21,239 --> 00:49:27,439
love this industry because low brow

1261
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:30,119
humor goes really are for sure you know

1262
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:32,400
what I mean and so I'm in the business

1263
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:35,160
of talking about [ __ ] that's difficult

1264
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:39,039
to explain and isn't very interesting to

1265
00:49:35,159 --> 00:49:42,399
learn so but you have to know it so it's

1266
00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:46,639
like what's the way that I can make it

1267
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:50,318
palatable you know so if I throw a dick

1268
00:49:46,639 --> 00:49:53,078
joke in and yet the text underneath it

1269
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:55,159
actually teaches you something I at

1270
00:49:53,079 --> 00:49:57,440
least you know that's the the the photos

1271
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:59,399
you see see in my feed are like more to

1272
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,559
generate the shock and awe to get you to

1273
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:03,119
look I mean obviously they're tied to

1274
00:50:01,559 --> 00:50:06,000
whatever I want to talk about in the

1275
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:07,838
post that you know in the text right but

1276
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,639
but at the end of the day like yeah I

1277
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:13,880
mean I'm you know social media is this

1278
00:50:11,639 --> 00:50:15,358
river right think of it as a stream and

1279
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:17,000
if you're standing at the shore

1280
00:50:15,358 --> 00:50:18,318
everything's going past you and if

1281
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,798
you're not somebody's not standing at

1282
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:22,960
the shore at the moment your information

1283
00:50:19,798 --> 00:50:24,280
goes by they miss it you know and so you

1284
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,079
know that's where the hashtags come in

1285
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:28,079
and bl blahy blue but

1286
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:31,079
my my point in saying that is is it's

1287
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:33,720
like it softens the blow you know what

1288
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:35,240
I'm saying in the sense of like this

1289
00:50:33,719 --> 00:50:37,279
level of information can be really

1290
00:50:35,239 --> 00:50:39,118
intimidating for some people and yeah

1291
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,359
but let's M make education fun that's

1292
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,680
what we're doing here today you know I

1293
00:50:40,358 --> 00:50:43,960
feel like we're we're trying to make

1294
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:46,118
education fun and there's no reason

1295
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:48,039
education and learning shouldn't be fun

1296
00:50:46,119 --> 00:50:50,039
I completely agree and and not only that

1297
00:50:48,039 --> 00:50:52,599
but you're going to retain it more yeah

1298
00:50:50,039 --> 00:50:55,000
you know uh the retention level is huge

1299
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:56,760
like you know I get uh I get people that

1300
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,079

00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:15,280
last they can and sometimes it has but

1307
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:17,200
you know I've gotten a couple of I'm

1308

1311
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:28,358
yeah right right exactly but um we

1312
00:51:26,318 --> 00:51:31,318
sensitive time these days you know it is

1313
00:51:28,358 --> 00:51:33,960
what it is you know but I I I definitely

1314
00:51:31,318 --> 00:51:36,279
know that like the core of of the

1315
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:38,079
industry loves having a good time

1316
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:41,599
because you know the entire industry is

1317
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:44,240
rooted in you know I mean I don't know

1318
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:46,240
like I just don't get sad in smoke weed

1319

1323
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:56,000
you know and I believe it makes the

1324
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:57,519
world a better place I believe people

1325
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,760
are in better moods because of it you

1326
00:51:57,519 --> 00:52:02,239
know oh sure no absolutely I I you know

1327
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:04,799
I mean I've seen it firsthand with the

1328
00:52:02,239 --> 00:52:07,479
effects of of you know from a medicinal

1329
00:52:04,798 --> 00:52:11,000
standpoint from people who have like you

1330
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:12,599
know seen an ease in symptoms like uh I

1331
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,480
mean I tell you when I was at Spectrum

1332
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:17,200
King I had a I had a boss who had two

1333
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:19,519
bad knees he needed two knee replacement

1334
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:20,759
surgeries and he wasn't getting them for

1335
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:23,480
one reason or another a whole other

1336
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:26,760
story but what I can tell you is that my

1337
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:30,318
uncle here in Michigan makes a Sav out

1338
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:32,480
of his plants and everybody swears by it

1339
00:52:30,318 --> 00:52:36,039
and he sent me some and I gave it to my

1340
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:38,358
boss and he's like get me more yeah

1341
00:52:36,039 --> 00:52:40,039
please get me more I mean you know and

1342
00:52:38,358 --> 00:52:42,558
he's like listen you know my my pain

1343
00:52:40,039 --> 00:52:46,519
didn't go away completely but it went

1344
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:49,680
from a nine to like a three wow yeah

1345
00:52:46,519 --> 00:52:52,119
exactly exactly I mean you know I I I'm

1346
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:54,879
a big fan of of of you know there's not

1347
00:52:52,119 --> 00:52:57,119
enough research is what it comes down to

1348
00:52:54,880 --> 00:53:00,200
no and I think we have a stack of

1349
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:02,480
anecdotal proof and we have a stack of

1350
00:53:00,199 --> 00:53:05,118
we're starting to get a stack of actual

1351
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:07,798
you know white papers and proof on that

1352
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:10,240
level um and I think like you know you

1353
00:53:07,798 --> 00:53:13,358
would watch sanj Gupta on 60 Minutes and

1354
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:17,358
there's a kid that he gets cured of his

1355
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:20,759
uh seizures from from THC or CBD or you

1356
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:22,239
know any of these cannaboids I mean how

1357
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:25,760
can you argue with a parent that wants

1358
00:53:22,239 --> 00:53:27,838
to keep their kid healthy and you know I

1359
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:29,040
just it's it's so hard to argue the fact

1360
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:31,759
and the fact that it's still schedule

1361
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:33,639
one is kind of crazy too oh completely I

1362
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:35,160
mean you know I done that that that that

1363
00:53:33,639 --> 00:53:37,118
whole story goes back to like paper

1364
00:53:35,159 --> 00:53:38,960
mills and yellow journalism of like the

1365
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:41,440
20s and 30s or whatever it was and the

1366
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:43,559
reer madness days where they demonized

1367
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:46,480
everything for social or corporate

1368
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:48,200
interests you know and I mean I I I seem

1369
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,480
to remember like historically wasn't

1370
00:53:48,199 --> 00:53:51,558
there some period of time where like

1371
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:53,760
every American Farmer was required to

1372
00:53:51,559 --> 00:53:55,798
grow some sort of section of hemp on

1373
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,720
their Farm

1374
00:53:55,798 --> 00:53:59,759
I seem to remember that was a thing like

1375
00:53:57,719 --> 00:54:01,919
in the George Washington

1376
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,760
days makes a lot of sense I think we

1377
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:06,440
should go back to those ways I

1378
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:08,520
completely agree I mean you know I you

1379
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:10,639
know I mean smoking it aside you know

1380
00:54:08,519 --> 00:54:12,559
yeah you get more paper per hectare you

1381
00:54:10,639 --> 00:54:15,318
get oils you get all sorts of other

1382
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:17,319
usable things remediation for soil uh

1383
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:20,119
the fact is it produces a lot more

1384
00:54:17,318 --> 00:54:22,679
oxygen than trees do there there's all

1385
00:54:20,119 --> 00:54:25,440
kinds of benefits yeah no completely and

1386
00:54:22,679 --> 00:54:27,159
so you know uh so from that stand I

1387
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,519
think it's it's a sad State of Affairs

1388
00:54:27,159 --> 00:54:30,960
that there's not enough research but as

1389
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:32,599
I understand it if it does go to

1390
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,480
schedule of three that that will open up

1391
00:54:32,599 --> 00:54:36,318
the door for a lot more of that research

1392
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,440
because the Laboratories that can work

1393
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:40,440
with those that level of study will now

1394
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:42,798
have access to that is that well

1395
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:44,798
schedule three is a scary thing right so

1396
00:54:42,798 --> 00:54:47,079
I'm I'm All About descheduling not

1397
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:48,358
rescheduling and I think the last three

1398
00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:50,280
episodes we've talked about the

1399
00:54:48,358 --> 00:54:52,719
deschedule not reschedule because a

1400
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:56,119
second you make it a schedule three drug

1401
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:57,838
what happens to the wreck Market true

1402
00:54:56,119 --> 00:55:00,280
you know and I think there's a lot of

1403
00:54:57,838 --> 00:55:03,519
unanswered questions like I I understand

1404
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:05,160
that you know as as a alcohol and

1405
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:06,599
tobacco are controlled substances we

1406
00:55:05,159 --> 00:55:09,318
should have it as a controlled substance

1407
00:55:06,599 --> 00:55:10,798
but as far as like the fact that they

1408
00:55:09,318 --> 00:55:13,400
want to turn it into a schedule three

1409
00:55:10,798 --> 00:55:16,318
drug I'm not a huge fan I think we need

1410
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:16,318
to deschedule it

1411
00:55:16,679 --> 00:55:21,960
completely yeah no I mean and I I would

1412
00:55:20,239 --> 00:55:24,159
say so too there's no reason it should

1413
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:25,960
have ever been so in the first place you

1414
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:30,078
know

1415
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:34,159
so yeah yeah but uh anyway so so yeah I

1416
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:36,039
mean from a from a to get people to that

1417
00:55:34,159 --> 00:55:38,519
place where there's

1418
00:55:36,039 --> 00:55:40,839
consistently you know clean product on

1419
00:55:38,519 --> 00:55:44,519
the market it's like it's just requiring

1420
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:46,639
that you go to a place of you know being

1421
00:55:44,519 --> 00:55:50,038
able to analyze your environment and

1422
00:55:46,639 --> 00:55:52,400
being able to uh you know take small

1423
00:55:50,039 --> 00:55:55,520
mitigation risks uh mitigate or

1424
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:57,240
eliminate risks within the facility so

1425
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:58,920
from that standpoint you know it's not

1426
00:55:57,239 --> 00:56:02,199
even just about putting a magic box up

1427
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:04,119
in the ceiling uh before you you know uh

1428
00:56:02,199 --> 00:56:06,239
operate it's about you know what kind of

1429
00:56:04,119 --> 00:56:09,440
mops are you using um you know what kind

1430
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:11,358
of gowning are you doing uh what kind of

1431
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:13,039
uh you know uh like are you fixing your

1432
00:56:11,358 --> 00:56:14,199
cracks in your floors and your windows

1433
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:16,520
and what have

1434
00:56:14,199 --> 00:56:18,558
you you know those types of questions

1435
00:56:16,519 --> 00:56:19,599
like all those other risks things that

1436
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:23,440
fall under

1437
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:26,280
GMP right for sure it's funny with the

1438
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:28,000
filter uh we had the option of either

1439
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:30,240
putting it hidden up in the ceiling or

1440
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,880
putting it so that we can see it and I

1441
00:56:30,239 --> 00:56:33,118
feel like I want to see it so I want to

1442
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:35,119
be able to talk about it when people

1443
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:37,519
come in the building I I just you guys

1444
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:39,480
are designed to make it look nice too

1445
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:41,599
thank you no I appreciate that and and

1446
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:44,639
yeah it it the nice part about it is it

1447
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:47,200
does come on uh um you know casters so

1448
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:48,598
you can wheel it around if you want uh

1449
00:56:47,199 --> 00:56:50,358
we do have hardware for you to be able

1450
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:53,079
to mount it to the ceiling mounted to a

1451
00:56:50,358 --> 00:56:56,440
wall you know what have you I mean you

1452
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:59,400
know uh ceiling in floor real estate in

1453
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:02,838
a in a cultivation facility is pretty uh

1454
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:05,039
pretty premium you know so to be able to

1455
00:57:02,838 --> 00:57:06,519
find the balance of the size of a unit

1456
00:57:05,039 --> 00:57:09,240
that you can work with that puts out

1457
00:57:06,519 --> 00:57:12,079
enough air flow for it to be worth it

1458
00:57:09,239 --> 00:57:14,959
that you know still has uh efficacy in

1459
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:16,720
its process right and to be able to you

1460
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:19,199
know they like I mean full disclosure

1461
00:57:16,719 --> 00:57:22,279
you know you know we are an h13 HEPA

1462
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:25,279
filter right h14

1463
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:26,880
exists but you lose air flow so there's

1464
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:29,079
a little bit of give and take it's sort

1465
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:31,640
of like you know even going into the

1466
00:57:29,079 --> 00:57:34,359
facilities like just their native HVAC

1467
00:57:31,639 --> 00:57:36,519
systems you know um there's something

1468
00:57:34,358 --> 00:57:37,920
called the Merv rating system for air

1469
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:39,920
filters some people don't know what it

1470
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:43,119
is it stands for minimum efficiency

1471
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:45,240
reporting value and what it is is it's

1472
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:48,119
sort of a standard expectation of

1473
00:57:45,239 --> 00:57:51,118
performance for that filter so and it's

1474
00:57:48,119 --> 00:57:55,079
given a number so like for example uh a

1475
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:57,838
Merv 13 filter will remove 90% of one

1476
00:57:55,079 --> 00:58:00,280
micron and larger particles whereas a

1477
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:02,599
Merv 8 filter will only capture about

1478
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:04,079
60% or something like that in fact do I

1479
00:58:02,599 --> 00:58:07,798
have a mve chart I might actually have a

1480
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:09,519
mve chart here I do how do you know um

1481
00:58:07,798 --> 00:58:13,639
you can actually see it but here's the

1482
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:17,599
joke of it or the the give and take is

1483
00:58:13,639 --> 00:58:20,480
the the higher you go up in uh mve

1484
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:22,680
rating yeah you get better filtration

1485
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:25,159
performance your Mechanicals for your

1486
00:58:22,679 --> 00:58:28,639
HVAC have to work a lot harder in order

1487
00:58:25,159 --> 00:58:32,879
to push air through so the it the

1488
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:34,519
efficiency pops out because if your HVAC

1489
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:36,280
system can't support the heavier

1490
00:58:34,519 --> 00:58:37,559
weighted filter because it can't move

1491
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:40,160
the air through it you're going to

1492
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:42,280
experience cooling capacity issues

1493
00:58:40,159 --> 00:58:45,318
you're going to experience um you know

1494
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:47,280
stress on your HVAC system you know

1495
00:58:45,318 --> 00:58:49,239
those types of things and so that's

1496
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,960
where filter kind of comes in to just

1497
00:58:49,239 --> 00:58:56,439
directly attach uh attack the particle

1498
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:59,159
problem so we don't cying into HVAC I

1499
00:58:56,440 --> 00:59:01,358
don't even suggest it as a bypass I'm

1500
00:58:59,159 --> 00:59:04,480
just like just you put it in the room

1501
00:59:01,358 --> 00:59:06,558
let it recirculate its own air and let

1502
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:08,760
the HVAC do its thing and we're

1503
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:09,880
basically supplementing the filtration

1504
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:12,799
because you know when people are

1505
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:14,318
specking in HVAC in their plan more

1506
00:59:12,798 --> 00:59:17,199
often than not they're factoring for

1507
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:21,000
cooling capacity versus you know

1508
00:59:17,199 --> 00:59:22,480
particle filtration I get it yeah so

1509
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,199
with that said it's like I'm not going

1510
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,760
to tell you to like rip out and replace

1511
00:59:24,199 --> 00:59:28,759
hundreds of thousands of dollars worth

1512
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:30,119
of HVAC equipment I'll tell you to put

1513
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:31,799
hundreds of thousands of dollars worth

1514
00:59:30,119 --> 00:59:35,160
of filters in there right no I'm kidding

1515
00:59:31,798 --> 00:59:36,639
huh absolutely that's great but no I

1516
00:59:35,159 --> 00:59:39,519
mean at the end of the day though it's

1517
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:42,480
like you know it not only can you can

1518
00:59:39,519 --> 00:59:44,159
you uh immediately test filtration so

1519
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:46,240
that's the cool part about versus like a

1520
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:47,798
lot of the other guys that that that are

1521
00:59:46,239 --> 00:59:50,038
out there the other types of

1522
00:59:47,798 --> 00:59:51,880
Technologies is that I can put a

1523
00:59:50,039 --> 00:59:53,920
particle counter on the bottom I can put

1524
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:57,280
a particle counter on the top and I can

1525
00:59:53,920 --> 01:00:00,159
demonstrate efficacy in real time you

1526
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:02,798
know what I mean so like uh in fact

1527
01:00:00,159 --> 01:00:05,519
would you know it uh I might actually

1528
01:00:02,798 --> 01:00:07,559
have that handy here and uh let's see

1529
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:09,519
here let me see if I can open this up

1530
01:00:07,559 --> 01:00:11,680
and share it with you but I can

1531
01:00:09,519 --> 01:00:13,559
literally uh yeah there it is let me

1532
01:00:11,679 --> 01:00:15,159
share share screen has stopped as the

1533
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:17,798
share windows closed okay cool well

1534
01:00:15,159 --> 01:00:20,159
we're gonna share it again uh here we go

1535
01:00:17,798 --> 01:00:22,838
so let me let me roll it back here for a

1536
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:25,118
second just to keep you in suspense here

1537
01:00:22,838 --> 01:00:27,279
so we got a filter unit here and you can

1538
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:30,079
see we put a particle counter on one

1539
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:31,880
side and you can see those numbers are

1540
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:33,760
counting and you can see the time clock

1541
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:36,280
in the bottom right where it's counting

1542
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:38,280
seconds so you know it's running show

1543
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:40,680
you the rest of the filter unit and then

1544
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:42,500
we come to the output with a particle

1545
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:43,679
counter running

1546
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:48,559
[Music]

1547
01:00:43,679 --> 01:00:50,199
and all zeros so I can prove that this

1548
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:53,200
thing is actually doing something in

1549
01:00:50,199 --> 01:00:54,838
real time versus a lot of other

1550
01:00:53,199 --> 01:00:56,239
companies that are out there that you

1551
01:00:54,838 --> 01:00:58,838
know where you would have to do a lot of

1552
01:00:56,239 --> 01:01:01,118
testing of the room in order to be able

1553
01:00:58,838 --> 01:01:04,400
to understand if this thing's actually

1554
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:07,318
doing something and well my my buds past

1555
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:09,079
testing is anecdotal but not very

1556
01:01:07,318 --> 01:01:11,159
scientific

1557
01:01:09,079 --> 01:01:13,440
right I

1558
01:01:11,159 --> 01:01:15,159
mean yeah yeah but it's a beautiful

1559
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:18,318
world we live in where we can test this

1560
01:01:15,159 --> 01:01:20,440
stuff yeah I agree I I yeah the level of

1561
01:01:18,318 --> 01:01:22,920
Awakening to like all of these little

1562
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:24,559
facets is you know at the same time

1563
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:27,358
while it's cool it definitely makes the

1564
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:30,640
industry a lot more complicated you know

1565
01:01:27,358 --> 01:01:34,719
um but at at the end of the day you know

1566
01:01:30,639 --> 01:01:36,000
it's like so many people take pride in

1567
01:01:34,719 --> 01:01:38,639
their

1568
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,519
process and oftentimes you don't

1569
01:01:38,639 --> 01:01:43,519
necessarily know if the cleaning that

1570
01:01:40,519 --> 01:01:46,759
you're doing is actually cleaning so for

1571
01:01:43,519 --> 01:01:49,239
example uh and a device common in food

1572
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:51,359
manufacturing it's called an ATP meter

1573
01:01:49,239 --> 01:01:54,879
have you heard of one you familiar with

1574
01:01:51,358 --> 01:01:57,000
those no I mean I know what ATP is yeah

1575
01:01:54,880 --> 01:02:00,640
righto triphosphate or something like

1576
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:03,798
that right endine triphosphate okay so

1577
01:02:00,639 --> 01:02:06,118
an ATP meter is basically like every

1578
01:02:03,798 --> 01:02:07,278
living cell produces bioluminescence

1579
01:02:06,119 --> 01:02:08,559
sort of like you know when you go to the

1580
01:02:07,278 --> 01:02:10,079
beach at certain times of year and you

1581
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:12,359
kick the water and it turns blue because

1582
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:16,200
of all the algae right bioluminescent

1583
01:02:12,358 --> 01:02:18,000
algae um or whatever animal or thing is

1584
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:20,639
making that bioluminescent so everything

1585
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:23,039
has a natural level of bioluminesence so

1586
01:02:20,639 --> 01:02:25,118
this ATP meter is like roughly the size

1587
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:27,278
of like a large cell phone maybe twice

1588
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:28,960
as thick about that size and it comes

1589
01:02:27,278 --> 01:02:31,358
with you buy a bunch of sticks where you

1590
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:33,119
break off the end and you swab it on a

1591
01:02:31,358 --> 01:02:35,440
surface and then you put it in the

1592
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:38,039
device and it spits out a number and

1593
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:40,559
that's the what what it's calculating is

1594
01:02:38,039 --> 01:02:43,720
how much bioluminescence is reflected

1595
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:45,319
back wow so in other words like let's

1596
01:02:43,719 --> 01:02:47,759
say you're at a cookie factory and you

1597
01:02:45,318 --> 01:02:50,159
want to test your conveyor belt you know

1598
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:53,079
you can you can uh test it beforehand

1599
01:02:50,159 --> 01:02:55,318
you get what's called an rli relative

1600
01:02:53,079 --> 01:02:57,278
light indicator relative Light number

1601
01:02:55,318 --> 01:02:59,599
I'm not familiar with them too deeply

1602
01:02:57,278 --> 01:03:02,159
but you get a number that it spits out

1603
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:04,278
and then you execute your cleaning sop

1604
01:03:02,159 --> 01:03:06,679
and then you test it again and if you

1605
01:03:04,278 --> 01:03:10,318
see a lower number that's a validation

1606
01:03:06,679 --> 01:03:12,558
that you've cleaned right and that's you

1607
01:03:10,318 --> 01:03:13,960
know a big misconception is because a

1608
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:17,160
lot of people walk into a room and

1609
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:19,559
they're like smells clean smells really

1610
01:03:17,159 --> 01:03:21,239
clean in here but it's like in some

1611
01:03:19,559 --> 01:03:22,519
cases that could just be fragrance that

1612
01:03:21,239 --> 01:03:25,439
the

1613
01:03:22,519 --> 01:03:29,000
manufactur could be

1614
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:33,639
yeah exactly exactly right so um you

1615
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:35,838
know it really does take the ability to

1616
01:03:33,639 --> 01:03:37,679
you know validate it but I don't know

1617
01:03:35,838 --> 01:03:40,038
that cannabis is necessarily there yet

1618
01:03:37,679 --> 01:03:41,919
like Pharma manufacturing is very much

1619
01:03:40,039 --> 01:03:43,319
there they live and die by validation

1620
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:45,680
every claim they make they have to be

1621
01:03:43,318 --> 01:03:49,400
able to validate and that includes

1622
01:03:45,679 --> 01:03:52,679
cleaning um you know and and that and

1623
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:54,639
you know following specific like Sops

1624
01:03:52,679 --> 01:03:57,719
you know standard operating procedure

1625
01:03:54,639 --> 01:04:00,078
are are becoming quite popular I get a

1626
01:03:57,719 --> 01:04:02,838
lot of requests for people to you know

1627
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:05,318
from people to write them and I know hom

1628
01:04:02,838 --> 01:04:06,880
Growers that write Sops for themselves

1629
01:04:05,318 --> 01:04:08,920
you know I don't you know what's funny I

1630
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:11,160
don't write Sops I I mean like high

1631
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:14,559
level I do but like I write Sops for

1632
01:04:11,159 --> 01:04:18,598
other people as a service just well

1633
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:20,760
simply because you know when you're um

1634
01:04:18,599 --> 01:04:21,880
you have to observe somebody's process

1635
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:24,200
you know what I mean there's not

1636
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:26,599
necessarily like some Cookie Cutter Way

1637
01:04:24,199 --> 01:04:29,679
spoiler play sop it's so customed to the

1638
01:04:26,599 --> 01:04:31,278
individual environment U you know it's

1639
01:04:29,679 --> 01:04:33,480
it's an amazing thing too if you get it

1640
01:04:31,278 --> 01:04:35,519
down right I can tell you this while

1641
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:39,440
there's like a million different ways to

1642
01:04:35,519 --> 01:04:42,079
do something um the formatting is is

1643
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:45,079
where I think that you're GNA win you

1644
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:46,680
know what I mean so like for instance uh

1645
01:04:45,079 --> 01:04:48,200
uh is this the SOP training template

1646
01:04:46,679 --> 01:04:50,639
this is the SOP training template so

1647
01:04:48,199 --> 01:04:53,439
watch this madness here where is it here

1648
01:04:50,639 --> 01:04:55,159
we go so what I did was a while back I

1649
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:57,960
did a webinar it's available on the

1650
01:04:55,159 --> 01:05:00,358
filter uh YouTube page and what I did

1651
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:04,798
was I did a webinar on building

1652
01:05:00,358 --> 01:05:07,078
Sops and building Sops from a Pharma and

1653
01:05:04,798 --> 01:05:09,199
food manufacturing standpoint so I took

1654
01:05:07,079 --> 01:05:10,839
what they do and just put it in a

1655
01:05:09,199 --> 01:05:13,960
template that makes everything very easy

1656
01:05:10,838 --> 01:05:15,798
to understand so and we ran through all

1657
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:18,760
the different various parts so you you

1658
01:05:15,798 --> 01:05:20,719
know in in Pharma sop writing um they

1659
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:23,119
have these very specific Parts they have

1660
01:05:20,719 --> 01:05:24,838
the scope you know which defines what

1661
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:26,880
the where the procedure applies within

1662
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:28,759
the overall operation of the facility

1663
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:31,240
because people want to know well how

1664
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:33,039
does what I'm doing fit into the process

1665
01:05:31,239 --> 01:05:35,959
or the purpose what's the purpose of

1666
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:38,240
doing this thing this way you know um

1667
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:40,519
any specific definitions who's in charge

1668
01:05:38,239 --> 01:05:42,199
of what what materials are you going to

1669
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:44,239
need not just cleaning materials and

1670
01:05:42,199 --> 01:05:46,558
Equipment but like do you need safety

1671
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:48,759
gear do you need like ladders and you

1672
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:50,880
know pole extendable poles and what have

1673
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:52,400
you you know and then you finally get to

1674
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:54,880
the procedure where you actually list

1675
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:56,720
out the steps if you have references

1676
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:58,559
that you want to to include with there

1677
01:05:56,719 --> 01:06:00,358
you do that too and then you know

1678
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:02,440
there's a validation and sign off

1679
01:06:00,358 --> 01:06:06,639
section and again you know like cannabis

1680
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:08,278
isn't as huge on validating yet um but I

1681
01:06:06,639 --> 01:06:10,118
can tell you this that if it's not

1682
01:06:08,278 --> 01:06:13,760
documented it didn't

1683
01:06:10,119 --> 01:06:15,079
happen right you know so I have to tell

1684
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:16,920
people as well I'm like you need to

1685
01:06:15,079 --> 01:06:20,119
start getting down on documenting

1686
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:21,720
documenting everything you do you know

1687
01:06:20,119 --> 01:06:23,039
because everything who cleans the

1688
01:06:21,719 --> 01:06:25,038
bathroom and when do they clean it I

1689
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:26,440
mean I those are little things but

1690
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:29,160
they're super important believe it or

1691
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:30,440
not absolutely and you know here's the

1692
01:06:29,159 --> 01:06:32,440
thing it's it's not even just

1693
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:34,318
necessarily from a day-to-day operation

1694
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:37,119
standpoint yeah what happens if you have

1695
01:06:34,318 --> 01:06:39,000
a recall what happens if you get sued by

1696
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:40,760
an employee who got hurt at your

1697
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:43,318
facility or something like that or got

1698
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:45,400
sick at your facility we we heard about

1699
01:06:43,318 --> 01:06:47,480
a case in Massachusetts right we all we

1700
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:49,200
all kind of got familiar with that one

1701
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:50,920
and that had some special nuances to it

1702
01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:53,798
and it's unfortunate that it happened

1703
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:54,798
but at the end of the day um you know

1704
01:06:53,798 --> 01:06:58,318
it's

1705
01:06:54,798 --> 01:07:00,599
it's to be able to to document

1706
01:06:58,318 --> 01:07:02,838
everything you did can actually in fact

1707
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:06,000
provide you a legal defense in certain

1708
01:07:02,838 --> 01:07:08,679
situations absolutely you know if if you

1709
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,679
can sit there and say like you know yes

1710
01:07:08,679 --> 01:07:12,399
this happened to this person but it's

1711
01:07:10,679 --> 01:07:14,318
not like we've been doing nothing we

1712
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:16,838
have this diligent particle monitoring

1713
01:07:14,318 --> 01:07:18,599
program a diligent air sampling program

1714
01:07:16,838 --> 01:07:20,000
we document every time we clean

1715
01:07:18,599 --> 01:07:21,838
something and every time we change

1716
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,318
something and then at least it gives you

1717
01:07:21,838 --> 01:07:26,920
some sort of plausible defense around

1718
01:07:24,318 --> 01:07:29,199
like versus you know just you're just

1719
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:31,960
growing Backyard Boogie indoors and you

1720
01:07:29,199 --> 01:07:33,399
got my client sick or some people don't

1721
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:35,920
document stuff because they want

1722
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:37,240
plausible deniability as well so if you

1723
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:39,318
want to do it the right way then

1724
01:07:37,239 --> 01:07:42,639
document it if you don't then whatever

1725
01:07:39,318 --> 01:07:44,358
but documenting is the way to go I mean

1726
01:07:42,639 --> 01:07:45,920
especially it doesn't matter whether

1727
01:07:44,358 --> 01:07:47,400
you're breeding or whether you're doing

1728
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:49,358
tissue culture or whether you're doing

1729
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:51,039
cultivation if you want to improve what

1730
01:07:49,358 --> 01:07:53,119
you're doing documentation is where it's

1731
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:54,480
found you you find the the ways and the

1732
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:56,358
paths to improve what you're doing

1733
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:58,480
through documentation right who kept the

1734
01:07:56,358 --> 01:08:00,440
grow Journal I kept the grow Journal

1735
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:02,599
right you you kept the grow Journal why

1736
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:04,318
and some of it was just simply as basic

1737
01:08:02,599 --> 01:08:05,880
as you wanted to remember what you did

1738
01:08:04,318 --> 01:08:08,558
last time so that if it worked you could

1739
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:10,680
do it again for sure you know well I

1740
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:13,000
always changed recipes so often in the

1741
01:08:10,679 --> 01:08:14,358
beginning when I was learning stuff I

1742
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,679
was always changing stuff around and

1743
01:08:14,358 --> 01:08:17,960
there were these really complicated

1744
01:08:15,679 --> 01:08:21,798
recipes and way way more than what I

1745
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:23,480
would do now for cultivation but right

1746
01:08:21,798 --> 01:08:25,679
yeah when you're just buy like what like

1747
01:08:23,479 --> 01:08:28,639
seven different liquids and like most of

1748
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:30,239
them are yeah most of them are 95% water

1749
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:33,000
anyway

1750
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:36,759
seriously you know but I'll tell you

1751
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:39,039
know and and and I will say that um you

1752
01:08:36,759 --> 01:08:41,640
know simplifying things making things

1753
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:43,039
easier mcging your way around things

1754
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:44,880
like just because I'm telling people to

1755
01:08:43,039 --> 01:08:46,560
live between food and Pharma doesn't

1756
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:49,880
necessarily mean you have to spend

1757
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:52,279
Pharma money to get there right you know

1758
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:53,480
I mean but you got to have the knowledge

1759
01:08:52,279 --> 01:08:54,799
that's the one thing you got to have the

1760
01:08:53,479 --> 01:08:57,000
knowledge to know what you need to

1761
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:59,640
change you know and and you have to be

1762
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:01,719
able to be willing to look at yourself

1763
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:03,359
like hold the mirror up to your process

1764
01:09:01,719 --> 01:09:05,319
and be willing to go okay this is not

1765
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:07,440
working right cut the ego out and

1766
01:09:05,319 --> 01:09:10,120
actually look at it you know from an

1767
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:12,198
outside perspective I just said that

1768
01:09:10,119 --> 01:09:14,880
today to a client I was at a site visit

1769
01:09:12,198 --> 01:09:17,838
earlier today and I was like you know

1770
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:20,960
there is a distinct lack of CEO training

1771
01:09:17,838 --> 01:09:22,640
in this industry you know um because I I

1772
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:24,158
I kind of find it disturbing sometimes

1773
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:26,560
because like I'm seing as like like

Ultra Clean guy and really in my reality

1775
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:31,759
I'm like I'm a pig but like as soon as I

1776
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:33,719
get to the facility door as soon as I

1777
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:35,600
get to the facility door that's like you

1778

01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:44,798
I also have to be able to live it

1782

yeah I get it I I'm I'm definitely the

1794
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:16,879
killjoy of of the industry sometimes you

1795
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:21,520
know and uh but at the same time it's

1796
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:23,239
like you are in a business and right if

1797
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:25,840
you want to do business as business is

1798
01:10:23,238 --> 01:10:29,079
done unfortunately there's some give and

1799
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:31,719
take around where your level of fun is

1800
01:10:29,079 --> 01:10:33,279
versus where your level of work is

1801
01:10:31,719 --> 01:10:35,198
problem I have a serious problem I love

1802
01:10:33,279 --> 01:10:36,639
touching plants with my bare hands I

1803
01:10:35,198 --> 01:10:39,678
know it's not the best thing but it's

1804
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:41,760
terrible and I try I've I've worked

1805
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:43,560
really diligently on wearing gloves most

1806
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:45,920
of the time I just really enjoy touching

1807
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:48,800
plants with my bare hands and rubbing my

1808
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:51,440
fingers make you a deal if you can start

1809
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:55,279
to deploy a hand sanitizing regimen

1810
01:10:51,439 --> 01:10:57,519
before you touch your plants allow it

1811
01:10:55,279 --> 01:11:00,319
that's a great idea we have hand

1812
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:01,920
sanitizing stations all over so yeah you

1813
01:11:00,319 --> 01:11:03,880
know I tell you what man we've been

1814
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:06,199
taught to wash our our hands since

1815
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:09,319
kindergarten man and

1816
01:11:06,198 --> 01:11:12,799
like you know but we were never really

1817
01:11:09,319 --> 01:11:15,719
taught how you know well yeah you're

1818
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:18,000
supposed to what say the alphabet is it

1819
01:11:15,719 --> 01:11:20,279
three times well I'll tell you what it

1820
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:23,238
actually well no twice like sing Happy

1821
01:11:20,279 --> 01:11:24,880
Birthday twice twice right but you know

1822
01:11:23,238 --> 01:11:26,839
here's where it where it gets

1823
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:28,760
interesting is it's not even just the

1824
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:31,239
amount of time that you spend it's the

1825
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:33,119
amount of of effort and direction oh

1826
01:11:31,238 --> 01:11:34,799
yeah you're what you're looking at right

1827
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:37,198
here is What's called the aseptic

1828
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:39,840
handwashing technique and this is used

1829
01:11:37,198 --> 01:11:42,359
in hospitals this is used in dental

1830
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:45,360
offices it's used in Pharma clean rooms

1831
01:11:42,359 --> 01:11:48,119
like it is considered an aseptic process

1832
01:11:45,359 --> 01:11:49,479
right for aseptic manufacturing and so

1833
01:11:48,119 --> 01:11:51,479
what it starts with is you're

1834
01:11:49,479 --> 01:11:53,079
traditional rubbing your palms together

1835
01:11:51,479 --> 01:11:54,519
and then you're getting the insides of

1836
01:11:53,079 --> 01:11:56,439
your fing fingers you're getting the

1837
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:58,800
insides of your fingers you know you're

1838
01:11:56,439 --> 01:12:00,839
you're interlacing your fingers you're

1839
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:02,560
getting the backs of your fingernails

1840
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:05,719
you're getting your thumbs you're

1841
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:07,880
getting the fingertips right and uh then

1842
01:12:05,719 --> 01:12:09,920
you're getting your wrists and I do this

1843
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:11,319
little exercise when I do site visits

1844
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:15,359
like sometimes what happens is I'll do a

1845
01:12:11,319 --> 01:12:18,679
site visit and um I will uh I'll I'll

1846
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:20,359
bring somebody up and I will have them

01:12:46,238 --> 01:12:49,319
up and I'll say okay I'm gonna put some

1860
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:50,639
hand sanitizer and your gloved hands

1861
01:12:49,319 --> 01:12:51,960
right they're dark gloves you can see

1862
01:12:50,639 --> 01:12:54,480
the difference between the dry and the

1863
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:55,880
light and the dry the dry and the wet

1864
01:12:54,479 --> 01:12:57,359
and I'll say wash your hands like you

1865
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:59,119
would normally wash your hands at home

1866
01:12:57,359 --> 01:13:00,519
or here at work after using the bathroom

1867
01:12:59,119 --> 01:13:01,880
or something like that and so they'll

1868
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:03,639
wash their hands and I'm like okay now

1869
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:04,960
take a look do you see all the dry spots

1870
01:13:03,639 --> 01:13:06,520
you see all the spots that didn't get

1871
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:09,840
hand sanitizer on them and they're like

1872
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:11,239
I do and I'm like okay now try try this

1873
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:13,400
method that I just showed you and we do

1874
01:13:11,238 --> 01:13:15,319
it together in front of everybody and

1875
01:13:13,399 --> 01:13:19,000
I'm like now take a look at your hands

1876
01:13:15,319 --> 01:13:21,799
completely completely covered awesome

1877
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:24,079
yeah yeah and so it's just a great way

1878
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:25,480
of uh you know because any even if you

1879
01:13:24,079 --> 01:13:27,479
think about it like when people grab the

1880
01:13:25,479 --> 01:13:29,678
gloves out of the middle of the box

1881
01:13:27,479 --> 01:13:32,559
right like most glove manufacturers lay

1882
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:33,920
their gloves alternate right like you

1883
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:36,320
know they and you pull it from the

1884
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:38,960
middle like Kleenex right like a tissue

1885
01:13:36,319 --> 01:13:41,079
box and uh you know but you're pulling

1886
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:43,198
it with the finger and you're pulling on

1887
01:13:41,079 --> 01:13:44,600
the part that is invariably potentially

1888
01:13:43,198 --> 01:13:48,839
going to be totally contaminating the

1889
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:50,560
gloves right yeah in in pharmaceutical

1890
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:52,279
environments and in medical environments

1891
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:54,440
and stuff their gloves come individually

1892
01:13:52,279 --> 01:13:56,519
wrapped and they're up

1893
01:13:54,439 --> 01:13:57,879
and uh and so that that way they could

1894
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:59,560
just slip into them and put them on one

1895
01:13:57,880 --> 01:14:03,319
at a time makes

1896
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:04,840
sense and so you know with that uh it's

1897
01:14:03,319 --> 01:14:06,559
like you know those little changes and

1898
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:09,360
about keeping that barrier between

1899
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:11,199
people who uh you know because again

1900
01:14:09,359 --> 01:14:12,960
it's like humans are oftentimes the

1901
01:14:11,198 --> 01:14:15,000
problem until robots are starting to be

1902
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:16,239
able to grow you know which we don't

1903
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,719
want to happen anyway and you're never

1904
01:14:16,238 --> 01:14:22,279
going to get the same level of quality

1905
01:14:17,719 --> 01:14:24,198
sorry smoking that tpless robot weed

1906
01:14:22,279 --> 01:14:27,319
that's

1907
01:14:24,198 --> 01:14:29,879
right oh my God but anyway so so yeah I

1908
01:14:27,319 --> 01:14:32,679
mean that makes me a big you know germ

1909
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:34,520
nerd to the industry unfortunately no I

1910
01:14:32,679 --> 01:14:35,840
mean that's really good stuff I think

1911
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:39,159
the people that watch my show are gonna

1912
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:40,880
love it I think uh it's it's always good

1913
01:14:39,158 --> 01:14:43,399
the viewers out there are gonna really

1914
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:44,840
enjoy it and I'd love to do a you know

1915
01:14:43,399 --> 01:14:46,759
we could do a seminar one of these days

1916
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:48,960
together I would love to I mean if you

1917
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:51,560
wanted to assemble your your your

1918
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:53,439
audience together in one place or maybe

1919
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:55,239
we can run through it like a co-hosted

1920
01:14:53,439 --> 01:14:57,399
type of co-branded type of thing you

1921
01:14:55,238 --> 01:14:59,198
know and you just leave it out on the on

1922
01:14:57,399 --> 01:15:00,960
the web people need to know this

1923
01:14:59,198 --> 01:15:02,839
information that's the problem they just

1924
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:04,239
they don't know where to get it and and

1925
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:06,520
that's you know and that's where I want

1926
01:15:04,238 --> 01:15:08,238
to try to be of help because when you

1927
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:10,440
better understand the problem the

1928
01:15:08,238 --> 01:15:13,439
solution makes more sense and as you can

1929
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:15,559
see or here uh the kids are

1930
