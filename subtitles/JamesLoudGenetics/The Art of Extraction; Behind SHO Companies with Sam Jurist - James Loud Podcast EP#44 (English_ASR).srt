28
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,079
it's uh wearing a lot of different hats

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,280
you know yeah I mean and you guys create

30
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:09,359
a lot of good products I feel like you

31
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,079
have an emphasis on quality whether it's

32
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:14,280
the packaging or the stuff that's in the

33
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:16,158
product I feel like some people miss one

34
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,759
of them across the board and I feel like

35
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,400
you really have an emphasis on quality

36
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:23,879
across the board yeah everything we do

37
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,799
is really centered around hash so show

38
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:27,839
stands for solventless hash oil for

39
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:29,920
those like who may know of show

40
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,640
companies but not know what the show

41
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,879
stands for and um yeah quality is

42
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:39,640
definitely you know in everything that

43
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:41,879
we do rosin a premium hash brand last

44
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,079
year we released a lot of new products

45
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:47,199
so we we actually started the year with

46
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:49,879
with only selling hash and then expanded

47
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,560
the product line to include uh we

48
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:55,920
released a hash hole last year um our

49
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,759
hash Walkers which are like a sixpack of

50
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,200
uh indoor flour with ice water hash nice

51
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:02,840
uh and then we have uh rousing gummies

52
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,960
yeah your hash hole was the best hash

53
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,520
hole I smoked last year out of every I

54
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,719
smoked a lot of hash holes but that was

55
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:10,840
the best one um I wish I could have

56
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:12,959
gotten another one we that's when you

57
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,598
have good today we might spark one up

58
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,920
yeah yeah yeah that was really good I

59
00:02:14,598 --> 00:02:18,759
feel like the flavor was there and it

60
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:20,559
had just the long finish you know it's

61
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:23,280
like hash holes at the end of the day

62
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,519
are about effect and flavor and it

63
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,878
definitely check the boxes they're yeah

64
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:29,200
they're they're definitely a labor of

65
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:31,079
love you know each one is is handrolled

66
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:33,639
we put a L of work into the tip too

67
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:37,239
that's like really what creates the

68
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:39,559
shape of the joint is what style tip you

69
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:43,039
use you know right the glass tip it

70
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:46,479
keeps the the shape uh kind of a certain

71
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:48,239
size yeah and uh creates good air flow

72
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,119
yeah I mean i' I've done a bunch of R&amp;D

73
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,120
on different tips and I've been I've

74
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,800
kind of settled on the organ tips I

75
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,519
really like the organ tips for myself

76
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,360
for smoking but yeah the glass it's

77
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:59,640
they're kind of elegant too yeah they

78
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,080
they are a little heavier but other than

79
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:04,158
that that it's you can reuse them you

80
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,519
can reuse them recyclable and reusable I

81
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:08,158
bought a box of a thousand of them

82
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,480
thinking that I was going to do this

83
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:11,798
pre-roll thing it just never amounted to

84
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:14,318
anything and then I switched the organ

85
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:16,640
tips but so using them for personals for

86
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:19,318
personals yeah I got two different sizes

87
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:21,798
and yeah they're nice so tell me how you

88
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:25,039
got your start in the industry so show

89
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:27,159
was founded in 2015 and if you remember

90
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:30,519
at that time that was when rosin first

91
00:03:27,158 --> 00:03:32,598
hit the scene so uh soil grown vess he

92
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:36,039
started pressing some of his ice waterer

93
00:03:32,598 --> 00:03:38,639
hash with uh a hair straightener and it

94
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:40,798
kind of caught on on Instagram everyone

95
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:44,199
started to realize there was this new

96
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:47,400
method of um making hash with heat and

97
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:50,158
pressure and um so the first product

98
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:54,079
line that we uh introduced was a line of

99
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:57,120
presses that was in 2015 wow it was kind

100
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:59,280
of crazy you know like everyone was

101
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,799
interested in this Tech it was you know

102
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,239
a ventless way to make a dabbable

103
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:07,319
product which previous didn't dab right

104
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:10,280
it wasn't dabbable you know it left you

105
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:11,919
know it left residue yep yeah I mean and

106
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,640
the thing is is I love Bubble has I've

107
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:16,039
Loved I mean I was I've been smoking

108
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:17,719
bubble has since the late 90s I love

109
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,639
Bubble has I still love it

110
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,280
today U you know Nick guys like Nick

111
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,120
they kind of elevated the bubble has

112
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:27,119
game I think to a degree but bubble hash

113
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,639
wasn't the same as all the other things

114
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,639
you could dab and it's hard to come

115
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:35,000
across six-star hash you know as far as

116
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:36,840
dabbable products rosin introduced and

117
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,680
and opened the market up so that there

118
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:42,719
was way more like range of quality yeah

119
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,560
we I mean at least for us and what we're

120
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,360
seeing in the market right now it's it's

121
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,399
been interesting like fresh press has

122
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,199
become like not as popular in the market

123
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:53,679
um and everyone in California at least

124
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,520
in the wreck Market is is gravit toting

125
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,000
gravitating towards Cal cures right so

126
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:59,120
that's mainly what we're putting out

127
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,478
right now is just because that's what

128
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,519
the market wants is is a lot of Cal cure

129
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:06,279
so that moist kind of consistency is

130
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:08,038
like what we're primarily putting out

131
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:10,799
even with ice water hash like we're not

132
00:05:08,038 --> 00:05:12,639
we we used to kind of like every quarter

133
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,560
we would you know find a strain that

134
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,960
really was like good for ice water hash

135
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,439
product but we've been we've been

136
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:21,599
putting everything through the press and

137
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:23,279
primarily putting out all cold cures

138
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,960
nice so yeah so tell us a little bit

139
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:26,279
about cold cure the process for it

140
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:27,478
because I think a lot of we have a lot

141
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:30,318
of breeders and we have a lot of other

142
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:32,519
people that are curious about dabs and

143
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:33,560
extract and kind of the processes if you

144
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:35,318
can walk us through some of the

145
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,038
different processes that you guys doing

146
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:39,560
yeah so I mean with the cold cure it's

147
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:42,079
you know we're taking fresh press so

148
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,439
washing the material first then we uh

149
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:47,000
put it through our freeze dryer right um

150
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:49,639
then we press it uh so fresh frozen yeah

151
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,279
starting with the fresh frozen yep so

152
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:54,560
the cultivator grows it um when it's

153
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:56,879
ready to be harvested gets chopped uh

154
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,199
immediately freezing it and then

155
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,319
transporting it down to us Frozen stays

156
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,038
you know Frozen all the way through the

157
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:07,598
process uh washing it in super cold

158
00:06:04,038 --> 00:06:10,079
water so that super cold water is um you

159
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:12,319
know agitating it's acting basically as

160
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:15,120
the solvent uh to separate the Tricom

161
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:18,280
head from the Frozen plant material and

162
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,000
then passing that through Micron screens

163
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:21,679
um and separating it from the plant

164
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,639
material and then you have like a wet

165
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,959
hash right that you uh in the past you

166
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:29,879
would let it air dry you know and then

167
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:31,918
people started using freeze dryer

168
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:34,120
Harvest rights Harvest rights there's

169
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:36,279
yeah that's what we use and uh put it

170
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:39,240
through the the freeze dryer um that's

171
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:42,079
typically like a 24hour 36- hour process

172
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,400
some good Tech that's still evolving

173
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:47,240
with temperatures in the freeze dryer

174
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:50,038
and and different uh ways to kind of run

175
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,960
your Cycles because the operator is not

176
00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:54,000
there a lot you know you're not just

177
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:56,519
watching the freeze dryer the whole time

178
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,439
so you you know we've started to use um

179
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:01,079
this app hashy that uh you can pull your

180
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:04,038
data from your freeze dryer and really

181
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:05,800
kind of see the the heating cycle in the

182
00:07:04,038 --> 00:07:08,759
in the unit make sure that it's doing

183
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,680
what it says it's doing but then uh for

184
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:13,240
cold cure it's you know we we we use a

185
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:17,038
Mas jar and we're putting it uh at

186
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:20,000
approximately like 76 degrees to cold

187
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:22,800
cure um it's just letting time do its

188
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,240
thing um can range depending on the

189
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,800
strain some strains are more stubborn uh

190
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:31,960
to turn over but uh anywhere from 3 days

191
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:35,400
is really quick um to as long as like a

192
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:37,198
week and a half oh wow so do you know by

193
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:40,038
the way it looks or how how do you

194
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,120
identify once it's ready yeah you'll see

195
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:44,839
like the the kind of top turp layer

196
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,800
separate and um then we'll kind of whip

197
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:48,399
it up it's kind of somewhat of a feeling

198
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,840
you know kind of when it's fully

199
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:53,519
separated and and kind of ready awesome

200
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:55,839
that ice water you I saw I think a video

201
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:57,878
last year of you guys doing cold plunges

202
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:00,000
yeah that was you guys yeah I'm a big

203
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:02,000
cold plunge fan and so I saw that I'm

204
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,879
like yeah this guy I'd be happy working

205
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,038
at that company yeah yeah that was a

206
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:08,400
good time we actually bought that to

207
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:10,240
transport fresh frozen we haven't been

208
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:12,839
we've been actually just using uh like a

209
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,720
regular chest freezer to transport most

210
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:17,318
of the time but uh we bought that to

211
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,240
transport fresh Frozen with dry ice and

212
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:20,039
uh so it was just sitting there and

213
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,038
we're like all right maybe we could we

214
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:24,000
could put this to use let's jump in

215
00:08:22,038 --> 00:08:26,318
let's jump in right yeah all the

216
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,759
employees jumped in you guys looked like

217
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:31,039
had a lot of fun yeah yeah we do it's

218
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:33,599
good team bu it is good team building

219
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:35,278
yeah we try to keep things fun you know

220
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,360
working in manufacturing is is

221
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:39,439
definitely it's tough you know and it's

222
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,680
like a Daily Grind you got to hit

223
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,159
numbers and you know hit a certain quot

224
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,919
every day and um a lot of repetitive

225
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:48,639
tasks it's cool because we care about

226
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:50,679
the quality of the product and so I

227
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,799
think that makes it more interesting for

228
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:54,079
everybody but right well then you get

229
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,359
people that want to work there they work

230
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,200
there they work there because they're

231
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,839
passionate you want passionate people

232
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,278
working for you and I feel like

233
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,839
that's just the best way with with

234
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:04,360
employees if you have people that are

235
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:06,959
just as passionate as you are about

236
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,959
cannabis that are experts in whatever

237
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,639
they do or they they learn how to do

238
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:13,278
that to their the best of their ability

239
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:15,240
that's always great yeah you you need

240
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:17,120
some passion in this industry if you're

241
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,759
if you're not passionate like you

242
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,440
probably left the industry you're you're

243
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,360
probably already gone and if you're not

244
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,360
gone you're going to be gone it's yeah

245
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,919
it's just it's so tough the industry

246
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,039
isn't what it used to be you know I

247
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:29,479
think there was a lot of people in it

248
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:30,759
for the money and now there's a lot of

249
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,159
people that are in it for the passion

250
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:34,000
that are saying I'm not going anywhere

251
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,559
else yeah it's kind of like the flip

252
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,120
side of the coin with you know some of

253
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:41,000
the challenges that the industry has

254
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:43,159
it's kind of allowed kind of the people

255
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,480
that are true to the industry and the

256
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:48,838
the plant and who really care about it

257
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:51,639
to you know grind it out yeah keep out

258
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:54,000
some of the the Chads and some of the

259
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:56,078
you know Financial guys that really

260
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,839
don't care that much and are just trying

261
00:09:56,078 --> 00:09:59,199
to make make a buck yeah it's

262
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,360
interesting how it's changed in the last

263
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,040
five years because during covid

264
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,360
everyone's like I'm doing cannabis

265
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:05,759
cannabis is crushing and now it's like

266
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,680
you're doing it because you love it and

267
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:09,319
you're doing it because you you're doing

268
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:11,359
it for the long play and not the quick

269
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,160
money but yeah and even the award

270
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,600
ceremonies and stuff like that is you

271
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:17,439
know they Chang from High Times to

272
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,519
Emerald cup is you know now a big one I

273
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,120
think there's there's a lot of awards

274
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,560
but there's not as many prestigious

275
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,440
Awards I think yeah you know I mean

276
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:29,359
Emerald cup has you know done their

277
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,000
award ceremony for at least like two

278
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,360
decades right I would think something

279
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,039
along those two decades that sounds

280
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,480
right they do a great job you know and

281
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:38,679
and they're really connected to like the

282
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,360
cultivators North the community and the

283
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:42,319
cultivators and they're they're really

284
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,720
in it yeah Tim's Tim's done a good job

285
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,839
with Emerald cup yep so and there was a

286
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,278
time where High Times was on top and

287
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:51,880
those High Times cups back in the day

288
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:54,759
were amazing um especially the first US

289
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:56,720
ones were it was something new and the

290
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:59,439
people were so excited to be there

291
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,879
everybody was having an amazing time and

292
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,320
everybody did really well that was

293
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:04,278
selling products if you had a good

294
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,079
product it was easy to sell it yeah the

295
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:09,120
High Times cannabis cups those were we

296
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:12,039
started going to them in 2016 and we did

297
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,720
uh we would set up like a 50x50 booth

298
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:16,679
and it was branded the solventless

299
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:19,160
experience and um we had all of our Ros

300
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:21,799
and presses set up and people would come

301
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:23,838
in with flow or we would have a farm at

302
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:25,958
our booth that would give people flow

303
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,720
yeah and uh we would just teach them

304
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:30,638
like what the process of making rosin

305
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,480
was so we would allow them to press on

306
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:36,159
the machine you know collect the the the

307
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,920
Rosa put it in a jar for them we would

308
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:40,519
have a bunch of dab break set up and let

309
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:42,519
them like take a dab so it was it was

310
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:44,959
pretty cool like I think a lot of people

311
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:47,078
saw pressing for the first time at one

312
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:48,399
of our booths yeah I mean the old old

313
00:11:47,078 --> 00:11:49,879
High Times cups had the passionate

314
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,240
people because you had to go to a

315
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:54,759
destination location so if you're

316
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,680
American going in you you loved weed and

317
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:59,679
then it was like disco though when it

318
00:11:56,679 --> 00:12:01,679
was gone it was gone High Times

319
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:03,359
it's it's changed for sure the company

320
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,919
has changed the company has changed the

321
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,120
whole the whole landscape of the company

322
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:08,599
has changed it has yeah I mean you

323
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,720

324
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,480

and keep it you know active and yeah I

326
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,278
mean in High Times They have this

327
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,879
amazing name right and so they have the

328
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:19,159
potential to do great things they could

329
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:20,399
they could do another High Times event

330
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:23,399
and it would probably be cool if they

331
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:26,320
did it right yeah it's amazing like the

332
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:29,039
the equity that the brand still has even

333
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,879
after like you know maybe not doing as

334
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:33,439
much as they should have over the past

335
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:34,759
few years um it's still a great brand

336
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,399
you know and it's still part of the

337
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:38,159
culture and hopefully will be it's

338
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,679
heavily that name is heavily tied to the

339
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:41,600
culture you know and if you say High

340
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:43,439
Times to anybody that knows anything

341
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,639
about weed they know what High Times is

342
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:49,320
exactly yeah it's definitely like for

343
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:52,519
like the mass public Ma you know Mass

344
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:55,720
market like the most well-known brand

345
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:57,519
Still Still Still C May cookies now

346
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,879
cookies is because they little kids

347
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,560
wearing cookies t-shirts that's that

348
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:02,879
trips me out by the way when you see

349
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:04,078
little kids you know that are like four

350
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:07,198
years old walking around with cookie

351
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:08,799
shirts on and it's like sometimes you

352
00:13:07,198 --> 00:13:10,639
wonder does that kid actually know what

353
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:13,879
cookies is or do the parents know

354
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:17,039
because sometimes not know yeah pretty

355
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:19,120
amazing though the the reach of cookies

356
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:21,480
yeah they're they're in a lot of markets

357
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,440
they've done a good job uh uh branching

358
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:26,720
out into ancillary too so so do you guys

359
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,000
do clothing yet or you just have your

360
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,480
only your sub merch hoodies hats and

361
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,360
t-shirt that's kind of like what we're

362
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,560
doing yeah yeah primarily um like we we

363
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,039
don't focus on apparel but for for us

364
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:41,759
ancillary is focus V so like all the the

365
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:43,399
uh the focus V products we can ship them

366
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,838
cross state lines we don't have to deal

367
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:48,198
with like you know licenses in each

368
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,759
state like we do with rousing tech right

369
00:13:48,198 --> 00:13:53,198
um so that's nice you know allows us to

370
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:56,120
build a brand across state lines and

371
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:58,120
even you know in other countries we sell

372
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,078
a lot of units in in Canada and in

373
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,000
Europe and South America that's really

374
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:04,039
cool and it's a good product I like it

375
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,919
you gave me one you're a fan I'm a fan

376
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:08,159
I'm definitely a fan I was a guy who

377
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:10,519
used hot knives back in the day so we

378
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:12,278
went from coals and hot knives to all

379
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:14,320
the you know dab rigs and now we have

380
00:14:12,278 --> 00:14:16,759
like yeah there was the enails and now

381
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,680
it's all in one and I think that it's

382
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:20,800
amazing that we have gone you know we've

383
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:23,879
come so far and it's

384
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:25,278
very scientific and very specific you

385
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:27,559
can dial it down to the right

386
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:29,519
temperature I mean I think that's it's a

387
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:32,278
lot easier to do that than hot knives

388
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:35,159
yeah well it's it's I mean it's

389
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:37,639
definitely cool to see like the progress

390
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:39,759
of dabbing you know and just like where

391
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:41,600
it started you know we didn't really

392
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:43,800
know what we were doing you know with

393
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,320
what materials we wereing on or what

394
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:48,719
temperatures we were dabbing at um it's

395
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,079
been uh it's definitely evolved I think

396
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,079
every year and gotten more sophisticated

397
00:14:51,078 --> 00:14:56,359
in terms of you know now we're like

398
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:59,000
looking at complex air flow and you know

399
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:01,720
heat retention and all these kind of

400
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,879
things to to make it a better experience

401
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,680
well and that's really what it boils

402
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:06,639
down to is the exper we keep improving

403
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:08,039
the experience right and I think there's

404
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,959
something to be said for hot knives you

405
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:12,480
know people still I'm sure do hot knife

406
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:14,638
hits with hash and same thing with the

407
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,879
you know I feel like quartz Nails I

408
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,039
haven't seen one of those in a long time

409
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:18,720
but that's kind of where dab Brak

410
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:20,039
started was with those quartz nails that

411
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,519
we' heat up because they heat up real

412
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:24,679
fast and then they went to Titanium we

413
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:26,919
seen some of the like slurpers that are

414
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:29,239
on the market like the control tower

415
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:31,919
Highly Educated control tower with the

416
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:34,159
the pillar that spins and the there's

417
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:37,639
just yeah I mean all kinds of creative

418
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:40,318
ways to get your hash to evenly spread

419
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:41,799
around your heated you know surface

420
00:15:40,318 --> 00:15:44,318
right yeah it's cool it's it's

421
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:46,838
mind-blowing and then eens they they've

422
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:50,078
they've come a long way since the Gen

423
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:52,000
one you know the vape pens that started

424
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:53,719
out you know they half of them would go

425
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,600
bad anyway they're all manufactured in

426
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,199
China and they'll Wick and all this

427
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,839
other stuff and they've really improved

428
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:00,439
on those and you have a new improv

429
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:02,440
version as well right yeah so I mean

430
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:06,440
it's it's kind of a good segue it's it's

431
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:09,000
uh so this is uh this is AIS and uh we

432
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:11,360
just released it uh last month it's a

433
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,278
dry dab device I mean there's a lot of

434
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,800
amazing features we packed a lot of

435
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:19,679
Technology into like a really small form

436
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:21,758
factor um but I like to really describe

437
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:25,039
it as it's like the first time you can

438
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:29,519
fit a dab device in your pocket and take

439
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:32,240
a real dab wow um so it has the intell

440
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:36,600
cor atomizer which is the same atomizer

441
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:38,879
on the c 2 it has removable batteries so

442
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,720
you can if you're going to a festival or

443
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:43,399
if you're traveling or just want to have

444
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,360
backup juice and don't want to run out

445
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:47,958
of battery uh it's got a proprietary

446
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,159
removable battery compatible atomizer

447
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:53,239
and then this mouthpiece is really kind

448
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:56,759
of what took us the longest part uh

449
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:59,079
longest time to develop and um The

450
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:01,278
Challenge was like you have a short

451
00:16:59,078 --> 00:17:03,399
amount of space here and you have a a

452
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:05,240
heated atomizer so cooling the smoke as

453
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:08,078
it's like going into the

454
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:10,199
user's uh mouth and then like also

455
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:13,720
moving the air around the chamber so it

456
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:15,759
has two carb holes on either side the uh

457
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:18,798
the way the air flows in it moves the

458
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:20,558
oil around the atomizer um and then it

459
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:23,279
goes through a longer air path on its

460
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:26,078
way out to cool the smoke and uh it's

461
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:28,078
got a ceramic insert piece that this

462
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,000
pops out and you can just dunk that in

463
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:31,960
ISO

464
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,119
wow super easy to clean Super durable

465
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,200
like you could just throw this thing in

466
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:38,558
your backpack you know right how many

467
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:42,440
hits do you get per charge it's around

468
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:46,678
10 to 12 similar to the cter 2 oh nice

469
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,679
it's not bad want give it a go

470
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:52,919
sure I'm big on R&amp;D that's I love I love

471
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:53,919
r&amp; ding new things so it's a serious

472
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:57,038
part of the

473
00:17:53,919 --> 00:18:00,360
job this is um some first class Funk

474
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:03,519
from uh Luma nice so yeah it's heating

475
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:05,119
up uh it'll uh flash white when it's

476
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:07,679
ready and then these are two carb Pooles

477
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:09,639
so if you want to just you just hold

478
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:13,440
hold one and yeah just hold it straight

479
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,440
up hold the device straight up

480
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,519
yeah oh you're tapping it I mean that

481
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:25,639
was good good

482
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,319
flavor so the interesting thing with

483
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,880
that flavor

484
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:31,558
is it's one of the things I like about

485
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,240
certain strains when you take a hit of

486
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:35,798
it you get an initial flavor then when

487
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,200
you exhale you you get something on the

488
00:18:35,798 --> 00:18:40,279
Finish that's completely different and

489
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:43,038
you get the the gas the Earth you get

490
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:46,000
some Pine in there yeah I mean yeah

491

drain them I mean they took it away from

511
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:34,199

I uh fly back and forth to uh between LA

514
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:42,558
and Jersey a lot yeah and I was flying

515
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:45,079
home like two months ago and uh had my

516
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:48,678
backpack like I had uh couple grams of

517
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:51,000
rosin I had some hash Walkers so I had

518
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:53,320
like four or five of these uh these are

519
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,839
joints nice and then I had our gummies

520
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:58,399
and I had the gummies just like straight

521
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:59,480
up in a case pack no like not in my bag

522
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,280
or anything I just put them on the

523
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:05,919
conveyor belt and so stopped me TSA

524
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:08,240
person came over was like what are you

525
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:10,520
doing here like this is not allowed you

526
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,519
know like you have way too much product

527
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:14,200
oh wow I was like okay like what what

528
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:16,240
are we doing you know what's going on

529
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,919
cops came over like three three cops

530
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,960
came over and it was like a Redeye

531
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,320
flight so I was like [ __ ] like I'm not

532
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,079
going to be able to get a later flight

533
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:24,119
like and then she she came over the cop

534
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:26,000
came over to me and she was like do you

535
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:28,719
know what the legal limit is and I was

536
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,319
like no you tell me and she's like no

537
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,960
you tell me what's the legal limit I was

538
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:34,879
like no tell me what is it you know so

539
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,960
she's like it's 28 gram I was like okay

540
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,080
and I like did some quick math and like

541
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,079
the the gummies are only 10 milligrams

542
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:42,798
per gummy so like it that was only like

543
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:44,439
really two grams even though it was

544
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:46,679
looked like a lot right and then the

545
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:49,120
joints was really only like was like 12

546
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:52,200
or 15 gram so like all added up to like

547
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:54,558
21 22 gram so how you keep it yeah

548
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,519
that's amazing she went back like with

549
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:59,798
her flashlight started to like add it up

550
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:02,639
and she came back and she was like okay

551
00:20:59,798 --> 00:21:04,400
yeah yeah that's amazing yeah it doesn't

552
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,200
always end good I mean I have some

553
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,519
friends that have been stopped lately

554
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,558
yeah so yeah 28 grams you're not

555
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:13,119
supposed to fly with more than 28 grams

556
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:15,399
even going medical to medical or license

557
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:16,839
to license State my view is kind of like

558
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,960
you know we should be pushing these

559
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:22,839
boundaries and like if that's how we got

560
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:26,558
like you know like so be it you know I

561
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:29,480
got caught flying with samples from

562
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:31,480
Colorado to California they stopped me

563
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,240
and uh pulled them out of the bag that

564
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,400
it was a new person and they pulled them

565
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,640
out and they were all Jarred up and they

566
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,840
were all labeled and I was going to go

567
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,440
get them tested it wasn't that much but

568
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:42,519
there there was a bunch of jars and

569
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,120
these were seeds or no this was flour

570
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:45,519
okay so we were doing yeah I was doing

571
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:47,519
some testing on this stuff because I

572
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:49,158
wanted to see the results but that never

573
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:50,918
worked out but what happened was they

574
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:53,520
called the sheriff over and the sheriff

575
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:55,640
was like yeah I would let you fly with

576
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:56,918
this I don't even care but the person

577
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,360
lifted out of the bag so there's all

578
00:21:56,919 --> 00:21:59,559
these people that saw that and so you

579
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:02,558
can call your friend and have him come

580
00:21:59,558 --> 00:22:04,639
pick it up or you know I can destroy it

581
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:06,399
and so they destroyed it because I need

582
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,278
to catch my flight and fortunately and

583
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,679
then I had them most of them just don't

584
00:22:08,278 --> 00:22:12,240
want to deal with the paperwork that you

585
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:13,840
know and they don't care they don't care

586
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,240
most people they don't care they don't

587
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:18,278
care the Edibles it's funny if you think

588
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,880
of it you know technically that that

589
00:22:18,278 --> 00:22:22,159
isn't even a product that needs to go

590
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:25,840
through the DCC if you look at it by by

591
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:29,000
weight is it's below 3% THC by total

592
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:30,558
weight but uh that's a big loop Poland

593
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,558
yeah that's a good point yeah because

594
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:34,079
our G gums are five grams like the

595
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:36,079
weight of them yeah you know and they

596
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:39,519
only have 10 milligrams yeah that's way

597
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:41,678
below that's below 0.1 yeah so so we can

598
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:44,000
start shipping those is technically

599
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,000
technically by law under the farm bill

600
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,679
that is a legal product to sell as long

601
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,119
as it's three by weight well I mean

602
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:52,759
that's what's going on you know that's

603
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:55,918
what going on that's chca in New York

604
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:59,079
and and you know in a lot of markets

605
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:01,799
people are just you know the thca

606
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:04,839
excuse is just doesn't have Delta 9 in

607
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:06,278
it or it has a very little uh yeah I

608
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:07,759
mean that it's a big loophole right now

609
00:23:06,278 --> 00:23:09,798
I think that's going to get closed up

610
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:11,480
but that's just my personal opinion I'm

611
00:23:09,798 --> 00:23:13,158
not super excited about it like other

612
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,960
people are saying it's legal weed I'm

613
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:16,919
not excited about it either because like

614
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,519
we just opened a store in New Jersey and

615
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:20,919
like down the block we got this guy

616
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:22,639
that's just got like you know jars and

617
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:25,400
he's doing like the old school like you

618
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,320
know plucking like full nugs out of like

619
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,400
a jar and weighing it for people where

620
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:30,798
we have like

621
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:34,240
all this compliance and packaging and

622
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:36,278
taxes taxes and yeah it's wild I I think

623
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,679
in the short term it could be a good

624
00:23:36,278 --> 00:23:40,319
thing and that it forces like States or

625
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:42,240
or the federal government to make some

626
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:44,119
changes I'm not opposed to it don't get

627
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,319
me wrong I'm just not excited about it

628
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:48,959
it doesn't excite me like genetics or

629
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:50,759
like all this other stuff the legal side

630
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,480
of it never excites me because it's like

631
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:54,319
we've come so far and we still have a

632
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,519
long ways to go but you know it's like

633
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:58,879
we need interstate commerce it's it's

634
00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:01,480
crazy that we don't have inter at the

635
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,400
very least legal state to Legal State

636
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,360
Interstate Commerce like that's not a

637
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:08,159
thing like and I we're working on it to

638
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:11,000
become a thing but also banking banking

639
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:13,960
who's working on it I don't know like

640
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,440
that's the problem even we don't ban

641
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,960
together enough as an industry to push

642
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,080
forward the change that we want to see

643
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,120
and I mean I'm guilty of you know like

644
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:24,079
not doing enough I think like everybody

645
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:26,199
could do more me too it's hard because

646
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:28,879
we don't have the resources that other

647
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:32,558
Industries have or other markets have

648
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,919
where you know they can lob money to put

649
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:36,038
together groups and well the ones who

650
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,640
are lobbying are the ones that have a

651
00:24:36,038 --> 00:24:40,759
lot of money to Lobby against us against

652
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,960
us right specifically in our industry

653
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:44,599
it's like it's rough um there's not a

654
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,000
lot of money for

655
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:48,719
lobbying uh I mean there's some there's

656
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,839
some people doing it I mean I think

657
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,000
we're doing a good thing by talking

658
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:55,038
about it today I think that's beneficial

659
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,319
to the whole world is I think there's a

660
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:59,720
lot of people that don't understand it

661
00:24:56,319 --> 00:25:03,439
either it's like THC across the board as

662
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:06,720
long as there's less than 3% Delta 9 THC

663
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:10,519
thca is 100% legal according to the farm

664
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:12,319
bill federally legal so pretty wild it's

665
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:15,798
you know and I was in Texas not so long

666
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:18,000
ago during Christmas and they had flour

667
00:25:15,798 --> 00:25:20,119
and I was like I I had smoked any of the

668
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,480
thca flour that sold in Texas over the

669
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:25,239
counter taxed like a normal product they

670
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:28,240
had thca flower tax like with normal

671
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:31,919
sales tax 10% sales tax you know it's

672
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:34,240
pretty wild that it got me high and it

673
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,520
didn't taste terrible it wasn't the best

674
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,079
it but I I would say it's probably

675
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:39,319
comparable to a lot of stuff you find in

676
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:42,119
dispensaries interesting we'll see where

677
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:43,599
it goes the next year yeah I mean

678
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:45,439
there's like some Rumblings it feels

679
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:47,359
like because it's an election year so

680
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,000
it's going to be a real interesting year

681
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:51,439
no matter what with the elections and

682
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,720
with everything else and I mean there's

683
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,600
a lot of people that want change we got

684
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,278
a lot of problems here in California the

685
00:25:55,599 --> 00:26:00,119
system is not good like the the the

686
00:25:58,278 --> 00:26:01,720
Cannabis at least like you know focusing

687
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:04,398
on like just the the system that they

688
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,480
set up for cannabis in California yeah

689
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:08,558
is not

690
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:10,519
working yeah taxes too high too makes

691
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:13,000
too much sense to push product to the

692
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:15,879
black market right cannabis shouldn't be

693
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,159
taxed more than oil more than alcohol

694
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:20,840
more than cigarettes it's a medicine why

695
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,760
are you taxing more than than cigarettes

696
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:24,480
yeah but it is tax more than cigarettes

697
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:26,679
right crazy yeah I mean these are things

698
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,120
that have to change I think and and like

699
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:32,840
in New Jersey there there the it's just

700
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:35,439
sales tax there's no separate xise like

701
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:36,959
there is in California oh wow um like

702
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,640
you have a local tax that you have to

703
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:43,759
pay as a retailer at least as a retailer

704
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:46,278
versus California 27% it's hard to work

705
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:47,720
in California they like their taxes it's

706
00:26:46,278 --> 00:26:50,119
hard to live in California it's hard to

707
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:52,480
work in California um they make it a lot

708
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:54,239
easier in other states

709
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:58,759
unfortunately but how many states are

710
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:01,519
you guys in so California um and then

711
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:03,759
Jersey as of like a month ago so we're

712
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:06,398
like I guess officially like M

713
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:09,519
multi-state officially Ms as of a month

714
00:27:06,398 --> 00:27:11,879
ago um but you know definitely like a

715
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:13,759
like a a different style I think it's

716
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:17,159
good like you know the brands that are

717
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:18,879
doing the good like good work um got to

718
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:20,480
bring them out into other markets and

719
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,200
like it's good to see some of these

720
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,599
Brands like you know going into Florida

721
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,000
and some of the East Coast markets

722
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:29,359
because a lot a lot of the East Coast

723
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,038
markets they're lacking some of the just

724
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:32,798
culture that we have on the west coast

725
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:34,440
and some of the brands because those

726
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:36,639
markets were more limited at first and

727
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,759
so it was a lot of yeah like bigger msos

728
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:42,240
that got established in those East Coast

729
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:45,000
markets Florida's going to be big yeah

730
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,480
yeah Florida I mean it's very limited

731
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,200
who's who's like the way that they've

732
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,919
set it up well New Jersey is pretty

733
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,240
limited on how they set it up so when

734
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,880
you said New Jersey I'm thinking man

735
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,519
it's hard to get in New Jersey it's not

736
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,960
they didn't give out a ton of licenses

737
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:58,480
or there wasn't a ton of access for

738
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:01,558
licenses yeah New Jersy Jersey like

739
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:04,440
right now there's under 75 dispensaries

740
00:28:01,558 --> 00:28:06,558
yeah so it's still limited it's more

741
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,558
limited on the city Side so the state

742
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:10,839
didn't limit like the number of licenses

743
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:15,440
that they're issuing um but on like

744
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:18,079
there's just of there's 650 towns and uh

745
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:21,720
cities in New Jersey and only 150 have

746
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:23,879
said yes to some form of cannabis yeah

747
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:27,600
and then we got New York who's just

748
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:30,559
crazy and D it's just wild the whole

749
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:32,480
BEDA the BEDA model yeah you know it's

750
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:34,319
like people are making money though

751
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,919
people are making money stimulating the

752
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:39,079
economy I guess but like the the groups

753
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:40,440
that went in and like got licenses and

754
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:42,079
like CU remember there was like that

755
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,798
round where it was like only like five

756
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:47,278
groups got licenses and they all paid

757
00:28:43,798 --> 00:28:49,038
like $20 million like it's tough yeah

758
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:51,558
not yeah it's tough to compete it's not

759
00:28:49,038 --> 00:28:52,640
cool like no it's not cool it's not cool

760
00:28:51,558 --> 00:28:54,720
if you're that you're paying all that

761
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,200
moneyy you yeah it's interesting how

762
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,720
it's evolved to what it is because I

763
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:00,558
don't think anybody saw this 20 years

764
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:03,240
ago that'd be like this and I don't

765
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:05,519
think when we look back 20 years from

766
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,200
now this is going to be how we're doing

767
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:08,519
it it's going to be completely different

768
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,038
the model is going to be different we're

769
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:13,359
going to move away from gelato a little

770
00:29:10,038 --> 00:29:15,398
bit I'd like to say I mean I I'd assume

771
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:17,319
we're going to move tast always evolve

772
00:29:15,398 --> 00:29:18,839
yeah taste you know all these things are

773
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:21,599
just like fashion and everything else

774
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:23,480
they evolve flavor evolves uh people get

775
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:25,719
so burned out and we're we're on the top

776
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,880
40s list anyway it's like whatever's

777
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29,679
popular right now that might be popular

778
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,919
for another month or two months or

779
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:34,360
whatever and then another

780
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,840
gelato you know something similar is

781
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:38,639
going to hit that number one spot and

782
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:41,798
it's constantly rotating so I mean

783
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:44,278
there's longterm there's a place for the

784
00:29:41,798 --> 00:29:46,158
really you know the top hits but right

785
00:29:44,278 --> 00:29:48,359
now it's definitely the top 40 so what's

786
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,360
ever and I think a lot of it's going

787
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:51,398
towards washing different genetics that

788
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:54,119
wash

789
00:29:51,398 --> 00:29:56,558
well hash has definitely like started to

790
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:58,000
steer genetics and for sure that

791
00:29:56,558 --> 00:30:00,720
obviously like C certain strains that

792
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,119
are good washers yeah what kind of

793
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,880
genetics are you guys running you know

794
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:09,398
GMO is always a dumper um but we have uh

795
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:12,880
like AMG sour that we just put out uh P

796
00:30:09,398 --> 00:30:14,839
Loco government Oasis uh some of the

797
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:18,519
how's the government so I'm not a huge

798
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:20,519
fan of the flow but I do like the turps

799
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:22,599
yeah it's interesting I haven't smoked

800
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:24,599
any of the turps I didn't know it washed

801
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:26,278
yeah yeah know it washed as well yeah

802
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:28,839
it's interesting you know like the honey

803
00:30:26,278 --> 00:30:30,679
bananas the ban bondas and the the

804
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:32,839
banana Oreos and all these things I

805
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:35,038
think they wash really well and I like

806
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:37,000
GMO but there's a lot of stuff that's

807
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:40,038
like GMO that I feel like isn't as good

808
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,480
as GMO but it's like GMO Don Burgers the

809
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:43,879
Donnie burgers out there and stuff like

810
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:46,240
that I mean that's basically GMO yeah

811
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:49,640
like GMO across from GMO cross from GMO

812
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:51,399
yeah it's a it's very GMO you know and I

813
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:53,240
think a lot of stuff is like gelato if

814
00:30:51,398 --> 00:30:55,479
you go back to the gelato 33 runs

815
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,880
whatever you want to call it uh we keep

816
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:00,159
going away from that and keep going back

817
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,919
to it people still it's in high demand

818
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,320
still the the chart people are you know

819
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:06,360
aiming for and you know for a while

820
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:07,918
you'll see the RS 11s on top and these

821
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:10,719
other things that are amazing I think

822
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:13,038
they're really good too but we still

823
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,278
gravitate back towards those main things

824
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:16,599
instead of spreading out because there's

825
00:31:14,278 --> 00:31:19,278
so much diversity in the plant and we

826
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:22,240
can go to any any flavor profile that

827
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:24,079
you guys like we can go orange we can go

828
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,599
and not just like if we look at Citrus

829
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:27,599
there's like 20 different types of

830
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:29,439
citrus because with every one there's

831
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:31,879
like the Citrus rind of that plant

832
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,600
there's the Citrus Blossom of that plant

833
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,880
there's the juice of that plant and then

834
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:38,240
there's just the fruit and so for every

835
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:40,480
type of orange or lemon there's there's

836
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,519
a variant of that and then you have the

837
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,000
environment too which is going to bring

838
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:47,079
out different attributes of each right

839
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,159
genetic well and then like chocolate

840
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:49,678
there's every kind of chocolate you

841
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,120
could imagine out there you know and

842
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,720
it's like I I do like chocolate TPS to a

843
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:55,798
degree something like Gorilla Glue has

844
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:57,960
some chocolatin to it chocolate loue has

845
00:31:55,798 --> 00:32:00,319
some chocolatin to it and that can go

846
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,679
all over the place too and I'm a huge

847
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:03,119
fan of Ruby chocolate I don't know if

848
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,120
you've had Ruby chocolate before it's

849
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:06,439
like the it's a just like white

850
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:08,558
chocolate but it's a ruby CH it's

851
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,720
another natural chocolate it's really

852
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:13,798
good what are your thoughts on Skittles

853
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:16,240
uh I mean I like Skittles yeah I do I

854
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:19,038
enjoy it Skittles flour Skittles rosin I

855
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,638
love Skittles everything pretty much I

856
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:22,919
love the turbs yeah I was talking more

857
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:24,158
on the hash side yeah hash side it's

858
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:25,759
great it's one of the best it's one of

859
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:28,240
the best flavors it's really it has a

860
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:29,679
long finish it's candy tastes like candy

861
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,079
it's Cy and there's a lot of like

862
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:33,798
expressions of it mhm on the hash side

863
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:35,319
so yeah and that's another one so like

864
00:32:33,798 --> 00:32:36,918
we're just figuring out like what day do

865
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:39,000
you harvest on Skittles is an early

866
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:42,240
finisher so you got to harvest on day 53

867
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,638
or day 55 or something really early

868
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,919
whereas some of the other stuff you want

869
00:32:43,638 --> 00:32:49,359
to go mature a little bit more for sure

870
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:51,320
and that also has you know it has an

871
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:52,879
effect so like going longer is you might

872
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:56,119
get a different effect than you would

873
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:58,200
get by going earlier right yeah changes

874
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:59,798
the the effect totally changes the

875
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,360
effect totally changes especially with

876
00:32:59,798 --> 00:33:04,638
Skittles if you go to day 63 it gets you

877
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:08,119
it's way stronger but the taste is in as

878
00:33:04,638 --> 00:33:10,119
candy it's not as amazing not that it's

879
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:11,119
not great it's just not as good as the

880
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:14,119
early

881
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:16,719
one so yeah it's really interesting what

882
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:18,558
we've picked up on over the last you

883
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,038
know 30 years and then what we still

884
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:22,960
have to learn because there's so much to

885
00:33:20,038 --> 00:33:27,079
learn still so smoke a joint yeah yeah

886
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:29,038
I'm down this is uh wedding cake flow

887
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:31,678
times GMO with wedding cake ice water

888
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:34,000
hash nice yeah but these are yeah these

889
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:37,000
are uh Point fours

890
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,519
and minis yeah ice water hash mixed in

891
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,200
with the flower indoor flower a lighter

892
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:44,319
looks like a bey for those of you little

893
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,558
rippers you know yeah totally they're

894
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:48,119
like yeah you get a couple hits and

895
00:33:45,558 --> 00:33:49,440
you're done you know I like big 3.5 gram

896
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:51,719
joints that's my so you should light up

897
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,960
the hash hole Yeah

898
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:55,639
Yeah there's nothing wrong with bees

899
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,079
they they're nostalgic for me I mean I

900
00:33:55,638 --> 00:33:58,798
remember they had different flavored

901
00:33:57,079 --> 00:34:00,439
tobacco they're like little mini

902
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:02,638
cigarettes and they had different

903
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:05,759
flavors back in the

904
00:34:02,638 --> 00:34:07,359
day yeah I mean you know hash holes are

905
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:09,440
great but in the middle of a day to take

906
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:11,319
a hash hole to the to the Dome is it's

907
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:14,519
gonna knock me out yeah I think hash

908
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:16,359
holes are more for the evening um I like

909
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:19,800
big big joints but

910
00:34:16,358 --> 00:34:22,319
it's it's this is cool we're already

911
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:25,000
getting some

912
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:28,399
uh oil on there starting to drip

913
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:31,039
already I mean this yeah the side is

914
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:36,799
interesting yeah we smoked like you know

915
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:36,800
we we rolled them longer shorter a good

916
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:40,878
size

917
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:43,358
yeah yeah you're getting a little drip

918
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:46,639
little oil that's good it looks

919
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:49,398
nice the flavor is good flavor is good

920
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:51,679
flavor is good yeah it's consistent

921
00:34:49,398 --> 00:34:54,638
too I like it when it doesn't go away

922
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,639
right away a lot of

923
00:34:55,878 --> 00:35:01,559
stuff

924
00:34:57,719 --> 00:35:06,118
what are your thoughts on uh living soil

925
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:07,799
versus Coco versus Hydro uh I mean from

926
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:10,720
what we from the Farms we work with the

927
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,920
ones that are doing living soil there's

928
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:16,399
just a

929
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:18,440
greater expression of like the genetic I

930
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:21,480
I find you know and like there's just

931
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:24,079
like another level of quality um in

932
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,119
terms of how that like plant how healthy

933
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:27,440
it is right and then like kind of what

934
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:29,240
you're getting out of

935
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,679
the triome yeah but there's a lot of

936
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:32,000
things that got to go right you know

937
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:34,000
there's a lot of things you got to go

938
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,400
living soil too it's a lot of other

939
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,880
parts that you got to do just growing in

940
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,920
general you're 70 days of a plant's life

941
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:42,160
have to be great for you to have great

942
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,720
flow you have one day it could throw

943
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:47,920
your whole crop off one day one bad day

944
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:49,759
that's it so stacked with a bunch of

945
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,159
days and you can correct a lot of things

946
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,760
if you recognize them before their

947
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:54,159
problems but still there's a lot of

948
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,000
things that have to go right and there's

949
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:57,440
a lot of variables a lot of micro

950
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,400
variables but but yeah I'm a fan of

951
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,079
living soil especially for the effect I

952
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:04,200
just I'm all about the effect with

953
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:07,839
living soil I feel like my friends that

954
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:10,679
get great flavor using cocoa um doing

955
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:15,039
really well I'm not a huge fan

956
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:16,318
of rockwolf for flour for flavor but

957
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:18,279
people have been moving away from the

958
00:36:16,318 --> 00:36:19,800
rock wall and there some have been

959
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:21,319
moving away and then some guys are going

960
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,519
full force into it and same thing

961
00:36:21,318 --> 00:36:26,119
Hydroponics you know you talk about

962
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:29,039
aquaponics uh like dwc the deep water

963
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:30,519
culture mhm and uh I've had a couple

964
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:33,079
guys on my show that do it and they have

965
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:34,719
really good flower too and you know but

966
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:36,519
it's if you care about it and you put a

967
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:37,879
lot of energy into it you know good

968
00:36:36,519 --> 00:36:39,639
energy I think you're going to end up

969
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:42,800
with a good product when you cultivated

970
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:46,400
in the past was it uh indoor or mostly

971
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:49,440
indoor and I did I mean I do outdoor too

972
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,960
outdoor with soil with Organics um

973
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,358
thanks to Brian vital by the way for the

974
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:56,039
soil nice br's he hooked me up he's a

975
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:58,239
good guy uh but yeah and indoor I like

976
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:59,719
Coco for breeding I do you know for for

977
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:03,039
breeding and making seeds I typically

978
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:05,318
use cocoa uh for my moms I use Rock wal

979
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:07,318
and for my clones I use rockwool and

980
00:37:05,318 --> 00:37:10,800
that's the sterile side of it I try to

981
00:37:07,318 --> 00:37:12,719
be as sterile as possible um giving that

982
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:16,240
plant is much of an opportunity to be

983
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:18,399
clean and healthy and there's anything

984
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:20,118
wrong with soil and cocoa is great too

985
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,000
you can do cocoa for this stuff too but

986
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:27,440
like soil there's bugs so if you have a

987
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:29,400
nursery I think using a soil is not

988
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,200
necessarily the right choice for me if I

989
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:34,000
had a nursery and some people do it

990
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:35,439
really well butes for me it's like

991
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,199
Health it's an environment if you're

992
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,519
going with soil living soil like you

993
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:41,639
need to maintain that environment and

994
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:43,719
like that ecosystem if it goes out of

995
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:45,519
whack right you're have a problem yeah

996
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:47,679
and it's like uh well there's so many

997
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:49,920
things if you're selling clones to

998
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:51,199
people that you're expected you know

999
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,599
you're expected to have a clean clones

1000
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:54,879
they need to be virus free not everybody

1001
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:56,160
does this either but I feel like those

1002
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,800
are the standards that people should

1003
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:59,358
have if they're they're selling clones

1004
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,119
they should be clean of bugs you

1005
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:03,358
shouldn't have pests or pathogens those

1006
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,760
are the two like no no because then

1007
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:06,039
you're [ __ ] up the world and you're

1008
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,560
making it a worse place when you could

1009
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:09,679
be making it a better place by taking a

1010
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:10,880
couple important steps to get there and

1011
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:12,960
also if you're selling clones like

1012
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,519
you're shipping it somewhere presumably

1013
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,280
into a new environment like so could be

1014
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:19,039
introducing something that's fine in

1015
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,760
your environment but not wherever you're

1016
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:23,239
shipping it to exactly so and then you

1017
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,599
get all kinds of problems with that

1018
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:26,719
International scenes you guys are

1019

the the energy and the social aspect

1055
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:47,440

late and I get a you know I wake up

1059
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:55,078
pretty early too because we have events

1060
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:57,280

1068
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:17,520
good stuff hash has holes seen the our

1069
00:40:13,838 --> 00:40:17,519
gummies I have not seen the

1070
00:40:18,358 --> 00:40:22,838
gummies Rosen gummies are great I feel

1071
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:25,680
like Rosen gummies are

1072
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:30,279
stronger than uh they're more like full

1073
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:33,639
spectrum I mean like a dis

1074
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:36,040
on so these uh don't have any added

1075
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:37,719
flavoring they're just the The Strain

1076
00:40:36,039 --> 00:40:40,079
that's like really that's what you're

1077
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:43,439
tasting how many these are 10 milligrams

1078
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:45,519
yeah nice we'll have to try these later

1079
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,800
but they look amazing they look like

1080
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:48,800
nice big

1081
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,200
gumdrops it's interesting because a lot

1082
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,160
of people there's a lot of the cookie

1083
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:53,799
cutter gummies or the the ones that come

1084
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:55,679
on the The Press where they have like a

1085
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:58,920
machine that does it but I like these

1086
00:40:55,679 --> 00:41:00,279
they have a homemade feel to them feels

1087
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:02,480
a little more Boutique than just the

1088
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:05,720
cookie cutter stuff but it's a nice the

1089
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,679
Drop Like Gumdrop shape it's a nice like

1090
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:09,919
amount of gummy you know like you don't

1091
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:11,318
want like too small of a gummy no you

1092
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,838
don't cuz you're paying for it so you

1093
00:41:11,318 --> 00:41:14,318
don't there's value in the size of the

1094
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:16,119
gummy for whatever that matters

1095
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:19,800
something you there has to be something

1096
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:24,519
substantial you know

00:41:56,838 --> 00:42:01,759
and like that's what we were smoking on

1112
00:41:59,639 --> 00:42:03,239
like 70% of the people that I interview

1113
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,680
it's like yeah I got some from my

1114

00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:35,200
like who I don't know where he was

1127
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,800
getting it from but I it was probably

1128
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:39,480
like indoor New York like flower

1129
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:42,200
California stuff probably could have

1130
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:44,039
been some maybe yeah yeah but so the

1131
00:42:42,199 --> 00:42:46,519

1145
00:43:12,199 --> 00:43:15,558
like we were just smoking whatever the

1146
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:17,159
[ __ ] we were smoking yeah you know what

1147
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:19,400
were your favorite genetics when you

1148
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:21,078
were growing up cat piss cat piss cat

1149
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,079
piss was the favorite you know it's

1150
00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:24,960
funny cuz like ciss is coming back yeah

1151
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:27,119
we had some we're doing a documentary on

1152
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:30,679
ciss that's how much I like and I've got

1153
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:32,280
some people inv well my friend Jason has

1154
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:34,279
his cut but it's not the same cut that

1155
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:36,559
we had and I I found out because we had

1156
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:38,640
the this thing in the Bay Area capis was

1157
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:40,800
so big and this is going to be a lot of

1158
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:42,440
controversy for the show but there's a

1159
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,599
lot of capes out there there's not just

1160
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:46,599
one I think a lot of stuff with ammonia

1161
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:50,240
is catpiss like people call it catpiss

1162
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:52,200
because it has that that uh Aroma and so

1163
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:53,479
when it hits the nose it's aonia piss

1164
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:55,239
they you know it's not like calling

1165
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:57,159
something blue dream where somebody else

1166
00:43:55,239 --> 00:43:58,358
would take take that name and Associate

1167
00:43:57,159 --> 00:44:01,558
it with blue dream there's not an

1168
00:43:58,358 --> 00:44:03,679
association with the aroma so with the

1169
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:05,920
documentary we're going to dive into the

1170
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:08,598
history of the ciss that I know and then

1171
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,760
also the different smells of our ours

1172
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:12,400
what people consider to be ciss well

1173
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,720
ours was more of a super silver so there

1174
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:17,000
was super silver

1175
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:18,679
haze uh in the one that I remember that

1176
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,039
my friends grew uh one of the guys

1177
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:22,318
that's working with me now his name is

1178
00:44:20,039 --> 00:44:24,159
Matt he used to grow cat piss all the

1179
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:25,558
time and so we've researched it and I've

1180
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:26,920
got a hold of a couple other people that

1181
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:29,079
we were friends with we figured out

1182
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:30,400
exactly what the cross was which is

1183
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:33,200
definitely different and this was a

1184
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:35,480
longer flowering variety that was you

1185
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:37,279
know 12 to 14 weeks whereas some of the

1186
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:40,400
guys that have the cat other cat piss

1187
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:42,920
varieties those are very short flowering

1188
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:45,000
and so the aroma can express in

1189
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:47,159
different things but yeah cap his was

1190
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,599
good we had you know if I think of way

1191
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:52,440
back we had Maui woi that was amazing we

1192
00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:54,838
had some stuff that there was stuff that

1193
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:56,480
was just called purple bud that was like

1194
00:44:54,838 --> 00:44:59,558
[ __ ] purple and then there was like

1195
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:01,960
the Maui W was like yellow velvety Bud

1196
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:03,720
that was really good but like we had a i

1197
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:07,000
growing up in the Bay Area we had access

1198
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:08,318
to all kinds of different things I mean

1199
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,880
there was always different strains we

1200
00:45:08,318 --> 00:45:11,558
did have droughts too but there was

1201
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:14,039
people growing in their garages and

1202
00:45:11,559 --> 00:45:15,760
closets and before warehouses everybody

1203
00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:17,519
was growing in their closets or garages

1204
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,160
Romulan was a really good one but like

1205
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:21,679
if you talk about before cookies there

1206
00:45:19,159 --> 00:45:24,440
was so much stuff there was even before

1207
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:26,279
Tangi if we talk about like you know

1208
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:27,039
some of the oranges there was def some

1209
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:29,640
really

1210
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:31,358
oranges some of the the great real

1211
00:45:29,639 --> 00:45:33,400
skunky weed we never called it roadkill

1212
00:45:31,358 --> 00:45:35,119
skunk but it was skunky it was like

1213
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,240
skunk but they called it strawberry and

1214
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:38,240
we picked it up in Santa Cruz and it was

1215
00:45:37,239 --> 00:45:40,558
called strawberry because it was

1216
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:43,799
strawberry sized nuggets but it was

1217
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:46,000
skunk it was like skunk like like

1218
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:47,800
sprayed skunk smell like super strong

1219
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,920
like if you it's something I would

1220
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:51,880
associate with roadkill skunk if that

1221
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,280
would be a roadkill skunk to me like

1222
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:54,838
smells like right dead off the side of

1223
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,400
the road they calling it strawberries

1224
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:58,000
they just called it strawberries

1225
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,119
so but then I and I'd never heard the

1226
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,639
term road kill skunk that came out much

1227
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:06,838
later for me but uh yeah I love I love

1228
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:07,920
skunky chps I love GMOs I love chems I

1229
00:46:06,838 --> 00:46:09,880
love I like

1230
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,079
everything um at different times like

1231
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:13,119
all get burned

1232
00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:14,880
out I don't get too burned out on

1233
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:16,160
Skittles Skittles is one of those ones I

1234
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,800
can go back to but it's not strong what

1235
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:20,159
are you smoking on right now uh zetopia

1236

1240
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:33,920
amazing so but the zetopia got the the

1241
00:46:30,318 --> 00:46:36,199
candy turps I like candy turps but I

1242
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:38,200
also what was the last thing that wasn't

1243

Jacks so I have not seen good Jacks in a

1246
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:49,160
long time I've seen stuff that has

1247
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:51,119
similar expression like super silver

1248
00:46:49,159 --> 00:46:54,799
like I was smoking some super silver

1249
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:57,800
from Flor and Flame same company in

1250
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,800
Oakland

1251
00:46:59,719 --> 00:47:04,598
and uh there's some good you know

1252

1256
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:16,200
weed strong weed but really like it's

1257
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:19,359
energetic and it makes you feel really

1258
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:21,159
good like I like sativas like that and

1259
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:23,119
we've really West Coast has really gone

1260
00:47:21,159 --> 00:47:24,838
away from sativas for the most part

1261
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:29,039
there's little patches of and groups of

1262
00:47:24,838 --> 00:47:33,078
people that definitely like um sativas

1263
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:37,119
but so much candy gas I mean 20% of what

1264
00:47:33,079 --> 00:47:40,720
I'm feno hunting is candy 80 sorry 80%

1265
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:43,200
is candy and 20% is like the wild weird

1266
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:46,480
stuff we're popping some aaoca gold

1267
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:48,078
hybrids nice and some just random rare

1268
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,039
stuff rare stuff I've had that I feel

1269
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:52,000
like if I don't germinate now they I

1270
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:54,400
might not be able to it wouldn't that be

1271
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,639
a waste of holding seeds for a long time

1272
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:59,440
and not being able to ger genetics right

1273
00:47:56,639 --> 00:48:01,118
now that like are going to be extinct

1274
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,318
that aren't going to be around just get

1275
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:05,200
lost so much stuff got lost but now with

1276
00:48:03,318 --> 00:48:07,119
tissue culture and now with awareness

1277
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:10,960
and Technology will'll be able to save a

1278
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:12,880
lot of stuff I mean most of not all of

1279
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:15,079
but almost all of the genetics I grew up

1280
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:17,599
with those are gone you know it's like

1281
00:48:15,079 --> 00:48:21,800
people didn't preserve them the cap piss

1282
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:25,200
that we had gone for 25 years not 25

1283
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:27,318
sorry 2005 25 no it's been gone since

1284
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:30,279
2005 the real the one that we had I

1285
00:48:27,318 --> 00:48:32,679
haven't seen it in almost 20 years and

1286
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:34,559
but there would be like bra in a bag it

1287
00:48:32,679 --> 00:48:35,799
wasn't it didn't have a nice structure

1288
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:38,119
right so like sometimes it looks like

1289
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:40,318
shreds in a bag and if you just went by

1290
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:42,119
the look you'd say I don't want that I'm

1291
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:44,000
not going to pay $60 for something like

1292
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:46,760
that but yeah so New Jersey and then

1293
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,719
when did you move out here it's like

1294
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:52,200
seven years ago nice we moved pretty

1295
00:48:49,719 --> 00:48:54,598
quickly to La just like on the East

1296
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:57,199
Coast 2015 there wasn't a lot of people

1297
00:48:54,599 --> 00:49:00,599
pressing right Rin at that time it was

1298
00:48:57,199 --> 00:49:03,399
more built out in la la was huge for for

1299
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:05,640
extract La has been huge shatter it was

1300
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:08,559
they were crazy about their shatter yeah

1301
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:10,440
that's yeah pizza boxes for Shatter was

1302
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:11,599
invented in Los Angeles I believe some

1303
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:13,679
people are going to say Colorado and

1304
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:16,480
that might be true but it's one of them

1305
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:17,759
one of them but I remember going to a

1306
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:22,159
spot and they just

1307
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:24,319
had pizza freaking boes secret sashes oh

1308
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:28,879
yeah just set up with tables and just

1309
00:49:24,318 --> 00:49:32,239
slinging yeah I'm gramming slabs oh yeah

1310
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:34,200
dabbing them holy water they had the

1311
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:37,719
original sauce right there was just

1312
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:39,239
straight sauce that was next level and

1313
00:49:37,719 --> 00:49:40,558
even High Times didn't even know how to

1314
00:49:39,239 --> 00:49:44,479
judge it in

1315
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:46,680
2013 at the cup in Denver uh we went

1316
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:48,880
there with the holy water guys big shout

1317
00:49:46,679 --> 00:49:50,279
out holy water all you guys that aren't

1318
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:53,079
with holy water they're doing your own

1319
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:55,599
thing everybody good people but uh we

1320
00:49:53,079 --> 00:49:56,798
were at the cup in Denver together we

1321
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:58,400
entered it through our company because

1322
00:49:56,798 --> 00:50:00,798
we're entering some stuff and then we

1323
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:04,119
entered it for them with our brand and

1324
00:50:00,798 --> 00:50:06,440
the judges apologized to us because they

1325
00:50:04,119 --> 00:50:08,318
said that we can't judge this against

1326
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:10,599
all this other stuff it's so different

1327
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:13,960
that it's amazing but it's so different

1328
00:50:10,599 --> 00:50:16,039
and so we didn't we didn't place with it

1329
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:17,599
and what was it what was what how did

1330
00:50:16,039 --> 00:50:20,400
you make it it was sauce no so what they

1331
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:21,880
were doing I believe and you know I it

1332
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:25,119
was a secret back then but I believe

1333
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:25,960
they were doing uh extraction and then

1334
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:30,318
they were

1335
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:31,920
uh slowly off gassing with uh dry ice is

1336
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:32,960
what I believe it was yeah whatever kind

1337
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,559
of extraction they were doing and

1338
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,798
they're slowly off gassing they were

1339
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:40,680
capturing the turps and it would be a

1340
00:50:35,798 --> 00:50:43,119
sauce and this sauce was like high 20%

1341
00:50:40,679 --> 00:50:43,798
tpin and you could just pour it right in

1342
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:46,280
the

1343
00:50:43,798 --> 00:50:48,358
rig and so they gave me this big box and

1344
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:49,640
I was going around just pouring it for

1345
00:50:48,358 --> 00:50:51,400
everybody and people were tripping

1346
00:50:49,639 --> 00:50:53,279
because you're used to doing you know we

1347
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:56,000
had the guys doing the [ __ ] one G

1348
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:57,720
snakes back then and stuff like that

1349
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,599
was just straight pouring [ __ ] yeah

1350
00:50:57,719 --> 00:51:01,838
they were just pouring the yeah and it's

1351
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:04,440
like TPS and it's like TPS to your face

1352
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:06,639
yeah and uh turps can change the high

1353
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:09,559
completely so they can also mellow the

1354
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:12,400
high out some turps just mellow it out

1355
00:51:09,559 --> 00:51:14,559
completely so besides the cannaboids I

1356
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:17,160
feel like tpin can really dictate the

1357
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,400
way you feel the effect so tell me how

1358
00:51:17,159 --> 00:51:22,759
you met

1359
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:28,160

terpinolene loning and there's not a lot

1435
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:40,679
of depth to it you got to smoke it it

1436
00:54:37,519 --> 00:54:43,838
smokes like lemon yeah lemon hazy lemon

1437
00:54:40,679 --> 00:54:45,719
it's not it's it's really citrusy and it

1438
00:54:43,838 --> 00:54:48,519
doesn't have a lot of depth but the real

1439
00:54:45,719 --> 00:54:50,838
Jack is you know it's amazing it's got a

1440
