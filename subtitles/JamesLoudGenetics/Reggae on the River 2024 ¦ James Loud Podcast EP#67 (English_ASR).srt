76
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:14,238
months ago or so we were on for the

77
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:16,000
podcast y I was on for the podcast and

78
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,358

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,319
to dinner and uh and it's one of those

80
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,758
things you know sometimes you can

81
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:22,120
mention something like this oh man R get

82
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:24,520
in the river is going on you should come

83
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,759
up and a lot of times people just want

84
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:27,560

85
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,840

88
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,198
want to take you up on this I think it's

89
00:04:32,918 --> 00:04:36,959
a great opportunity to not just do

90
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,360
podcasting and and get out there and

91
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:41,439
talk to our audience but to get back

92
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,360
into the roots and and like the magic

93
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:46,680
that surrounded us with in regards to

94
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,319
this plan right as we go more commercial

95
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,079
as we go more legal things are changing

96
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:53,399
man and it and it's very very important

97
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:55,159
for us to remember where we came from

98
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:57,519
and and the magic that happened in these

99
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:00,280
Hills you know these mountains the we're

100
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:02,799
here abolutely that's where we all our

101
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:05,799
teeth with this plant you know 30 40

102
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,520
years ago for some of us um so it's

103
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,120
important man it's it's all about coming

104
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:11,159
back being a part of the the Cannabis

105
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,160
Community here in southern humo County

106
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,680
in the anald triangle and giving back

107
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,439
and sharing and all that good stuff it's

108
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,038
great cuz you meet the nicest people

109
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,800
here too it's like everybody's in a good

110
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:23,879
mood everyone's happy to be here uh I

111
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,960
think there's more cannabis consuming

112
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:27,560
alcohol which plays a huge role to like

113
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:29,239
the people tuning in rather than tuning

114
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,280
out sure and it's a lot of fun not that

115
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,800
there's anything wrong with a couple

116
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:34,799
beers or anything like that's always

117
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,759
great but I feel like people here are

118
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,199
tuned in and it's great to be around a

119
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:41,240
whole bunch of people that are tuned in

120
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:43,080
what's going on and happy uh just just

121
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,879

122
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:46,279
going at home is going on at home when

123
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:47,800
you're here you're here and it's just an

124
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:50,318
amazing feeling to be around people that

125
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,319

142
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:31,839
cuz these next couple months

143
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:33,198
you might even still be sexing plants

144
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:34,918
like this time of year Outdoors if

145
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,759
you're going regular seats you know like

146
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:38,359
this the time of year y you know plants

147
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:40,000
are big the bigger ones show their sex

148
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,160
early on typically but you'll still get

149
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,199
some oh absolutely we've all been caught

150
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,720
off guard you know seed companies have

151
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,439
been built off of that you know big time

152
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,800
amaz time so yeah man it's it's really

153
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:54,319
good I think you know everybody being in

154
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:57,478
a good mood I think it's it's where

155
00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:00,199
we're at right now where where people

156
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:02,000
you know postco I think that that was

157
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:04,960
you know a traumatic thing for for

158
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,279
people like us our tribe our our culture

159
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:11,239
We Gather we we like to Circle up and

160
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:12,878
ceremony and uh and those years man it

161
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,598
was really difficult for us to so of get

162
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:17,120
back to something like this and and

163
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:19,399
where we can actually share in all the

164

Donnie burger and it's maybe the best

501
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:48,038
Donnie Burger I've ever

502
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:49,879

00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,280
the TPS on that yeah you just push on

505
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,839
the button there's a little bit on there

506
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:59,879
to get a nice fat

507
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:00,879
hit that is T yeah it's like candy it's

508
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,760
kind of

509
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,559
like candy popcorn tasting like in a

510
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:07,759
good way not like the negative side of

511
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:09,399
popcorn no no not the really sweet it's

512
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:11,158
just that bright kind of flavor but it's

513
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,000
like right there it's it's I think it

514
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:16,720

529
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,240
belt one time thing you know you grow up

530
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,960
with WWF when you're when you're

531
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:54,240
bringing a belt to the table huh it's a

532
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:56,200
fight I wi man I'm definitely down

533
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,720
anything that you touch like I said you

534
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,278
you've been absolutely killing it as far

535
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,640
as the genetics

536
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:03,839
been a long F because you geek out on

537
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:06,120
the r you have a huge respect for land

538
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:08,558
race I know you geek out on the more

539
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:11,558
unique and in special things not just

540
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:13,158
the the trending stuff right I sometimes

541
00:22:11,558 --> 00:22:14,839
think that with the market we we're

542
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:16,159
stuck on this one thing yeah that

543
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:18,079
doesn't mean we can't try to sneak

544
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,600
things in to get people interested

545
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:21,399
things where they're like oh yeah this

546
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:23,839
is cool it's got the look it's got the

547
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,120
smell maybe it has something unique

548
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:27,599
about it you know like it's exactly true

549
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:28,959
and you hear and you know this I'm sure

550
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:31,519
I have friends up here on the the hill

551
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,038
that they're sneaking sour d back in

552
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:34,158
they're bringing blue diamond back in

553
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:36,720
like they're bringing some of these

554
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,240
these fun things from kind of Circa 9s

555
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,240
2000 a lot of this stuff is just

556
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,440
reoccurring so like Don Burger is

557
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:46,839
supposed to be it's like a S1 of GMO GMO

558
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,640
is basically a stronger version of Kim D

559
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:51,278
so really you're getting the evolution

560
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,559
of Kim Kim dog like Kim dog D in my

561
00:22:51,278 --> 00:22:55,679
opinion all this stuff is it came from

562
00:22:53,558 --> 00:22:57,798
there like we can recognize that and we

563
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,759
can appreciate it and it's special for

564
00:22:57,798 --> 00:23:02,319
some of smok it as long as I have to be

565
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:03,960
able to see the evolution I don't feel

566
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:05,678
special but I really feel special being

567
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,558
part of this bigger thing it's so

568
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,880
amazing that we're here and we're part

569
00:23:07,558 --> 00:23:11,399
of this thing too and it's like I think

570
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:13,080
it's a mentality you and I both Carri

571
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,120
like for us and not toight I mean

572
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:16,519
there's some people that are so build

573
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:18,479
busy building their name and building

574
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:20,918
their brand and the Ary doesn't escape

575
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,120
you it's James live genetics but but

576
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:25,278
you've never made it about you you're

577
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:27,399
like me it's always been an us and we

578
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:28,798
not an i and me and like you get that

579
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,679
which again I think that's why you're

580
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:33,038
having success on the global stage like

581
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:35,240
seeing friends of mine from the Czech

582
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:37,440
Republic and from Italy and from Germany

583
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,120
coming up to your booth as spous like

584
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,440

585
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:43,959
book I want like that's freaking sick I

586
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,679
I didn't even tell any Barry Jan yeah I

587
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,880
had a friend flying from Austria

588
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:50,080
actually this guy's buddies with him

589
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,840
this guy just bet he's like he listening

590
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:53,319
to your podcast with James loud on the

591

flight over he's like dude he's like

592
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:58,240
that guy's killing I'm like 100% because

593
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,600
he cares about this community not just

594
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,120
about about the industry and where it's

595
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:04,000
going you know so definitely you got it

596
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:05,678

597
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
with it I have a good team that I work

598
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:11,440
with and it's like they make be and it's

599
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
just it's a group effort and it's like

600
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,919
it's also the group we're highlighting

most amazing stories for people dude I

604
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:22,199
love that some of our guests are just

605
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:24,879
some of the guests I think that are

606
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,880
going to be like okay they might yeah

607
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,919
could go either either way and sometimes

608
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,919
they just knock it out of the park you

609
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:34,200
know it's like Julie from SK magazine

610

00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:43,158
back in the day and when Julie came on

613
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:45,398

614
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:47,720
of our interview it was kind of like how

615
00:24:45,398 --> 00:24:50,398
our interview went I got the same

616

617
00:24:50,398 --> 00:24:56,918
say and she said it it's such a precise

618
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,840
way and it was so amazing and you just

619
00:24:56,919 --> 00:24:59,320
never know when you're going to get

620
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:00,839
those moments with people in their life

621
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:02,678
where when you're interviewing they hit

622
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:04,240
it out of the park and I've been

623
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:07,840

purpose for whatever that was I feel

685
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:28,519
like I'm serving a purpose that's much

686
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:30,839
greater than myself that we're all part

687
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:32,519
of it like I'm just like this Catalyst

688

690
00:27:33,798 --> 00:27:36,599
you balance a lot man I mean that's the

691
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:39,038
thing like you just talked about earlier

692
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:41,719
but I I remember you remember another

693
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:44,398
funny story we talked about our podcast

694
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:46,558
over a mutual uh buddies at Ros Do's

695
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:48,199
house and we smoked through everything I

696
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:50,759
brought everything I grew and and

697
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,519
brought along and so he bought us out a

698
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:55,158
bag I mean straight out of our youth man

699
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:56,640
it it was like Mom's sandwich bag I'm

700
00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:57,840
like God this smells like fire this

701
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,399
looks like fire I'm like where'd you get

702
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:01,319
this like I got from James I'm like in

703
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:04,000
this

704
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:06,158
bag well of course get me used to it

705
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,119
baggy so that's how I came up with the

706
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,600
doing the collab with you but I think

707
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:10,879
it's those kind of stories man and

708
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:13,678
people don't understand it's such a

709
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,840
tight Niche Network and again you and I

710
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,679
are even more unique in that that

711
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:20,119
Network expands internationally like we

712
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:22,240
have mutual friends throughout Europe

713
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:23,759
Australia yeah everywhere I run into

714
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:27,440
guys are like oh I messing with James J

715

so so you are J I think you're in the

719
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,159
perfect

720
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:38,720
place yeah I love it I'm glad that it's

721
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:41,080
working out you know it's a struggle

722
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,839
right now for some people and I'm pretty

723
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:45,398
happy with where I'm at right now like

724
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:47,480
it's it's it's a great place you know

725
00:28:45,398 --> 00:28:48,879
it's like it is a struggle life is a

726
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,798
struggle so we make it through the hard

727
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,159
times and then the times get better and

728
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:54,278
then there's more hard times in the

729
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:57,720
future but then they get better and it's

730
00:28:54,278 --> 00:29:00,640
like AB this industry is amazing though

731
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,720
it's like uh right when you think and

732
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,080
the thing with t walk is like right

733
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,240
you're another reason that I still

734
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:08,759
believe in new things because right when

735
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:11,480
you think you got it all figured out you

736
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:14,720
I'm I'm old right I'm not old old but

737
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:16,960
where we're gen xers so I feel like look

738
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,558
I I figured it all out right like that's

739
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,960
when like I thought I figured out with

740
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:22,158
lighting and I didn't need LED if they

741
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,880
were garbage the blur bols whatever now

742
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:27,039
LEDs are the [ __ ] they

743
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:30,120
perfected may they perfected them

744
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:31,558
they've improved them to amazing Dee now

745
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:33,319
with canopies and all these things but

746
00:29:31,558 --> 00:29:35,639
tur it's like right when I thought I

747
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:37,960
knew how to cure weed complely along

748
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,080
something that makes me go [ __ ] I I

749
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:41,679
could have done it differently and this

750
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:43,599
makes the product better right minded I

751
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,919
mean I you triing I have friends that

752
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:47,678
hate the trim rush I love the trim rush

753
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,600
I'm a huge trim Rush finger trimming and

your bud huge props to you man because

757
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,640
yeah there's some things that may be a

758
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:58,880
little bit better trim that came out of

759
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,480
the 80s but like but it's not one of

760

00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:12,880
they're not going to get harsh not at

765
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,798
all not at all man so I agree with you

766
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,080
like the technology and that's what you

767
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:17,359
probably notice this as well that's what

768
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:18,759
we do love about the international

769
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:20,240
market is we aren't talking to people

770
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:22,158
that think they know everything they're

771
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,558
like hey you're from noral man you've

772
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,600
seen it all like you've probably come a

773
00:30:23,558 --> 00:30:27,558
long way with some of the things you do

774
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:29,038
what is that yeah let me tell it's like

775
00:30:27,558 --> 00:30:31,119

00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:32,919
spous like oh you want like genetics

at what James loud has so there's people

779

out there but it seems like to your

780
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:40,839
point internationally they are more like

781
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,960
us so they're open to this being an

782
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:45,720
evolution not a revolution an evolution

783
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,840

976
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:52,440

977
00:39:50,838 --> 00:39:55,880
the most amazing musicians have come out

978
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:58,280
of Jamaica Lots definitely definitely

979
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:00,920
definitely without I doubt you

980
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:02,319
know yeah man and we are the ones them

981
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:05,480
right now where

982
00:40:02,318 --> 00:40:07,318
really keeping that energy alive keeping

983
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:09,800
that spiritual energy alive in the

984
00:40:07,318 --> 00:40:12,400
Western Hemisphere right now you know

985
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:14,400
what I mean yeah so what do you

986
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,800
think why why do you think so many

987
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,079
amazing artists come out of Jamaica you

988
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,200
think it's partially the struggle and

989
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:19,839
the ones that have made it past the

990
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:21,759
struggle and then they can sing about it

991
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:26,880
well that's a part of it the struggle is

992
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:29,280
a part of it but the culture too and and

993
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,640
and then the bloodline itself you know

994
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:35,680
right for sure yeah black people on a

995
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:39,799
whole is is is is more lean towards art

996
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:44,399
and and culture you know I mean yeah so

997
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:47,160
the culture of Raa far to is is is is is

998
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:50,160
is a big influence and why so much

999
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:53,799

1017
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:44,599
thech message

1018
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:45,880
yeah and there's a lot I feel like

1019
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:48,000
there's a lot of responsibility with

1020
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:49,800
something like that you know I I think

1021
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,318
there's there's so much importance

1022
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:55,720
that's for me is not an option we can't

1023
00:41:53,318 --> 00:41:58,119
fail so we have to get the real

1024
00:41:55,719 --> 00:42:01,000
connection them just like connect with

1025
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:03,000
the eye now so we have to go and get the

1026
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,318
right connection them to the right

1027
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,358

1030
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:13,240
fall into place and it's like we're here

1031
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:16,199

1033
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:21,480

00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:36,159

00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:38,720
we ran it a few times at our local uh

Fairgrounds yeah and then they changed

1079
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:43,439
laws about how we could do the events

1080
00:44:41,239 --> 00:44:45,799
right and so we had to get so we waited

1081
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:48,039
a few years and then during co uh we

1082
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:49,519
couldn't really do events in California

1083
00:44:48,039 --> 00:44:52,279
so we're like let's take this thing on

1084

1108
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:49,519
community event up here Canabis is a

1109
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:52,639
bigger thing to our community up here

1110
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:54,318
it's really a experience of generational

1111
00:45:52,639 --> 00:45:55,519
kind of thing and whatnot so it it

1112
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:57,039
totally makes the world a better place

1113
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:58,800
and we can all agree on that you know

1114
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:00,719
completely no it brings a lot of good

1115
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,400
people together all the people I know

1116
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:04,279
yeah and and you look at the generations

1117
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,720
right we have this I'm a little older

1118
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:08,800
now and we have this up and cominging

1119
00:46:05,719 --> 00:46:10,558
generation of passionate cannabis

1120
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,960
enthusiasts people that have grew up

1121
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:13,519
with the plan for the time they were

1122
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:16,559
born right like

1123
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:17,880
definitely with technology and the plant

1124
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:20,160
and I think they're going to be carrying

1125
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:22,280
the torch eventually well we put the

00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:28,399
what we're trying to do and that's kind

1129
00:46:26,199 --> 00:46:29,679
of what our community is doing right now

1130
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,519
coming together I feel like we're going

1131
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:34,480
through a Cann ofis Renaissance

1132

absolutely you know I really do and um

1133
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:39,760
it's bringing some of the real heads

1134
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:41,959
together to navigate the future you know

1135
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:45,119
that's really how it is and there's a

1136
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:47,679
lot of things that have shifted yeah uh

1137
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:49,240
you know concerts in general festivals

1138
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:51,598
and then the whole cannabis World kind

1139
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:54,078
of gotten turned around the last few

1140
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:56,119
years I would say and so we're trying to

1141
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:57,800
represent the future of uh bringing that

1142
00:46:56,119 --> 00:47:00,160
together well we'll bring in this whole

1143
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:02,400
thing to other events for have our full

1144

Festival proper in humbold and other

1145
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,800
places you know yeah I mean it's a

1146
00:47:04,519 --> 00:47:08,358
beautiful thing carry on Legacy right of

1147
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,880
something that's so much bigger than

1148
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:13,078
ourselves on all levels with the stuff

1149
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,480
that people are doing now and I think

1150
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:17,200
there's still browny pushers there's

1151
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:19,760
people still changing the game trying to

1152
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:21,598
make a better plan a better product for

1153
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:24,280
the end user something that's more

1154
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:27,519
special that has you know different

1155
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:31,200
flavors or different effects got me into

1156
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:33,239
this I started you grow my own herb yeah

1157
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:34,719
when I was like 16 I grew a few plants

1158
00:47:33,239 --> 00:47:37,039
and put them out in the back of the ball

1159
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:39,838
park where I grew up playing baseball

1160
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:42,239
and whatnot cuz I learned about compost

1161
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:44,239
yeah and that the soil was active and

1162
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:46,479
super rich and I thought if I was going

1163
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:48,199
to plant some weed in the woods and not

1164
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,358
have to go back to it as often I needed

1165
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:52,358
to find some soil that was rich could

1166
00:47:50,358 --> 00:47:54,159
hold a lot of moisture and nutrients and

1167
00:47:52,358 --> 00:47:56,358
stuff and I was learning about that [ __ ]

1168
00:47:54,159 --> 00:47:58,838
at school and they've been dumping all

1169
00:47:56,358 --> 00:48:01,078
these um leave piles but sweeping all

1170
00:47:58,838 --> 00:48:02,400
the streets outside of Philly wow in the

1171
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:04,680
back of the park they' have been dumping

1172
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,680
this [ __ ] for 50 60 years yeah so there

1173
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:08,440
was some compost piles at the far end of

1174
00:48:06,679 --> 00:48:11,279
that that were just I planted my first

1175
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:13,838
place there and the light came on and

1176
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:16,760
then I moved to California right when

1177
00:48:13,838 --> 00:48:18,920
they started writing scripts and I was

1178
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:20,359
growing my own weed in my house like

1179
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:21,920
soon as I moved to California I was like

1180
00:48:20,358 --> 00:48:24,039
oh okay now it's legal and I have this

1181
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:26,280
little insurance card right and then I

1182
00:48:24,039 --> 00:48:29,119
open my own grow shop so I've been

1183
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:31,720
helping will grow for over 23 years it's

1184
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:34,160
awesome and then doing the whale stuff

1185
00:48:31,719 --> 00:48:36,239
but producing this whole community

1186
00:48:34,159 --> 00:48:38,719
events is kind of like that's my true

1187
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:40,838
love and for sure that's kind of where

1188
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:42,879
it all comes together yeah that's where

1189
00:48:40,838 --> 00:48:44,519
I spending my time right now mostly I

1190
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,400
love the collected Consciousness right

1191
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:48,280
like all this effort from people in

1192
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,559
these different directions all coming

1193
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:52,319
together and events like this happening

1194
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:54,200
and events like yours how that are

1195
00:48:52,318 --> 00:48:57,199
happening and how it ties into the

1196
00:48:54,199 --> 00:49:01,159
industry and you know it's it's pretty

1197
00:48:57,199 --> 00:49:04,279
amazing I was born at the time 77 and

1198
00:49:01,159 --> 00:49:07,719
we're 76 here 76 yeah so we're the same

1199
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:11,280
they're basically the same age right and

1200
00:49:07,719 --> 00:49:13,679
yeah I'm a dragon so yeah same same fire

1201
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:16,079
dragon Scorpio Dragon yeah I'm at the

1202
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:17,078
last the tail end of in 77 cuz Chinese

1203
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:20,200
New Year

1204
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:23,440
end but uh yeah dude we're a special

1205
00:49:20,199 --> 00:49:25,159
time because when we grew up it wasn't

1206
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,480
popular it wasn't the popular opinion

1207
00:49:25,159 --> 00:49:30,199
that cannabis is okay it was a small

1208
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:31,199
group of people that said no it is okay

1209
00:49:30,199 --> 00:49:32,838
they're going to go to jail for it

1210
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:35,318
they're going to do whatever and the

1211
00:49:32,838 --> 00:49:37,798
kids today are being brought up in a

1212
00:49:35,318 --> 00:49:39,880
world that's normalizing it slowly but

1213
00:49:37,798 --> 00:49:41,039
surely right 100% way different than

1214
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:43,079
when we were younger and people were

1215
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:45,519
getting 32 year 100 Year prison

1216
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:47,400
sentences some of even like Richard Deli

1217
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:49,880
served 32 years of 100 Year sentence

1218
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:54,200
100% yeah no it's a different world and

1219
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:57,838
it's um it's way more open yeah we can

1220
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:59,318
be attracts more people and so many

1221
00:49:57,838 --> 00:50:01,519
people have found the medicine because

1222
00:49:59,318 --> 00:50:03,880
of well we can talk about things like

1223
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:06,119
this podcast all the time we can like

1224
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:07,480
pop up now in the middle of reg on the

1225
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:10,119
River where everybody's been smoking

1226
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:12,280
weed forever yeah so it's almost an

1227
00:50:10,119 --> 00:50:15,039
interesting scenario being here I ree

1228
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:17,280
with like the legal weed scene right in

1229
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:20,039
the like heart of the outlaw cannabis

1230
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:21,880
culture right right absolutely so it's

1231
00:50:20,039 --> 00:50:23,039
like originally it was like well I don't

1232
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:26,079
know how are people are going to react

1233
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:30,119
to like legal weed being in the space

1234
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:32,079
but our whole Community is so rooted in

1235
00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:34,838
the what the future of cannabis looks

1236
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:37,760
like yeah and we have like Legends of

1237
00:50:34,838 --> 00:50:41,039
the past it's rooted in what the future

1238
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:42,799
can be truly and it's it's undiscovered

1239
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:45,239
I feel and it's like well the potential

1240
00:50:42,798 --> 00:50:47,639
is so great who knows what's going to

1241
00:50:45,239 --> 00:50:49,519
happen but the potential is so great you

1242
00:50:47,639 --> 00:50:51,519
can see the direction the trajectory is

1243
00:50:49,519 --> 00:50:53,838
going in the right direction at the end

1244
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:57,280
of the day 100 years from now cannabis

1245
00:50:53,838 --> 00:50:59,000
will fully be normalized we won't have

1246
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,200
any of the haters like we do now there

1247
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,400
might be some haters or whatever but it

1248
00:51:00,199 --> 00:51:04,078
won't be the same right people will

1249
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,160
understand it a lot more you know

1250
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:08,079
especially not growing up in a world

1251
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:11,639
where they criminalized it and they made

1252
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:13,599
it they made us Outlaws right we were

1253
00:51:11,639 --> 00:51:15,358
it's a plant we're talking about a plant

1254
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:18,240
here that they turned all of us into

1255
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:20,039
Outlaws and said we were bad yeah and

1256
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:22,399
now that's changing over that we're

1257
00:51:20,039 --> 00:51:23,719
normal people too we're not hurting

1258
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,200
anybody and I feel like as long as

1259
00:51:23,719 --> 00:51:27,239
you're not hurting anybody what's the

1260
00:51:26,199 --> 00:51:28,358
harm you know what I mean like you

1261
00:51:27,239 --> 00:51:30,679
should be able you should have the

1262
00:51:28,358 --> 00:51:32,920
freedom live a country of Freedom you

1263
00:51:30,679 --> 00:51:36,078
should have the freedom to consume

1264
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:37,358
things that don't hurt other people uh

1265
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:39,039
you know obviously you don't want stuff

1266
00:51:37,358 --> 00:51:41,119
that could potentially harm somebody but

1267
00:51:39,039 --> 00:51:43,440
at the same time like we should have the

1268
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:46,160
right to use plant medicine too what

1269
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:48,480
that that's just a such a crazy thing

1270
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:50,679
right it's it's not just a plan that's

1271
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:53,400
the problem right so it's such a special

1272
00:51:50,679 --> 00:51:56,759
plan that it competes in the market with

1273
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:57,920
all these Pharmaceuticals right and but

1274
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:59,160
they're going to have to accept it

1275
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,639
they're going to have to we used plant

1276
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:02,679
medicine for thousands of years you know

1277
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:04,558
and we need to go back to it because

1278
00:52:02,679 --> 00:52:07,078
when you talk about homeostasis and the

1279
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:08,440
body being in an optimal condition

1280
00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:10,519
cannabis can be a big part of that

1281
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:12,880
whether it's neurologically or

1282
00:52:10,519 --> 00:52:15,798
physically so that's say it's special

1283
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:17,240

00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:44,920
it's just we don't have to be in the

1297
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:48,079

1301
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:58,920
we've done it a few times since we'll do

1302
00:52:55,639 --> 00:53:01,000
it again this us this year for can ofest

1303
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:03,079
yeah really on the Sunday morning we

1304
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,199
come March it through town and it's a

1305
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:07,039
cannabis Pride Parade yeah and the first

1306
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:08,439
time we did this we had a whole a whole

1307
00:53:07,039 --> 00:53:10,440
crew of us we wrote all these

1308
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:12,599
affirmations kind of like you know out

1309
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:15,480
of the shade and into the light you know

1310
00:53:12,599 --> 00:53:18,920
and really it is about being proud of

1311
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:23,000
something and having to not hide what

1312
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:25,880
you care so much about or necessarily be

1313
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:29,280
looked in a way that doesn't even align

1314
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:32,160
with yeah what's going on you know I

1315
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:33,359
feel you it is a positive plan and it

1316
00:53:32,159 --> 00:53:35,159
makes the world a better place at the

1317
00:53:33,358 --> 00:53:37,679
end of the day man it's just such a

1318
00:53:35,159 --> 00:53:40,399
positive thing

1319
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:43,078
that a lot of us find comfort in it a

1320
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:46,119
lot of us you know we our social network

1321
00:53:43,079 --> 00:53:47,640
is built around it you know I feel like

1322
00:53:46,119 --> 00:53:49,880
it's a it's a beautiful thing and then

1323
00:53:47,639 --> 00:53:52,279
this whole Community was built around it

1324
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:54,240
we on the shoulders of cannabis

1325
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:56,599
definitely right here at the heart of

1326
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:59,318
Ray G on the river that couldn't be more

1327
00:53:56,599 --> 00:54:02,039
true right it's like this whole this

1328
00:53:59,318 --> 00:54:05,279
whole venue here at the mat Community

1329
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:07,079
Center and the other businesses that

1330
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,640
make this happen and support what we're

1331
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:12,480
doing

1332
00:54:09,639 --> 00:54:14,159
um it's all built on the Canabis culture

1333
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:16,000
I mean I feel like if you look at the

1334
00:54:14,159 --> 00:54:17,598
community that feeds the community right

1335
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,760
the trickle down economics within the

1336
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:22,720
community yeah uh where it goes down

1337
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:25,160
where how how it's supposed to work in

1338
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:26,879
in the real world which it doesn't right

1339
00:54:25,159 --> 00:54:28,598
but in this community it does cuz these

1340
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,039
people feed the other people in the

1341
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:31,119
community they they buy stuff from the

1342
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:32,960
other people in the community we all

1343
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:34,280
support each other and I feel like the

1344
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:37,358
canis industry is really good and

1345
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:40,040
humbled even more so with everywhere

1346
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:41,159
with within the money the cash system is

1347
00:54:40,039 --> 00:54:44,079
where it's at though I've been here for

1348
00:54:41,159 --> 00:54:45,798
20 I lived the rumble for 24 years it

1349
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:48,880
didn't take long to figure out what was

1350
00:54:45,798 --> 00:54:50,920
going on as far as you know I opened up

1351
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:54,880
a groc store and I didn't even know

1352
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:57,280
anybody about tomatoes in we yeah I mean

1353
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:59,599
I used to go in Garden we had to say

1354
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:01,119
tomato garden they were a great customer

1355
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:03,760
and a client and good friends and

1356
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:05,960
supporters of us for years House and

1357
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:09,319
Garden was something that uh we brought

1358
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:11,079
yeah to the US and U from Holland I

1359
00:55:09,318 --> 00:55:13,119
thought let's connect humbold and

1360
00:55:11,079 --> 00:55:15,359
Holland nice what are they using for

1361
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:16,920
nutrients over there and just tapped

1362
00:55:15,358 --> 00:55:17,719
into that yeah I got a lot of friends in

1363
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:21,119
the

1364
00:55:17,719 --> 00:55:24,358
industry uh Josh Freeman he sold to

1365
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:27,720
growa he sold growa to Botanicare way

1366
00:55:24,358 --> 00:55:29,880
back in the day or but yeah I mean I

1367
00:55:27,719 --> 00:55:32,318
grew up this area a lot of not not this

1368
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:35,640
area but California yeah for sure and so

1369
00:55:32,318 --> 00:55:37,400
the connections are deep you know

1370
00:55:35,639 --> 00:55:39,078
great and then we're all tied to the

1371
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:40,798
Grateful Dead which is even more of a

1372
00:55:39,079 --> 00:55:43,839
wild thing right like there's this whole

1373
00:55:40,798 --> 00:55:45,280
Grateful Dead tie within the bay area of

1374
00:55:43,838 --> 00:55:48,358
people that love the dead that have

1375
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:50,039
great stories about the dead that are

1376
00:55:48,358 --> 00:55:52,679
more or less an evolution of the

1377
00:55:50,039 --> 00:55:54,280
Grateful Dead in our own expression

1378
00:55:52,679 --> 00:55:56,719
right and that's that's the most amazing

1379
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:59,599
thing to be part of that as well from

1380
00:55:56,719 --> 00:56:01,078
California it's like Logan Brewery I use

1381
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:04,400
that as an example all the time Tony

1382
00:56:01,079 --> 00:56:06,240
McGee I believe he is an evolution of

1383
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:08,240
the Grateful Dead in his own expression

1384
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:10,279
and just as powerful and just as amazing

1385
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:12,679
creative expression yeah and it's like I

1386
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:14,359
do my stuff and it's it evolves out of

1387
00:56:12,679 --> 00:56:15,879
the Grateful Dead like the Cannabis

1388
00:56:14,358 --> 00:56:17,798
scene evolved out of the Grateful Dead

1389
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:19,400
too of course of course and other things

1390
00:56:17,798 --> 00:56:20,920
too but the Grateful Dead was a heavy

1391
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:23,160
influence and and part of the reason

1392
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:25,838
we're here today that whole movement in

1393
00:56:23,159 --> 00:56:28,038
the 60s and 70s I mean that's why you

1394
00:56:25,838 --> 00:56:31,038
know this we brought we're bringing oot

1395
00:56:28,039 --> 00:56:36,559
and friends to danif fest with Steve

1396
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:38,680

1397
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:40,480

1399
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,920
it's going to be a blast dude it's going

1400
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:47,559
to be a lot D yeah I can't wait it's

1401
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:50,720
going to be epic we wanted to bring the

1402
00:56:47,559 --> 00:56:53,440
festival goers together with the

1403
00:56:50,719 --> 00:56:55,679
cannabis event goers because it's a

1404
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:58,079
tough thing to do we've been a lot of

1405
00:56:55,679 --> 00:57:00,798
events seen you know a lot of times

1406
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:02,519
people don't show up for the music or

1407
00:57:00,798 --> 00:57:05,318
they don't show up for the weed it's

1408
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:06,960
like it's always hard to hit both sure

1409
00:57:05,318 --> 00:57:09,519
because of the way the laws kind of make

1410
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:12,199
it separate so we've always tried our

1411
00:57:09,519 --> 00:57:14,559
best to like integrate what we're doing

1412
00:57:12,199 --> 00:57:17,519
and normalize the herb so it kind of

1413
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:21,079
Fest we do it on a 3 and 1 12 acre part

1414
00:57:17,519 --> 00:57:23,480

1416
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:27,760
always just like the weather that time

1417
00:57:25,639 --> 00:57:29,598
of year is like it'll be like 73 degrees

1418
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:32,720

1421
00:57:35,159 --> 00:57:39,838

1422

1520
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:55,920
talk about a podcast and get hooked up

1521
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:58,400
but yeah like and then I found the real

1522
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:00,440
a sour diesel I've been searching for it

1523
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:03,079
forever and I tell people like yeah I'll

1524
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:04,519
look at it but this guy was like if it's

1525
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:06,440
not the real one I won't have hurt

1526
01:03:04,519 --> 01:03:08,679
feelings just tell me the truth and he

1527
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:11,039
showed it to me and I was like I can't

1528
01:03:08,679 --> 01:03:13,239
believe it's the real one and I was in I

1529
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:14,680
wanted it almost not to be the real one

1530
01:03:13,239 --> 01:03:17,358
I had my mindset that it was going to be

1531
01:03:14,679 --> 01:03:19,519
another fck fake version or or not even

1532
01:03:17,358 --> 01:03:22,400
fake but not just not the that I

1533
01:03:19,519 --> 01:03:25,278
remember right and so I was totally

1534
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:28,119
Blown Away to smell that smell after all

1535
01:03:25,278 --> 01:03:32,318
these years and and this cuz sometimes I

1536
01:03:28,119 --> 01:03:34,160
think your memory can be mistaken after

1537
01:03:32,318 --> 01:03:35,759
time passes your memory might interpret

1538
01:03:34,159 --> 01:03:37,519
things differently right but then when

1539
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:39,200
you smell it you're like oh no my memory

1540
01:03:37,519 --> 01:03:40,440
was right they weren't the right ones

1541
01:03:39,199 --> 01:03:42,558
all these years keep smelling and you're

1542
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:44,000
like you want it to be that sour you

1543
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:46,359
want it to be that and just like the

1544
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,480
super silver haze that flower you showed

1545
01:03:46,358 --> 01:03:51,358
me yesterday I gave it to John and he

1546
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:53,760
was like that's it it's like the The

1547
01:03:51,358 --> 01:03:56,119
Vision Quest is over but to find the

1548
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:57,720
original sour I'm still looking for I

1549
01:03:56,119 --> 01:03:58,680
have it over in a sample over in the

1550
01:03:57,719 --> 01:03:59,959
we're going to smoke it little we're

1551
01:03:58,679 --> 01:04:01,558
going to have to go smoke that well the

1552
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:04,639
funny thing with the the sour that I

1553
01:04:01,559 --> 01:04:06,200
remember is it wasn't just burnt Tire

1554
01:04:04,639 --> 01:04:08,118
burnt rubber smell which most of the

1555
01:04:06,199 --> 01:04:10,439
sours I've seen are more on that with a

1556
01:04:08,119 --> 01:04:13,079
very little bit of citrus and this one

1557
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:14,519
has the balanced Citrus it's loud like

1558
01:04:13,079 --> 01:04:16,039
when you open the bag it was and this

1559
01:04:14,519 --> 01:04:19,278
was depths and you open the bag I was

1560
01:04:16,039 --> 01:04:21,799
like wow so yeah pretty impressive it's

1561
01:04:19,278 --> 01:04:23,278
like the funk that hits you but that's

1562
01:04:21,798 --> 01:04:24,960
the thing is like it's always burnt

1563
01:04:23,278 --> 01:04:26,599
tires that's what that's what people

1564
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:28,679
think sour is now and it's not if you

1565
01:04:26,599 --> 01:04:31,519
don't have that Citrus back it has to

1566
01:04:28,679 --> 01:04:33,558
have like this citrusy balance right and

1567
01:04:31,519 --> 01:04:35,798
and it's also got this pungent Funk to

1568
01:04:33,559 --> 01:04:37,599
it too but yeah it's like nose burning

1569
01:04:35,798 --> 01:04:39,679
and not just from that not just from the

1570
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:41,440
burnt Tire you know cuz that's and

1571
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:43,318
that's what people think sour is too I

1572
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:44,679
would say that most people all the

1573
01:04:43,318 --> 01:04:48,000
people that have shown me S last year

1574
01:04:44,679 --> 01:04:51,159

1575
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:54,039

1576
01:04:51,159 --> 01:04:56,598

01:05:51,318 --> 01:05:55,759
Conference and it's actually where I

1601
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:57,359
bought this shirt ni but I ran into Matt

1602
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:58,960
at the hotel bar cuz he didn't know

1603
01:05:57,358 --> 01:06:00,480
Spanish and he was trying to order beer

1604
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:02,000
oh wow and we started talking and he

1605
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:04,400
gave me one of these and I was like no

1606
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,318
way I've never seen this before and now

1607
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:09,440
see them everywhere and they're so I'll

1608
01:06:06,318 --> 01:06:12,079
tell you what I do like my nectar

1609
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:14,519
collector my boy Uncle Stoner Big Ups

1610
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:17,200
Uncle Stoner but he gave me a nectar

1611
01:06:14,519 --> 01:06:20,119
collector at uh

1612
01:06:17,199 --> 01:06:22,399
the the squash off in Barcelona this

1613
01:06:20,119 --> 01:06:24,278
year and I love that thing I love for

1614
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:25,920
the turs but this is the convenience

1615
01:06:24,278 --> 01:06:27,480
right here and it does get more

1616
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:29,039
convenient especially if you like

1617
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:32,000
extract and you don't want to smoke big

1618
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:34,240
dabs you can smoke 50 50 of these in an

1619
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,239
hour and you'll probably be high but wow

1620
01:06:34,239 --> 01:06:38,159
feel really good that's delicious that's

1621
01:06:36,239 --> 01:06:40,399
absolutely super super clean floor and

1622
01:06:38,159 --> 01:06:43,000
Flame they're metric they're down at

1623
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:46,318
Oakland they do living soil in soil beds

1624
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:49,119
two-tier Game Changer I feel like Chris

1625
01:06:46,318 --> 01:06:52,239
Castle the one of the he's an owner and

1626
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:54,079
head grower he is amazing he just

1627
01:06:52,239 --> 01:06:56,118
crushes it and he believes in living

1628
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:58,519
soil and I I also

1629
01:06:56,119 --> 01:07:00,720
love living soil you know yeah I use

1630
01:06:58,519 --> 01:07:03,079
cocoa I I do other substrates for my

1631
01:07:00,719 --> 01:07:05,598
mom's I use grodent but living soil for

1632
01:07:03,079 --> 01:07:08,200
flavor yeah it's hard to beat you really

1633
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:10,318
can't I mean I know it even being on the

1634
01:07:08,199 --> 01:07:11,719
fertilizer side of things there's

1635
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:13,519
certain things you're looking for and

1636
01:07:11,719 --> 01:07:15,118
different Expressions you get from

1637
01:07:13,519 --> 01:07:17,278
either really good biology or just

1638
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:19,880
straight feeding programs oh yeah you

1639
01:07:17,278 --> 01:07:22,480
have a plant in Rockwall in a commercial

1640
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:23,440
facility vers a living soil I mean it's

1641
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,880
a whole different product you're going

1642
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:26,880
to see a completely different end

1643
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:29,640
product well expression is different the

1644
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:32,440
the and the effect like especially like

1645
01:07:29,639 --> 01:07:35,519
I would I would argue that the effect is

1646
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:36,920
different in almost 100% of the my

1647
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:38,119
experiences with it if you have two

1648
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:39,760
things side by side you're going to get

1649
01:07:38,119 --> 01:07:42,400
a different effect yeah especially if

1650
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:45,400
you look at the tpping profile just the

1651
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:46,559
actual by itself y but also you know

1652
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:47,920
they look different and I think a lot of

1653
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:49,160
people love that Instagram weed and

1654
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:51,838
there's nothing wrong with that I'm not

1655
01:07:49,159 --> 01:07:53,358
going to put anybody down for liking

1656
01:07:51,838 --> 01:07:55,000
beautiful looking flower right but at

1657
01:07:53,358 --> 01:07:56,759
the same time some of the ugliest [ __ ]

1658
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,838
I've smoked over the years is some of

1659
01:07:56,760 --> 01:08:01,119
the best [ __ ] and so you can't count out

1660
01:07:58,838 --> 01:08:03,239
the ugly kid you know exactly well I

1661
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:04,798
mean you get like a really funky IPA

1662
01:08:03,239 --> 01:08:06,959
that's brewed in someone's basement it

1663
01:08:04,798 --> 01:08:09,759
might be the best beer you've ever had

1664
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:12,400
but you can't you can't make 12 30 racks

1665
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:14,680
of that real quick where PBR comes in

1666
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:16,359
you can't even replicate those again

1667
01:08:14,679 --> 01:08:17,838
sometimes they're like you know it's

1668
01:08:16,359 --> 01:08:19,079
like and that's the boutique flower you

1669
01:08:17,838 --> 01:08:21,359
know it's like it's grown once and it's

1670
01:08:19,079 --> 01:08:23,359
a certain way well the same guy grows it

1671
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:26,920
and it's slightly different variables

1672
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:28,359
right so like whether the humidity was

1673
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:29,440
just slightly different or the

1674
01:08:28,359 --> 01:08:31,440
temperature was slightly different

1675
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:34,119
because the outside temperature like

1676
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:36,599
threw it off or the outside humidity had

1677
01:08:34,119 --> 01:08:38,000
impact it can come out not completely

1678
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:39,400
different but it can come out a slightly

1679
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,719
different expression it's just like

1680
01:08:39,399 --> 01:08:44,158
micro brew where you doing you know and

1681
01:08:41,719 --> 01:08:46,039
I I love that about Boutique products

1682
01:08:44,158 --> 01:08:47,879
you know I think the market needs

1683
01:08:46,039 --> 01:08:51,519
consistency with products like Cutting

1684
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:53,119
Edge right sure but on the grower side

1685
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:54,719
just like on the micro beer side we can

1686
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:56,719
have those Boutique products that have

1687
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:58,319
slight variation and and appreciate them

1688
01:08:56,719 --> 01:08:59,600
equally exactly and you guys have a

1689
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:00,960
really good product too it's very

1690
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:04,679
consistent you

1691
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:08,640
guys believe in the plant I feel like

1692
01:09:04,679 --> 01:09:10,399
John is a amazing contributor to

1693
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:11,719
everything that we've done here the

1694
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:13,198
reason I'm here the reason you're here

1695
01:09:11,719 --> 01:09:15,560
is because of people like John and

1696
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:17,198
they're the generation that we really

1697
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:20,520
need to acknowledge now while they're

1698
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:22,238
still here and uh yeah it's great to be

1699
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:24,359
part of all this and having him here and

1700
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:25,959
seeing like these younger kids too like

1701
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:27,560
you got younger kids coming they're in

1702
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:30,198
their 20s and they're excited about

1703
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:31,480
cannabis they're excited about nutrients

1704
01:09:30,198 --> 01:09:32,879
all the other things yeah it's beautiful

1705
01:09:31,479 --> 01:09:35,318
dude it's like there's so many different

1706
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:36,719
directions you can go and be successful

1707
01:09:35,319 --> 01:09:38,480
but there's nothing better than getting

1708
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:40,560
started early and finding what you love

1709
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:42,919
when you're young yeah exactly exactly

1710
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:44,719
and like people like John that's how

1711
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:47,079
they started like John started growing

1712
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:48,359
when he was 14 hitchhiked his way out

1713
01:09:47,079 --> 01:09:50,559
here and started growing in the hills

1714
01:09:48,359 --> 01:09:51,880
and learned from other people this isn't

1715
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:53,400
something that you can just I mean

1716
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:55,760
nowadays a little different you can pull

1717
01:09:53,399 --> 01:09:58,719
up something on the Internet learn how

1718
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:00,280
to grow weed but to really do it from

1719
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:02,560
the the heart and like of what the

1720
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:04,119
culture really is uh you got to learn

1721
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:05,960
from the other people that have started

1722
01:10:04,119 --> 01:10:07,800
before you right and and if we go

1723
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:09,239
generational like we can learn from the

1724
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:10,880
previous generation who learned from the

1725
01:10:09,238 --> 01:10:12,639
previous generation if we think we can

1726
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:15,679
do it all ourselves we we're kidding

1727
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:18,199
ourselves right and so Improvement

1728
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:19,960
happens over time whether it's breeding

1729
01:10:18,198 --> 01:10:21,960
or whether it's nutrients and

1730
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:24,119
understanding how to make the plant work

1731
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:26,359
more efficiently grow better you know

1732
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:28,319
improve the quality like

1733
01:10:26,359 --> 01:10:30,279
we're doing the same thing but two

1734
01:10:28,319 --> 01:10:32,039
different sides of the coin right we're

1735
01:10:30,279 --> 01:10:34,639
both trying to make the plant Express

1736
01:10:32,039 --> 01:10:38,198
itself better or help the plant become

1737
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:40,199
optimal right we don't drink and we

1738
01:10:38,198 --> 01:10:42,919
don't we don't want to have that I will

1739
01:10:40,198 --> 01:10:45,039
drink every once in a

1740
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:46,640
sure and I'll have a crappy free roll

1741
01:10:45,039 --> 01:10:49,519
every once in a while too but but that's

1742
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:51,360
not what we want to see for this

1743
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:53,080
industry or for this culture and that's

1744
01:10:51,359 --> 01:10:54,439
why we're doing what we're doing I mean

1745
01:10:53,079 --> 01:10:56,119
the work that you're doing from a

1746
01:10:54,439 --> 01:10:59,000
genetic standpoint from a culture

1747
01:10:56,119 --> 01:11:01,279
standpoint it's like ungodly you know

1748
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:03,119
like absolutely amazing oh I'm I'm just

1749
01:11:01,279 --> 01:11:05,158
filling my part of the gap of the

1750
01:11:03,119 --> 01:11:07,640
industry you know what I mean I feel and

1751
01:11:05,158 --> 01:11:08,799
when you find what you're doing in the

1752
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:10,360
industry that you were supposed to be

1753
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:12,279
doing with your life it's a really good

1754
01:11:10,359 --> 01:11:14,519
feeling I mean I know that you can

1755
01:11:12,279 --> 01:11:15,759
relate because I feel like you're doing

1756
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:17,000
exactly what you were meant to do on

1757
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:19,520
this planet you know you're following

1758
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:23,039
John's footsteps and really have stepped

1759
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:25,440
up and and it's amazing to see that

1760
01:11:23,039 --> 01:11:27,439
generational where where you can you can

1761
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:29,238
it fir hand where the two generations

1762
01:11:27,439 --> 01:11:30,399
are still there cuz sometimes that's

1763
01:11:29,238 --> 01:11:33,079
it's not the case you know what I mean

1764
01:11:30,399 --> 01:11:35,639
exactly well I me in in our situation

1765
01:11:33,079 --> 01:11:37,519
like I don't have to do anything right

1766
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:39,760
I'm doing this cuz I want to and John

1767
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:42,199
brought me to a hill when I was 14 that

1768
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:44,039
changed my life that made me move west

1769
01:11:42,198 --> 01:11:46,039
that made me understand something

1770
01:11:44,039 --> 01:11:48,359
different about the plant and then I get

1771
01:11:46,039 --> 01:11:50,760
to the point where okay John's in his

1772
01:11:48,359 --> 01:11:52,639
late 60s what is Cutting Edge going to

1773
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:55,719
be you know corporate companies offer us

1774
01:11:52,639 --> 01:11:57,679
a buyout and I look at that and go John

1775
01:11:55,719 --> 01:12:00,319
we could be offered a billion dollars

1776
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:02,079
with a B I don't give a [ __ ] we're not

1777
01:12:00,319 --> 01:12:03,920
taking the money because it's not about

1778
01:12:02,079 --> 01:12:05,439
that and nobody else is going to stand

1779
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:07,199
up and do that and we've watched it

1780
01:12:05,439 --> 01:12:09,638
happen over and over with all of our

1781
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:11,279
competition so we've got to kind of

1782
01:12:09,639 --> 01:12:13,119
stand up and fight for the community got

1783
01:12:11,279 --> 01:12:14,399
to stand up and fight exactly for sure I

1784
01:12:13,119 --> 01:12:15,679
mean it's happened over and over we look

1785
01:12:14,399 --> 01:12:17,119
at all these nutrient companies that

1786
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:19,760
sold out to bigger companies and they

1787
01:12:17,119 --> 01:12:21,800
Chang the formula or do whatever and

1788
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:23,480
it's hard when you take the the life

1789
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:26,520
blood out of a company that built it

1790
01:12:23,479 --> 01:12:29,519
from the ground up and you lose that for

1791
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:32,239
sales yeah yeah you can't sell your soul

1792
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:34,520
for sales I mean you can people do it

1793
01:12:32,238 --> 01:12:36,879
but that's not really sell the soul of

1794
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:39,159
the company either like companies I mean

1795
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:40,880
you can sell a company you can sell

1796
01:12:39,158 --> 01:12:43,638
intellectual property you can sell

1797
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:46,760
recipes you can sell genetics you can

1798
01:12:43,639 --> 01:12:49,319
sell all these things that that we can

1799
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:50,920
that we can quantify but like on the on

1800
01:12:49,319 --> 01:12:52,639
this the level of the soul of the

1801
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:55,840
company that built that company that

1802
01:12:52,639 --> 01:12:57,960
struggled to be successful you can never

1803
01:12:55,840 --> 01:13:00,159
fully sell that because it's hard to

1804
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:01,920
even describe what it actually is for

1805
01:13:00,158 --> 01:13:03,399
one thing and it's like because it's so

1806
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:05,039
many little things that have happened

1807
01:13:03,399 --> 01:13:07,399
over a period of such a long time

1808
01:13:05,039 --> 01:13:09,279
typically like for you guys and the

1809
01:13:07,399 --> 01:13:11,638
evolution of where John came from to get

1810
01:13:09,279 --> 01:13:13,359
where you guys are now oh yeah is wild

1811
01:13:11,639 --> 01:13:15,760
you know but even you from the time you

1812
01:13:13,359 --> 01:13:18,639
were 14 to where you're at now so many

1813
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:20,280
things have happened so many that have

1814
01:13:18,639 --> 01:13:21,960
yeah so many things in the world that

1815
01:13:20,279 --> 01:13:23,519
have happened and then I mean on top of

1816
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:26,119
that so many things that have happened

1817
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:27,920
to you yeah it's just this is an amazing

1818
01:13:26,119 --> 01:13:30,880
story and it's amazing to be part of all

1819
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:32,679
this I mean yeah it's it's beautiful and

1820
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:34,079
then we're here at ree it's funny coming

1821
01:13:32,679 --> 01:13:35,600
home and it feels like coming home and I

1822
01:13:34,079 --> 01:13:37,399
see a lot of people I haven't seen in a

1823
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:39,039
long time I'm seeing people I've never

1824
01:13:37,399 --> 01:13:41,079
met before who watch the podcast which

1825
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:42,319
is amazing that's a cool feeling that

1826
01:13:41,079 --> 01:13:44,519
grow my genetics they're giving me

1827
01:13:42,319 --> 01:13:46,238
genetics back hearing stories about my

1828
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:48,600
genetics being grown 10 years ago and

1829
01:13:46,238 --> 01:13:52,359
stuff like that where you know it's it's

1830
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:53,840
funny how people remember stuff and you

1831
01:13:52,359 --> 01:13:55,599
know and how we're interpretting

1832
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:58,079
interpreted in the industry you know and

1833
01:13:55,600 --> 01:14:00,560
it's like this is the community this is

1834
01:13:58,079 --> 01:14:02,079
the community this event like this is

1835
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:03,120
the Cannabis Community for Northern

1836
01:14:02,079 --> 01:14:04,479
californ this is the heart of the

1837
01:14:03,119 --> 01:14:07,279
Cannabis community and there's so many

1838
01:14:04,479 --> 01:14:09,879
other aspects of it but this is

1839
01:14:07,279 --> 01:14:14,719
like where Modern cannabis came from is

1840
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:17,480
these Hills you know and more so the the

1841
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:18,960
the mental side of it the the so as far

1842
01:14:17,479 --> 01:14:21,279
as people smoke weed all over the world

1843
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:22,920
right but how it evolved in Humble and

1844
01:14:21,279 --> 01:14:24,840
people had to go hide out and grow

1845
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:25,840
indoors we wouldn't be doing that if it

1846
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:27,480
wasn't for humble because they were

1847
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:29,079
growing outdoors and didn't want to get

1848
01:14:27,479 --> 01:14:31,479
caught so they started growing indoors

1849
01:14:29,079 --> 01:14:32,679
now indoor is super popular and there's

1850
01:14:31,479 --> 01:14:34,439
nothing wrong with either one I love

1851
01:14:32,679 --> 01:14:37,079
indoor I love outdoor I love mix light

1852
01:14:34,439 --> 01:14:39,079
and Greenhouse and you name it yeah but

1853
01:14:37,079 --> 01:14:40,158
uh we're here because of the people in

1854
01:14:39,079 --> 01:14:42,880
in this

1855
01:14:40,158 --> 01:14:45,359
community they pushed this forward so

1856
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:47,000
that we could be here today regga regga

1857
01:14:45,359 --> 01:14:50,279
on the river has always been like a

1858
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:51,960
buying show yeah it's always been July

1859
01:14:50,279 --> 01:14:54,319
end of July early

1860
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:56,279
August first depths are done everyone's

1861
01:14:54,319 --> 01:14:58,439
here slanging like that's what it was

1862
01:14:56,279 --> 01:15:01,238
always like it was

1863
01:14:58,439 --> 01:15:02,919
before I feel like now is I don't see

1864
01:15:01,238 --> 01:15:05,119
the people slanging packs there's like

1865
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:07,000
right people maybe hustling a little bit

1866
01:15:05,119 --> 01:15:09,158
but what I see is people that are

1867
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,760
passionate about weed sharing samples

1868
01:15:09,158 --> 01:15:12,479
and giving samples to each other and

1869
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:14,400
like us talking about stuff and US

1870
01:15:12,479 --> 01:15:16,638
seeing land race genetics that Nigerian

1871
01:15:14,399 --> 01:15:18,519
was crazy that Sour Diesel that I saw

1872
01:15:16,639 --> 01:15:20,679
was crazy I've gotten joints from a ton

1873
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:24,120
of people I saw this

1874
01:15:20,679 --> 01:15:25,679
crazy flower from last year I smoke some

1875
01:15:24,119 --> 01:15:27,279
flower I smoke the white B Road it was

1876
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:28,359
from last season that was really good

1877
01:15:27,279 --> 01:15:30,519
you did too

1878
01:15:28,359 --> 01:15:32,279
you yeah and John gave me that three

1879
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:34,480
months ago I preserved it and like I was

1880
01:15:32,279 --> 01:15:37,000
like saving it and couldn't be a better

1881
01:15:34,479 --> 01:15:40,198
place than ree to smoke that you know

1882
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:42,119
exactly yeah it's it's uh definitely

1883
01:15:40,198 --> 01:15:44,039
some really good weed going around

1884
01:15:42,119 --> 01:15:46,399
there's a lot of good stuff there's a

1885
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:47,600
lot of mediocre stuff too but there is

1886
01:15:46,399 --> 01:15:49,039
some really I mean you're going to find

1887
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:51,480
good stuff here there's people that love

1888
01:15:49,039 --> 01:15:53,238
weed and people that just know weed and

1889
01:15:51,479 --> 01:15:56,039
I saw some old school hash too I just SM

1890
01:15:53,238 --> 01:15:57,399

1893
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:03,159
that stuff's amazing well and that

1894
01:16:01,399 --> 01:16:06,039
that's like the nostalgic side of

1895
01:16:03,158 --> 01:16:07,638
cannabis where there's not a huge market

1896
01:16:06,039 --> 01:16:09,319
for anything like that but when I see

1897
01:16:07,639 --> 01:16:10,880
something like that I'm like oh yeah I

1898
01:16:09,319 --> 01:16:14,319
like smoking that and I hit it and I'm

1899
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:15,920
like reminds me of 199 [ __ ] 6 y you

1900

01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:20,319
and like the it's got that

1902
01:16:18,158 --> 01:16:21,599
pliability it's not full melt or

1903
01:16:20,319 --> 01:16:25,279
anything like that it's not supposed to

1904
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:27,239
be it's just Play-Doh exactly that has

1905
01:16:25,279 --> 01:16:29,198

there's like hers hers had like this

1907
01:16:29,198 --> 01:16:33,079
distinct Sandalwood smell that I

1908
01:16:30,639 --> 01:16:35,359
remember from the '90s like when I when

1909

without people like yourself they they

1951
01:18:15,479 --> 01:18:21,119
cared enough and even though it was

1952
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:23,079
illegal said it's not right and the

1953
01:18:21,119 --> 01:18:25,479
world needs people like that and I think

1954

that now it's our respons like my

1955

responsibility with my podcast with my

1956
01:18:27,079 --> 01:18:31,719
genetics the things I do that's where I

1957
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:33,159
fit in the industry and you know it's

1958
01:18:31,719 --> 01:18:35,920
amazing seeing people like yourself

1959
01:18:33,158 --> 01:18:37,559
still in the industry working with Sean

1960
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:40,199

1962
01:18:40,198 --> 01:18:43,479
you guys are pushing forth this this

1963
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:47,199
company that's going places and that has

1964
01:18:43,479 --> 01:18:49,919
good ethics and a consistent product so

1965
01:18:47,198 --> 01:18:51,799
family business everything is made in

1966
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:54,880
house

1967
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:57,159
chemistry microbiology and plant

1968
01:18:54,880 --> 01:19:00,679
pathology labs in

1969
01:18:57,158 --> 01:19:03,319
house we we trust our own work cuz if we

1970
01:19:00,679 --> 01:19:06,239
don't get it right we take more samples

1971
01:19:03,319 --> 01:19:10,359
and we get it right for sure and and

1972
01:19:06,238 --> 01:19:13,759
just like you do you you feed on and you

1973
01:19:10,359 --> 01:19:16,399
you you follow a certain pathway and

1974
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:18,000
then you're not happy and you back up

1975
01:19:16,399 --> 01:19:21,479
and you go another direction we do a lot

1976
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:23,520
of backing up you know it's it's part of

1977
01:19:21,479 --> 01:19:25,599
that process is going and trying things

1978
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:27,360
and going okay this is this is great

1979
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:29,360
this is great these 10 things are not

1980
01:19:27,359 --> 01:19:31,479
great you know and how can we move

1981
01:19:29,359 --> 01:19:33,000
forward with that to where we're serving

1982
01:19:31,479 --> 01:19:35,158
the plant the best to where we're

1983
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:37,000
optimizing the plant for specific

1984
01:19:35,158 --> 01:19:38,719
environments um you know I think we're

1985
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:40,479
both here to do the same thing is

1986
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:41,760
improve the plant or not even improve

1987
01:19:40,479 --> 01:19:44,839
the plant

1988
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:46,360
but make it as observable as possible at

1989
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:48,000
the outcome whether it's through

1990
01:19:46,359 --> 01:19:50,039
nutrition whether it's through genetics

1991
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:53,000
they're both key elements to Growing

1992
01:19:50,039 --> 01:19:56,279
amazing flower it's true you know we've

1993
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:58,719
always we've always used our fertilizer

1994
01:19:56,279 --> 01:20:03,119

01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:19,679
everyone and make sure makes sure that

2051
01:22:17,238 --> 01:22:21,399
everything is flowing and she knows how

2052
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:23,960
to do that just by looking at people

2053
01:22:21,399 --> 01:22:27,079
imagine growing up in a company and

2054
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:30,158
watching these people watching your

2055
01:22:27,079 --> 01:22:34,319
father yeah and how he deals with people

2056

for 20 years yeah you know it it it now

2057
01:22:34,319 --> 01:22:39,759
it's it's instinctive and

2058
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:41,840
intuitive what's going to happen and so

2059
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:44,440
she's always ahead of the game it's

2060
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:46,920

guess I went from being Infamous to

2076
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:24,159
somewhat famous but I worked really hard

2077
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:25,120
to never have a search warrant fulfilled

2078
01:23:24,158 --> 01:23:29,359
on

2079
01:23:25,119 --> 01:23:33,760
or a felony filed on me yeah that that's

2080
01:23:29,359 --> 01:23:36,599
not easy that's not easy sh we can't all

2081
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:39,000
see the same but you know but you know

2082
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:41,120
we do our best yeah I think it's one of

2083
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,439
those things that like I think people

2084
01:23:41,119 --> 01:23:43,840
it's it's a tough time for a lot of

2085
01:23:42,439 --> 01:23:45,279
people in the industry the guys go

2086
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:47,600
flower where it's like a race to the

2087
01:23:45,279 --> 01:23:48,880
bottom you know but you got to keep put

2088
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:51,960
one flood in front of the other and

2089
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:53,719
moving forward and you know you didn't

2090
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:56,319
you didn't just blow up overnight you

2091
01:23:53,719 --> 01:23:58,520
put a lot of hard work over many years

2092
01:23:56,319 --> 01:24:00,880
he then started in the black market and

2093
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:03,520
then evolved into an amazing business

2094
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:06,079
that you have today yeah you know we

2095
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:08,600
started I mean I started in

2096
01:24:06,079 --> 01:24:10,600
1978 yeah so there wasn't even

2097
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:12,440
traditional or black market even news

2098
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:15,520
you were just an

2099
01:24:12,439 --> 01:24:19,519
outlaw so yeah the outlaw days brought

2100
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:22,400
brought me up into where you know props

2101
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:25,360
2115 passed and then I saw an

2102
01:24:22,399 --> 01:24:28,679
opportunity just to work more closely

2103
01:24:25,359 --> 01:24:33,238
with different PhD scientists um one of

2104
01:24:28,679 --> 01:24:37,199
them being uh eler C and uh uh cure and

2105
01:24:33,238 --> 01:24:40,879
law at at Leaf works yeah and their PHD

2106
01:24:37,198 --> 01:24:44,519
PL geneticist and other small groups

2107
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:48,560
like that that uh I was able to to build

2108
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:52,719
on my knowledge base and also get deeper

2109
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:55,520
into what plants need because you know

2110
01:24:52,719 --> 01:24:59,158
we have a whole p of things we can

2111
01:24:55,520 --> 01:25:02,040
custom blend for you that we know work a

2112
01:24:59,158 --> 01:25:05,759
certain way that you can see the result

2113
01:25:02,039 --> 01:25:10,198
of a certain couple of Turpin or turine

2114
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:12,600
pop up right so well and more and more

2115
01:25:10,198 --> 01:25:14,559
we're talking about chemical expression

2116
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:17,239
so Cho something that you can get

2117
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:19,039
consistent results with where it's going

2118
01:25:17,238 --> 01:25:22,039
to give you same chemical compounds at

2119
01:25:19,039 --> 01:25:25,000
the end uh consistently each run you do

2120
01:25:22,039 --> 01:25:26,600
it which using the sun is very difficult

2121
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,359
well in an indoor environment I think

2122
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:31,079
it's possible where you

2123
01:25:28,359 --> 01:25:34,679
know for synthesizing different drugs

2124
01:25:31,079 --> 01:25:36,079
using cannabis or creating stuff use you

2125
01:25:34,679 --> 01:25:38,319
all just drug disc Discovery we're just

2126
01:25:36,079 --> 01:25:41,559
scratching the surface though but it

2127
01:25:38,319 --> 01:25:43,039
takes a consistent product and uh yeah

2128
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:46,600
it's amazing it's amazing what you years

2129
01:25:43,039 --> 01:25:49,079
are doing do yeah and you know I kind of

2130
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:52,280
backed off on growing so I could move

2131
01:25:49,079 --> 01:25:54,719
forward into traveling as much as I do

2132
01:25:52,279 --> 01:25:57,079
to all these different operations going

2133
01:25:54,719 --> 01:25:58,840
to Columbia yeah doing the Colombian cup

2134
01:25:57,079 --> 01:26:01,238
down there you guys do that every year

2135
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:05,199
yeah yeah we do the Caribbean cup and

2136
01:26:01,238 --> 01:26:08,319
we've actually helped influence people

2137
01:26:05,198 --> 01:26:10,839
uh through working with black black to

2138
01:26:08,319 --> 01:26:13,439
to Seed Company in Santa Marta Columbia

2139
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:17,800
yeah amazing people I love black C oh

2140
01:26:13,439 --> 01:26:20,960
yeah Carlos great guy and uh Sergio who

2141
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:25,119
works for them is uh great at going out

2142
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:27,679
and fighting seed he's uh got you

2143
01:26:25,118 --> 01:26:30,799
know so Carlo was he was busting

2144
01:26:27,679 --> 01:26:32,760
knowledge on me about uh Colombian gold

2145
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:34,880
and why it's called colan gold and then

2146
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:37,840
he was telling about how Panama it's the

2147
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:39,800
same exact genetic line what expresses

2148
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:41,719
differently because it's in Panama same

2149
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:44,880
thing with most what most people know is

2150
01:26:41,719 --> 01:26:47,800
W hawen is actually the same Colombian

2151
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:52,960
land race that's expressed differently

2152
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:56,560
in both Jal and in Waka right in fact uh

2153
01:26:52,960 --> 01:27:00,000
Sergio now has the cleanest lines of

2154
01:26:56,560 --> 01:27:05,239
land race bu Roa and so now they're

2155
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:07,760
running trials like Acres of Trials am

2156
01:27:05,238 --> 01:27:11,158
at their farm at at the black T company

2157
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:14,800
farm and sativa nativa in order to

2158
01:27:11,158 --> 01:27:18,319
actually see this see this trend come

2159
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:21,000
out so the changing fertilizer

2160
01:27:18,319 --> 01:27:24,840
requirements on some of these plants to

2161
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:28,800
try to adjust to see those different is

2162
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:31,800
to see p red yeah come out of BU

2163
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:34,639
ROV so really cool yeah and there's

2164
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:37,840
other varieties there too and a lot of

2165
01:27:34,639 --> 01:27:41,480
this last Caribbean Cup on July 26 we

2166
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:43,639
had a lot of uh invited a lot of Growers

2167
01:27:41,479 --> 01:27:46,399
out of the mountains you know the Sierra

2168
01:27:43,639 --> 01:27:49,719
Nevada Mount de madre mountains are

2169
01:27:46,399 --> 01:27:53,319
right there they're e 18,000 ft tall and

2170
01:27:49,719 --> 01:27:56,359
snow cap right behind Santa Marta so

2171
01:27:53,319 --> 01:27:58,439
imagine all the different climatic

2172
01:27:56,359 --> 01:28:00,839
changes yeah on the front of the

2173
01:27:58,439 --> 01:28:02,719
mountain that faces the Caribbean and on

2174
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:06,600
the back side that

2175
01:28:02,719 --> 01:28:11,079
faces Magdalena River at the plain right

2176
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:14,000
so M they're similar they locations that

2177
01:28:11,079 --> 01:28:16,359
are similar but completely different uh

2178
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:18,560
climate changes not climate changes but

2179
01:28:16,359 --> 01:28:20,679
completely different environments yeah

2180
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:25,840
you know just like in Hawaii where you

2181
01:28:20,679 --> 01:28:28,480
have you know a shade uh hurden of rain

2182
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:30,239
over one side the other side's dry yeah

2183
01:28:28,479 --> 01:28:32,638
you know so well it's kind of like

2184
01:28:30,238 --> 01:28:34,678
somoma and cadero cadero is like the

2185
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:36,440
northernmost part of Sona but it's

2186
01:28:34,679 --> 01:28:38,639
completely different as far as like

2187
01:28:36,439 --> 01:28:40,519
compared to sebastan pool as far as

2188
01:28:38,639 --> 01:28:44,279
climate and like that banana Bel up

2189
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:47,400
there it's extremely special yeah yeah

2190
01:28:44,279 --> 01:28:49,359
you go up to guala and there's actual an

2191
01:28:47,399 --> 01:28:52,519
actual bananabell close to the coast

2192
01:28:49,359 --> 01:28:54,479
that doesn't pull in fog right and I I

2193
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:57,480
mean I knew people that were growing

2194
01:28:54,479 --> 01:28:59,879
there in the uh in the late 70s and

2195
01:28:57,479 --> 01:29:01,919
their herb was coming out amazing and

2196
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:04,199
they were getting seed from Waka to grow

2197
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:07,319
there amazing which is co you know the

2198
01:29:04,198 --> 01:29:09,279
Waka is totally different but yeah we're

2199
01:29:07,319 --> 01:29:12,799
down to Waka too and

2200
01:29:09,279 --> 01:29:15,359
guadalahara Costa Rica and Colombia

2201
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:17,719
basically we're we're working with any

2202
01:29:15,359 --> 01:29:20,679
Growers that are passionate about

2203
01:29:17,719 --> 01:29:23,399
growing for plan yeah you know there's

2204
01:29:20,679 --> 01:29:25,399
no time for people that just want to yes

2205
01:29:23,399 --> 01:29:28,359
just we're just going to spend $50

2206
01:29:25,399 --> 01:29:30,158
million create this facility blow up a

2207
01:29:28,359 --> 01:29:33,960
couple of different strains and we're

2208
01:29:30,158 --> 01:29:36,319
going to push you know unicorn poop

2209
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:37,679
out that happens all the time though

2210
01:29:36,319 --> 01:29:39,840
yeah right that happens the funny thing

2211
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:41,279
is is like we joke about like Fu but it

2212
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:42,880
happens all the time these guys are like

2213
01:29:41,279 --> 01:29:44,559
we're going to make money off this and

2214
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:47,600
that's not only true in cannabis that's

2215
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:50,840
true in in everything you know that is

2216
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:54,159
true you know I was up at uh White

2217
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:57,119
Salmon Vineyard uh in the fall cuz I

2218
01:29:54,158 --> 01:29:59,599
also go up to yaka there's some Growers

2219
01:29:57,118 --> 01:30:02,198
up there that I I like to drop in and

2220
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:05,400
see what they're doing yeah and uh it's

2221
01:30:02,198 --> 01:30:08,638
Peter brm's Winery and he's you know

2222
01:30:05,399 --> 01:30:10,839
he's got a Vineyard he just turned 90 I

2223
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:13,719
went out walked the field with him went

2224
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:16,159
up the hill smoking a joint and he's

2225
01:30:13,719 --> 01:30:17,359
like yeah I think I'm going you know I

2226
01:30:16,158 --> 01:30:20,879
think this is the year I'm going to

2227
01:30:17,359 --> 01:30:23,719
retire and I'm like Peter you know when

2228
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:26,118
you were 76 years old and you said that

2229
01:30:23,719 --> 01:30:29,079
and I said it was too soon now it's too

2230
01:30:26,118 --> 01:30:31,519
late I go you're such a legacy that you

2231
01:30:29,079 --> 01:30:34,039
actually have to die in this Vineyard

2232
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:36,119
yeah he goes what do you mean I go do

2233
01:30:34,039 --> 01:30:38,920
you realize that I can never retire

2234

2235
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:42,639

2251
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:18,400
to the Caribbean comp about you as a

2252
01:31:16,238 --> 01:31:21,039
matter of fact the your seed company and

2253
01:31:18,399 --> 01:31:23,439
they're like oh man we're you know we

2254
01:31:21,039 --> 01:31:25,639
know we're going to win with our flower

2255
01:31:23,439 --> 01:31:27,599
but you know we looked at the seed

2256
01:31:25,639 --> 01:31:29,639
varieties and James loud seeds weren't

2257
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:31,320
there and I was like yeah you know we

2258
01:31:29,639 --> 01:31:33,279
couldn't get everywhere quickly enough

2259
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:35,279
in order to be able to bring him down

2260
01:31:33,279 --> 01:31:37,800
but next year we next year we'll make a

2261
01:31:35,279 --> 01:31:40,319
point of doing it and he was like yeah

2262
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:41,960
you know I look at what James L's doing

2263
01:31:40,319 --> 01:31:44,840
and you know it's super impressive and

2264
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:48,560
he's a lot younger guy but that's what

2265
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:50,840
you're looking at people think wow if

2266
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:53,360
you can do it through all the hard work

2267
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:56,960
and sacrifice and be where you are now

2268
01:31:53,359 --> 01:31:59,198
and be happy they want to be there too

2269
01:31:56,960 --> 01:32:02,079
one day at the end of the day we all

2270
01:31:59,198 --> 01:32:04,799
serve a purpose on this planet prior is

2271
01:32:02,079 --> 01:32:06,920
a weird thing but to be proud of being

2272
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:09,119
part of all this that's that's where I'm

2273
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:10,800
at you know I'm just happy and excited

2274
01:32:09,118 --> 01:32:12,880
that I get to be a part of this every

2275
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:15,960
day I love what I get to do I I feel

2276
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:18,520
like I found my place I found my

2277
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:20,319
people uh you know and it's just an

2278
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:22,119
amazing community of people that really

2279
01:32:20,319 --> 01:32:24,759
care about something bigger than

2280
01:32:22,118 --> 01:32:27,118
themselves and there's so many faces I

2281
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:28,520
get to see events like this events like

2282
01:32:27,118 --> 01:32:30,759
the cups that I've been to over the

2283
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:33,080
years and like really passionate people

2284
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:34,600
that are part of the community and and

2285
01:32:33,079 --> 01:32:36,880
they've done something to move the plan

2286
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:40,079
forward however they've done it you

2287
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:43,359
know yeah even if forward is and a

2288
01:32:40,079 --> 01:32:46,279
Direction you don't think is really good

2289
01:32:43,359 --> 01:32:48,238
because you don't agree with the

2290
01:32:46,279 --> 01:32:50,559
genetics they're working with yeah you

2291
01:32:48,238 --> 01:32:53,198
got to appreciate the the work they put

2292
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:56,440
in in order to get there on legacies are

2293
01:32:53,198 --> 01:32:57,638
built over Lifetime and you know I think

2294
01:32:56,439 --> 01:32:58,919
one of the biggest things is you know

2295
01:32:57,639 --> 01:33:01,359
you're on the right path when stuff

2296
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:02,960
falls into place right when stuff's

2297
01:33:01,359 --> 01:33:05,118
crazy and it falls apart sometimes you

2298
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:07,319
just have to have the get gets to keep

2299
01:33:05,118 --> 01:33:09,238
going but you know you're really in the

2300
01:33:07,319 --> 01:33:12,039
right place when it starts calling into

2301
01:33:09,238 --> 01:33:14,599
place right like Serendipity like you

2302
01:33:12,039 --> 01:33:17,719
get serendipitous events where you meet

2303
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:19,320
someone twice three times four times and

2304
01:33:17,719 --> 01:33:21,158
good people you're doing business

2305
01:33:19,319 --> 01:33:23,920
unintentionally you start working with

2306
01:33:21,158 --> 01:33:27,319
them and they do good business

2307
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:29,239
exactly I I've come across so many good

2308
01:33:27,319 --> 01:33:32,960
people just in the United States that

2309
01:33:29,238 --> 01:33:35,799
are have held on to things you know like

2310
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:39,319
the the guy that won the cup for sour

2311
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:43,719
diesel in Rhode Island uses our uses our

2312
01:33:39,319 --> 01:33:46,719
products and he got his Sour Diesel seed

2313
01:33:43,719 --> 01:33:51,960
from his friend whose dad grew Sour

2314
01:33:46,719 --> 01:33:54,920
Diesel out here well in like in red way

2315
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:59,158
in like uh early

2316
01:33:54,920 --> 01:34:01,319
90s crazy so he was able to take to

2317
01:33:59,158 --> 01:34:04,479
start a bunch of that seed and just get

2318
01:34:01,319 --> 01:34:06,799
a few seats to pop yeah and a couple of

2319
01:34:04,479 --> 01:34:09,319
them were female and he just ran with it

2320
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:12,039
and now two years later he's you know

2321
01:34:09,319 --> 01:34:13,799
the it looks like the right structure it

2322
01:34:12,039 --> 01:34:15,560
has the right smell it has the right

2323
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:17,159
smoke so you going to check out what I

2324
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:19,719
got today I but I smelled it and I'm

2325
01:34:17,158 --> 01:34:21,319
like that's it absolutely it it's not

2326
01:34:19,719 --> 01:34:23,920
just the burnt tires it's got the like

2327
01:34:21,319 --> 01:34:26,479
the Citrus back to it where it's real

2328
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:28,480
and bright but it's not just burnt tires

2329
01:34:26,479 --> 01:34:31,039
which is like more of the Kim 91 side

2330
01:34:28,479 --> 01:34:33,879
where it's all kind of got that cheem

2331
01:34:31,039 --> 01:34:35,319
spell uh I love sour and to see that

2332
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:37,199
here this is the perfect place of course

2333
01:34:35,319 --> 01:34:38,840
it's going to be a regga you know well

2334
01:34:37,198 --> 01:34:41,158
this is what regga on the river is all

2335
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:43,679
about it's our community it's about

2336
01:34:41,158 --> 01:34:45,679
people coming around and coming together

2337
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:48,440
and there are people out in these Hills

2338
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:50,920
still that are just growing the real

2339
01:34:48,439 --> 01:34:54,118
pineapple like the real original

2340
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:56,920
pineapple and they have this little

2341
01:34:54,118 --> 01:34:59,679
Market Niche that they sell to and they

2342
01:34:56,920 --> 01:35:02,079
don't grow a lot yeah and that's it

2343
01:34:59,679 --> 01:35:04,079
right and you know you can completely

2344
01:35:02,079 --> 01:35:06,719
miss it sometimes I feel like I'm going

2345
01:35:04,079 --> 01:35:10,920
down the freeway at 90 M an hour I'm

2346
01:35:06,719 --> 01:35:12,880
missing my exit you know the GU of these

2347
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:14,840
people yeah it's funny some of the guys

2348
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:17,039
do on the old school stuff especially

2349
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:18,719
you know I mean there's a niche market

2350
01:35:17,039 --> 01:35:21,000
for it I wouldn't say that it's wanted

2351
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:22,560
by everybody but like I think a lot of

2352
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:24,000
people if they were shown it in the

2353
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:25,320
right condition they just smell it

2354
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,198
they'd be like oh yeah I really like

2355
01:35:25,319 --> 01:35:29,439
that you show them me it's saw purple

2356
01:35:27,198 --> 01:35:31,960
and you're in the city they're like no

2357
01:35:29,439 --> 01:35:34,238
no no this super silver HS I don't know

2358
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:36,279
about this stuff and it's like how can

2359
01:35:34,238 --> 01:35:37,839
you not like that do you get to see the

2360
01:35:36,279 --> 01:35:39,960
super silver from floor and Flame that's

2361
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:42,079
my friend Chris Castle That Grew that oh

2362
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:44,079
okay and you know he's he's the steward

2363
01:35:42,079 --> 01:35:46,679
of that cut it's from tissue culture

2364
01:35:44,079 --> 01:35:48,439
from uh apical biotech but that is one

2365
01:35:46,679 --> 01:35:50,840
of my favorite Cuts I love that I love

2366
01:35:48,439 --> 01:35:53,158
the effect of it I love the smell it's

2367
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:55,360
unmistakable it smells just like the

2368
01:35:53,158 --> 01:35:58,479
original super silver that I first saw

2369
01:35:55,359 --> 01:36:01,839
in 1979 oh wow now without seeing the

2370
01:35:58,479 --> 01:36:05,439
plant that's one thing he's he's got a

2371
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:08,279
uh a more compact blower yeah but you

2372
01:36:05,439 --> 01:36:11,678
know he's using Moder fertilizers I mean

2373
01:36:08,279 --> 01:36:12,759
stuff that didn't exist in 1979 right so

2374
01:36:11,679 --> 01:36:14,239
you know you didn't have a ton of

2375
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:18,039
options in

2376
01:36:14,238 --> 01:36:20,959
1979 you know you had bone meal yeah

2377
01:36:18,039 --> 01:36:22,719
bone meal compost and bone meal you know

2378
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:25,520
yeah so there was options I mean people

2379
01:36:22,719 --> 01:36:28,118
B girlly plants a long time it's just

2380
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:30,679
it's got and the thing is I can say that

2381
01:36:28,118 --> 01:36:32,158
in the '90s the biggest problem with n

2382
01:36:30,679 --> 01:36:34,679
companies is they had recipes and they

2383
01:36:32,158 --> 01:36:36,638
were never good by themselves and now

2384
01:36:34,679 --> 01:36:38,560
that's different now there's a lot of

2385
01:36:36,639 --> 01:36:40,239
testing done like jum days like yourself

2386
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:41,960
where you actually test the recipes you

2387
01:36:40,238 --> 01:36:45,319
can follow your recipe to the tea and

2388
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:46,920
get amazing results you know and handful

2389
01:36:45,319 --> 01:36:48,599
companies I feel like they do the same

2390
01:36:46,920 --> 01:36:50,199
where they put forth the effort they

2391
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:53,840
give you the real recipe there's no

2392
01:36:50,198 --> 01:36:55,359
hidden secrets it's a good recipe and

2393
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:57,960
not even a base recipe you just follow

2394
01:36:55,359 --> 01:37:00,559
that recipe and you good results yeah I

2395
01:36:57,960 --> 01:37:03,520
mean yeah you know we have an hlc and

2396
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:07,520
the gcms but yeah you

2397
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:09,159
know us having to test everything in

2398
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:12,920
order to know what it

2399
01:37:09,158 --> 01:37:15,759
is people can just send the customer or

2400
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:18,279
the breeder can just send it into a lab

2401
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:21,000
yeah and they can get the results it's a

2402
01:37:18,279 --> 01:37:23,840
lot less work for us and I'm happy for

2403
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:26,359
that and plus it's like a third party

2404
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:27,840
testing too yeah so it's even better

2405
01:37:26,359 --> 01:37:29,519
well it's like we weren't doing all the

2406
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:31,000
testing even with genetics I wasn't

2407
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:33,520
doing the testing like we're doing now

2408
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:35,920
it's like we test everything we have

2409
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:38,040
coas for all our all our flowers all our

2410
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:40,440
phenotypes that we keep we have

2411
01:37:38,039 --> 01:37:42,479
coas and the model for us is to be able

2412
01:37:40,439 --> 01:37:44,399
to show the finished product right and

2413
01:37:42,479 --> 01:37:47,238
right now I'm doing a trial with LED

2414
01:37:44,399 --> 01:37:49,238
versus HPS with same cultivar so that

2415
01:37:47,238 --> 01:37:50,919
customers can see when you grow on HPS

2416
01:37:49,238 --> 01:37:53,559
it's like this when you grow it under

2417
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:55,480
LED it's like this these are both good

2418
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:57,520
results what do you prefer what do you

2419
01:37:55,479 --> 01:37:59,559
have and then what's optimal for your

2420
01:37:57,520 --> 01:38:01,880
environment right so like you want a

2421
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:03,320
specific amount of grams per watt these

2422
01:38:01,880 --> 01:38:04,920
are the options that you have if you're

2423
01:38:03,319 --> 01:38:07,399
trying to go for that if you're going

2424
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:09,520
for this specific ear profile if you

2425
01:38:07,399 --> 01:38:12,158
have a HPS it might do like blue dream

2426
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:14,679
does way better at HPS my op oh yeah it

2427
01:38:12,158 --> 01:38:18,198
needs that big deep breath needs that

2428
01:38:14,679 --> 01:38:21,199
heat too you just sweat the heat yeah it

2429
01:38:18,198 --> 01:38:23,839
just swells up there it's like yeah yeah

2430
01:38:21,198 --> 01:38:28,359
it's amazing how the plant

2431
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:30,560
or changes yeah with not just with time

2432
01:38:28,359 --> 01:38:32,559
but with what we're talking about the

2433
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:35,719
evolution of the fertilizers the

2434
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:38,480
Biologicals used the soils and the

2435
01:38:35,719 --> 01:38:40,560
lighting and the lighting is the big one

2436
01:38:38,479 --> 01:38:43,118
and stuff they used to really figure out

2437
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:44,920
now with LEDs and con concentrated ppfd

2438
01:38:43,118 --> 01:38:46,679
when you get it right in there it

2439
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:49,039
doesn't get the fox tailes like it used

2440
01:38:46,679 --> 01:38:51,480
to some this St are shape but they don't

2441
01:38:49,039 --> 01:38:53,000
get the fox tails so I think a lot of

2442
01:38:51,479 --> 01:38:54,718
that has to do with heat too cuz we used

2443
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:57,279
to goow with HPS for everything and I

2444
01:38:54,719 --> 01:39:00,279
love HPS oh yeah I I don't love what it

2445
01:38:57,279 --> 01:39:02,840
does for the environment but LEDs are

2446
01:39:00,279 --> 01:39:04,359
definitely more efficient I don't know I

2447
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:06,400
like mix light the best I think that's

2448
01:39:04,359 --> 01:39:07,719
the future of the industry anyways we're

2449
01:39:06,399 --> 01:39:09,479
all going to go towards mix light

2450
01:39:07,719 --> 01:39:12,960
because we can use the sun the sun

2451
01:39:09,479 --> 01:39:15,279
creates amazing uh amazing flavor

2452
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:17,279
molecules when we're talking about PES

2453
01:39:15,279 --> 01:39:21,079
Turpin flavorant whatever you want to

2454
01:39:17,279 --> 01:39:24,079
call them uh the aroma is impacted by

2455
01:39:21,079 --> 01:39:27,719
the sun in a in a good way right and the

2456
01:39:24,079 --> 01:39:29,880
sun spectrum is it changes it's not even

2457
01:39:27,719 --> 01:39:32,158
a constant like the solar flare that

2458
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:35,840
happened this this summer right that

2459
01:39:32,158 --> 01:39:37,719
almost knocked out all our cell service

2460
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:39,679
uh you don't think that affected plants

2461
01:39:37,719 --> 01:39:42,239
people don't even know really what that

2462
01:39:39,679 --> 01:39:46,279
did for a lot of their plants they they

2463
01:39:42,238 --> 01:39:48,879
see uh changes in and what elements it

2464
01:39:46,279 --> 01:39:52,319
picks up Canabis as opposed to other

2465
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:54,199
other plants in agriculture cannabis is

2466
01:39:52,319 --> 01:39:56,679
a very resilient plant that can adapt to

2467
01:39:54,198 --> 01:39:58,519
almost any environment whereas some of

2468
01:39:56,679 --> 01:40:02,520
this this you know over time with

2469
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:05,280
climate change and the these climates

2470
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:07,119
changing so much we'll see what happens

2471
01:40:05,279 --> 01:40:09,359
to the the national agriculture that

2472
01:40:07,118 --> 01:40:11,719
does really well that may change from

2473
01:40:09,359 --> 01:40:13,399
region to region you know it's like cuz

2474
01:40:11,719 --> 01:40:15,079
we're experiencing hotter hotter days on

2475
01:40:13,399 --> 01:40:17,679
Earth than we've ever had in and not in

2476
01:40:15,079 --> 01:40:20,840
our lifetime but probably in the last

2477
01:40:17,679 --> 01:40:23,359
you know 100,000 years yeah I mean I see

2478
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:26,199
just in the Rogue Valley before I left

2479
01:40:23,359 --> 01:40:29,639
so many people switching to red shade

2480
01:40:26,198 --> 01:40:32,519
cloth wow you know and the difference

2481
01:40:29,639 --> 01:40:38,079
between 25% and

2482
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:40,119
50% and I looked at uh 50% and the veg

2483
01:40:38,079 --> 01:40:42,719
time was shorter the structure was

2484
01:40:40,118 --> 01:40:46,279
better and uh I don't know how it's

2485
01:40:42,719 --> 01:40:50,480
going to end up but for instance West CO

2486
01:40:46,279 --> 01:40:53,840
West Coast Farms up in up in Talon uh

2487
01:40:50,479 --> 01:40:57,678
they use the 50% jakcloth yeah very

2488
01:40:53,840 --> 01:41:00,840
start and they 50% is that's takes a lot

2489
01:40:57,679 --> 01:41:04,760
of sun out but it's amazing you you hold

2490
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:08,960
a uh infrared gun on the soil outside

2491
01:41:04,760 --> 01:41:12,679
it's 145 you step inside and it might be

2492
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:15,520
108 or 110 and that's huge and then you

2493
01:41:12,679 --> 01:41:18,158
put it under the plant and it's you know

2494
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:21,800
might be in the low 90s and then the

2495
01:41:18,158 --> 01:41:25,000
canopy might be in the high 80s and so

2496
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:26,520
now all of a sudden that's a big big

2497
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:29,079
shift right there it's a huge game

2498
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:30,679
changer for cultivation and not

2499
01:41:29,079 --> 01:41:33,039
stressing the planets out you know you

2500
01:41:30,679 --> 01:41:34,639
get like going above 105 and it's not

2501
01:41:33,039 --> 01:41:37,479
going to be

2502
01:41:34,639 --> 01:41:40,359
happy even above 90 it's

2503
01:41:37,479 --> 01:41:44,759
not up here it gives full every day

2504
01:41:40,359 --> 01:41:47,039
right but about 105 that's no good right

2505
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:48,880
well the plant respirat so it can drop

2506
01:41:47,039 --> 01:41:52,399
its temperature as long as it has

2507
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:55,599
moisture yeah but you know I'm years ago

2508
01:41:52,399 --> 01:41:58,198
I went to what uh one garden and the

2509
01:41:55,599 --> 01:41:59,400
person was like freaking out because her

2510
01:41:58,198 --> 01:42:03,118
plants

2511
01:41:59,399 --> 01:42:05,158
were were uh getting spots on them and

2512
01:42:03,118 --> 01:42:06,679
all these different deficiencies and I'm

2513
01:42:05,158 --> 01:42:09,920
like you're using our fertilizer you're

2514
01:42:06,679 --> 01:42:11,840
getting deficiencies and he guy was

2515
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:13,800
really really worried so I went up and I

2516
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:17,319
checked out his place it was in Willets

2517
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:20,560
yeah and I said great so you you think

2518
01:42:17,319 --> 01:42:24,198
you're planted at the EDG line of an oak

2519
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:27,360
forest but what's happening is the sun

2520
01:42:24,198 --> 01:42:29,759
has shifted from being high to now it's

2521
01:42:27,359 --> 01:42:31,839
being low and it's hitting all the bags

2522
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:34,400
and he goes no he he goes this not

2523
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:36,079
happening like okay I'll come back

2524
01:42:34,399 --> 01:42:38,719
tomorrow afternoon we'll see what's

2525
01:42:36,079 --> 01:42:41,359
going on and I'll bring a a thermometer

2526
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:42,319
a soul thermometer and his soil was like

2527
01:42:41,359 --> 01:42:45,198
at

2528
01:42:42,319 --> 01:42:48,198
118° I go this is great because you've

2529
01:42:45,198 --> 01:42:51,960
killed all the bacteria and fungi in the

2530
01:42:48,198 --> 01:42:54,359
soil so you're completely rying on

2531
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:57,158
injecting fertilizer yeah and the type

2532
01:42:54,359 --> 01:42:58,559
of PL you're growing doesn't want that

2533
01:42:57,158 --> 01:43:01,960
you know he's growing like

2534
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:04,719
AK-47 which we know is totally adaptable

2535
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:07,599
but when you strip out the soil and have

2536
01:43:04,719 --> 01:43:10,719
high heat like that it's done just like

2537
01:43:07,599 --> 01:43:13,440
why you're supposed to SC Rock

2538
01:43:10,719 --> 01:43:15,439
outside you might as well to be H like

2539
01:43:13,439 --> 01:43:17,960
right you're us I mean that's the the

2540
01:43:15,439 --> 01:43:20,960
beauty of using soil you're taking away

2541
01:43:17,960 --> 01:43:23,560
the most valuable part of of using a

2542
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:27,239
substrate right but those black grow

2543
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:28,599
bags right they get hot they cooked yeah

2544
01:43:27,238 --> 01:43:31,718
he didn't believe it I said put your

2545
01:43:28,599 --> 01:43:32,760
hand in he went oh I go yeah imagine if

2546
01:43:31,719 --> 01:43:35,118
you're a

2547
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:37,480
rude you're have nowhere to

like a lot of people when they found the

2788
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:02,159
industry that was home for them it's

2789
01:53:00,479 --> 01:53:03,279
like we're all contributing to so much

2790
01:53:02,158 --> 01:53:05,598
something that's so much bigger than

2791
01:53:03,279 --> 01:53:06,960
ourselves it's just amazing time to be

2792
01:53:05,599 --> 01:53:09,199
alive and to be able to contribute to

2793
01:53:06,960 --> 01:53:13,078
this thing that's just a collective

2794
01:53:09,198 --> 01:53:15,198
consciousness of energy and of passion

2795
01:53:13,078 --> 01:53:16,599
and spirit and these people that are in

2796
01:53:15,198 --> 01:53:18,000
this industry are extremely special

2797
01:53:16,599 --> 01:53:19,599
because they feel the same way that we

2798
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:21,599

love cannabis it's like it's contagious

2801
01:53:24,118 --> 01:53:28,759
when people start seeing that it's like

2802
01:53:26,279 --> 01:53:30,559
how can you argue that that's wrong or

2803
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:33,000
that that should be criminal or that

2804
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:35,679
we're not Outlaws we bad people we love

2805

cut of the sfb OG yeah I like sfb I like

2815
01:53:58,279 --> 01:54:01,759
it a lot it's a crazy looking plan

2816
01:54:00,198 --> 01:54:03,479
though like if you go too long with it

2817
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:05,800
it totally looks crazy it was it wasn't

2818
01:54:03,479 --> 01:54:07,879
the best yielder I as we usual OG's

2819
01:54:05,800 --> 01:54:09,760
wasn't the best yielder but what I was

2820
01:54:07,880 --> 01:54:11,719
able to cold cure in the rosin to show

2821
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:14,280
him what I could do with cold curing his

2822
01:54:11,719 --> 01:54:16,679
his his resin that he and the team grew

2823
01:54:14,279 --> 01:54:18,880
yeah and he literally just sent me a

2824
01:54:16,679 --> 01:54:21,960
picture and just goes oh my goodness

2825

2826
01:54:21,960 --> 01:54:25,480
who's that everyone even said in terms

2827
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:27,840
of a concentrate form it they brings

2828
01:54:25,479 --> 01:54:30,238
them back and hearing people have no I

2829
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:32,159
used to love the scissor hasher I I grew

2830
01:54:30,238 --> 01:54:33,799
sfv my friends grew sfv we grew a lot of

2831
01:54:32,158 --> 01:54:35,839
it but the scissor hash for sfv was

2832
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:37,400
always the best you know there there was

2833
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:39,000
a handful of things where it was like I

2834
01:54:37,399 --> 01:54:40,799
still remember the way the scissor hash

2835
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:42,960
taste it was different than it taste

2836
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:44,440
exactly like the plat spell yes and so

2837
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:46,118
that's what I love you know like good

2838
01:54:44,439 --> 01:54:48,279
scissor hash should spell exactly like

2839
01:54:46,118 --> 01:54:51,238
the plant spells yeah you you're getting

2840
01:54:48,279 --> 01:54:52,679
those turns in it's perfect form yeah

2841
01:54:51,238 --> 01:54:54,238
you know yeah people have said when they

2842
01:54:52,679 --> 01:54:56,158
say that it's like it brings them back

2843
01:54:54,238 --> 01:54:58,799
it like it's not the plant burn like or

2844
01:54:56,158 --> 01:55:01,719
like a chlorophyll but more of the pine

2845
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:04,000
that that Piney earthy Pine with a

2846
01:55:01,719 --> 01:55:05,880
little Citrus right but like not just

2847
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:08,279
Pine but pine needles like you have that

2848
01:55:05,880 --> 01:55:10,199
fresh [ __ ] pine needles you can smoke

2849
01:55:08,279 --> 01:55:12,238
that and the beauty of a dab is it's all

2850
01:55:10,198 --> 01:55:14,399
chapped into L hit you smoke a joint and

2851
01:55:12,238 --> 01:55:15,519
it's amazing too I love joint absolutely

2852
01:55:14,399 --> 01:55:16,719
then you get that over the Peri of the

2853
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:18,960
joint it tastes good all the way down

2854
01:55:16,719 --> 01:55:20,560
the road is special but when you smoke

2855
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:23,239
it into form of Ros and it's like

2856
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:25,280
encapsulating that whole joint one hit

2857
01:55:23,238 --> 01:55:26,718
and you blow it out it's like it's

2858
01:55:25,279 --> 01:55:28,880
amazing that's what I love about it

2859
01:55:26,719 --> 01:55:32,000
because you're getting all that flavor

2860
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:34,639
condensed into one hit and it's just cuz

2861
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:36,000
really you're getting the the TPS and we

2862
01:55:34,639 --> 01:55:36,960
were talk about Flavor molecules but

2863
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:39,679

me to this day and had impact on the

2894

direction I went in life for with well

2895

was one we had a master cush and a Bubba

2897
01:56:57,439 --> 01:57:01,279
cush the Bubba cush was like soapy and I

2898
01:56:59,319 --> 01:57:03,559
still remember that soapy smell

2899
01:57:01,279 --> 01:57:05,399
sometimes I smell like Irish Springs or

2900
01:57:03,560 --> 01:57:08,840
I wash my hands with soap like smells

2901
01:57:05,399 --> 01:57:10,158
like Bubba cush yes same thing pine

2902

something I've been looking for for a

3001
02:01:58,359 --> 02:02:03,759
long long long time I've gotten samples

totally appreciate because I get that a

3007
02:02:11,679 --> 02:02:16,560

aroma it was grown with mix FL too so I

think there's we were talking about

3013
02:02:23,960 --> 02:02:27,078
there's something to be said for the

3014
02:02:25,238 --> 02:02:29,919
people who grow it in the way they grow

3015
02:02:27,078 --> 02:02:31,880
it to get those specific profiles and

3016
02:02:29,920 --> 02:02:34,560
yeah it's special right on well yeah I'm

3017

out there that has it someone that has

3024
02:02:46,599 --> 02:02:50,199
the real well so and there's so many

3025
02:02:48,520 --> 02:02:51,599
different cat pisses I'm sure they're

3026
02:02:50,198 --> 02:02:53,238
they're real to those people that have

3027
02:02:51,599 --> 02:02:55,360
them all these different ones but the

3028
02:02:53,238 --> 02:02:57,718
one that's real to me that I I miss the

3029
02:02:55,359 --> 02:02:59,519
most has been gone it's eluded me for a

3030
02:02:57,719 --> 02:03:02,078
long time and my friends that's like the

3031
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:03,520
Romulan for me I had this one Romulan

3032
02:03:02,078 --> 02:03:04,759
and it was the one for me and nobody

3033
02:03:03,520 --> 02:03:07,960
else had it and like I've been looking

3034
02:03:04,760 --> 02:03:10,119
for it ever since and you so Romulan was

3035
02:03:07,960 --> 02:03:12,560
amazing you know 20 years ago Romulan

3036
02:03:10,118 --> 02:03:14,279
was the one uh the Romulan we had the

3037
02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:15,560
shaman but it was like a really we just

3038
02:03:14,279 --> 02:03:17,920
call it the shaman but it was like a

3039
02:03:15,560 --> 02:03:20,719
Romulan back Cross or a shaman back

3040
02:03:17,920 --> 02:03:22,840
cross with the ra Romulan and it was it

3041
02:03:20,719 --> 02:03:24,359
was just amazing the was it was one of

3042
02:03:22,840 --> 02:03:26,360
those purple ones that didn't have the

3043
02:03:24,359 --> 02:03:29,279
effect that matches the color you think

3044
02:03:26,359 --> 02:03:31,399
of Ron it was more of an uplifting and

3045
02:03:29,279 --> 02:03:32,719
Powerful smoke okay yeah mine was the

3046
02:03:31,399 --> 02:03:34,719
exact opposite we used to call it the

3047
02:03:32,719 --> 02:03:38,158
head denter wow I mean that was like

3048
02:03:34,719 --> 02:03:40,239
straight the most sedative cannabis I've

3049
02:03:38,158 --> 02:03:41,519
ever smoked in my life um but it's so

3050
02:03:40,238 --> 02:03:42,519
it's different to see the different

3051
02:03:41,520 --> 02:03:44,719
expressions and like we were talking

3052
02:03:42,520 --> 02:03:46,440
about earlier the way it's grown can

3053
02:03:44,719 --> 02:03:48,198
express itself and how also different

3054
02:03:46,439 --> 02:03:50,879
effects yeah um and I think a lot of

3055
02:03:48,198 --> 02:03:53,039
times with the sour you know it can be

3056
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:54,440
really good or it can be not so good

3057
02:03:53,039 --> 02:03:56,679
real easy and there's kind of like a

3058
02:03:54,439 --> 02:03:58,719
fine line there if you mess up the cure

3059
02:03:56,679 --> 02:04:01,158
there's none of that good sour smell and

3060
02:03:58,719 --> 02:04:02,639
it go it goes to Hay yeah it totally

3061
02:04:01,158 --> 02:04:04,238
goes to Hay which is mostly what I see

3062
02:04:02,639 --> 02:04:07,078
to be honest with you most of the stuff

3063
02:04:04,238 --> 02:04:08,319
I've seen is hay you know people and

3064
02:04:07,078 --> 02:04:11,558
it's hard to tell if it was even the

3065
02:04:08,319 --> 02:04:12,880
real cut when it's hey you know so yeah

3066
02:04:11,559 --> 02:04:14,239
there should be some of it in there you

3067
02:04:12,880 --> 02:04:16,719
know but I've grown it you really got to

3068
02:04:14,238 --> 02:04:19,399
squeeze for some sometimes but but uh

3069
02:04:16,719 --> 02:04:23,078
I've grown under HPS and led and I will

3070
02:04:19,399 --> 02:04:25,759
say the LED is nowhere near like the HPS

3071
02:04:23,078 --> 02:04:27,679
um I grew it for a long time under HPS

3072
02:04:25,760 --> 02:04:29,719
and the first led Harvest I was like

3073
02:04:27,679 --> 02:04:31,559
what what happened to the sour like this

3074
02:04:29,719 --> 02:04:33,480
is not what I was expecting there's heat

3075
02:04:31,559 --> 02:04:35,159
and there's far red and so there's some

3076
02:04:33,479 --> 02:04:36,439
big differences with those and I agree

3077
02:04:35,158 --> 02:04:38,118
but Blue Dream is another example of

3078
02:04:36,439 --> 02:04:39,558
something that should be grown under HPS

3079
02:04:38,118 --> 02:04:41,439
that does better I think it performs

3080
02:04:39,559 --> 02:04:42,920
better under HPS some of them do you

3081
02:04:41,439 --> 02:04:45,598
know it's just like outdoor strains that

3082
02:04:42,920 --> 02:04:46,960
don't do well outside you know they do

3083
02:04:45,599 --> 02:04:48,599
better insight and all that so that's

3084
02:04:46,960 --> 02:04:50,000
part of kind of learning how to grow

3085
02:04:48,599 --> 02:04:52,800
different varieties what they like what

3086
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:54,319
they don't like right uh

3087
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:55,800
yeah it's a lot of fun but yeah all

3088
02:04:54,319 --> 02:04:57,439
these different sours I've seen there's

3089
02:04:55,800 --> 02:04:58,800
there's that sour in there or it has the

3090
02:04:57,439 --> 02:05:02,000
structure or it has a little bit of the

3091
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:03,559
smell sometimes it even has the smell

3092
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:05,800
and the look and then I go to smoke it

3093
02:05:03,559 --> 02:05:07,079
and you're like it's just not the one

3094
02:05:05,800 --> 02:05:08,480
it's not the one that I remember you

3095
02:05:07,078 --> 02:05:11,479
know and yours is the first thing I've

3096
02:05:08,479 --> 02:05:12,638
seen in 20 years not maybe a little bit

3097
02:05:11,479 --> 02:05:14,959
less than 20 years probably probably

3098
02:05:12,639 --> 02:05:16,920
like 12 years 14 years something like

3099
02:05:14,960 --> 02:05:21,800
that cuz it really went away in like

3100
02:05:16,920 --> 02:05:24,158
2012 2014 Gorilla Glue kind of was the

3101
02:05:21,800 --> 02:05:26,719
pivoting point I think for to basically

3102
02:05:24,158 --> 02:05:28,679
everybody switched to Gorilla Glue that

3103
02:05:26,719 --> 02:05:30,000
I knew it was hot for a while and then

3104
02:05:28,679 --> 02:05:32,239
it's like everything people start to

3105
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:34,158
grow it and then you get enough Bland

3106
02:05:32,238 --> 02:05:35,479
batches or mediocre batches and people

3107
02:05:34,158 --> 02:05:37,679
start to gravitate towards something

3108
02:05:35,479 --> 02:05:38,919
else that's better real quick and then

3109
02:05:37,679 --> 02:05:40,319
you call them they're like yo I got the

3110
02:05:38,920 --> 02:05:42,239
sour and like it wasn't good last time

3111
02:05:40,319 --> 02:05:44,359
I'm on to something else sorry you know

3112
02:05:42,238 --> 02:05:45,839
whatever the case was um you know I

3113
02:05:44,359 --> 02:05:47,000
think a lot of people lost it for

3114
02:05:45,840 --> 02:05:48,319
whatever reason I heard someone talk

3115
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:50,760
about how they got busted and they lost

3116
02:05:48,319 --> 02:05:53,198
their cut hot plate and viroid I mean I

3117
02:05:50,760 --> 02:05:54,679
think the the genetics deteriorated with

3118
02:05:53,198 --> 02:05:57,039
hop plate and verid so when people were

3119
02:05:54,679 --> 02:05:58,239
growing them they weren't getting good

3120
02:05:57,039 --> 02:06:00,359
yields it was

3121
02:05:58,238 --> 02:06:01,839
dutting uh you know I think they've

3122
02:06:00,359 --> 02:06:03,880
contributed to one of the early vectors

3123
02:06:01,840 --> 02:06:07,159
of hop PL and that got spread around

3124
02:06:03,880 --> 02:06:08,480
which I remember it it wasn't the same

3125
02:06:07,158 --> 02:06:11,078
some of my friends grw it just wasn't

3126
02:06:08,479 --> 02:06:12,799
the same too so yeah I've often thought

3127
02:06:11,078 --> 02:06:14,439
maybe mine has some sort of virus after

3128
02:06:12,800 --> 02:06:16,000
growing it under an LED and then just

3129
02:06:14,439 --> 02:06:19,078
seeing some weird stuff but then I had

3130
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:20,960
one of my best yields ever under LEDs um

3131
02:06:19,078 --> 02:06:23,118
and I almost gave up on it but my buddy

3132
02:06:20,960 --> 02:06:25,399
grew it last year in his outdoor patch

3133
02:06:23,118 --> 02:06:27,198
wow and I was like okay it's still got

3134
02:06:25,399 --> 02:06:30,118
it like it probably needs to be dissu

3135
02:06:27,198 --> 02:06:32,359
cultured but what we want what we're

3136
02:06:30,118 --> 02:06:33,198
hoping to get out of it is still there

3137
02:06:32,359 --> 02:06:34,799
so I was like all right I'm going to

3138
02:06:33,198 --> 02:06:38,279
roll the dice and I'm going to put 20 in

3139
02:06:34,800 --> 02:06:40,000
a greenhouse and see what happens um and

3140
02:06:38,279 --> 02:06:42,319
I'm really glad I did because it came

3141
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:43,719
out kind of what I've been kind of I've

3142
02:06:42,319 --> 02:06:46,039
been looking for it even though I've had

3143
02:06:43,719 --> 02:06:48,679
it the whole time right um I haven't

3144
02:06:46,039 --> 02:06:50,399
done as much growing recently so I had

3145
02:06:48,679 --> 02:06:52,239
some friends grow it outside it came out

3146
02:06:50,399 --> 02:06:54,118
really great yeah with then when I grew

3147
02:06:52,238 --> 02:06:56,519
it inside I was like oh this is

3148
02:06:54,118 --> 02:06:58,279
disappointing um so I think a lot goes

3149
02:06:56,520 --> 02:07:00,520
to how you're growing it where you're

3150
02:06:58,279 --> 02:07:02,319
growing it what nutrients you're using

3151
02:07:00,520 --> 02:07:04,159
when you're using them what do you think

3152
02:07:02,319 --> 02:07:07,558
are the best fruit nutrients for for

3153
02:07:04,158 --> 02:07:10,078
sour specifically ah I mean it likes

3154
02:07:07,559 --> 02:07:12,520
nutrients you know the first recipe was

3155
02:07:10,078 --> 02:07:14,039
the GH recipe back in the early 2000s I

3156
02:07:12,520 --> 02:07:17,320
think it's like the Lucas recipe just

3157
02:07:14,039 --> 02:07:19,039
that basic GH right um I think it likes

3158
02:07:17,319 --> 02:07:22,078
Organics though you know I was growing

3159
02:07:19,039 --> 02:07:26,078
it side by side with a friend soil

3160
02:07:22,078 --> 02:07:29,158
versus Hydro rock wool you know um the

3161
02:07:26,078 --> 02:07:31,039
the uh the clay pellets and it seems to

3162
02:07:29,158 --> 02:07:34,238
just Express itself to its Fuller

3163
02:07:31,039 --> 02:07:36,279
potential when grown in soil um with

3164
02:07:34,238 --> 02:07:38,759
organic nutrients I mean my same friend

3165
02:07:36,279 --> 02:07:41,078
was growing in soil but with chem

3166
02:07:38,760 --> 02:07:42,719
nutrients um and then I think one thing

3167
02:07:41,078 --> 02:07:44,840
that I started doing I was like okay

3168
02:07:42,719 --> 02:07:49,039
what nutrient is most responsible for

3169
02:07:44,840 --> 02:07:50,078
smell and flavored so is uh sulfur you

3170
02:07:49,039 --> 02:07:51,760
know and I think there's been some

3171
02:07:50,078 --> 02:07:53,519
studies that came out recently that suur

3172
02:07:51,760 --> 02:07:55,480
is responsible for that like skunky

3173
02:07:53,520 --> 02:07:57,559
Aroma yeah abstract Tech they're call

3174
02:07:55,479 --> 02:08:00,158
them flavorant but it's it has to do

3175
02:07:57,559 --> 02:08:01,520
with THS and sulfur and sulfur being so

3176
02:08:00,158 --> 02:08:04,759
I don't think that's necessarily what

3177
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:06,800
gives the sour it skunky smell but I did

3178
02:08:04,760 --> 02:08:08,400
start kind of gravitating toward I think

3179
02:08:06,800 --> 02:08:10,719
that's why it's pungent though is is

3180
02:08:08,399 --> 02:08:12,118
from that for sure some Epsom salt you

3181
02:08:10,719 --> 02:08:14,279
know from the store just cuz it's cheap

3182
02:08:12,118 --> 02:08:15,839
and easy right I've used a lot of

3183
02:08:14,279 --> 02:08:20,319
different nutrients on I've used banic

3184
02:08:15,840 --> 02:08:23,520
hair Advanced Nutrients bio Biz Organics

3185
02:08:20,319 --> 02:08:25,759
alive um and I think it just likes good

3186
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:29,320
amended soil this last round I used a

3187
02:08:25,760 --> 02:08:31,039
blend of Organics alive and some biolink

3188
02:08:29,319 --> 02:08:32,439
with some inoculants um you know just

3189
02:08:31,039 --> 02:08:34,359
kind of standard run-of-the-mill

3190
02:08:32,439 --> 02:08:36,678
Organics but I really do like uh some of

3191
02:08:34,359 --> 02:08:39,960
the more water soluble organic stuff

3192
02:08:36,679 --> 02:08:42,480
just cuz I do in jackon totally and you

3193
02:08:39,960 --> 02:08:44,679
have lines yeah I've got kind of it's

3194
02:08:42,479 --> 02:08:46,479
not automated but I've got the five rows

3195
02:08:44,679 --> 02:08:47,920
are all separated they're all on emitter

3196
02:08:46,479 --> 02:08:49,638
so I just turn on a couple lines at a

3197
02:08:47,920 --> 02:08:52,599
time and then just you know watch the

3198
02:08:49,639 --> 02:08:54,639
tank go down switch the lines

3199
02:08:52,599 --> 02:08:56,039
and a lot of stff stilles clog it even

3200
02:08:54,639 --> 02:08:57,400
the really you know soluble organic

3201
02:08:56,039 --> 02:09:00,158
stuff some of yeah some of the stuff

3202
02:08:57,399 --> 02:09:02,479
just just clogs but good organic stuff

3203
02:09:00,158 --> 02:09:04,118
clogs yeah um but it's pretty basic I

3204
02:09:02,479 --> 02:09:05,919
mean nothing special you know it's got a

3205
02:09:04,118 --> 02:09:08,238
greenhouse with some good ventilation

3206
02:09:05,920 --> 02:09:09,880
nice so you you're not just a one hit

3207
02:09:08,238 --> 02:09:13,118
wonder you showed me some other land

3208
02:09:09,880 --> 02:09:14,719
race genetics that were you know stuff

3209
02:09:13,118 --> 02:09:15,920
that you just don't see you might see it

3210
02:09:14,719 --> 02:09:17,520
at rig in the river but you really

3211
02:09:15,920 --> 02:09:20,800
typically wouldn't see it anywhere else

3212
02:09:17,520 --> 02:09:23,480
in California other than in the Hills

3213
02:09:20,800 --> 02:09:25,079
yeah um I haven't seen a lot of it

3214
02:09:23,479 --> 02:09:27,238
myself I'm you know I'm still learning

3215
02:09:25,078 --> 02:09:29,359
I'm it's new to me you know I've been a

3216
02:09:27,238 --> 02:09:30,638
kind of a traditional kind of hype guy

3217
02:09:29,359 --> 02:09:33,198
almost I mean I grew a lot of sour

3218
02:09:30,639 --> 02:09:35,760
predominantly yeah and I guess I've

3219
02:09:33,198 --> 02:09:37,279
never really kind of I've always gratit

3220
02:09:35,760 --> 02:09:38,719
towards stuff that was different you

3221
02:09:37,279 --> 02:09:41,479
know and just held on to that and kind

3222
02:09:38,719 --> 02:09:43,599
of ran with it MH um and then my

3223
02:09:41,479 --> 02:09:45,039
father-in-law has been collecting seeds

3224
02:09:43,599 --> 02:09:48,279
and pollen from around the world since

3225
02:09:45,039 --> 02:09:49,960
the 60s wow and as soon as I met him I

3226
02:09:48,279 --> 02:09:52,319
knew that he had something different

3227
02:09:49,960 --> 02:09:54,719
going on but it took me a little while

3228
02:09:52,319 --> 02:09:57,279
to kind of experience what he was trying

3229
02:09:54,719 --> 02:10:00,118
to share with me and I kind of like to

3230
02:09:57,279 --> 02:10:02,399
call like an indicia detox you have to

3231
02:10:00,118 --> 02:10:04,558
almost only smoke these types of

3232
02:10:02,399 --> 02:10:07,000
varieties to really understand the hide

3233
02:10:04,559 --> 02:10:10,559
because they don't slap you in the face

3234
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:12,920
super hard instantly MH like a good OG

3235
02:10:10,559 --> 02:10:15,840
cush for example you know it

3236
02:10:12,920 --> 02:10:17,760
just um it's hard and quick where some

3237
02:10:15,840 --> 02:10:19,840
of these other varieties it kind of

3238
02:10:17,760 --> 02:10:21,520
builds up to this thing where you get to

3239
02:10:19,840 --> 02:10:24,000
a point where you're like damn I am is

3240
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:26,559
so high right now yeah and that can be

3241
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:28,840
subtle but when it takes full course is

3242
02:10:26,559 --> 02:10:30,480
actually really strong and then once you

3243
02:10:28,840 --> 02:10:32,760
start to

3244
02:10:30,479 --> 02:10:34,479
notice that experience kind of from

3245
02:10:32,760 --> 02:10:35,920
start to finish and some of it does come

3246
02:10:34,479 --> 02:10:39,718
on quick you know like the African Haze

3247
02:10:35,920 --> 02:10:41,440
11 is a really quick acting Strong high

3248
02:10:39,719 --> 02:10:44,000
and it lasts for a long time and it can

3249
02:10:41,439 --> 02:10:47,078
be pretty intense um those pearls that I

3250
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:50,158
showed you yeah are similar but I feel

3251
02:10:47,078 --> 02:10:52,519
like it's a little less racy and more of

3252
02:10:50,158 --> 02:10:56,879
that like good giggly feeling where you

3253
02:10:52,520 --> 02:11:00,480
just feel absolutely fantastic right

3254
02:10:56,880 --> 02:11:02,239
um so it's hard they take a long time to

3255
02:11:00,479 --> 02:11:04,359
flower you know a lot of things can go

3256
02:11:02,238 --> 02:11:06,000
wrong in 14 weeks and then the pearls

3257
02:11:04,359 --> 02:11:08,719
they look like something you might throw

3258
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:10,158
away Dr grinin is like yeah I mean yeah

3259
02:11:08,719 --> 02:11:11,679
it looks like most people would call

3260
02:11:10,158 --> 02:11:12,839
that undesirable or they'd be like

3261
02:11:11,679 --> 02:11:15,679
that's what I used to see in High Times

3262
02:11:12,840 --> 02:11:17,119
in the 70s yeah and people associate

3263
02:11:15,679 --> 02:11:19,880
that with have some for some reason have

3264
02:11:17,118 --> 02:11:22,238
a negative connotation right but I think

3265
02:11:19,880 --> 02:11:23,800
a lot of it just comes down to to well

3266
02:11:22,238 --> 02:11:25,479
be honest with yourself did you grow it

3267
02:11:23,800 --> 02:11:27,159
to its full potential because if you

3268
02:11:25,479 --> 02:11:29,000
didn't then you can't really say it was

3269
02:11:27,158 --> 02:11:31,000
or wasn't good sure I learned that the

3270
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:32,238
hard way with LEDs I recently got rid of

3271
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:34,960
some good genetics that I thought

3272
02:11:32,238 --> 02:11:37,399
weren't good um I later found out they

3273
02:11:34,960 --> 02:11:38,960
were and I should have kept them um and

3274
02:11:37,399 --> 02:11:40,759
then just you know sometimes the yiel Is

3275
02:11:38,960 --> 02:11:42,639
Not Great sometimes the yiel is actually

3276
02:11:40,760 --> 02:11:44,400
really good so I think it just takes

3277
02:11:42,639 --> 02:11:47,159
someone that is really after the

3278
02:11:44,399 --> 02:11:50,238
experience and the high the whole kind

3279
02:11:47,158 --> 02:11:52,439
of enchilada of growing it rolling the

3280
02:11:50,238 --> 02:11:54,039
joint multiple times to figure out what

3281
02:11:52,439 --> 02:11:55,960
to do with it too like how you can

3282
02:11:54,039 --> 02:11:57,198
improve it totally cuz you know you

3283
02:11:55,960 --> 02:11:58,679
could grow it once and it didn't come

3284
02:11:57,198 --> 02:12:00,000
out that good and you grow it over and

3285
02:11:58,679 --> 02:12:02,760
over and over and that's how I learned

3286
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:05,039
how to grow really good I grew the sour

3287
02:12:02,760 --> 02:12:06,960
repeatedly as many times as I could for

3288
02:12:05,039 --> 02:12:09,599
years and years and years and it really

3289
02:12:06,960 --> 02:12:11,840
taught me this is a nitrogen deficiency

3290
02:12:09,599 --> 02:12:13,599
this is a cow mag deficiency and I was

3291
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:15,520
able to identify certain things so that

3292
02:12:13,599 --> 02:12:17,319
when I grew other plants it was like

3293
02:12:15,520 --> 02:12:19,360
okay I know what to look for as opposed

3294
02:12:17,319 --> 02:12:22,118
to well it could be underwatering with

3295
02:12:19,359 --> 02:12:24,158
this plant or overwatering or issue but

3296
02:12:22,118 --> 02:12:27,078
you don't know until you do it multiple

3297
02:12:24,158 --> 02:12:29,158
times and then you know what a good

3298
02:12:27,078 --> 02:12:30,799
version of sour is or a good version of

3299
02:12:29,158 --> 02:12:33,118
Bubba cush is right because you've done

3300
02:12:30,800 --> 02:12:36,239
it enough times to know well I love

3301
02:12:33,118 --> 02:12:37,880
Bubba Bubba's name got ruined in the you

3302
02:12:36,238 --> 02:12:39,919
know 10 starting 10 years ago when they

3303
02:12:37,880 --> 02:12:42,760
started mass producing Bubba in huge

3304
02:12:39,920 --> 02:12:44,679
warehouses and so I think a lot of

3305
02:12:42,760 --> 02:12:46,760
people think of Bubba is something

3306
02:12:44,679 --> 02:12:48,118
completely different than what I know is

3307
02:12:46,760 --> 02:12:51,840
buba and what you know is Bubba that

3308
02:12:48,118 --> 02:12:54,158
pre98 soapy has a a you know it has an

3309
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:56,039
amazing Aroma it's gassy it's soapy it's

3310
02:12:54,158 --> 02:12:58,158
special it smokes good it it has a good

3311
02:12:56,039 --> 02:13:00,279
effect it in my opinion it checks all

3312
02:12:58,158 --> 02:13:03,759
the boxes right but there's like the the

3313
02:13:00,279 --> 02:13:05,840
whole in Oakland San Leandro uh they

3314
02:13:03,760 --> 02:13:08,480
were between Oakland and San Leandro on

3315
02:13:05,840 --> 02:13:10,440
San Leandro Avenue they were going

3316
02:13:08,479 --> 02:13:14,718
filling warehouses and just growing up

3317
02:13:10,439 --> 02:13:17,678
pulling it 53 days or less sometimes 49

3318
02:13:14,719 --> 02:13:19,000
days so you know it's like depending on

3319
02:13:17,679 --> 02:13:20,679
who you grow and what cut you have

3320
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:22,078
that's the other thing is like just cuz

3321
02:13:20,679 --> 02:13:23,800
it's called one thing doesn't mean that

3322
02:13:22,078 --> 02:13:25,799
it's necessarily that like Bubba Kush is

3323
02:13:23,800 --> 02:13:28,679
a great example cuz there's several cuts

3324
02:13:25,800 --> 02:13:30,199
of Bubba Kush and there's there's one

3325
02:13:28,679 --> 02:13:31,920
good one in my opinion that I've seen

3326
02:13:30,198 --> 02:13:33,439
over the years yeah and I get that a lot

3327
02:13:31,920 --> 02:13:35,118
with the sour people ask me what cut is

3328
02:13:33,439 --> 02:13:38,039
this and I say well I don't know because

3329
02:13:35,118 --> 02:13:41,759
it was just the sour yeah it was pre any

3330
02:13:38,039 --> 02:13:43,118
names you know and people's reaction

3331
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:44,639
like yours was often like well I haven't

3332
02:13:43,118 --> 02:13:46,238
seen this one you know since back in the

3333
02:13:44,639 --> 02:13:48,559
day or for 20 years and so it's like

3334
02:13:46,238 --> 02:13:51,839
well what what do you have like I had

3335
02:13:48,559 --> 02:13:54,199
some friends um they got a batch from my

3336
02:13:51,840 --> 02:13:57,279
buddy that had seeded itself and they

3337
02:13:54,198 --> 02:13:59,638
grew those seeds and they said for years

3338
02:13:57,279 --> 02:14:01,920
that that sour that came out of those

3339
02:13:59,639 --> 02:14:05,279
seeds wasn't the same as the sour clone

3340
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:06,639
that we had oh wow um makes sense though

3341
02:14:05,279 --> 02:14:08,840
you know it was a little bit watered

3342
02:14:06,639 --> 02:14:10,520
down maybe it got a little bit of pollen

3343
02:14:08,840 --> 02:14:14,719
from something else maybe it was self

3344
02:14:10,520 --> 02:14:16,800
who knows but um that sour cut you know

3345
02:14:14,719 --> 02:14:18,520
it was just as sour and I'm thankful

3346
02:14:16,800 --> 02:14:20,520
that I've kept on to it you know cuz I

3347
02:14:18,520 --> 02:14:22,920
feel like it is a special one and I kind

3348
02:14:20,520 --> 02:14:24,520
of knew just my gut was telling me just

3349
02:14:22,920 --> 02:14:26,279
don't let go of this don't let go this

3350
02:14:24,520 --> 02:14:28,639
you know I really connected with it in a

3351
02:14:26,279 --> 02:14:30,559
really strong way yeah and was around

3352
02:14:28,639 --> 02:14:32,800
other people that had that same really

3353
02:14:30,559 --> 02:14:35,239
strong connection when it was really

3354
02:14:32,800 --> 02:14:36,800
popular and it's interesting to see you

3355
02:14:35,238 --> 02:14:38,558
know I kind of just throw my arms up and

3356
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:40,440
be like man it's just sour you know it's

3357
02:14:38,559 --> 02:14:42,719
just a good batch of sour hopefully the

3358
02:14:40,439 --> 02:14:45,319
next one comes out that good you know

3359
02:14:42,719 --> 02:14:46,719
totally yeah and I mean it is farming

3360
02:14:45,319 --> 02:14:48,158
from Harvest to harvest is different

3361
02:14:46,719 --> 02:14:49,639
comes out slightly different you know

3362
02:14:48,158 --> 02:14:52,000
it's like you try to get it as

3363
02:14:49,639 --> 02:14:53,760
consistent as possible and

3364
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:55,078
if you do it right it's going to be good

3365
02:14:53,760 --> 02:14:56,639
if you do it wrong it's not going to be

3366
02:14:55,078 --> 02:14:59,158
as good but typically it's going to be

3367
02:14:56,639 --> 02:15:01,078
good yeah and you know I mean growing in

3368
02:14:59,158 --> 02:15:02,759
a greenhouse versus indoor and outdoor

3369
02:15:01,078 --> 02:15:04,799
it's all going to be different you're

3370
02:15:02,760 --> 02:15:06,679
going to have oh to totally different

3371
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:08,239
and and structurally too the bud can be

3372
02:15:06,679 --> 02:15:10,760
structurally different indoor versus

3373
02:15:08,238 --> 02:15:14,598
outdoor versus Greenhouse versus mix

3374
02:15:10,760 --> 02:15:16,800
light and I found that the area sour

3375
02:15:14,599 --> 02:15:19,078
stinks more than the really dense sour

3376
02:15:16,800 --> 02:15:22,360
yeah um for whatever reason there's just

3377
02:15:19,078 --> 02:15:24,519
more like like air surface area for that

3378
02:15:22,359 --> 02:15:26,279
smell to get out but I find like on the

3379
02:15:24,520 --> 02:15:28,559
indoor the bigger buds would be less

3380
02:15:26,279 --> 02:15:31,039
stinky than the smaller buds that were

3381
02:15:28,559 --> 02:15:32,559
maybe weren't as dense right which is

3382
02:15:31,039 --> 02:15:34,118
now you're getting into the same plant

3383
02:15:32,559 --> 02:15:36,279
grown the same way but different parts

3384
02:15:34,118 --> 02:15:38,799
of the plant are producing different

3385
02:15:36,279 --> 02:15:41,759
types of of butt you know sides as

3386
02:15:38,800 --> 02:15:44,000
opposed to the top a lot more curp yeah

3387
02:15:41,760 --> 02:15:44,960
it's really interesting yeah well we're

3388
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,399
going to have to get you down to the B

3389
02:15:44,960 --> 02:15:48,118
area get you on a show I'd love to do a

3390
02:15:46,399 --> 02:15:49,759
whole podcast come down we could smoke

3391
02:15:48,118 --> 02:15:53,039
the sour together talk about it smoke

3392
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:54,760
some of the other stuff that uh it was a

3393
02:15:53,039 --> 02:15:56,960
Bubba Haze that you had that was pretty

3394
02:15:54,760 --> 02:16:00,320
Bubba Kush original Haze yeah really

3395
02:15:56,960 --> 02:16:02,198
nice real Bubba Aroma like nostalgic

3396
02:16:00,319 --> 02:16:04,198
Bubba smell but it has something else to

3397
02:16:02,198 --> 02:16:06,799
it it's a little funky a little sharp on

3398
02:16:04,198 --> 02:16:07,960
the nose too yeah it's it's a good combo

3399
02:16:06,800 --> 02:16:10,000
that's one of my favorite hybrids right

3400
02:16:07,960 --> 02:16:11,840

and then the acts they've had so many

3440
02:17:34,239 --> 02:17:37,318
good performers over the last couple

3441
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:39,079
days tonight's going to be another

3442
02:17:37,318 --> 02:17:41,359
amazing night you know last night

3443
02:17:39,079 --> 02:17:43,439
finishing with Capleton and then they

3444
02:17:41,359 --> 02:17:45,439
did the the battle with the with the dub

3445
02:17:43,439 --> 02:17:48,559
plates last night that was pretty sound

3446
02:17:45,439 --> 02:17:51,120
was sick to bring that real real

3447
02:17:48,558 --> 02:17:52,799
Jamaican culture here is really the

3448
02:17:51,120 --> 02:17:55,439
first of its kind to bring that to

3449
02:17:52,799 --> 02:17:57,759
reging on the river so I love what Leo

3450
02:17:55,439 --> 02:17:59,920
has done with this festival and the acts

3451
02:17:57,760 --> 02:18:03,359
that he's brought as you were mentioning

3452
02:17:59,920 --> 02:18:05,359
it's not like all the big headlining

3453
02:18:03,359 --> 02:18:07,599
acts it's a lot of this underground

3454
02:18:05,359 --> 02:18:11,120
reggae music and and sound system

3455
02:18:07,599 --> 02:18:12,719
culture that he's booked there's 41 dj/

3456
02:18:11,120 --> 02:18:15,399
sound systems that he brought to this

3457
02:18:12,718 --> 02:18:17,239
event and so I love that aspect of this

3458
02:18:15,398 --> 02:18:19,478
event so I heard that that sound system

3459
02:18:17,239 --> 02:18:21,280
was a million dollars down at the river

3460
02:18:19,478 --> 02:18:23,840
I don't know what the price is but

3461
02:18:21,280 --> 02:18:27,399
christop fari Royal Sound and Lighting

3462
02:18:23,840 --> 02:18:29,040
they know how to tune a sound not only

3463
02:18:27,398 --> 02:18:31,239
setting up the sound it's not only their

3464
02:18:29,040 --> 02:18:33,639
relationship with void Acoustics but

3465
02:18:31,239 --> 02:18:35,679
it's tuning that sound that Chris and

3466
02:18:33,638 --> 02:18:38,239
Zach and the whole royal Sound and

3467
02:18:35,679 --> 02:18:40,120
Lighting family just have on point you

3468

02:18:40,120 --> 02:18:44,399
there and not hurt your ears the main

3470
02:18:42,679 --> 02:18:47,840
stage was a little a little ringing this

3471
02:18:44,398 --> 02:18:49,879
morning because the main stage but the

3472
02:18:47,840 --> 02:18:52,519
