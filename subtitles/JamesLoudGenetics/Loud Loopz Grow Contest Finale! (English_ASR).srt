00:00:02,549 --> 00:00:12,239
[Music]

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,160
how's it going everybody thank you for

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,019
tuning in today today is the big day

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,879
where we announced the winner of the

6
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:19,679
loud Loops grow contest

7
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:22,559
I learned a lot of things over the past

8
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:25,160
six months uh especially over the last

9
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:28,320
two weeks since I got the entries back

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,660
uh about fairness and everything else I

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,359
feel like giving people seeds and

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,299
expecting them to grow them

13
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:38,159
is almost unfair I think a clone would

14
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:41,218
give every Everything an even playing

15
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:43,319
field uh because then everybody starts

16
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,520
with the same thing giving people seeds

17
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,799
you're going to get some winners you're

18
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,140
going to get some losers uh especially

19
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:51,299
with five seeds it doesn't give you a

20
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,039
lot of things to pick from if you're a

21
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:55,439
great cultivator I don't necessarily

22
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,000
think the best cultivator came in first

23
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,459
place I think the guy with the best

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,019
genetics who grew really well came in

25
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,359
first place everything was really

26
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,420
impressive I mean the top 10 we narrowed

27
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,700
it down from 18 to 10 and then from 10 I

28
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,640
put them in order I smoked joints

29
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:14,219
competing them against each other but I

30
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,460
I gave each one a fair chance and some

31
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:19,438
people turned in five phenotypes so it

32
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:21,298
was first I had a narrow phenotypes down

33
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:23,059
for people and then moving from there I

34
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,700
had to go on and

35
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:28,259
uh pair them against each other and what

36
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,200
I did was like smoke in the morning and

37
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:35,579
then give it a couple hours uh this is a

38
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:38,219
really strong Indica leaning variety uh

39
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:40,739
and so the cultivars that you guys

40
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:42,359
selected to turn in some of them were

41
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:45,000
really strong and I also feel some

42
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:46,438
people went a little bit long with their

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,780
harvest date they probably could have

44
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:51,179
gone a little sooner and that definitely

45
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,460
affects the strength of the and the

46
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,520
effect of the uh the high

47
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:58,259
okay guys so how I made it more of an

48
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:59,819
even playing field or attempted to make

49
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,099
it more of an even playing field was

50
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:03,478
when I did the intake I took everybody's

51
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:05,099
product and I stored them in these Grove

52
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:07,438
turf block bags

53
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:09,359
uh what I really like doing is taking my

54
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,219
jars if I'm worried about my flower

55
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,780
getting damaged I mean if you're talking

56
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:14,939
about pounds and ounces and whatever

57
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,759
they make different sizes but you just

58
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:19,800
take the flower right here

59
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:22,378
and you can put them in with the lid off

60
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,719
and put them at 60 degrees

61
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:25,919
the great way to store your flour long

62
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:27,959
term

63
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,958
I think it's an amazing solution I'm

64
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:32,759
glad they came up with these

65
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:35,640
and then the entries

66
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:39,239
I basically divided them up into these

67
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:42,000
chirp lock bags for storage and for ease

68
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,439
of use I smoked a lot of joints I rolled

69
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,080
big joints I feel like you get the most

70
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,780
flavor from larger joints so two gram

71
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,420
joints was my go-to choice although I

72
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,878
smoked some smaller ones

73
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:56,219
um you know and it's really interesting

74
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:58,318
because

75
00:02:56,219 --> 00:03:00,959
I feel like after storing these in five

76
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:02,518
days before I actually smoked them a lot

77
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,719
of the Terps came out that weren't there

78
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:06,420
initially when I looked at some of the

79
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:08,818
stuff I was like it looks a little you

80
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:10,500
know premature or some of the stuff I

81
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:12,780
was like well it's not cured out yet and

82
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:16,199
it definitely did the trick

83
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:19,500
so appreciate uh Grove and turblock

84
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:22,079

the James loud genetics website so uh

99
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:59,518
we're gonna do this contest again with

100
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,739
clones tissue culture clones uh later on

101
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:05,219
this year so I'm really looking forward

102
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:08,519
to that but uh let's go down so 10th

103
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:11,699
place we got the Big Green Wave

105
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:16,620
appreciate you guys thank you guys for

106
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:20,639
turning in entries uh top 10 you guys

107
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,840
get uh prizes so big green wave at 10th

108
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,639
Place

109
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:28,918
uh Ninth Place we got God's Garden

110
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:30,418
and uh you know I I can't speak highly

111
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:33,478
enough of all these entries it was

112
00:04:30,418 --> 00:04:36,240
really difficult based on looks some of

113
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:37,620
them were actually sleepers that you

114
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,780
know in the sense that they didn't look

115
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,160
great they smelled pretty good but those

116
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:43,138
were definitely the ones that leaned

117
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,939
towards like the Skittles Side of

118
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:47,340
Everything

119
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:50,579
uh so and what we had was zerio's which

120
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:52,439
is uh zerbert times uh cereal milk and

121
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:56,099
that that times the zbx which is a

122
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:58,500
skittles back cross with gelato 41 and

123
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,699
so you get some cereal stuff a lot of

124
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,699
the stuff leaned towards the cereal milk

125
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:05,040
I have to say but you got some cereal

126
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:07,259
milk sherbet you know and then there's

127
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,699
Skittles in there so there was some

128
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:11,220
sweet stuff those ones didn't look

129
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:16,020
nearly as good as the cereal milk

130
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:18,300
so uh God's garden and Ninth Place we've

131
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:21,120
got a relaxed atmosphere that turned in

132
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,439
uh some really amazing stuff that I

133
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,600
don't I wouldn't necessarily look the

134
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:27,779
best but smoked absolutely amazing

135
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,000
definitely soil grown

136
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:31,038
um as a lot of the entries were soil

137
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:37,319
grown

138
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:41,759
budget grower77 at uh Seventh Place

139
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:44,279
uh really good stuff uh NorCal cannabis

140
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,800
we got sixth place for NorCal cannabis

141
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:50,939
really appreciate the entries love your

142
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:54,720
Instagram uh keep up the good work uh

143
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:57,839
fifth place we got cannabinoid wolf my

144
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,360
friend uh Michael Myers great job

145
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:02,219
I feel like he might have kept the best

146
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,379
injury to smoke and turned in the second

147
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:07,139
best one to me but you know

148
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:08,879
whatever whatever goes it was really

149
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:10,259
good I feel like his structure wasn't

150
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:13,199
there his room was probably a little bit

151
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:15,000
hot but his Bud although kind of loose

152
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,720
was super sticky and smoked really

153
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,600
really really good uh long finish

154
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:25,440
amazing uh 420 Bomb Pops he turned in

155
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:28,139
colas from each of his five phenotypes

156
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:29,939
and wow good stuff good stuff and I mean

157
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:32,400
the top five is it's really so

158
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:35,219
subjective when you get into these top

159
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:37,019
five uh with contests especially with

160
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:40,500
people that are so passionate yeah all

161
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:41,879
these the top 10 especially you know not

162
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,918
that there was anything wrong with the

163
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:46,579
11 through 18 they just weren't up to

164
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:50,339
par with the top ten uh some people

165
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:51,959
turned in some really interesting things

166
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:53,459
um and now we're going to get into third

167
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:56,839
place

168
00:06:53,459 --> 00:07:00,359
which is a happy Fields Farms

169
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:03,959
and I feel like the Expressions that he

170
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:06,000
got out of these plants were amazing uh

171
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:07,560
you know there there's a lot of unique

172
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,360
Expressions which is really what you

173
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,280
want as a cultivator

174
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,979
when you're growing all these you know

175
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,659
these seeds out if you can't grow them

176
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:17,818
exceptionally well it's going to be

177
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:21,139
really hard to differentiate between the

178
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:24,539
best and the worst uh Happy Fields Farms

179
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:27,418
his Expressions really amazing I mean I

180
00:07:24,538 --> 00:07:30,360
got a good idea of what to expect when

181
00:07:27,418 --> 00:07:33,478
you buy five seeds out of that and I was

182
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:36,780
pleasantly surprised so second place

183
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:39,180

187
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,660

188
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:50,098

189
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:52,620

grams phenomenal flower sticky and lots

205
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:30,779
of candy and I think that's what I was

206
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:33,179
looking for is candy somewhere that has

207
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:35,699
a good structure but still has that

208
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:37,319
skiddly candy that you know that really

209
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,120
lingers on the back your palette that

210
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,399
has that long finish

211
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,038
phenomenal stuff

212
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:45,539
um you know it's it's really interesting

213
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:47,879
doing these contests and this is my

214
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:50,338
first one we're gonna do more we're

215
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:52,620
gonna do more with clones specifically

216
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:55,080
and uh

217
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:56,700
yeah I think you know so I guess let's

218
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,580
talk a little bit about the Expressions

219
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:02,879
uh that we got you know that went from

220
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:07,019
uh very like various candy we got candy

221
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:08,700
necklace we got Skittles sweet uh we

222
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:10,580
we've got all kinds of different candy

223
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:14,278
in there and then there was some really

224
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:17,519
earthy pungent gas uh from like the

225
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:20,100
cereal milk side and the sherbet side

226
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:23,278
where it's like that earthy gassy kind

227
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,839
of nose burn even gassy in some of the

228
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:27,958
females and I really like those as well

229
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:30,180
I think the market is kind of pivoting

230
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:31,919
for for some of those as well the candy

231
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:33,120
is always going to be popular dessert

232
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:35,039
strains are always going to be popular

233
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,679
we will constantly be going back to

234
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:39,620
those but uh trying to switch it up with

235
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:41,639
the earthy pungent ones

236
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:44,940
uh you know

237
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:47,338
I would say that the ones that were

238
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:50,040
gassy that had that cereal milk kind of

239
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:51,360
complexion those ones are the ones that

240
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:54,059
stacked harder the ones that probably

241
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,680
yield more uh there was a lot of

242
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:58,799
interesting stuff there but I really

243
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:00,539
liked the sweet nose uh that probably

244
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:03,000
doesn't yield quite as much doesn't look

245
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:05,399
necessarily quite as nice

246
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,759
uh really interesting though and then so

247
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:10,740
big shout out to SF Canna I gave them 72

248
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:12,899
seeds I germinated them and give them so

249
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,778
I could have a baseline for kind of what

250
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:18,299
we're looking for genetically and so as

251
00:10:15,778 --> 00:10:21,000
far as Rec grows SF Canna popped and

252
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:22,799
found some amazing stuff they grow in

253
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,679
cocoa and I would say that it stands up

254
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:28,679
to a lot of the soil entries believe it

255
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:30,479
or not some people hate on Cocoa some

256
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:33,239
people hate on rock well I'm not a huge

257
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,039
fan of rockwool but Coco definitely you

258
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,580
can crush and these guys crushed with

259
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:40,620
the 72 there's at least 10 that I think

260
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:43,680
should be grown out again that were

261
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:45,600
phenomenal so big shout out to SF Canada

262
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:47,639
those guys are crushing I really

263
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,019
appreciate you guys for tuning in and I

264
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:50,879
