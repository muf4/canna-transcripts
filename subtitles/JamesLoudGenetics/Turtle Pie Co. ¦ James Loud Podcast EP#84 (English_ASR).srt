00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,840
for a minute we uh have run with similar

14
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,759
the same group of friends but not really

15
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,079
known each other for quite a while when

16
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:06,759
I saw you uh chefing at the birthday

17
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:09,759
party I was like wait a minute like how

18
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,439
how close are you I had no idea so the

19
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:12,560
fact that we're on the show and we're uh

20
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,079
getting to know more about each other is

21
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,118
great seems like it's long overdue

22
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:18,519
totally yeah and I've known about Turtle

23
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:21,319
pie for quite a while Turtle Magnum it

24
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:23,000
made the made the circuit you know a

25
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:24,639
while back and that was super popular

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,719
and I feel like it was a hype strain for

27
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,960
a minute it was the thing to have yeah

28
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:31,239
that magum Turtle definitely had its

29
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:33,399
little spotlight it was it was

30
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:35,158
challenged heavily by the lcgs cuz it

31
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:36,920
looked it looked the same but it

32
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,759
definitely had its own tarpine profile

33
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,640
its own taste it was so great though

34
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,000
honestly that's exactly why it was so

35
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,239
great cuz it wasn't just lcg it was

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,519
different no lcg just looked similar

37
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,560
there was no lcg yeah it did it had a

38
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:53,199
similar look but the tpine profile was

39
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,680
completely different the effect was

40
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,320
really good I feel like it was pretty

41
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,200
strong anecdotally do you remember

42
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:00,679
cherry pie I do was there any tarpine

43
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,759
profile similar ities between Magnum

44
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,039
turtle and cherry pie cuz the the first

45
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:05,680
time I smelled it the only thing that

46
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:07,200
came I'm like I've never maybe this is

47
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,239
what Cherry cuz I haven't seen cherry

48
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,878
pie since you Cherry Pie was like

49
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:15,319
straight anise and I mean okay I would

50
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:17,719
say cherry pie was like anise gas like a

51
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:20,518
GDP with more

52
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:22,039
cherry okay so that's that's how I

53
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:23,719
remember Cherry Pie and Cherry Pie hmed

54
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:26,318
a little bit when you grew it and but

55
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:27,800
like cherry pie was amazing like I think

56
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:31,238
that was another one but I think that

57
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,719
that lost uh momentum because it had

58
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:35,719
intersex traits and people didn't want

59
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:38,280
[ __ ] that hmed but GDP was like the real

60
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:40,719
the real real back in the day cherry pie

61
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,318
was if you thought about opening the

62
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:44,280
door with the lights off it was going to

63
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:46,318
get seeds yeah cherry pie was special it

64
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,800
was extremely special and I mean that

65
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:51,639
came out of like the GDP era and was

66
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,159
like the new GDP and it was it checked

67
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:55,559
those boxes for those people that really

68
00:02:53,158 --> 00:02:57,158
like GDP but it wasn't GDP and that's

69
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,878
what I liked about it you know and the

70
00:02:57,158 --> 00:03:01,280
whole that that was like the beginning

71
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:04,719
of like the cookies are era absolutely

72
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:08,719
and it was the beginning of like back

73
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:11,598
then you had Jack TPS yeah you had sour

74
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:13,840
and OG turps and you had per turps and

75
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:14,959
there was you know there was other uh I

76
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,560
used to get this stuff called Orange

77
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,080
Crush so you had your citrus turps too

78
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,479
but there wasn't a ton of stuff outside

79
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,239
that box that was readily available so

80
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:25,238
when cherry pie came along I was like oh

81
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:28,560
wow this thing tastes way different it

82
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:31,519
was an early zah pre candy yeah for sure

83
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,799
for sure some of the I smoked funny uh

84
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,438
old friend of mine grew it in his

85
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,840
backyard in like half a whiskey barrel

86
00:03:35,438 --> 00:03:40,199
or some [ __ ] and and it was it didn't

87
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,840
HTM at all it was one plan it was huge

88
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:46,000
and it was just the firest outdoor I've

89
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:49,598
ever smoked growing in noi Valley uh uh

90
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,120
in early 2000s yeah it was like you know

91
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:52,438
I mean I feel like cookies was its own

92
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,599
thing and it was like a

93
00:03:52,438 --> 00:03:56,719
sweeter something that definitely tied

94
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:58,798
into the cookies and and you know I

95
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:00,919
really enjoyed it I the wild life was

96
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,599
around back then I was super excited

97
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:04,759
about the I have not seen the Y since

98
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:07,759
2014 used to get it from my buddy gold

99
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:10,158
member and Dude that [ __ ] why life

100
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:13,280
was down to the road tasted just as

101
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:15,239
intense as Skittles it was the you know

102
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,839
before Skittles that was the candy that

103
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:20,000
was the one it was floral too it was

104
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:22,319
super floral super sweet really amazing

105
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,079
that was one of those unobtainable

106
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:25,519
strains for me like I was lucky to find

107
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:26,918
an eth every once in a while or someone

108
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:28,478
would part with one because it was like

109
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:29,478
no I only got a zip I'm you know I'll

110
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:31,478
give you an eth cuz I'm going to keep

111
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:33,159
the rest this [ __ ] right uh but I

112
00:04:31,478 --> 00:04:35,240
definitely it was day it definitely had

113
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,160
his time in the sun I remember paying 60

114
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,199
bucks an e that we could get it straight

115
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,560
up 60 bucks an eth and that was it you

116
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,478
it didn't matter not 3.0 no we actually

117
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,079
got 3.5 might be a little wet but you

118
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:46,918
know it was okay I mean can't wait to

119
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:48,599
sell it you're not going to wait for it

120
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:50,120
to dry I remember the time yeah people

121
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,520
were so excited about certain things you

122
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,800
would buy it wet and you would lose a

123
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:54,159
little bit of weight but if you didn't

124
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,360
get it wet you wouldn't get it at all

125
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,639
you wouldn't get it yep so yeah so how

126
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,919
did you get your start uh in cannabis or

127
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,120

153
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,280
little flap of grass they'd pull up with

154

it fit you know my dad grew it he didn't

163
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,800

164
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,399
introduced him to me doing it it wasn't

165
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,680
like he was like all right it's time now

166
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,359
he never shared the family business with

167
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,560
me until way after the fact now you got

168
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,120
yeah he beat my ass it was funny like I

169
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,918
remember he left on Hawaii he went to

170
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,879
Hawaii one time and I was maybe a

171
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:43,959
freshman in high school and he left like

172
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:47,159
an ounce of weed in his weed drawer and

173
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:48,879
every day I took a little bit thinking

174
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,199
he wouldn't he wouldn't notice right but

175
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:52,918
the eth turned into like less than a

176
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,840
half ounce or the the ounce turned into

177
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:56,279
less than a half oun so to me it didn't

178
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:58,119
look like much was missing because I was

179
00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:00,279
taking you know bowl or two every day

180
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,560
not a big deal right home he's like all

181
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:02,878
right this has got to [ __ ] stop

182
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,918
you're you know you're a freshman in

183
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:05,879
high school you're not supposed to be

184
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:09,439
smoking weed I don't stop stealing my

185
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:11,360
weed get your own which I did and that's

186
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:14,160
kind of how this all started yeah had a

187
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,680
guy who would sell actual Ace for 60

188
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:20,240
bucks and bought an eighth one day broke

189
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,918
down three dubs sold them the next day

190
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,680
bought another eighth the day after that

191
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:27,240
broke down three dubs sold him the next

192
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,519
day now I had a dub it was like I saved

193
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:33,079
the0 five from the from the ace I did

194
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:36,000
didn't smoke it and for once and then I

195
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:38,758
just kept reinvesting and you know kind

196
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,240
of always always like being the plug to

197
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:43,400
a certain extent definitely has his

198
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,560
pitfalls being a plug plenty yeah um you

199
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:48,839
attract a lot of attention a lot of it

200
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,839
good A lot of it Sinister a lot of uh

201
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:54,038
multi- intention people hang out with

202
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:56,560
the plug yeah uh and so learned a lot of

203
00:07:54,038 --> 00:07:57,759
hard expensive lessons lost a lot of

204
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,120
people I thought were friends that

205
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,639
really weren't friends they were just

206
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,240
hanging out the plug um but at the end

207
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,840
of the day I don't know that I would

208
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,840
change too much maybe some of the dumb

209
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:10,478
decision decisions I made but you know

210
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:12,719
who wouldn't yeah you really know who

211
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:14,120
your friends are when [ __ ] hits the fan

212
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,080
you know I mean like when you go through

213
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,720
hell when you bad [ __ ] happens then you

214
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:19,598
really find out who your friends are

215
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,120
it's happened to me I've learned you

216
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:23,079
people that I thought were my best

217
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,280
friends or my close friends and then the

218
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:26,719
people that actually came out and that

219
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:29,679
were there for me it's like those were

220
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,560
my real friends you only got a couple of

221
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,918
flat tire rainy day on the freeway

222
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,679
friends you know I mean if if you got

223
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:37,639
three then you're probably in good shape

224
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,079
you know most people got one if it's not

225
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:42,038
their wife or partner you know what I

226
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,479
mean so uh and if you got more than that

227
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:44,838
then you're obviously running [ __ ] the

228
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:46,000
right way you're running your life and

229
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:47,800
you're making sure everybody else is

230
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,720
eating and taking care of everybody and

231
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:52,039
uh you're you're not wrong about about

232
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,959
the the how you find out what where you

233
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:55,278
are in their life they may be hold a

234
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:56,759
certain position in your life but you

235
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:59,240
don't really know where you hold what

236
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:02,078
position you hold in their life until

237
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,919
that day comes and then it's like oh how

238
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:05,519
did I not see that well the bad times

239
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:07,039
make you appreciate the good times even

240
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,639
more so I feel like you can't have the

241
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:11,759
bad without the good I mean there's that

242
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:14,480
contrast that really uh you know it

243
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:16,200
shows you who you are too and you know

244
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,480
the tough times the test you show you

245
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,120
what you're made of and then when you

246
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:23,039
have good times it you know it it allows

247
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,240
you to appreciate those those bad times

248
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:27,399
even more because they gave you that

249
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,560
contrast 100% it I heard the saying you

250
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:30,000
don't know happiness if you don't know

251
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:31,159
sadness and I kind of chuckled it off at

252
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,399
first and you're like no actually it's

253
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:34,719
really deep and it kind of they kind of

254
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,879
coexist like you can't have one without

255
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,879
the other you can't just be happy all

256
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:38,159
the time cuz then you won't know what

257
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:39,439
being happy is you don't actually

258
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,600
experience the opposite of that if

259
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,240
you've never been broke you won't really

260
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,879
appreciate what it's like to have money

261
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,720
and vice versa I think you got to be

262
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:48,200
broke

263
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,399
twice I agree I agree you really before

264
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,399
you really start to get it yeah you need

265
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,360
to make that and then if you're dumb and

266
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,078
you trick it all off and then you make

267
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,800
it again you're like I'm never going

268
00:09:56,078 --> 00:09:59,199
back like I really get it now like I'm

269
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:01,078
going to save every penny or I'm going

270
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,040
to invested correctly or yeah but also

271
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:04,159
you know that you can if you have to

272
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:05,838
right that's the other thing is like

273
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,360
then you you don't have the fear because

274
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,959
I think a lot of people they move

275
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,560
through life with fear but if you can

276
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,879
take that fear away and you can just

277
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,759
move and do things the right way you

278
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,000
know I mean there's so many way you know

279
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:17,919
the right way is so many different

280
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,480
things but there is the right way

281
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:21,639
everybody's version of the right way

282
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,278
yeah you know that's how your version of

283
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:26,559
the truth your version of how you look

284
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:28,360
at things your exactly am I normal I

285
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,119
don't know what your vision or version

286
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:33,399
of being normal is seem pretty normal to

287
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:36,000
me you know but yeah so it's perspective

288
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:37,839
it's all the balance for sure for sure

289
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,839
so yeah so and then you grew up in

290
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:43,079
California bone and raisin SF yeah first

291

00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:38,519
know what humble is but they know it's

347
00:12:37,198 --> 00:12:39,639
in California they know it's a place

348
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:41,679
where the good weed came from the good

349
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:43,320
weed came from exactly and it can't be

350
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:46,120
duplicated our climate can't be

351
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,199
duplicated and not in authentic way

352
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,759

397
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:34,120
pumped because the green dog team has

398
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:37,120
been scouring their resources to come up

399
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:39,879
with the diesel they grew up with in uh

400
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,679
in Vermont and one of the posts I read

401
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,559
the other day from the cultivator Keegan

402
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:46,078
shout out dirt lore buddy I love you

403
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:48,159
dude uh he was though just the passion

404
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:49,838
and the way he was describing the flower

405
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:51,360
of it being so reminiscent you could

406
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,240
kind of see like I could see it because

407
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,278
it was still wet but like the the

408
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,120
outside was really bright green but

409
00:14:56,278 --> 00:15:01,600
light light bright green a lime like a

410
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,278
like a line that you almost peeled some

411
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,079
of the [ __ ] skin off of like it was

412
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:09,720
super light and then it had these bright

413
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:11,719
pink salmon colored hairs and then the

414
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,560
inside was almost like white and

415
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,639
blinding yellow and I was like that's

416
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:16,919
what old wet diesel used to look like so

417
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:18,159
I haven't been up the sack in a couple

418
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:19,879
weeks but I'm going to go up and

419
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:22,600
hopefully get to smokes I don't I should

420
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:26,320
have don't we' had access since R the

421
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:28,399
river uh Dave from uh buero he grows the

422
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,879
real Sour and he gave me some of ree

423
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,240
we've had we done a podcast with them

424
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:34,919
I've been friends with them ever since

425
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:36,278
and amazing amazing and then it made me

426
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:39,198
think that really there's probably only

427
00:15:36,278 --> 00:15:40,958
one sour I feel like we have the AJ sour

428
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:43,120
and we have the weasel Diesel and all

429
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:44,958
these things and for me the sour that I

430
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,480
remember it was just one thing like

431
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:49,518
there was this one amazing open the bag

432
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:53,079
punches you in the face with TPS and

433
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,360
it's not super chemy it's got the gas

434
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:59,039
but it's definitely the gas on the

435
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:00,839
bottom and it has loud lime Citrus funk

436
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:03,039
and it just you open it up and it's

437
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:05,079
unmistakable the thing is is like with

438
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:06,799
certain things you smell enough times

439
00:16:05,078 --> 00:16:08,318
where it's not what you remember and

440
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,240
then you start wondering if your mind is

441
00:16:08,318 --> 00:16:12,360
like playing tricks on you and maybe you

442
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,720
just didn't remember it right the funny

443
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,480
thing is is once you smell it you'll go

444
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,720
oh that's it that is the one it's

445
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,440
unmistakable there's no other ones that

446
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,680
I remember that are quite like that I've

447
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:25,360
recently come across that we smoke what

448
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:27,278
we called Nate yeah BC weed Canada weed

449
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:31,360
we short we shortened Canada or Canadian

450
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:33,799
into Nate Anders n n and the nade and we

451
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,039
had we had what we called nade or we had

452
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:37,318
glue or glue there was wasn't really too

453
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:38,639
many other variations if there was I

454
00:16:37,318 --> 00:16:41,559
don't remember it well our friend

455
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,879

456
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:45,879
[ __ ] n dude it's like no it's

457
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:47,399
whatever he's calling it I'm like

458
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:50,318
looking at it and I'm

459
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:53,839
like way I'm smelling it and I'm like oh

460
00:16:50,318 --> 00:16:56,198
my God and then I touch it man like like

461
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,680
a [ __ ] reaching back into history

462
00:16:56,198 --> 00:17:01,039
reaching back into the 2000s I'm like

463
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:02,679
I'm like this is it like holy [ __ ] it's

464
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:05,599
a

465
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:08,240
2024 version you know grown differently

466
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:10,639
to today's standards and and if it's an

467
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,400
identical twin this is our mutually

468
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,720
favorite genetic right you know that

469
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,640
right both the second I I smelled it I

470
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,679
was like oh this is the one dude this is

471
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:23,038
the [ __ ] so what do you remember it as

472
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:25,038
because you have yeah I mean so I so the

473
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:26,599
funny thing is I I was so excited when

474
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:28,318
he gave it to me CU it's so loud and

475
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:30,359
it's like the OG that punches you in the

476
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:32,480
face it's got that OG gas that burns

477
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:35,479
your nose right and but it's not heavy

478
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,120
on the pine like like like Josh D and

479
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,400
some of these other ones have more of

480
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:41,879
that earthy Pine this one is like nose

481
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:45,960
burning and it's more on the sativa

482
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:48,679
leaning smaller buds uh longer flowering

483
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,360
and it has that nose burning punch like

484
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:52,600
the gas like you wouldn't believe it has

485
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:53,678
the most gas of anything out right now

486
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:55,158
and I showed it to a whole bunch of

487
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,240
people from New York and a whole bunch

488
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:58,280
of people from Miami and the thing is is

489
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:02,720
the first thing they're like d That's

490
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:04,519
crippy I'm like crippy uh yeah and so

491
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,360
their opinion was crippy I remember

492
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:09,038
getting that in the Bay Area as OG or

493
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:10,719
like we had an OG that was just like

494
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:14,798
that where it was like what the [ __ ] is

495
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:17,519
this you don't see gassy OG Brian from

496
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:20,400
vital soil hit me with some OG like an

497
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:22,279
ounce of OG that was it was the real OG

498
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,200
like unmistaken he's had the cut for 20

499
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:27,200
years it was the sh out to Brian living

500
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,558
soil yeah Brian from vital thank you

501
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,319
Brian it is you know he has it every

502
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:33,759
time I see him he usually givs me a

503
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:37,558
little bit and uh they do you know they

504
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:39,000
do the infinity jars and I think he has

505
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:40,359
some friends that are also he's working

506
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,400
with that are doing it and it's like

507
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:45,959
that is the real cut of OG like it's so

508
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:48,080
for me it it's not it's it's different

509
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,640
than the OG I grew yeah it's it's

510
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:55,279
feeling and effect wise it's there but

511
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:56,480
like I get in my nasal I get and I don't

512
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:58,119
I hate saying this cuz I don't want to

513
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,839
diminish it in any way but back then I

514
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:01,599
get Gorilla glue Vibes off it to a

515
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:03,319
certain extent Gorilla Glue was the [ __ ]

516
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:05,519
for years like that was a really killer

517
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:08,359
strain for a light you know it did well

518
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:11,079
for itself but like I get I get like the

519
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:14,038
merger of OG and Gorilla Glue not really

520
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:17,000
a GMO kind of stank but like that that

521
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:19,960
pungent that loud up there in the in the

522
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,079
in the simar structure to the glue too

523
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,919
the way it fingers out so I definitely

524
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:24,558
get what you're saying with the

525
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:27,159
structure also just the loudness it's

526
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:28,960
extremely loud uh you know and the first

527
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:31,240
thing like do you do you have any I

528
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,159
don't but our our mutual friend is

529
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,919
supposed to be bringing some soon I

530
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:36,960
think they're in they're they're in like

531
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:38,880
week six right now so it's a 10 weer so

532
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,400
we got four weeks he's splitting it with

533
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,559
you and I we get the the tester lights

534
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,360
so that's that's the you know that's the

535
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:47,440
dream and I love that stuff and it is so

536
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:49,519
loud right so that's the one where you

537
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,000
don't see you don't get the same effect

538
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:53,519
from gelados or cookies or any of these

539
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,558
things where you open the bag and it

540
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:57,279
burns your nose like you get hit it's

541
00:19:55,558 --> 00:19:59,399
like how sour would hit your face right

542
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:00,798
Sour's different but also when you open

543
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,519
the bag and it punches you in the face

544
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:05,639
with smell with the aroma it's just like

545
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:07,639
unmistakable cat piss is what started

546
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,080
for me where it had that that nose burn

547
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,679
where you open the bag you don't even

548
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:13,199
have to open the bag it would smell

549
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:15,840
through bags you know and I guarantee

550
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,200
you even today's standards the TPL locks

551
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:19,319
like it would it would go through TPL

552
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,798
locks cap his I miss some good cap his

553
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:22,678
man you're from the Bay Area so you

554
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:23,918
probably remember good ciss in the 90s

555
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,880
you know and it's like that's another

556
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,000
one where if I knew what my dad was

557
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,520
growing I'm sorry I cut you off but like

558
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,519
my dad always grew he only he only grew

559
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:34,158
green weed once and it was the [ __ ]

560
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:36,400
best [ __ ] he ever grew but all the other

561
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:39,039
ties and mexies that he grew that he

562
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,200
took care of and manicured and and it

563
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:43,839
was all fire like weed I've never seen

564
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,279
since you know se you know seeds that I

565
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:47,000
don't know if he went and where where

566
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:50,359
they came from out of a lid back in the

567
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,319
day uh but as as a freshman in high

568
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:54,599
school that the strain you're talking

569
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:57,599
about was for me was skunk yeah because

570
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:59,480
it was like you had to have seven bag it

571
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:01,558
had to be in seven fold over sandwich

572
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,720
bags or film canister when we used to

573
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:05,359
have 35mm because if you didn't you get

574
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,159
busted at school it would smell out of

575
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:09,918
your backpack and it'd be like a

576
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:12,200
thumb-sized bright green marble with one

577
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,759
Crown Royal bag purple leaf just laying

578
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,480
on it and it would just be like what the

579
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:17,359
[ __ ] and then we moved from that

580
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,640
disappeared it was probably so strong

581
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,119
that people didn't want to grow it I

582
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,600
think that has a lot to do with it it

583
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:24,119
was so intense CU we had skunk weed we

584
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:25,599
didn't even call it skunk though it was

585
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:27,278
you know it was green but it was

586
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:29,079
extremely skunky we got some from Santa

587
00:21:27,278 --> 00:21:31,000
Cruz I've told the story of my podcast a

588
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:33,240
few times it was called the strawberry

589
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,400
because the nugs were strawberry shaped

590
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:38,400
right so the you get three or four

591
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:40,440
usually three nugs in a bag and each nug

592
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,000
was you know like 1.2 grams or whatever

593
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,159
but it was strawberry shaped and it was

594
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,798
as skunky as anything I've ever smelled

595
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,720
we never had stuff called the roadkill

596
00:21:45,798 --> 00:21:49,200
skunk that wasn't until the 2000s that

597
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,120
I've heard that name kind of being

598
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,319
thrown around but like 90s we didn't

599
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:55,359
have a roadkill skunk we had heard the

600
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:57,240
term skunk for sure like skunk or skunk

601
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:59,719
one was basically it yeah skunk one was

602
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,519
a sweet skunk that was like totally like

603
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,360
the skunk that I skunk one that I

604
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:05,119
experienced uh there was a Michigan

605
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:06,759
skunk too that was really good but that

606
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:08,959
was like on the sweeter side of the

607
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:10,400
skunk and not on like the nose bur side

608
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,840
I don't remember the sweet skunk I just

609
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:16,960
remember that stanky yeah loud in yourr

610
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:19,000
pocket on you it told on you it told on

611
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,759
you told on you for sure yeah well a

612
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,880
tenth of a gram if you just had a tenth

613
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:24,640
of a gram that accidentally fell in your

614
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,679
you know pocket you're you're done it

615
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,159
would smell it would smell a whole room

616
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:29,519
yep and you just don't get stuff like

617
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,840
that anymore more and some stuff like

618
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:32,759
Skittles doesn't even really smell like

619
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:35,240
weed it smells like candy you know I

620
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:37,640
mean 90% of the stuff that's out there

621
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,519
right now is a trip down through the

622

629
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:58,519
like so I just did a breeding project

630
00:22:54,079 --> 00:23:00,599
myself yeah and I did half of it for me

631
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:01,960
and the other half for everybody else

632
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:04,678

645
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:31,799
pie is over here yeah no similarities in

646
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:34,400
the way it makes you feel um so I

647
00:23:31,798 --> 00:23:35,839
definitely got I'm super pumped I took I

648
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,200
didn't just mean to jump into this right

649
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:39,599
here but like I'm chomping at the bit uh

650
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,960
because I can't I can't wait to start

651
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:47,038
popping these seeds and see um what I

652
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:50,600
come up with i a friend of mine uh shout

653
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:53,440
out Adrien Sky he created zetopia which

654
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:55,079
I love zetopia okay I do too I do too

655
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,159
and a lot of people don't really notice

656
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:59,079
the difference than a regular lcg but I

657
00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:01,278
get the Z twang in the back it's totally

658
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:03,599
different if you're a smoker I totally

659
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:06,440
get in the background and it's for me I

660
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:08,199
I really dig the strain for being in the

661
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,440
in the realm that it's in I dig that one

662
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,519
a lot we worked together way back in the

663
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,679
day and then we just you know Frisco do

664
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:17,079
went our separate ways well he ended up

665
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:19,080
Lon with the group or I don't know what

666
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:21,879
he was a main part of a group I don't

667
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:24,319
know the middle of 2000s and he ended up

668
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:26,120
developing the zetopia and we got

669
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:29,599
reconnected he he was working I believe

670
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:32,519
with the jokes up and uh Society right

671
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:34,558
and working with them and I had no idea

672
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:36,079
it was a friend of mine and I I said

673
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:38,200
something I was like I did a post like

674
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:40,000
February is love month I'm looking to

675
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,159
you know get my ladies pregnant and he

676
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,480
hit me up like yo I got you and I'm like

677
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,240
what do you mean and he's like yo I did

678
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,640
this I did that I did the Obama runs I

679
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,798
think I think he said the Obama runs I

680
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,480
hope I'm not I hope I'm quoting him

681
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:54,558
correctly yeah but uh like no [ __ ]

682
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:56,720
way like all right let's talk so um

683
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:59,038
after a few unsuccessful breeding

684
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,839
projects I tried to do

685
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:02,440
um I just said [ __ ] it I I need some new

686
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:05,599
genetics I got to get some new stuff

687
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:08,720
pumping through the pipeline um and so I

688
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:10,240
did a little project in my basement and

689
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,798
I've got a couple hundred seats to start

690
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:17,679
rifling through I

691
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:19,440
took six seven of my strains and then

692
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:22,640
one other strain was gifted to me by a

693
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,640
friend and I just dosed them uh I got

694
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,679
some I got with purple sticky rice some

695
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,159
I got with zetopia and some I got with

696
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,919
the belts

697
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:34,120
and so I'm pumped to see some of these

698
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,080
combos I got grits and jam combos I got

699
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:39,278
strawberry melon combos I got prickly

700
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:41,879
pear SUNY paper like I'm super pumped

701
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:44,798
it's my first intentional breeding

702
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:48,480
program I got a lot to learn I don't

703
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:50,679
know if becoming a breeder per se is

704
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,319
something like internally for my own

705
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:56,038
[ __ ] absolutely but like to turn to make

706
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:58,839
that external I'm probably not organized

707
00:25:56,038 --> 00:26:01,240
enough uh to do that I it seem it's

708
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:03,359
still a great progression for for sure

709
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,079
it's not it's not pounds of weed it's

710
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:08,079
not triming flour it's a completely

711
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:09,439
different everything um from I guess

712
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:11,000
from the day you flip the lights you got

713
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,798
to treat them differently to a certain

714
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,440
extent yeah I'm pumped to start popping

715
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:16,359
beans I'm pumped to get some new Jenni

716
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:18,640
out and and see the

717
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:20,038
feedback I have a new strain now that a

718
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,600
friend of mine did it's it hasn't

719
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:23,599
released it's about to release I'm super

720
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:25,398
excited about it it's purple sticky I'm

721
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:28,000
calling it original sin it's purple

722
00:26:25,398 --> 00:26:31,519
sticky rice time Sher Banger and it's

723
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,919
[ __ ] great it's got Banger I've worked

724
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:33,960
with the sh Banger too I love it too

725
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:35,880
it's got everything you want from the

726
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,720
purple sticky rise but then it's got

727
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:40,120
that from the sh Banger it's got that

728
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:42,399
Banger from the sh Banger soch yeah I'm

729
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:43,879
super sto again every time I talk about

730
00:26:42,398 --> 00:26:45,398
weed it's all about the feeling for me

731
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,799
and I like those weeds that make that

732
00:26:45,398 --> 00:26:50,000
that punch hard the turtles the Sher

733
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:52,879
bangers the nade or whatever you know

734
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,880
those those GMO I love the way GMO makes

735
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:58,360
that stuff is so strong great yeah GMO

736
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:00,480
is super strong too but yeah the the

737
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:01,558
nade or the crippy or whatever whatever

738
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,038
you're going to call it I'm going to

739
00:27:01,558 --> 00:27:07,319
call it it's so amazing right but it's

740
00:27:04,038 --> 00:27:08,798
so strong right like that stuff is like

741
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:11,119
it's not for the faint of heart right

742
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:12,679
it's not for the it's not for the new

743
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:14,959
smoker that wants to see if they like

744
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:16,679
weed it's for the guys who really smoke

745
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,079
that's what I love about it too CU all

746
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:19,679
the old school guys that smell are like

747
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:22,119
yeah that's the one I want that it's

748
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,360
people with either too much anxiety and

749
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:26,038
they need less or people or if you get

750
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:28,240
anxiety hella easy it's not for you it's

751
00:27:26,038 --> 00:27:29,798
not for you yeah yeah it's not for you

752
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,880
if you roll with anxiety and you want

753
00:27:29,798 --> 00:27:33,519
less smoke some turtle if you if you get

754
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,240
anxiety easy definitely stay away from

755
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:38,398
it cuz your heart will be beaten you'll

756
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:39,880
hear your I can hear it in my ears who's

757
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:41,719
got the food it also makes you eat like

758
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,559
crazy but uh yeah I'm pumped about the

759
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,278
original sin because that's it like as

760
00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:47,359
soon as it came out I'm like oh I got

761
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:50,720
something here this tastes so good and

762
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:52,319
it has the looks and then as it sinks in

763
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,399
seven or eight minutes after smoking and

764
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:56,839
it's just like big heavy warm coat

765
00:27:55,398 --> 00:27:58,558
laying on your shoulders I'm like oh

766
00:27:56,839 --> 00:28:00,639
this is the [ __ ] right here thr Call of

767
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:02,678
Duty or a movie and I just [ __ ] veg

768
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,960
out for a little while I like it so be

769
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:05,080
on the lookout for original sin I know

770
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,000
you guys are going to [ __ ] like it

771
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:09,558
it's got it hits everything uh so and

772
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,960
that's going to be coming in the next

773
00:28:09,558 --> 00:28:12,918
couple of weeks just got my packaging

774
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,880
figured out and that's what I forgot to

775
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:18,080
bring the damn jar for the original then

776
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:22,360
yeah but uh yeah I'm pumped off that and

777
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:24,359
then I'm gonna start popping six to 12

778
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:25,879
ceds at a time and see what I can get

779
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:27,719
and just you know just do some fact

780
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,640
finding and see see how some of the

781
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:33,038
genetics laid out and and where I'm

782
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:34,559
going to end up with them so nice yeah

783
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:35,960
yeah and I I'm in the right place I know

784
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:38,798
I'm in the right place to talk seeds all

785
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:40,798
day off camera well the thing I like

786
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:42,480
about someone like yourself who's going

787
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:44,278
into breeding is you already know what

788
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,558
you're looking for as far as quality

789
00:28:44,278 --> 00:28:48,640
right so like if you just start growing

790
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:49,759
and then you're in like a year or six

791
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,799
six months to a year and you're like I

792
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:53,359
want to start breeding I don't feel like

793
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:55,599
you have enough data points collected

794
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:57,839
over the period of your life to really

795
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:59,558
go you know you might say this is what I

796
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:01,038
like is what I don't like but if you

797
00:28:59,558 --> 00:29:03,558
have a huge collection of things that

798
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:06,079
you've tried and you can go okay 80% of

799
00:29:03,558 --> 00:29:07,839
the stuff I don't like I really like 20%

800
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:09,879
I like the way this makes me feel I like

801
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:12,798
this the way this tastes I like these

802
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:15,039
traits and you can start period I like

803
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:16,798
the color I like the yield you know what

804
00:29:15,038 --> 00:29:19,200
I mean you start listing these boxes

805
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:20,839
that have to be checked and it's like as

806
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,120
you have experience that's when you

807
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:24,038
really should go into breeding and I

808
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:25,479
feel like it's it's a great way to

809
00:29:24,038 --> 00:29:27,558
prevent yourself from getting bored with

810
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,599
just growing for one thing but also you

811
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:30,879
have this knowledge that you can pass

812
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:33,959
down and you can share with the world

813
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:36,600
through your breeding I completely agree

814
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:39,038
I think there's 15 jobs you should have

815
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:41,038
before you're [ __ ] breeding from from

816
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:43,038
building a room or or watching a room

817
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:45,599
being built to learning how to line the

818
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:48,879
trays or set your trays up and run run

819
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:51,519
feed to De leafing to harvesting to

820
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,720
trimming to all those things come away

821
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:54,440
then then maybe you get to learn how to

822
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,000
make the batches you know maybe curing

823
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:59,558
and drawing I feel like that's a huge

824
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,919
one like learning how to

825
00:29:59,558 --> 00:30:02,720
you can watch every day but it's still

826
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:03,840
on me I'm not going to unless I'm gone

827
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,960
you're not doing that until I'm

828
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:07,480
confident with you it's one of the

829
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,360
hardest parts 100% you can ruin all your

830
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,278
work in one [ __ ] day that you spent

831
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:12,519
three months doing so many people do

832
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:13,880
they ruin it they grow it and it's

833
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:15,640
amazing and then they go to or they

834
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:18,360
don't flush right and then you know they

835
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,919
don't do that last week or that last two

836
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:21,398
weeks or whatever you flush for but they

837
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,679
screw that part up and then the drawing

838
00:30:21,398 --> 00:30:25,759
and the curing they just major fail and

839
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,360
then they have some Booth right and Y

840
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:29,480
boof that should have been amazing they

841
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:31,199
had a good starting point with genetics

842
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,839
like if you start with good genetics you

843
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,519
have your room set up properly you dial

844
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:36,038
it in and you go all that time do is

845
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:37,839
don't [ __ ] up yeah you don't even have

846
00:30:36,038 --> 00:30:39,679
to be great you just don't [ __ ] up right

847
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:41,038
like you know keep it simple until you

848
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:44,720
actually learn what you're doing and

849
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:46,679
then you know I would an early mistake I

850
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,880
made and maybe you did is I had two or

851
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:49,480
three other people who were really good

852
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,320
Growers yeah and I'd ask them all the

853
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,000
same [ __ ] question but and I would

854
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:55,038
take some of what he said and some what

855
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,798
he said and some wor yeah it was the

856
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:58,200
worst [ __ ] idea because then you

857
00:30:56,798 --> 00:30:59,679
don't know what's actually working and

858
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,278
not working so then I was like you know

859
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,320
what I'm just going to listen to this

860
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:04,880
dude and then I take his advice and if

861
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:06,158
that doesn't work out after three

862
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,559
Harvest then I'll you know I mean for

863
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,760
whatever reason I'll take the one

864
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:10,038
problem or two problems over to this

865
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:12,079
dude and see if he can help me Square

866
00:31:10,038 --> 00:31:14,599
them away and that need trial and error

867
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:17,158
but cannabis is a [ __ ] up business to

868
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:19,519
have a lot of trial and error like one

869
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:20,880
lost Harvest might mean lost rent you

870
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,638
know especially if that's how you're

871
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,720
supporting might be a bad Christmas it

872
00:31:22,638 --> 00:31:26,638
might be a Christmas with no presents it

873
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,200
might be a yeah you can't afford

874
00:31:26,638 --> 00:31:29,398
electricity there's all kind of bad

875
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,038
stuff Christmas was always hard in the

876
00:31:29,398 --> 00:31:33,000
weed game unless unless you saved money

877
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:34,558
from summertime cuz no one was spending

878
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,038
money I like I'd be like don't you want

879
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:38,240
to buy weed for Christmas like give

880
00:31:36,038 --> 00:31:40,480
quarters away like who the [ __ ] wants an

881
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,359
album they want a quarter of this

882
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,399
OG here best Christmas gift of all time

883
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:48,199
for sure yeah but Christmas money was

884
00:31:45,398 --> 00:31:49,558
hard to make October to January yeah

885
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,480
that was when it was flooded because we

886
00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:54,200
had floods and we had droughts and there

887
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:56,319
was a lot of yeah and it was up in waves

888
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,600
and you know the summer it'd be hard to

889
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:59,200
get stuff people don't even understand

890
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:01,038
there was times where you couldn't get

891
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,240
weed to save your life when I was a kid

892
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:06,079
you know I was like you know not kid kid

893
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,480
even in 1819 it was like we might be

894
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:09,038
able to get some brown weed but nobody

895
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,399
wanted to smoke Brown weed like I I

896
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:11,480
would rather not smoke at a certain

897
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:13,000
point when I was younger I was like

898
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,360
whatever but there was a point where I'm

899
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,880
like I'm not smoking that stuff because

900
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:17,638
it gives me headaches I just want the

901
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,679
good stuff and once you really get a

902
00:32:17,638 --> 00:32:20,798
taste for the good stuff and you've

903
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:22,559
smoked it long enough you just can't you

904
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:25,599
can't do the bad stuff you know and it's

905
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:26,839
like I think I've smoked Brown weed like

906
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:29,240
three times since I started smoking

907
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:31,558
green weed yeah once was in Thailand

908
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,679
once was I let my buddy convince me that

909
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:35,319
his brain was phenomenal cuz it was

910
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,960
green but it was brown weed like you

911
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:40,439
could tell I mean for for being brain it

912
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:42,360
was good but it's like you did like once

913
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,798
you fly first class you don't try to go

914
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:46,479
back to the no that's the truth I'm

915
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:49,558
experiencing that you know it's like

916
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,798
it's hard you know it is what it is but

917
00:32:49,558 --> 00:32:52,480
uh you know we live in this amazing

918
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:54,480
world where we have access to a lot of

919
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,798
good stuff like you the access that you

920
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,038
have and the access that I have it's

921
00:32:55,798 --> 00:32:59,359
like we get to smoke the really good

922
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:01,558
stuff but not everybody I always have to

923
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:03,918
remind myself this not everybody gets to

924
00:33:01,558 --> 00:33:05,839
smoke like we get smoke or experience

925
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:08,360
whether it's you know it doesn't matter

926
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:10,638
with extract we can smoke pens or

927
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:12,678
whatever most people don't really get to

928
00:33:10,638 --> 00:33:14,798
experience stuff on that level because

929
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:16,360
that's the 1% right so like it's just

930
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:17,558
like with money and everything else most

931
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:20,439
people don't have it there's there's a

932
00:33:17,558 --> 00:33:21,480
reason it's the 1% and not the 99 I

933
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:24,600
definitely

934
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:28,079
know the groups of weed I smoke with I'm

935
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:30,638
smoking the if not the best TI for the

936
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:34,599
best weed around it's yeah it's at that

937
00:33:30,638 --> 00:33:38,479
point you can't really that 1% area and

938
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:39,839
it it kind of like I'm 50 almost 51 yeah

939
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,679
I've been smoking

940
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:44,959
weed you know 80% of my life at this

941
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:48,200
point I don't have space in my lungs for

942
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:51,840
shitty weed I I can't and

943
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:54,639
it's and and I it comes off totally weed

944
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:56,319
snobby and it might be a little bit but

945
00:33:54,638 --> 00:33:58,278
I would prefer you step your game up and

946
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:59,720
get better you know what I mean

947
00:33:58,278 --> 00:34:00,880
so I don't have to about that like

948
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:03,440
people want to hand me their joints all

949
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,360
the time first of all with and being

950
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,960
sick like I'm like I'm getting the point

951
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:08,598
now where I like go to an event and

952
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,320
light a do can be like I'm not I don't

953
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:12,000
want to hit your weed I love you give

954
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,359
you bro hug give you D but I don't want

955
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,559
to hit your weed and I don't really want

956
00:34:13,358 --> 00:34:16,960
you to hit mine cuz I don't know what

957
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:20,480
you're giving me I don't know how it was

958
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:22,159
taken care of I know who grew and rolled

959
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,199
whatever's in my hand and I know their

960
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:27,760
standards right and and then nor do I

961
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:29,319
want to swap spit like I would always

motivating me to do more every day

1047
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:38,920
because I can get lazy you I can get

1048
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,240
complacent I've been doing this for so

1049
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:42,960
long like I haven't been up excited

1050
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:44,439
about anything really except for the new

1051
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,880
strains that I drop and the seed like

1052
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,599
this new seed project I'm excited about

1053
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:50,000
that because it's new for me it's it's

1054
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,800
you know I did it myself you know I did

1055
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,079
I was given the pollen but I got my

1056
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,400
little paint rushes out and went in

1057
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:56,960
there and dusted each plan and you know

1058
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,240
did I haven't grown in years because

1059
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,960
other people been doing it for me so I

1060
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:02,439
got to grow a harvest again uh I know

1061
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,000
why I [ __ ] up at the end and if I

1062
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,358
decide to do it again I won't make that

1063
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,280
mistake when with seeds it's like you go

1064
00:38:06,358 --> 00:38:10,960
for me I go a lot longer than I would

1065
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,680
like if I harvest something a day or 63

1066
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,159
in flour I go an extra month because I

1067
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:16,960
want the darkest best looking seeds sure

1068
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:18,960
so it's a lot more work and you got to

1069
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,119
keep them as healthy and happy as long

1070
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,159
as possible with seeds it's always a

1071
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,559
challenge we can talk on air off air

1072
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:27,639
about that like I definitely would like

1073
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:30,000
I'd like a a a a a longer recipe cuz I

1074
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:32,159
got a bunch of great seeds but they're I

1075
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,400
wouldn't say any of them are huge um

1076
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:35,639
they're going to pop and I'm going to

1077
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:38,240
get some fire as genetics out of it it's

1078
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:39,358
not the size not the size of the seed

1079
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:41,399
it's not the size of the seed that

1080
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:43,199
counts yeah okay I was I guess I was

1081
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,400
just making the extra month would make

1082
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:45,639
them girth out a little bit not

1083
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,920
necessarily but it'll definitely make

1084
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:50,159
them darker uh outdoor seats come out

1085
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,720
bigger typically than indoor but also

1086
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:55,719
that's very specific to the genetics

1087
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:57,559
you're working with um you know you can

1088
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:59,239
but but I've seen bigger seeds come from

1089
00:38:57,559 --> 00:39:02,078
the same cross outside as opposed to

1090
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:03,439
inside okay so you know but I feel like

1091
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:06,039
there's all kinds of benefits but yeah I

1092
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,039
got a book too you've seen my right I I

1093
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:08,800
haven't given you a book yet so we'll

1094
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:11,679
give you a book today [ __ ] will you sign

1095
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,599
it oh yeah of course go yeah it's it's a

1096
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:15,759
lot of fun and I mean I think it's all

1097
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:18,240
about finding those exciting things

1098
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,599
where it you know I mean some people are

1099
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:21,199
barracudas right they're chasing the

1100
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:23,838
next shiny object in the ocean right I

1101
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:25,480
try not to be that I try to do stuff

1102
00:39:23,838 --> 00:39:28,358
that keeps me excited that's aligned

1103
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:30,639
with my main focus so we got a breeding

1104
00:39:28,358 --> 00:39:33,199
book we got a podcast we got a new

1105
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:35,358
podcast uh we got our website we got all

1106
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:36,960
these things it's all genetics right

1107
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:38,559
everything comes back to genetics I'm

1108
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,318
not trying to be the flower guy I want

1109
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:43,679
to be the gortex I want to be the velcro

1110
00:39:41,318 --> 00:39:45,719
I want to be the guy that helps you make

1111
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:47,399
your genetics better or your brand

1112
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:50,078
better I like that and proves you know

1113
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,639
and the beauty of where I'm at with that

1114
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,519
is I can work with everybody I don't I

1115
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:54,598
feel like I don't have enemies in the

1116
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:56,400
industry there might be people that

1117
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:58,800
don't like me but I don't care I like

1118
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,680
everybody for the most part and if you

1119
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,760
want people that don't like you you're

1120
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:03,239
not doing [ __ ] right exactly exactly

1121
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,680
there's always going to be haters dude

1122
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:06,799
it's like look at the environment we

1123
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:08,159
live in currently right like half the

1124
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,680
country sees things one way the other

1125
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:10,799
half sees things the other way AB you

1126
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:12,519
guarantee if you got both of those

1127
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,440
people paying attention to you some of

1128
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:17,039
them are not going to be like it just is

1129
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,599
what it is it's okay negative energy

1130
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:20,079
still energy yeah you know what I mean

1131
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:21,720
if that's what you got you got negative

1132
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,800
energy for me [ __ ] it it's better than

1133
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:24,279
none energy as long as you're not

1134
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,920
pointing a gun at me you know we're good

1135
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,640
sure you know hate all you want I laugh

1136
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,119
at that [ __ ] it's like cool you could

1137
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:31,440
have spent your time hanging out with

1138
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:34,358
your kid but you chose to [ __ ] rage

1139
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:36,240
on me okay thanks but yeah like our our

1140
00:40:34,358 --> 00:40:38,358
friends our mutual friends at SF Canada

1141
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:41,279
it's like them and a handful of other

1142
00:40:38,358 --> 00:40:42,920
people I feel like we the industry is so

1143
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,280
small within our community like

1144
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:46,200
everybody knows everybody and we all

1145
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:48,160
kind of lift each other up and it's like

1146
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:50,439
you know who the Bad actors are and who

1147
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:51,920
the bad guys are it's like you've done

1148
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,159
it long enough and I've done it long

1149
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,039
enough it's like we know who the bad

1150
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:56,960
guys are and they they stay at a

1151
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:58,719
distance right and so they might still

1152
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,599
exist and I know there's bad guys out

1153
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:02,199
there but like I work within the people

1154
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:04,318
that help lift me up and I help lift

1155
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:05,719
them up and it's like this community of

1156
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:07,039
good people and it's like we all have

1157
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:09,118
the same kind of vision about what

1158
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:11,800
quality is we have the same kind of

1159
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:14,400
vision about what ethics are because I

1160
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:16,000
think that's important uh and it's it's

1161
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,400
it's teamwork at the end of the day not

1162
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,280
one person can do it all and I don't

1163
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,079
want to do everything I want to stay

1164
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,640
focused on what I do and then you know

1165
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,839
we got SF Canada that grows amazing

1166
00:41:23,639 --> 00:41:27,400
flower y we've got all these guys in the

1167
00:41:25,838 --> 00:41:29,279
Bay Area there's a handful of guys to

1168
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,599
grow really amazing flour and then

1169
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,640
there's everybody else and I've always

1170
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:34,359
wanted to be aligned with the best

1171
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:36,480
whatever the best quality-wise the best

1172
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:38,960
flour I fell in love with good weed and

1173
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,240
I just have never gone back and I always

1174
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,159
attached myself to that that's what I

1175
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:42,879
want because that's what I want to

1176
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:45,159
consume for myself when at the end of

1177
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,838
the day I want to smoke the best stuff I

1178
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:50,879
can possibly get life's short I mean you

1179
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:52,920
know when do you pick the old steak Yeah

1180
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:56,000
you know when you don't you know when do

1181
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:58,680
you drink the mold milk don't do that

1182
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,599
dry yes but not the one that's 99 Cents

1183
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:03,480
Brown I don't go for the discount [ __ ]

1184
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:05,039
no so why would you not be wanting to

1185
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:08,400
smoke the best unfortunately you and I

1186
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:10,519
are in that in within arms R length if

1187
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,119
we're not doing it ourselves to do to do

1188
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:13,599
just that all the time well it's always

1189
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:15,119
the latest and greatest I'm seeing

1190
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:18,440
you're seeing stuff I mean that

1191
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:20,240
zetopia you know I feel like it hasn't

1192
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,639
made it fully on the scene like some of

1193
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:23,358
these other things but it is special

1194
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:24,960
it's just as special as anything else it

1195
00:42:23,358 --> 00:42:26,558
smokes good down to the roach and it's

1196
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,079
got it you know it definitely has its

1197
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:31,079
own thing I

1198
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:32,800
think back to the actual pallette and

1199
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:34,559
connoisseur and understanding of what

1200
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,079
you're smoking yeah if you're not

1201
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:37,760
looking for it it goes right over your

1202
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:39,280
head yeah if you don't if you know if

1203
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,839
you're not familiar with zps if you're

1204
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,720
not familiar with how zps affect other

1205
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:45,639
plants and other genetics like I don't

1206
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:47,879
even know that I get a ton of Z in the

1207
00:42:45,639 --> 00:42:52,039
smell like there's there's something

1208
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:54,440
different about it it's am I lcg right

1209
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:55,759
in my opinion it's just not visually

1210
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,639
visually it looks very similar even on

1211
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:00,440
the nose it's pretty dang

1212
00:42:57,639 --> 00:43:03,519
close to your run-of-the-mill lcg but

1213
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:04,720
yeah you exhale you're like oh there it

1214
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:06,559
is I got that and you smoke it down to

1215
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:08,558
the roach it just tastes good all the

1216
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:10,400
way down and and it has a really good

1217
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:12,960
effect too like I feel like it's all

1218
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:15,760
about effect with that U and it's not as

1219
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,318
strong as lcg right but it is the Z

1220
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,559
somewhere in the middle because of the Z

1221
00:43:17,318 --> 00:43:20,800
but uh you know it's not a diet Skittles

1222
00:43:19,559 --> 00:43:22,480
either that's what I I hate diet

1223
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,280
Skittles I hate stuff that's a diet

1224
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,800
version of the original there's nothing

1225
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:27,720
better than Skittles as far as on the

1226
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,440
candy where it's like straight candy but

1227
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:31,039
there's things like moonbow and I've

1228
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,119
talked about this on my show a lot with

1229
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:34,400
moonbow where it's like it's complex

1230
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,640
enough to where it's not just straight

1231
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,318
Skittles but it's Skitty it's got that

1232
00:43:36,639 --> 00:43:40,879
doy dough and it's like complex and you

1233
00:43:39,318 --> 00:43:42,199
smoke it you're like wow down to the

1234
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,160
roach it tastes amazing and that's what

1235
00:43:42,199 --> 00:43:45,439
I'm really looking for tastes amazing

1236
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:48,199
makes me feel great makes me want to

1237
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:52,599
smoke another joint it

1238
00:43:48,199 --> 00:43:55,558
that's okay so when you go to get high

1239
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:58,039
yeah and you open your toolbox with 200

1240
00:43:55,559 --> 00:43:59,359
[ __ ] flavors in there do you open it

1241
00:43:58,039 --> 00:44:01,519
how often do you open it with a

1242
00:43:59,358 --> 00:44:03,759
conscious decision prior to opening it

1243
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:05,559
what you're going for or how or how many

1244
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,440
times you open you're just like I'm

1245
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:10,079
feeling like this one right here because

1246
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,039
I get that with the zetopia like I I

1247
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:13,559
love I love that tur like I love smoking

1248
00:44:12,039 --> 00:44:15,279
my Sunday paper yeah but I don't want to

1249
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:16,839
smoke it all the time I I smoke it

1250
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,240
intermittently I don't I don't want to

1251
00:44:16,838 --> 00:44:20,480
smoke the zetopia all the time but I

1252
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:23,719
find myself maybe because it's new right

1253
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,480
like lately I've been like papers Utopia

1254
00:44:23,719 --> 00:44:30,439
my other strains like I'm going to lean

1255
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:32,358
this way and for me it's so often an un

1256
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:34,280
not an unconscious Choice yeah but you

1257
00:44:32,358 --> 00:44:37,239
know what I'm saying it's like if I want

1258
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:38,640
to go if I'm like I'm [ __ ] pissed or

1259
00:44:37,239 --> 00:44:40,598
I need to go to sleep and I need to be

1260
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:43,480
this high I'll go smoke some turtle yeah

1261
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:45,920
the rest of the time I'm like you know

1262
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:47,679
it's shades of the same color but you

1263
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,119
have some that are heavy over here and

1264
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:51,078
some that are heavy over here and I find

1265
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:53,880
myself gravitating towards that zetopia

1266
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:57,079
lately as it as opposed to some of my

1267
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:58,358
other routine strains the ones I line

1268
00:44:57,079 --> 00:45:00,920
jar test you know it's like the first

1269
00:44:58,358 --> 00:45:03,759
thing gone that's the one you it's like

1270
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:04,920
there you go and and I have so many like

1271
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,599
exactly what I'm talking about yeah and

1272
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:08,159
I have options I can smoke 50 different

1273
00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:09,800
things right I have a jar of this and a

1274
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:11,799
jar of that and a jar of this and I have

1275
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,599
that you know I have 20 jars of extract

1276
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:15,800
or more than that actually probably like

1277
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:18,160
40 or 50 different types of raw in right

1278
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,680
now and I can pick from any of them but

1279
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:21,879
you know the the one that goes first is

1280
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:24,358
usually the best and I I gravitate

1281
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:25,599
towards Skittles even though that's not

1282
00:45:24,358 --> 00:45:28,759
the strongest but a lot of times that's

1283
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:30,519
my daytime just

1284
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:32,319
yeah I mean other than the one that

1285
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:35,559
we're about to try in a little bit that

1286
00:45:32,318 --> 00:45:38,880
so on my last podcast we did it you know

1287
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:41,880
we we took dry hits uh and then we

1288
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:44,400
smoked and tried the soil grown versus

1289
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:47,599
the cocoa right actually I think I did

1290
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:49,880
the dry hits and she did not hie from

1291
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:51,880
humbled seed company and we got really

1292
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:53,480
high on the podcast and you know I'm not

1293
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:55,519
used to getting high like that from

1294
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:57,559
Skittles Skittles is usually you go up

1295
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:59,280
to about here and I can maintain that

1296
00:45:57,559 --> 00:46:00,880
here all day long where it's it doesn't

1297
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,760
get me over the top I can super

1298
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,960
functional I can do pretty much anything

1299
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:09,839
on it but that soil grown it was more it

1300
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:13,240
was almost perfumey it was Candy Perfume

1301
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:15,239
like TPS up here as opposed to down yeah

1302
00:46:13,239 --> 00:46:17,759
he get here no we have we have the the

1303
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:19,598
refires we're we're going to test refire

1304
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,640
dude so I feel like that's the true test

1305
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:21,880
right that's funny I was just going to

1306
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:24,239
say the same [ __ ] thing so we're

1307
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:25,720
going to see if you know which one is

1308
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:27,279
you know after hearing all this you

1309
00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:29,159
should be able to tell the difference on

1310
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,839
the refire I'm excited to see how much

1311
00:46:29,159 --> 00:46:33,039
of a difference it was from the last

1312
00:46:30,838 --> 00:46:35,039
podcast to this podcast on the refire

1313
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:36,358
I'm C I'm curious in the comments after

1314
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:38,639
I watch this episode and I read the

1315
00:46:36,358 --> 00:46:41,799
comments what is The public's opinion on

1316
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:43,519
refire because I have so much weed like

1317
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:45,318
I give it to my family and friends or

1318
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:47,440
whatnot my mother-in-law my pops my you

1319
00:46:45,318 --> 00:46:50,719
know my my close homies where I can roll

1320
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:53,760
a fresh joint all the time but if the

1321
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:56,519
weed for me if the weed is so I I always

1322
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:59,520
after I take 10 or 15 hits I do a tiny

1323
00:46:56,519 --> 00:47:02,159
Puff out so anything left in the paper

1324
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:03,960
goes out and then I never extinguish it

1325
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:06,118
I like put it in the end of a glass tube

1326
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:08,159
or something so it just stop smoking

1327
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:09,960
right and then 30 40 minutes later when

1328
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:12,679
it's time to reup I go back outside and

1329
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:14,079
I do the same thing and as you said that

1330
00:47:12,679 --> 00:47:15,399
is the true test especially if you can

1331
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:16,920
light it three times and you're like

1332
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:19,440
this [ __ ] still tastes H that's like the

1333
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:21,599
old school py Old School Champagne like

1334
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,679
the roach tasted almost damn if not

1335
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:24,838
better than the front because you're

1336
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:26,960
getting that [ __ ] resinous gluey [ __ ]

1337
00:47:24,838 --> 00:47:28,358
it's funny full circle Johnny Karan

1338
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,559
uh-huh that's where I used to get the

1339
00:47:28,358 --> 00:47:32,679
real champagne from that's funny small

1340
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:34,359
world right like but the real champagne

1341
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:36,440
was like that you would put it out and

1342
00:47:34,358 --> 00:47:37,759
champelli is the man I I'm I'm good

1343
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:40,800
friends with champelli we've been

1344
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:43,000
friends a while um and yeah there's a

1345
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:45,359
long story with that too but like d that

1346
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,159
champagne was got lot long stories that

1347
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:49,679
there's so many long stories yeah for

1348
00:47:47,159 --> 00:47:52,078
sure Bay Area is just such a small you

1349
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:56,078
know ni Community the amount

1350
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:57,359
of if not now at one time influential

1351
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:00,760
Canabis people that went to [ __ ]

1352
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:03,159
mcateer high school you know if the book

1353
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:05,720
of cannabis is written and they have a

1354
00:48:03,159 --> 00:48:08,719
map with little you know hot spots like

1355
00:48:05,719 --> 00:48:10,118
mcer High School 89 to 92 is going to

1356
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:13,118
it's going to be blinking on the map

1357
00:48:10,119 --> 00:48:15,559
because there was quite a few people who

1358
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:17,599
have have had a hand in the Cannabis

1359
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:19,040
industry and forming and the shaping uh

1360
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:20,440
at that place at one time was kind of

1361
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:22,199
funny right and all the high schools

1362
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:24,119
that really all the high schools

1363
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:26,078
Berkeley you know East Bay you can go

1364
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:27,960
out into conquered and you go Walnut

1365
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:29,440
Creek conquered Pleasant Hill area you

1366
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:32,079
know that's kind of where I was at and

1367
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,760
it's like cat piss a lot of guys from

1368
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:36,039
there remember the cat piss you know

1369
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:37,760
there's there was a lot of legendary cat

1370
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:40,800
piss going around that conquered area

1371
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:44,359
all the way into Antioch you know making

1372
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:46,039
it into the bay yeah [ __ ] ay yeah

1373
00:48:44,358 --> 00:48:49,719
crazy it's I

1374
00:48:46,039 --> 00:48:51,400
mean the the F the fact that we have run

1375
00:48:49,719 --> 00:48:53,078
such parallel lives and are only three

1376
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:55,318
years apart and really haven't come

1377
00:48:53,079 --> 00:48:57,760
across each other at all until happen

1378
00:48:55,318 --> 00:49:00,639
stance recently it's it's kind of weird

1379
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:03,000
because people with your resume and your

1380
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:04,118
longevity like I feel like I know most

1381
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,639
of them especially if they're from the

1382
00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:07,160
city you know whether they're good

1383
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:10,239
friends or acquaintances or somebody

1384
00:49:07,159 --> 00:49:12,838
I've met once or twice um so like I said

1385
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:15,199
before this is long overdue uh and I

1386
00:49:12,838 --> 00:49:16,519
like I definitely I definitely like

1387
00:49:15,199 --> 00:49:17,719
talking we I'm telling because we don't

1388
00:49:16,519 --> 00:49:18,960
really talk it too much we haven't hung

1389
00:49:17,719 --> 00:49:19,919
out before too many times you know a few

1390
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,280
minutes here and there this is the

1391
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:23,760
longest conversation I've ever had with

1392
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:26,280
you but to know how many similarities we

1393
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,559
already share without you know without

1394
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:29,640
knowing that ahead of time it's pretty

1395
00:49:27,559 --> 00:49:31,400
[ __ ] cool like we we can sit here and

1396
00:49:29,639 --> 00:49:32,519
think the same [ __ ] you know without

1397
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:35,599
having to verbalize it and then we're

1398
00:49:32,519 --> 00:49:37,079
like oh yeah that's F damn s with the

1399
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:38,400
that's the true test of weed that when

1400
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:40,880
you can relight it and tell how good it

1401
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,720
is for sure but I am curious if so if

1402
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,400
after you watch this I do Wonder because

1403
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:46,959
I already l a [ __ ] hash hole like who

1404
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:49,798
I can't face a hash hole you can't just

1405
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:51,798
throw that out no who [ __ ] know but even

1406
00:49:49,798 --> 00:49:54,480
I am not throwing out anything but if

1407
00:49:51,798 --> 00:49:56,719
it's a stew doinks the last part is

1408
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,358
that's it because it gets too harsh but

1409
00:49:56,719 --> 00:50:00,558
I'm definitely not throwing any none of

1410
00:49:58,358 --> 00:50:02,519
my cash packs none of my stew dinks out

1411
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:04,119
none of my homies doinks out I'll

1412
00:50:02,519 --> 00:50:05,880
already light that [ __ ] three times if

1413
00:50:04,119 --> 00:50:07,920
I can if I know there's no more hash

1414
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:10,480
left okay because I can go fire up

1415
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:13,000
another one but like who can face a hash

1416
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,358
hole you know seriously I have one

1417
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,559
friend that comes over and takes my half

1418
00:50:14,358 --> 00:50:18,318
joints and it's you know he comes over I

1419
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:19,680
don't like I don't mind like I don't

1420
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:22,920
want him to go to waste either you know

1421
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:25,440
what I mean but like if I showed

1422
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:27,559
the bag of half people would be like

1423
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:30,200
what the [ __ ] is wrong with you like I

1424
00:50:27,559 --> 00:50:32,599
can be wasteful but I don't smoke I

1425
00:50:30,199 --> 00:50:34,679
don't do the relight longer than the

1426
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:36,119
next day yeah I won't leave it outside

1427
00:50:34,679 --> 00:50:37,879
for three days and then go Rel it

1428
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:39,400
because that's never good sour you could

1429
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:41,240
do that with and catpiss you can do that

1430
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:42,680
with and I can't really name other ones

1431
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:44,318
where catpiss you can smoke it a week

1432
00:50:42,679 --> 00:50:47,519
later and you're like [ __ ] that's CET

1433
00:50:44,318 --> 00:50:49,440
okay so I I don't that I'll roll a joint

1434
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:51,318
at like noon and if I don't finish it

1435
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,599
that night I'll smoke at the next day

1436
00:50:51,318 --> 00:50:57,440
but I also don't smoke flour every day

1437
00:50:53,599 --> 00:51:02,559
yeah I smoke a ton of cold fire and uh

1438
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:05,440
flavor Aid uh and I I dab a little bit

1439
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:08,079
it's it's definitely my least it's

1440
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:09,559
definitely my least form of consumption

1441
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:11,160
yeah um but I went through a phase where

1442
00:51:09,559 --> 00:51:12,920
all I did was dab and it just [ __ ] up

1443
00:51:11,159 --> 00:51:14,519
my tolerance in general so if I want to

1444
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:17,240
enjoy any FL you appreciate flower as

1445
00:51:14,519 --> 00:51:20,119
much I still dab quite a bit and well I

1446
00:51:17,239 --> 00:51:23,439
mean I've been like so the the ays from

1447
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:25,160
Focus V is like my go-to but then I got

1448
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:28,200
this Rover and I've been on the Rover

1449
00:51:25,159 --> 00:51:30,078
kick and it's like you can see the smoke

1450
00:51:28,199 --> 00:51:32,358
yeah it's wild like I mean it's that's

1451
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:34,798
so reminiscent of the glass domes and

1452
00:51:32,358 --> 00:51:36,400
the the little uh the what is it called

1453
00:51:34,798 --> 00:51:38,079
the the castle from a chest piece they

1454
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,760
used to go a little metal thing like

1455
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:41,318
with you I'd always get to the party

1456
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,760
like 15 minutes into the party the glass

1457
00:51:41,318 --> 00:51:45,119
Dome would be busted in my pocket and

1458
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:48,480
I'm oh yeah that's the I broke in two of

1459
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:50,960
these now with the glass and and uh dude

1460
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,639
they these guys are great uh so dip

1461
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,159
device makes these so dip device made

1462
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:55,679
these straws right and so I got this

1463
00:51:54,159 --> 00:51:58,679
straw from this dude named Uncle Stoner

1464
00:51:55,679 --> 00:52:01,558
he's a character dip device they they

1465
00:51:58,679 --> 00:52:03,039
make the straw right and so you can just

1466
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:06,760
it's the same idea but it's electric

1467
00:52:03,039 --> 00:52:08,079
nectar collector I love neor I have I

1468
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,760
have they gave me a couple pieces I

1469
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:10,559
really liked I think I used them up but

1470
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,839
they worked pretty good I didn't know

1471
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:13,079
they had a new product you gave me one

1472
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:14,759
hit off that and it [ __ ] tastes a

1473
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:16,519
great and yeah and so it's a quartz

1474
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:20,680
bucket right and the inside it's got the

1475
00:52:16,519 --> 00:52:23,759
beads for TPS and I I I really so for

1476
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:25,199
the price point is 80 bucks oh [ __ ] and

1477
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,680
I think it's amazing for that you know

1478
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:28,598
and this is not you know they sent sent

1479
00:52:26,679 --> 00:52:30,639
me some they didn't pay me anything to

1480
00:52:28,599 --> 00:52:31,920
talk good about their yeah and I mean a

1481
00:52:30,639 --> 00:52:34,199
lot of these products are expensive but

1482
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:37,039
for the price this is a great product

1483
00:52:34,199 --> 00:52:39,199
it's simple and easy to use you know and

1484
00:52:37,039 --> 00:52:41,480
you know it's like I feel like taking it

1485
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:43,118
around other than breaking the glass I

1486
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:45,358
feel like if I had a container to store

1487
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:46,920
it in but it's simple they have a bunch

1488
00:52:45,358 --> 00:52:50,480
they have a flower pen too that it's

1489
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:51,838
like a volcano that's pocket size so

1490
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:54,280
pretty cool and they sent them for the

1491
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:56,039
dab AO and I I didn't get them in time

1492
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:57,040
and so I've been using them and I you

1493
00:52:56,039 --> 00:52:59,759
know I

1494
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:02,400
anyway yeah um what's it called a ro

1495
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:03,599
this is a Rover that bowl you passed the

1496
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,240
hit you passed me earlier was [ __ ]

1497
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:07,119
great that whatever it was tasted great

1498
00:53:05,239 --> 00:53:09,318
that thing hit really nice so yeah yeah

1499
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:11,358
not bad and it's it's convenient sounds

1500
00:53:09,318 --> 00:53:13,000
like that's a good walk away price yeah

1501
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:15,279
and then smoking before I go to the gym

1502
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,079
I usually dab because flower I don't

1503
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,960
like smelling like flower everywhere not

1504
00:53:17,079 --> 00:53:20,559
that it's that big of a deal but I go to

1505
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,960
the gym and I know everybody there not

1506
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:25,839
that it matters but like I feel like

1507
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:27,318
weed basically when I smoke a fat joint

1508
00:53:25,838 --> 00:53:29,838
it it makes me a little more tired

1509
00:53:27,318 --> 00:53:32,239
whereas I take a dab it it wakes me up

1510
00:53:29,838 --> 00:53:34,639
we also if if you're doing any kind of

1511
00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:36,639
cardio yeah I'm not trying to smoke

1512
00:53:34,639 --> 00:53:38,920
don't a flower before I go do cardio I'm

1513
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:40,480
going to take one fat dab or hit my pen

1514
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:42,639
twice and my lungs are still going to be

1515
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:45,079
tight but if I sit there and so it'll

1516
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:46,440
open me up if I just do one nice big hit

1517
00:53:45,079 --> 00:53:47,960
and it'll make me not have to think

1518
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:50,838
about what I'm doing so like cardio is

1519
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:52,920
great like or even lifting weight every

1520
00:53:50,838 --> 00:53:54,480
hit [ __ ] closes my [ __ ] up I need

1521
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:57,880
like a

1522
00:53:54,480 --> 00:54:00,280
ibol hit the Dewey and then take a nice

1523
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:03,358
[ __ ] hit some inhalers so I can open

1524
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:05,079
my chest again some caffeine yeah some

1525
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:06,639
aerosol caffeine I love smoking weed and

1526
00:54:05,079 --> 00:54:09,559
drinking coffee yeah that's the best

1527
00:54:06,639 --> 00:54:11,199
combo ever that's I I would say most

1528
00:54:09,559 --> 00:54:12,720
Stoners do that if you smoke a lot I

1529
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:14,519
feel like coffee is the balance for me

1530
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:16,078
so like throughout the day I don't drink

1531
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:17,838
a ton of coffee but I definitely drink

1532
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:19,519
coffee in the morning and then I'll

1533
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:21,119
drink it around one or two if I if I

1534
00:54:19,519 --> 00:54:23,039
drink coffee at five or six it's no good

1535
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:24,160
I can't sleep yeah if I drink it three

1536
00:54:23,039 --> 00:54:25,519
times a day I just don't enjoy it the

1537
00:54:24,159 --> 00:54:27,679
next morning like I love my morning cup

1538
00:54:25,519 --> 00:54:30,079
of coffee yeah I like that take my dog

1539
00:54:27,679 --> 00:54:32,960
to the park rip my pen a few times drink

1540
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:34,680
my coffee and [ __ ] yep I like that's

1541
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:36,199
a good morning for sure before I [ __ ]

1542
00:54:34,679 --> 00:54:38,078
tackle emails and phone calls and all

1543
00:54:36,199 --> 00:54:40,279
the other [ __ ] that comes along yeah

1544
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:41,960
it's it's easy and I just feel like it

1545
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:43,319
makes especially with with the extract

1546
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:44,920
in the morning if I'm smoking some good

1547
00:54:43,318 --> 00:54:46,719
rosin if I take a hit of that and I

1548
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:48,838
drink some coffee I'm I'm just super

1549
00:54:46,719 --> 00:54:51,519
clear-headed right if I smoke a huge

1550
00:54:48,838 --> 00:54:55,039
joint I save that for

1551
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:56,719
like afternoon yeah evening for sure

1552
00:54:55,039 --> 00:54:58,079
evening evening evening and then usually

1553
00:54:56,719 --> 00:55:00,358
in the afternoon podcast we usually

1554
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:01,920
smoke joints on the podcast but I like I

1555
00:55:00,358 --> 00:55:03,199
like the extract too I like all there's

1556
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,358
so many different types of raas in now

1557
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:05,759
and you can kind of get different

1558
00:55:04,358 --> 00:55:07,960
effects from just so many different

1559
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,960
things so we we not too long ago

1560
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:11,599
released a BHO line which has been

1561
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:13,480
[ __ ] doing great so thank you guys

1562
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:17,039
for so much for grabbing it because it's

1563
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:19,440
it's fire um I asked for when possible

1564
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:21,639
Butters so I can get the doughnut hole

1565
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:23,119
because I smoke them and I can't offer

1566
00:55:21,639 --> 00:55:25,159
rosin as a product none of my stuff

1567
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:27,039
really hashes which is another reason I

1568
00:55:25,159 --> 00:55:30,239
did the feno hunt that I did the reading

1569
00:55:27,039 --> 00:55:32,359
project that I did so I could hopefully

1570
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:35,558
you know I'm looking for six to 10

1571
00:55:32,358 --> 00:55:37,000
strains Max um which I think is doable

1572
00:55:35,559 --> 00:55:39,599
considering the genetics I put together

1573
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,798
I think I should be able to get that um

1574
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:46,440
but one or two of those really needs to

1575
00:55:41,798 --> 00:55:49,920
give me two plus 3% yield so that I can

1576
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:51,720
offer you know a quality rosin in the PO

1577
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,559
because I smoke hash holes I really love

1578
00:55:51,719 --> 00:55:54,879
it and I do kind of feel on the outside

1579
00:55:53,559 --> 00:55:57,480
CU I don't have a product that can

1580
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:59,960
really my Butters do it and for people

1581
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:01,719
that you know it's a really cost

1582
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:04,679
effective way to roll some donut is a

1583
00:56:01,719 --> 00:56:05,919
really clean way to smoke BHO um yeah I

1584
00:56:04,679 --> 00:56:07,440
mean if you Ian it gives you the hole

1585
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,760
too like it it works it smokes a hash

1586
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:11,318
hole just fine the end can be this much

1587
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,640
l there's a lot of people that hate on

1588
00:56:11,318 --> 00:56:15,279
on BHO but like BHO you're not losing

1589
00:56:13,639 --> 00:56:17,679
those water soluble turps that's all I

1590
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:19,559
got to say again I'm offering it I'm

1591
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:22,558
offering it to offer it yeah because I

1592
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:24,200
can't I've tried all my [ __ ] and 2% is

1593
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:25,519
not a reason to stop growing flour and

1594
00:56:24,199 --> 00:56:26,719
make rosin it's got to be better than

1595
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:30,519
that well you're going to have hash

1596
00:56:26,719 --> 00:56:32,639
makers that hate you at 2% yeah 100%

1597
00:56:30,519 --> 00:56:34,079
well I mean just to get them to do it

1598
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:37,838
you're going to be twisting arms well my

1599
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:40,200
flower does too well that take a a 2%

1600
00:56:37,838 --> 00:56:41,440
return on hash would be just a huge L

1601
00:56:40,199 --> 00:56:42,879
you know aside from the amount of work

1602
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:45,280
to get nothing it would just it wouldn't

1603
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:47,760
it'd be G it wouldn't be cost effective

1604
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:49,519
no so hopefully with some of these new

1605
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:51,559
crosses I'm going to get find something

1606
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:54,679
that washes like the the the turtle's a

1607
00:56:51,559 --> 00:56:56,519
dumper she's dumped 5% a few times um

1608
00:56:54,679 --> 00:56:58,000
what is the turtle crossup the first

1609
00:56:56,519 --> 00:57:00,079
time when jiga gave me and my old

1610
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,920
partner cookies yeah we grew one tray of

1611
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:04,599
cookies in a room in a building full of

1612
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:06,240
OG the cookies early on I [ __ ] miss

1613
00:57:04,599 --> 00:57:09,200
cookies I would love some form cut or

1614
00:57:06,239 --> 00:57:11,279
some cookies friend has I haven't smok

1615
00:57:09,199 --> 00:57:13,038
cookies I'm so ready a long story about

1616
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:14,960
Platinum cook we call him the zebra but

1617
00:57:13,039 --> 00:57:16,599
uh it was weird my partner and I were

1618
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:18,838
harvesting the room and like there was

1619
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:20,760
one OG Kush plant that was like

1620
00:57:18,838 --> 00:57:23,358
abnormally large it was a foot and a

1621
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:26,400
half two feet taller than any other

1622
00:57:23,358 --> 00:57:28,159
plant in the room we're like what this

1623
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:30,318
plant's special we just cut it off and

1624
00:57:28,159 --> 00:57:31,838
put it to the side you know we did dealt

1625
00:57:30,318 --> 00:57:34,000
with the rest what we had to do with the

1626
00:57:31,838 --> 00:57:36,358
rest couple weeks later he's like bro I

1627
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,920
got a [ __ ] seed off that OG plant I'm

1628
00:57:36,358 --> 00:57:40,000
like the big one he's like yeah and

1629
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:41,720
[ __ ] thing was I mean I tell it it

1630
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,280
was a size of a marble it wasn't but it

1631
00:57:41,719 --> 00:57:46,439
was [ __ ] huge and it was beautiful

1632
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:49,240
and it was just Stripes all over it and

1633
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:52,798
we were so disappointed in the yield of

1634
00:57:49,239 --> 00:57:55,159
the cookies and also OG was still King

1635
00:57:52,798 --> 00:57:56,960
at that time so finding OG adjacent

1636
00:57:55,159 --> 00:57:59,399
things which was never possible

1637
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:01,240
everything was Sub sub OG I never made

1638
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:02,639
anything I never got better crosses

1639
00:58:01,239 --> 00:58:04,159
making OG I always got wor there was

1640
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:06,639
some good [ __ ] but it was Never As Good

1641
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:08,239
As OG well so it has the the quality

1642
00:58:06,639 --> 00:58:10,239
traits that everybody loves are

1643
00:58:08,239 --> 00:58:12,279
recessive so it's like you typically

1644
00:58:10,239 --> 00:58:14,239
it's hard to get get you're not getting

1645
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:15,359
them in the crosses not not right away

1646
00:58:14,239 --> 00:58:16,679
you know it takes some work it was a

1647
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:19,000
long time before people had good OG

1648
00:58:16,679 --> 00:58:21,239
seeds for sure oh I never saw OG from

1649
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,400
seed it was all it was cut you know my

1650
00:58:21,239 --> 00:58:26,519
old friend was the dude in from bring

1651
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:29,440
from Florida in his [ __ ] sock diet OG

1652
00:58:26,519 --> 00:58:32,639
diet Skittles diet OG a lot of you know

1653
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:34,159
so uh yeah it was a it was unbeknownst

1654
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:37,719
to us at the time we thought we had new

1655
00:58:34,159 --> 00:58:39,639
OG yeah um but it was the plant the girl

1656
00:58:37,719 --> 00:58:42,078
the cookie girl next to her was freaky

1657
00:58:39,639 --> 00:58:45,199
back then and she just and and puffed on

1658
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:48,519
the OG leaned heavy on so we got this

1659
00:58:45,199 --> 00:58:52,318
everything about it was cookie dominant

1660
00:58:48,519 --> 00:58:54,400
aside from the effect and the effect it

1661
00:58:52,318 --> 00:58:55,599
was like it really got me stoned in

1662
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,760
comparison to what that was the only

1663
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:57,960
thing I didn't like about well I didn't

1664
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:01,520
like the yield and I didn't like the

1665
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:03,440
potency in compared to OG um it was

1666
00:59:01,519 --> 00:59:05,119
tasty everybody wanted it you know it

1667
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:08,559
was [ __ ] it was the [ __ ] for a long

1668
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:10,640
time right um but it it missed what I

1669
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:12,280
appreciated about smoking weed well the

1670
00:59:10,639 --> 00:59:14,078
strain we got we called it sweet cooks

1671
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:15,839
and it really I always think we misnamed

1672
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:18,039
it we should have called it sour Cooks

1673
00:59:15,838 --> 00:59:21,000
uh that would have taken off much better

1674
00:59:18,039 --> 00:59:25,319
because it was it was cookies times gas

1675
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:27,318
times sour gas and that strain my my old

1676
00:59:25,318 --> 00:59:29,358
partner at turtle pie ended up Crossing

1677
00:59:27,318 --> 00:59:31,440
that with the original sfv cut and

1678
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:35,440
that's where turtle pie came from nice

1679
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:38,679
um so it was cookie to OG that shame was

1680
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:41,119
crossed back to OG and again if you see

1681
00:59:38,679 --> 00:59:43,838
her and smell her like she there's not a

1682
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:45,079
ton of OG visuals or nose to it but then

1683
00:59:43,838 --> 00:59:46,599
when you smoke you're like you got the

1684
00:59:45,079 --> 00:59:48,440
strength you get the strength just like

1685
00:59:46,599 --> 00:59:51,798
you get I mean cookies was strong too

1686
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:53,519
that's why cookies right big noes big

1687
00:59:51,798 --> 00:59:55,079
old cookie noes they like four fingers

1688
00:59:53,519 --> 00:59:57,440
or more yeah and it's like then it

1689
00:59:55,079 --> 00:59:59,240
spaghetti's out yep that was the problem

1690
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:01,119
that I had with cookies was and same

1691
00:59:59,239 --> 01:00:02,959
thing with the old OG that we got that

1692
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:04,760
was just OG cush it was like it would

1693
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:06,720
spaghetti out where you had to Trellis

1694
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:08,160
it you had to support it there was no

1695
01:00:06,719 --> 01:00:09,439
way to grow it unless you wanted a bush

1696
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:11,399
that ran along the ground because it

1697
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:15,639
would literally grow up and flop over

1698
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:17,838
4inch node spacing little buds you know

1699
01:00:15,639 --> 01:00:20,199
um thin mint was different thin mint got

1700
01:00:17,838 --> 01:00:21,960
dud that was a freaking amazing plant

1701
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:24,639
Spears do you mean if I didn't grow OG I

1702
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:27,679
didn't have to Triple trellis yeah

1703
01:00:24,639 --> 01:00:28,920
exactly [ __ ] like I didn't know that BL

1704
01:00:27,679 --> 01:00:30,960
dream you don't need trellis what are

1705
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:32,680
you talking about trellis yeah it was

1706
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:35,119
like it only took me like three Harvest

1707
01:00:32,679 --> 01:00:37,519
to be like okay they're This Tall put a

1708
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:38,880
[ __ ] it I also wasn't I didn't use to

1709
01:00:37,519 --> 01:00:40,280
clean my plants like when I first

1710
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:42,039
started I didn't rip everything

1711
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:43,640
underneath the canopy off yeah like I

1712
01:00:42,039 --> 01:00:45,359
didn't I didn't know I was learning you

1713
01:00:43,639 --> 01:00:46,759
know my buddy my buddy came over and

1714
01:00:45,358 --> 01:00:48,880
taught me how to De Leaf the first time

1715
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:51,520
I'm like what the you just ruined my

1716
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:54,000
garden yeah there's no solar panels left

1717
01:00:51,519 --> 01:00:56,440
he's like just [ __ ] wait and sure

1718
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,280
enough I was like oh wow

1719
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:00,358
I see some people and they just pull it

1720
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:02,680
so hard they strip it so hard where I'm

1721
01:01:00,358 --> 01:01:04,558
like what are you doing but they they

1722
01:01:02,679 --> 01:01:07,399
get crazy yields and I I've never been

1723
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:09,839
one to completely pull off every leaf to

1724
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:13,519
where I'm like but everybody has their

1725
01:01:09,838 --> 01:01:15,558
own way sure well and now with underc

1726
01:01:13,519 --> 01:01:18,119
you have what are you getting paid for

1727
01:01:15,559 --> 01:01:19,599
yeah leaf or Bud totally so grow less

1728
01:01:18,119 --> 01:01:20,798
leaf and more Bud the energy is going

1729
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:22,200
somewhere it can go to your leaf or you

1730
01:01:20,798 --> 01:01:24,119
can go to the bud and I'm like okay that

1731
01:01:22,199 --> 01:01:25,960
makes sense okay yeah so the under

1732
01:01:24,119 --> 01:01:26,960
canopy lighting you don't have to clean

1733
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:29,440
the under

1734
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:31,440
canopy the faens are crushing it all our

1735
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:33,400
friends use favin it's like [ __ ] dude

1736
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:35,280
well when you're getting 30 to 50% more

1737
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:36,519
yield and you're getting more purple

1738
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:38,119
buds on the bottom than you're on the

1739
01:01:36,519 --> 01:01:41,318
top it's hard to argue with that you

1740
01:01:38,119 --> 01:01:45,039
know I did that years ago I hung t5s

1741
01:01:41,318 --> 01:01:47,239
around my room like so I mean it was it

1742
01:01:45,039 --> 01:01:49,119
wasn't under canopy but I got full side

1743
01:01:47,239 --> 01:01:51,838
canopy and I had crossover light you

1744
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:52,798
know t5s don't really get that far but I

1745
01:01:51,838 --> 01:01:54,480
definitely noticed the [ __ ]

1746
01:01:52,798 --> 01:01:56,079
difference in yield yeah I also notice

1747
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:59,240
the huge difference in power but a

1748
01:01:56,079 --> 01:02:01,039
little Phototron you photron same idea I

1749
01:01:59,239 --> 01:02:02,358
had I tried growing a Phototron in a San

1750
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:04,119
Jose and it just was miserable you know

1751
01:02:02,358 --> 01:02:06,318
how I know you're old you grew the photo

1752
01:02:04,119 --> 01:02:08,039
tron yeah that's I agree with theot that

1753
01:02:06,318 --> 01:02:11,000
was where I got my start too did you

1754
01:02:08,039 --> 01:02:13,319
ever try the Octagon yeah yeah so I

1755
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:16,039
that's so funny so that was the sickest

1756
01:02:13,318 --> 01:02:18,480
[ __ ] I could never Im so dope so we had

1757
01:02:16,039 --> 01:02:20,319
the wooden octagon my friend yeah Micah

1758
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:21,880
my good friend in business partner for a

1759
01:02:20,318 --> 01:02:24,119
long time he came over to the house one

1760
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:26,400
day and was like he had the recipe you

1761
01:02:24,119 --> 01:02:28,200
know he had okay this is the we have

1762
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,639
these Ang we have to cut we had to go

1763
01:02:28,199 --> 01:02:31,879
all the way to Willets to the Garden

1764
01:02:29,639 --> 01:02:33,519
spout and buy these Dutch pots which

1765
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:35,278
were 5 Gall Square pots with little

1766
01:02:33,519 --> 01:02:39,239
holes in the back and they were five

1767
01:02:35,278 --> 01:02:41,880
bucks a piece and it was 13 plants per

1768
01:02:39,239 --> 01:02:43,959
row and per light there was 26 plants

1769
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:46,318
per light growing toward thousands or

1770
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:48,480
the 600s one we had thousand so we did 2

1771
01:02:46,318 --> 01:02:49,639
thousands some people with three 600s we

1772
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:51,599
had the cool tubes that ran in the

1773
01:02:49,639 --> 01:02:54,679
middle so the cool tubes then there was

1774
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:56,160
with light on chains right and uh some

1775
01:02:54,679 --> 01:02:57,480
people just used to hang them but we put

1776
01:02:56,159 --> 01:02:59,759
the cool tubes in there to keep it

1777
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:01,119
cooler yeah but it was very strain

1778
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,880
depending on what would work you had to

1779
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:04,640
grow something that you could veg just

1780
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:07,039
for very shortly and you would still get

1781
01:03:04,639 --> 01:03:09,358
nice buds you grow some chem 91 like I

1782
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:10,920
did and we got walls of lar it was

1783
01:03:09,358 --> 01:03:12,798
straight it was it was chem dog it was

1784
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:16,278
the West Coast dog we got we got it as

1785
01:03:12,798 --> 01:03:19,358
the dog so my buddy had I think he had

1786
01:03:16,278 --> 01:03:21,798
three in the room but he also had room

1787
01:03:19,358 --> 01:03:23,278
lights yeah so all the backsides

1788
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:25,000
flowered out too like he end up having

1789
01:03:23,278 --> 01:03:27,480
to hang trellises on the back that's

1790
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:29,119
crazy like he was like you know there's

1791
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:30,159
so much [ __ ] like it all Grows Right

1792
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:31,358
towards the light that was another

1793
01:03:30,159 --> 01:03:32,960
triple trellis like you had to hang

1794
01:03:31,358 --> 01:03:35,038
trellis after cuz he was growing cush

1795
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:37,400
and sour so it was just you know was

1796
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:39,200
getting super long and then it would

1797
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:40,720
even if it touched the Cool Tube it was

1798
01:03:39,199 --> 01:03:42,278
getting burnt even you know what I mean

1799
01:03:40,719 --> 01:03:44,199
it wasn't that damn cool GDP was the

1800
01:03:42,278 --> 01:03:45,760
best thing to go in octagon because

1801
01:03:44,199 --> 01:03:47,519
short they would short and it would

1802
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:50,319
really chunk out yeah eight weeks and

1803
01:03:47,519 --> 01:03:51,920
you yeah I like GDP still [ __ ] I

1804
01:03:50,318 --> 01:03:54,119
don't see anybody growing it CU it's a

1805
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:56,440
pain in the ass to grow same thing good

1806
01:03:54,119 --> 01:03:58,160
bubba I haven't seen a lot of good bubba

1807
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:00,278
like I have this philosophical

1808
01:03:58,159 --> 01:04:02,960
conversation with people like what I

1809
01:04:00,278 --> 01:04:05,920
like and what sells yeah you know I try

1810
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:07,679
to sell people what I think they will

1811
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:09,039
what I of course I have what I know

1812
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:12,759
people will like yeah that's how the

1813
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:15,039
business Works am I here and there like

1814
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:17,079
try this like adding I've added sh

1815
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:19,440
Banger to two of my strains now and

1816
01:04:17,079 --> 01:04:21,839
that's outside what a lot of my people

1817
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:24,798
like the fabulosa does pretty well yeah

1818
01:04:21,838 --> 01:04:26,480
um and I'm hoping the original sin's

1819
01:04:24,798 --> 01:04:29,719
going to do [ __ ] great I'm pretty

1820
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:31,798
confident because it like I said it hits

1821
01:04:29,719 --> 01:04:34,598
the fabuloso is a little light where

1822
01:04:31,798 --> 01:04:37,278
this is a little more heavy um but

1823
01:04:34,599 --> 01:04:39,720
trying to curve the market to your will

1824
01:04:37,278 --> 01:04:41,679
is kind of tough like it's only going to

1825
01:04:39,719 --> 01:04:44,318
go so far and then it's going to bounce

1826
01:04:41,679 --> 01:04:45,519
back and it might happen one yeah for

1827
01:04:44,318 --> 01:04:47,599
it's not going to happen every time I'm

1828
01:04:45,519 --> 01:04:50,838
not going to stop trying you know I I

1829
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:52,559
have nine strains that do really well

1830
01:04:50,838 --> 01:04:54,159
yeah regardless of how long I've had

1831
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:55,960
them because they're grown perfectly and

1832
01:04:54,159 --> 01:04:57,239
their quality strains I have you know

1833
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:59,440
four or five more strains in my

1834
01:04:57,239 --> 01:05:02,038
repertoire that do okay and get grown

1835
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:06,240
and offered sporadically just to mix

1836
01:05:02,039 --> 01:05:08,559
things up um but every time I'm adding

1837
01:05:06,239 --> 01:05:10,239
if I add three new strains one of them

1838
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:11,798
is going to be something I want you to

1839
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:13,278
like yeah you know not something I know

1840
01:05:11,798 --> 01:05:15,000
you're going to like like I did a lot of

1841
01:05:13,278 --> 01:05:17,798

Smalls and I didn't want to show up with

1848
01:05:27,278 --> 01:05:31,880
Smalls but the grits and jam to me is a

1849
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,798
is a candy but it

1850
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:37,240
has not oregano or Rosemary but some

1851

gold and red and and had like maybe I

1918
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:03,838
remember like wheat looking like like

1919
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:05,599
buds as opposed to like nugs and [ __ ] I

1920
01:08:03,838 --> 01:08:07,679

1922
01:08:07,679 --> 01:08:11,919
fat Buds and the bags we so we used to

1923
01:08:10,159 --> 01:08:14,838
get in this specific turkey bag that our

1924
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:16,880
mutual friend had and it was always just

1925
01:08:14,838 --> 01:08:18,600
caked on the outside of the turkey B on

1926
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:20,039
the inside where the buds were it was

1927
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:21,719
like you could take a razor and you

1928
01:08:20,039 --> 01:08:23,640
could scrape up the crystals cuz it was

1929
01:08:21,719 --> 01:08:26,319
so Frosty I don't remember having

1930

1932
01:08:27,798 --> 01:08:31,640

1933
01:08:29,039 --> 01:08:34,719

1937
01:08:40,119 --> 01:08:44,838
bags you guys are Safeway bags Cur paper

1938
01:08:43,399 --> 01:08:46,079
bag I used to cure in Safeway plastic

1939
01:08:44,838 --> 01:08:48,960
and paper bags that was my little

1940
01:08:46,079 --> 01:08:51,479
technique y I used to cure in the Sun be

1941
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:54,480
like what the f that's crazy yeah but it

1942
01:08:51,479 --> 01:08:56,559
wasn't directly so this was my method I

1943
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:58,919
would I would wa weight CU always J

1944
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:01,039
hooked my weed I had a wooden the the

1945
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:03,279
room I grew in initially was all wood

1946
01:09:01,039 --> 01:09:05,439
mhm it was wood panels you know and so

1947
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:06,920
the closet was wooden in the winter time

1948
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:08,479
the wood would be wet more than it'd be

1949
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:10,239
[ __ ] dry because that's just how the

1950
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:12,718
moisture was in the in the you know the

1951
01:09:10,238 --> 01:09:15,079
environment right um but it was always

1952
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:18,560
two to three weeks of hang drying just

1953
01:09:15,079 --> 01:09:21,198
being patient always nope don't rush it

1954
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:23,199
don't rush it when the when the tip of

1955
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:25,759
the when the the tip of the cola the

1956
01:09:23,198 --> 01:09:28,439
fattest nugs snapped m I knew it was

1957
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:31,158
time to take it off the stem then I

1958
01:09:28,439 --> 01:09:33,879
would take my Safeway plastic bags and

1959
01:09:31,158 --> 01:09:35,639
I'd fill it up I'd roll it down and then

1960
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:37,279
I put it inside a Safeway paper bag and

1961
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:39,039
I'd roll that down yeah and I'd have

1962
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:43,279
eight or 10 of those sitting out and I'd

1963
01:09:39,039 --> 01:09:45,640
go get a thick like wool or fleece black

1964
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:48,359
green blue blanket and I'd lay it over

1965
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:49,798
the top of it and so the sun would come

1966
01:09:48,359 --> 01:09:51,480
through the window yeah and it would

1967
01:09:49,798 --> 01:09:54,158
heat the blanket up which would in turn

1968
01:09:51,479 --> 01:09:56,279
heat the bags up very slowly very gently

1969
01:09:54,158 --> 01:09:58,279
that's through the window yeah Frisco

1970
01:09:56,279 --> 01:10:01,840
it's what is it [ __ ] 82 degrees

1971
01:09:58,279 --> 01:10:03,519
window Sao no hell no hell no and people

1972
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:06,119
be like what are you doing I'm like just

1973
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:08,239
smoke my weed and it would be it'd be

1974
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:11,198
the kind of weed that felt super wet and

1975
01:10:08,238 --> 01:10:13,079
was perfectly dry like greasy yeah

1976
01:10:11,198 --> 01:10:14,799
exactly it's got that greasy but it's

1977
01:10:13,079 --> 01:10:17,198
totally cured cuz you get to snap on the

1978
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:19,600
stem but it still feels like it's wet a

1979
01:10:17,198 --> 01:10:21,238
little SP oil yeah where it's completely

1980
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:24,520
Droid from the moisture but it's yeah I

1981
01:10:21,238 --> 01:10:27,158
love oil I used to do that by the F it

1982
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:28,719
was like a two or three day burping

1983
01:10:27,158 --> 01:10:30,119
without glass jars I mean it wasn't

1984
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:32,760
really bur it was never burping cuz it

1985
01:10:30,119 --> 01:10:34,399
was never I would whenever I burped yeah

1986
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:36,119
that's when I would [ __ ] [ __ ] up because

1987
01:10:34,399 --> 01:10:37,960
I would leave it closed for too long

1988
01:10:36,119 --> 01:10:39,399
yeah you know six hours today was too

1989
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:41,439
long it should have been three hours you

1990
01:10:39,399 --> 01:10:43,359
know and whatever it was like iied it

1991
01:10:41,439 --> 01:10:46,639
never worked for me so you know I

1992
01:10:43,359 --> 01:10:49,119
figured out this own my own routine and

1993
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:52,560
I had great success with it like that's

1994
01:10:49,119 --> 01:10:54,079
how growing the OG I did is part of the

1995
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:56,000
reason I got here just it definitely

1996
01:10:54,079 --> 01:10:57,158
wasn't selling bees be e and the [ __ ]

1997
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,520
you know what I mean it wasn't that it

1998
01:10:57,158 --> 01:11:02,079
was it was getting the cultivation bug

1999
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:04,280
and you know having a few grows and

2000
01:11:02,079 --> 01:11:07,359
learning all the [ __ ] trials and

2001
01:11:04,279 --> 01:11:10,198
tribulations that the gamut of [ __ ] from

2002
01:11:07,359 --> 01:11:12,759
Bugs to police to robbers to you know

2003
01:11:10,198 --> 01:11:15,119
bad Harvest to all that [ __ ] and

2004
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:17,440
sticking with it yeah like [ __ ] I'm made

2005
01:11:15,119 --> 01:11:20,119
do this this is this is who I want to be

2006
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:21,799
this who I am exactly exactly Dark

2007
01:11:20,119 --> 01:11:24,880
Energy you ever used dark energy back in

2008
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:27,039
the day oh yeah yeah yeah yeah uh was

2009
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:29,199
that no I'm thinking no I'm thinking

2010
01:11:27,039 --> 01:11:31,039
that wasn't the one that made the B

2011
01:11:29,198 --> 01:11:32,678
seelp it was the seelp that was like

2012
01:11:31,039 --> 01:11:34,880
steroids for your buds and I believe

2013
01:11:32,679 --> 01:11:37,520
it's it's banned now because it's like a

2014
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:39,760
pgr but it's not a pgr it was no no it

2015
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:42,000
was it was actually seelp celp is now

2016
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:43,320
banned they consider a pgr and it was

2017
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,880
but it was like the big game changer

2018
01:11:43,319 --> 01:11:47,119
back in the day that made our buds swell

2019
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:48,480
up and it was crazy like the TPS

2020
01:11:47,119 --> 01:11:50,880
everything liquid caramel was another

2021
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:53,399
good product you know this is the '90s

2022
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:54,679

01:12:13,198 --> 01:12:18,399
completely blocking off like a fat third

2032

01:13:02,679 --> 01:13:06,520
want to do is grow Kush and he's like

2054
01:13:04,039 --> 01:13:08,158
walk he's like crawl dude yeah now

2055
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:09,560
you're walking so why don't we give

2056
01:13:08,158 --> 01:13:11,439
these a try we've been talking about it

2057
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:13,960
long enough [ __ ] hey we're GNA do the

2058
01:13:11,439 --> 01:13:15,479
refire test refire me up bro it's a

2059
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:17,880
little bit of AB testing we're doing

2060
01:13:15,479 --> 01:13:21,238
we're going to go soil versus cocoa I

2061
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:25,480
think it's a fun okay harmless test that

2062
01:13:21,238 --> 01:13:25,479
we can both enjoy okay

2063
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:32,920
yeah when I smoke joints I I it's like

2064
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:34,279
at night time before dinner or like in

2065
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:35,800
between rounds of Call of Duty so I

2066
01:13:34,279 --> 01:13:37,439
don't have like 15 minutes to smoke a

2067
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:40,639
whole joints so I'll do the refire no

2068
01:13:37,439 --> 01:13:42,158
problem three times though we we smoke

2069
01:13:40,639 --> 01:13:44,000
really good flour right so like you can

2070
01:13:42,158 --> 01:13:45,679
refire it a bunch and it's still if it's

2071
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,960
really good all the way down to the road

2072
01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:50,119
should tastes amazing I don't care how

2073
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:52,800
many re times or times you refire it

2074
01:13:50,119 --> 01:13:55,880
it's funny when I was pheno hunting the

2075
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:57,520
Tahiti midnight yep because I was given

2076
01:13:55,880 --> 01:14:00,679
a couple strains like you know which one

2077
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:03,719
of these works for you uh that one

2078
01:14:00,679 --> 01:14:05,560
worked because in the course of a

2079
01:14:03,719 --> 01:14:07,679
conversation with somebody over like an

2080
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:10,400
hour we smoked this Dink and we kept

2081
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:12,119
relighting it and we were both like damn

2082
01:14:10,399 --> 01:14:14,198
this the third time we relit this and

2083
01:14:12,119 --> 01:14:16,840
it's still [ __ ] tasting like we can

2084
01:14:14,198 --> 01:14:19,039
still get turfs off it what are your

2085
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:22,679
thoughts on number

2086
01:14:19,039 --> 01:14:26,479
one super smooth it's got

2087
01:14:22,679 --> 01:14:27,600
that that's I don't I call it a twang I

2088
01:14:26,479 --> 01:14:30,198
don't know if that's what other people

2089
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:34,280
describe it but it's that it's that

2090
01:14:30,198 --> 01:14:37,039
distinct pallet flavor it's not lemon

2091
01:14:34,279 --> 01:14:39,960
it's like if it's lemon it's like eating

2092
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:41,279
the peel not smelling the lemon you know

2093
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:43,198
if it's if it's something like that it's

2094
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:45,439
more like not from the smell of it it's

2095
01:14:43,198 --> 01:14:48,039
more like the Citrus taste of it I guess

2096
01:14:45,439 --> 01:14:51,079
that the oils behind it right but it it

2097
01:14:48,039 --> 01:14:53,198
has that

2098
01:14:51,079 --> 01:14:54,198
distinct tur profile that everybody's

2099
01:14:53,198 --> 01:14:56,719
looking for when they're smoking their

2100
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:58,919
Skittles yeah totally that's the one

2101
01:14:56,719 --> 01:15:02,000
thing when you smoke Skittles you expect

2102
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:03,679
oh there we go we'll swap it out yeah

2103
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,279
these were kind of rolled in a rush

2104
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:08,800
yesterday to do the show shameful was

2105
01:15:06,279 --> 01:15:11,759
like yeah I just you know that how dare

2106
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:13,600
you yeah these 1.75 or actually I think

2107
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:15,639
I I put two grams in each one of these

2108
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:17,039
okay do you actually weigh it out or you

2109
01:15:15,639 --> 01:15:18,639
I do I do because I feel like then I can

2110
01:15:17,039 --> 01:15:20,439
get more consistent and more even so

2111
01:15:18,639 --> 01:15:23,840
personally I prefer weighing out every

2112
01:15:20,439 --> 01:15:25,479
single one uh cuz I try to get that the

2113
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:27,279
specific grind right feel like the

2114
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:29,439
weight in each one the way I twist it at

2115
01:15:27,279 --> 01:15:32,119
the end the way it burns down I think

2116
01:15:29,439 --> 01:15:37,238
all those things are important I do use

2117
01:15:32,119 --> 01:15:38,760
uh the glue I use can gar glue and so

2118
01:15:37,238 --> 01:15:40,158
it's a little brush that you twist in

2119
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:41,960
and a little bit of liquid comes out and

2120
01:15:40,158 --> 01:15:43,638
so that the crutch sticks to it better I

2121
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:45,560
feel like you get better rib is it like

2122
01:15:43,639 --> 01:15:47,239
is it like that Agave stuff like sweet

2123
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:48,679
tast little sugar whatever there's a

2124
01:15:47,238 --> 01:15:51,399
little sugar in there it's perfect and

2125
01:15:48,679 --> 01:15:53,158
then I use the raw crutches I I love the

2126
01:15:51,399 --> 01:15:55,759
raw crutches with the element papers and

2127
01:15:53,158 --> 01:15:57,799
the organ tips so it's very specific and

2128
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:59,440
I've been working on this since before I

2129
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:00,199
started this podcast we've been working

2130
01:15:59,439 --> 01:16:02,439
on the

2131
01:16:00,198 --> 01:16:04,039
recipe and it's just one thing we keep

2132
01:16:02,439 --> 01:16:06,359
keep on perfecting and it's

2133
01:16:04,039 --> 01:16:07,760
like I'm looking for a couple things I'm

2134
01:16:06,359 --> 01:16:09,920
looking for how it burns I'm looking for

2135
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:13,039
the drip but also the taste how does

2136
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:15,239
that paper taste is it is it clear is it

2137
01:16:13,039 --> 01:16:16,960
yeah is you taste through the paper you

2138
01:16:15,238 --> 01:16:18,559
taste the paper does it burn the back of

2139
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:20,520
your throat if you use the wrong papers

2140
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:25,039
they you taste them and I'm not about

2141
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:28,360
tasting paper especially if you're

2142
01:16:25,039 --> 01:16:30,880
testing or if you're doing any kind of

2143
01:16:28,359 --> 01:16:33,880
Trials of your weed you want to use the

2144
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:36,159
same grinder the same paper the same

2145
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:39,800
amount of weed cut all the varials

2146
01:16:36,158 --> 01:16:42,000
variables out that you can so that all

2147
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:43,840
you're really testing is the weed itself

2148
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:46,479
it's not you know cuz a Raw versus an

2149
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:47,960
element versus OCB they all taste

2150
01:16:46,479 --> 01:16:50,119
different yeah they all have a different

2151
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:51,079
flavors for sure you can taste them a

2152
01:16:50,119 --> 01:16:53,039
little bit different in the back of your

2153
01:16:51,079 --> 01:16:55,559
throat sometimes uh you know and then

2154
01:16:53,039 --> 01:16:57,840
some of the stronger tasting papers I'm

2155
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:59,440
not into I want to taste the flour right

2156
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:02,039
but also we're looking for drip we're

2157
01:16:59,439 --> 01:17:05,039
looking for ash how does the ash

2158
01:17:02,039 --> 01:17:07,198
look what do you think what what do you

2159
01:17:05,039 --> 01:17:10,880
like better one or two I like that one

2160
01:17:07,198 --> 01:17:12,238
better nice I I I want to say this that

2161
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:14,159
one is definitely smoother like I've

2162
01:17:12,238 --> 01:17:16,119
coughed after every hit with this one

2163
01:17:14,158 --> 01:17:19,719
where that one I got one cough out of

2164
01:17:16,119 --> 01:17:22,279
three hits yep it's hard because of that

2165
01:17:19,719 --> 01:17:23,800
I'm taking hits four through eight off

2166
01:17:22,279 --> 01:17:25,479
this I don't know if it's like I want to

2167
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:27,000
say this is getting me high

2168
01:17:25,479 --> 01:17:28,959
but it could be the compounding of being

2169
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:32,279
the second four hits I've taken it could

2170
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:34,520
be um but flavor-wise are you getting so

2171
01:17:32,279 --> 01:17:34,519
this was

2172
01:17:35,119 --> 01:17:38,960
smoother this one has a different tur

2173
01:17:37,359 --> 01:17:41,238
profile though they

2174
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:45,198
taste that one to

2175
01:17:41,238 --> 01:17:47,959
me has the more what I'm used to Z tur

2176
01:17:45,198 --> 01:17:49,919
profile right this one has its I taste

2177
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:52,198
the Z but it's a different profile it's

2178
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:54,480
almost like this one's perfumey a little

2179
01:17:52,198 --> 01:17:56,119
bit like I get perfume okay is that what

2180
01:17:54,479 --> 01:17:57,559
you mean like because there is like a

2181
01:17:56,119 --> 01:17:59,279
like if you spray perfume and you get it

2182
01:17:57,560 --> 01:18:02,719
in your mouth like that yeah okay I get

2183
01:17:59,279 --> 01:18:04,519
that too okay and I always thought

2184
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:06,520
people say perfumey like it's smelled

2185
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:07,880
like perfume but it's not that it's the

2186
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:09,440
Coating in your mouth Coating in the

2187
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:11,800
mouth feel yeah it's not like it tastes

2188
01:18:09,439 --> 01:18:13,839
yeah I mean this is making my hands

2189
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:17,880
tremble I would love for sativas to love

2190
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:20,440
me back but my canabo system as much as

2191
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:25,480
I appreciate the turs does not

2192
01:18:20,439 --> 01:18:27,839
appreciate the effect of saiva's uh

2193
01:18:25,479 --> 01:18:30,759
again I know I'm using outdated terms

2194
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:33,159
yeah I get it until we the community

2195
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:35,639
come up with new vernacular to to

2196
01:18:33,158 --> 01:18:38,000
describe what we used to use sativa and

2197
01:18:35,639 --> 01:18:39,800
Inda for I'm going to continue to use

2198
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,039
these once we come up with new terms and

2199
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:43,600
and it's an accepted to talk about it

2200
01:18:42,039 --> 01:18:45,880
again because for me it's always about

2201
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:48,320
feeling or taste right so this has the

2202
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:51,440
feeling I would associate with sativas

2203
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:55,079
long flowering varieties we can go lfv

2204
01:18:51,439 --> 01:18:57,439
or whatever I don't know yeah sativa is

2205
01:18:55,079 --> 01:18:59,119
just what we know am I wrong that OG

2206
01:18:57,439 --> 01:19:02,079
Kush genetically would be classified as

2207
01:18:59,119 --> 01:19:04,479
a sativa OG Kush can be a long flower I

2208
01:19:02,079 --> 01:19:06,399
think OG cush is a hybrid for sure but

2209
01:19:04,479 --> 01:19:08,638
I've seen it when IND I've seen it when

2210
01:19:06,399 --> 01:19:11,198
Inda cups and I've seen it when sativa

2211
01:19:08,639 --> 01:19:12,760
CS is it genetically I think it's

2212
01:19:11,198 --> 01:19:14,678
everything's a hybrid obviously does it

2213
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:17,960
lean more sativa or indica I think

2214
01:19:14,679 --> 01:19:19,600
that's depending on the OG cut we'll

2215
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:21,520
switch you go back to this one and I'll

2216
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:22,920
go back to this one you look at the Ash

2217
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:26,040
and I feel like the ash on that was

2218
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:30,279
burning a little cleaner

2219
01:19:26,039 --> 01:19:33,560
but uh as far as taste wise this is a

2220
01:19:30,279 --> 01:19:35,559
this is levels up in my opinion um just

2221
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:36,800
twise I think this is up here and but

2222
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:38,400
that is the Skittles that we know and

2223
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:40,719
love that's the Skittles that I know and

2224
01:19:38,399 --> 01:19:43,238
love the but this one is different right

2225
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:45,760
this one is also strong one I'm telling

2226
01:19:43,238 --> 01:19:47,399
that's the stronger one because [ __ ]

2227
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:50,560
like dude Skittles does not give me

2228
01:19:47,399 --> 01:19:53,799
highight this it doesn't uh okay yeah

2229
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:55,840
cool normally it does not doinks of what

2230
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:59,159
this would be

2231
01:19:55,840 --> 01:20:02,360
akin to this yeah and I walk away

2232
01:19:59,158 --> 01:20:04,559
unsatisfied right right and and it's

2233
01:20:02,359 --> 01:20:05,960
like I'm ready to go jump in my car and

2234
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:07,600
hit my Cal Fire or just [ __ ] hit the

2235
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:11,079
Cal Fire or roll up something else you

2236
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:12,600
know if if if I'm in sack now that uh

2237
01:20:11,079 --> 01:20:14,198
Jordan's there all the time they got

2238
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:15,679
like P90 and [ __ ] laying around so I'll

2239
01:20:14,198 --> 01:20:17,279
grab some of that or I just tried this

2240
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:19,039

2260
01:20:57,039 --> 01:21:01,119
talking about Kyle a little bit lately

2261
01:20:59,079 --> 01:21:02,399
and he he was just basically letting me

2262
01:21:01,119 --> 01:21:03,639
know that who he was and [ __ ] and I'm

2263
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:04,879
like okay so I definitely know that

2264
01:21:03,639 --> 01:21:05,719
reference I haven't met him yet I

2265
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:07,119
haven't had the pleasure but I

2266
01:21:05,719 --> 01:21:10,319
definitely know the reference so yeah

2267
01:21:07,119 --> 01:21:11,880
he's awesome he's he's uh yeah he's he's

2268
01:21:10,319 --> 01:21:14,679
he basically is

2269
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:16,159
one hard dude I'm telling you for

2270
01:21:14,679 --> 01:21:17,560
Skittles that doesn't smoke like

2271
01:21:16,158 --> 01:21:18,920
Skittles in the sense that I don't know

2272
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:21,280
if I would have smoked so much on my

2273
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:23,800
last podcast had I known it was that

2274
01:21:21,279 --> 01:21:25,279
strong I was super ripped I'm curious to

2275
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:28,960
watch the podcast

2276
01:21:25,279 --> 01:21:30,719
and see if how different I am from

2277
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:32,840
before before and after the joint

2278
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:34,239
because inside I'm going a million miles

2279
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:36,880
hour right now yeah so Skittles doesn't

2280
01:21:34,238 --> 01:21:38,959
usually dab some OG cush right now

2281
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:40,920
Skittles usually doesn't give me tight

2282
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:43,359
eyes yeah but Skittles as far as eyes

2283
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:45,359
are [ __ ] yeah it's got to be that one

2284
01:21:43,359 --> 01:21:48,759
it's that's that's making the effect

2285
01:21:45,359 --> 01:21:50,238
because it's it's the soil one for sure

2286
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:51,760
it's cuz it does sidles doesn't normally

2287
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:54,198
and it doesn't taste perfumey like that

2288
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:56,440
normally in my opinion but this is that

2289
01:21:54,198 --> 01:21:58,919
tradition Z taste that everybody I love

2290
01:21:56,439 --> 01:22:00,799
it I love that too but this one is like

2291
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:03,679
what is up with that and the only

2292
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:06,880
variable different literally the same

2293
01:22:03,679 --> 01:22:09,239
light the same harvest the same

2294
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:12,520
nutrients it's all the same the one

2295
01:22:09,238 --> 01:22:15,279
variable is soil y right and so take it

2296
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:17,600
for what it is so um you equate that to

2297
01:22:15,279 --> 01:22:19,039
the slightly darker Ash as well I do

2298
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:21,199
because I feel like with soil you

2299
01:22:19,039 --> 01:22:23,439
probably need a longer flush and it's

2300
01:22:21,198 --> 01:22:25,759
harder to get a different well maybe not

2301
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:27,599
so different but definit like it takes

2302
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:29,360
longer to flush soil for sure like we

2303
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:31,120
used to do two weeks on soil I don't

2304
01:22:29,359 --> 01:22:33,079
really do too much soil you know I'm the

2305
01:22:31,119 --> 01:22:35,599
seed guy anyway so I'm mostly cocoa and

2306
01:22:33,079 --> 01:22:37,000
I love cocoa flour but really soil

2307
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:39,840
there's something special about the

2308
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:41,279
effect too like of this stuff especially

2309
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:42,920
I'm like Skittles doesn't make me feel

2310
01:22:41,279 --> 01:22:45,599
like that normally these are amazing on

2311
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:48,679
the relight by the way yeah both of them

2312
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:50,239
one day later literally 24 hours later

2313
01:22:48,679 --> 01:22:52,000
we do these podcasts sometimes you see

2314
01:22:50,238 --> 01:22:53,399
them one week to the next but like we

2315
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,359
we're filming these ones back toback so

2316
01:22:53,399 --> 01:22:57,238
you got to experience the relay it was

2317
01:22:55,359 --> 01:23:00,599
perfect for this instance where we could

2318
01:22:57,238 --> 01:23:02,519
test these on two days and get similar

2319
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:06,039
experiences I mean I

2320
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:07,639
think uh really special stuff just yeah

2321
01:23:06,039 --> 01:23:09,238
SF Canon dude they do a good job with

2322
01:23:07,639 --> 01:23:11,480
the Z they do a good job with it they've

2323
01:23:09,238 --> 01:23:13,718
been good for a while they do some good

2324
01:23:11,479 --> 01:23:16,279
cand some nice stuff absolutely super

2325
01:23:13,719 --> 01:23:18,198
candies the quality yeah I mean they

2326
01:23:16,279 --> 01:23:21,119
they get the the boxes it's like those

2327
01:23:18,198 --> 01:23:25,119
guys know what's up yep I used to get

2328
01:23:21,119 --> 01:23:27,760
this stuff it was super sour tan or sour

2329
01:23:25,119 --> 01:23:29,800
Tangi yeah and it was like a [ __ ]

2330
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:31,960
Skyrocket like you were holding on to a

2331
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:37,279
[ __ ] Sky you'd be so [ __ ] high in

2332
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:39,600
it and my I yeah I'm too [ __ ] it was

2333
01:23:37,279 --> 01:23:43,198
it was the best and the worst at the

2334
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:45,159
same time it was it was I was so far up

2335
01:23:43,198 --> 01:23:47,119
there it was just in up there I didn't

2336
01:23:45,158 --> 01:23:48,759
like I was uncomfortable being ghost

2337
01:23:47,119 --> 01:23:50,359
train Hayes used to do that for me the

2338
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:52,079
ghost train would be like yeah that

2339
01:23:50,359 --> 01:23:54,279
could that was like Rocket Field where

2340
01:23:52,079 --> 01:23:55,279
you would just blast off if you dude

2341
01:23:54,279 --> 01:23:57,759
yeah

2342
01:23:55,279 --> 01:24:00,198
those super Silvers those did two oh so

2343
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:02,000
you ran back with the 97 super silver in

2344
01:24:00,198 --> 01:24:04,519
the Bay Area dude that super silver was

2345
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:06,679
so strong it was one of the strongest

2346
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:08,280
and it would just get you lit like it

2347
01:24:06,679 --> 01:24:09,880
was it was stronger than anything else

2348
01:24:08,279 --> 01:24:11,359
around at that time and people liked it

2349
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:14,119
because it was strong also the tur

2350
01:24:11,359 --> 01:24:15,719
profile was nose burning like intense

2351
01:24:14,119 --> 01:24:17,238
totally yeah really good stuff when it

2352
01:24:15,719 --> 01:24:19,239
was right it was right when it was right

2353
01:24:17,238 --> 01:24:22,119

2354
01:24:19,238 --> 01:24:24,519

01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:52,400
yeah it was so I was a buyer for a while

2368
01:24:51,118 --> 01:24:55,118
and a lot of times I had to take

2369
01:24:52,399 --> 01:24:57,279
people's word for it yeah because

2370
01:24:55,118 --> 01:24:59,079
I'd never seen Romulan the first time

2371
01:24:57,279 --> 01:25:00,559
until I saw it the first time yeah and

2372
01:24:59,079 --> 01:25:02,439
then when I saw it the third time and it

2373
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:04,480
was the same looking smelling thing as

2374
01:25:02,439 --> 01:25:08,039
I'm like okay this is officially Romulan

2375
01:25:04,479 --> 01:25:09,479
you know uh all these crazy St n9b

2376
01:25:08,039 --> 01:25:11,800
hammer and all these different strains

2377
01:25:09,479 --> 01:25:14,839
that would come through and I'm like

2378
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:18,000
okay cool until I knew it was or wasn't

2379
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:21,239
I ran with it yeah but it was cool

2380
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:24,158
having that time on that side of the

2381
01:25:21,238 --> 01:25:26,638
desk where I could learn from all the

2382
01:25:24,158 --> 01:25:30,960
world work that other people did right

2383
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:33,359
evaluate 100% 100% instead of the small

2384
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:35,600
circle of Growers and and and smokers

2385
01:25:33,359 --> 01:25:39,118
that I hung out with is to be put in a

2386
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:41,119
position to view hundreds of pounds a

2387
01:25:39,118 --> 01:25:44,519
month without smoking them making good

2388
01:25:41,118 --> 01:25:46,399
decisions right I was even I that's the

2389
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:47,639
best those those guys the the buyers at

2390
01:25:46,399 --> 01:25:49,319
the dispensaries back in the day that

2391
01:25:47,639 --> 01:25:51,400
would smoke a joint of it I have the

2392
01:25:49,319 --> 01:25:53,158
most respect for those guys right but

2393
01:25:51,399 --> 01:25:55,079
not everybody has time you look at

2394
01:25:53,158 --> 01:25:56,879
Harbor Side you look at PG and it's like

2395
01:25:55,079 --> 01:25:59,760
the line's a mile long for people trying

2396
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:01,520
to vend but like really you can gauge

2397
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:02,600
the stuff I mean by the looks yeah you

2398
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:04,119
know these guys have to make good

2399
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:06,400
decisions by the looks but also you go

2400
01:26:04,118 --> 01:26:08,319
to smoke it and it's like so the

2401
01:26:06,399 --> 01:26:11,158
dispensary I worked for was was coming

2402
01:26:08,319 --> 01:26:13,359
out of an older dispensary and they

2403
01:26:11,158 --> 01:26:15,399
needed someone to put good weed on the

2404
01:26:13,359 --> 01:26:18,439
shelf and I didn't know [ __ ] about being

2405
01:26:15,399 --> 01:26:21,519
a buyer I knew good [ __ ] weed and I

2406
01:26:18,439 --> 01:26:23,359
knew vaguely what it was worth in in

2407
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:25,199
within within a certain within a certain

2408
01:26:23,359 --> 01:26:26,719
realm like things I never seen before

2409
01:26:25,198 --> 01:26:29,039
you know I didn't know I didn't know

2410
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:32,600
what crazy depths were worth until I

2411
01:26:29,039 --> 01:26:35,719
until I figured it out but being able to

2412
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:37,840
see all the weed and try it because I

2413
01:26:35,719 --> 01:26:39,079
got my eyes fooled me quite a few times

2414
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:40,920
yeah so I stopped looking at the weed

2415
01:26:39,079 --> 01:26:42,840
first and I would just open I'd talk to

2416
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:45,399
you and open your bag and I close my

2417
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:47,560
eyes and I'd smell it and i' taste it

2418
01:26:45,399 --> 01:26:50,599
and I look at you in your eyes and close

2419
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:52,400
my eyes again and I wanted my nose to

2420
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:54,679
make my first buying decision yeah

2421
01:26:52,399 --> 01:26:56,079
because my nose didn't lie to me my eyes

2422
01:26:54,679 --> 01:26:59,560
would [ __ ] lie to me all oh this

2423
01:26:56,079 --> 01:27:02,319
[ __ ] looks so good no no does it

2424
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:04,880
[ __ ] smell good because ultimately if

2425
01:27:02,319 --> 01:27:06,759
it's rinsed and and and flushed and

2426
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:08,400
cured correctly it's going to taste good

2427
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:12,440
right regardless of what it looks like

2428
01:27:08,399 --> 01:27:16,279
except for purple punch but never yeah I

2429
01:27:12,439 --> 01:27:16,279
I had like that doesn't get

2430
01:27:16,399 --> 01:27:21,359
you but uh I didn't buy a lot of that uh

2431
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:23,000
like I had to buy so much blue dream and

2432
01:27:21,359 --> 01:27:24,679
I didn't want to buy blue dream yeah I

2433
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:26,639
was like what but but it was like the

2434
01:27:24,679 --> 01:27:28,319
blue collar strain like okay always have

2435
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:30,279
blue dream on the menu but fire blue

2436
01:27:28,319 --> 01:27:32,158
dream is good don't get me wrong good

2437
01:27:30,279 --> 01:27:35,559
fire blue dream is so good like grown

2438
01:27:32,158 --> 01:27:36,879
correctly the real cut it's it's amazing

2439
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:40,960
uh you know and it's not everyone's cup

2440
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:43,920
of tea I was using that place to elevate

2441
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:45,760
myself and my and eventually my brand

2442
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:47,880
when I started the brand there uh I

2443
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:49,639
elevated my knowledge of the game of the

2444
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:52,639
industry of what everybody else was

2445
01:27:49,639 --> 01:27:54,639
doing I I my my knowledge of strain

2446
01:27:52,639 --> 01:27:57,239
diversity grew intensely I learned all

2447
01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:59,520
about hashes and Edibles and like why

2448
01:27:57,238 --> 01:28:01,039
are the Edibles and the hash companies

2449
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:02,760
the only ones with names like why don't

2450
01:28:01,039 --> 01:28:03,960
the flower companies have names I

2451
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:05,880
started telling the Growers like dude

2452
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:07,800
you need to name your company totally

2453
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:11,000
who the [ __ ] are you you have four

2454
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:13,560
strains on my shelf and no one knows

2455
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:17,399
that they're yours but every corova

2456
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:20,840
black bar versus uh Coffee Bean whatever

2457
01:28:17,399 --> 01:28:22,519
those things are called bar they get all

2458
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:24,480
the hype but they don't exist without us

2459
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:26,239
anyways cuz I'm a cultivator not edible

2460
01:28:24,479 --> 01:28:28,519

2466
01:28:37,238 --> 01:28:41,158
list the rosin on I'm getting all the

2467
01:28:39,719 --> 01:28:43,000
packaging constraints but I'd like to be

2468
01:28:41,158 --> 01:28:44,920
able to list you know what exactly

2469
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:46,800

bit hopefully my voice isn't quivering

2492
01:29:29,079 --> 01:29:35,479
too much but I'm surprisingly lit off of

2493

2496
01:29:41,079 --> 01:29:45,920
little uncomfortable being completely

stingy with the amount of seeds that she

2524
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:51,159
gave me from the uh and I've never we

2525
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:54,639
read we did the Magnum Turtle but I

2526
01:30:51,158 --> 01:30:56,799
wasn't there for that uh we got three

2527
01:30:54,639 --> 01:30:58,319
iterations two were terrible and then

2528
01:30:56,800 --> 01:31:00,719
when the Magnum Turtle came out the

2529
01:30:58,319 --> 01:31:04,000
Magnum turtle is gone right or I I mean

2530
01:31:00,719 --> 01:31:06,198
I haven't seen my knowledge so my friend

2531
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:08,600
it fell out of favor with us but our

2532
01:31:06,198 --> 01:31:11,118
friends at SF Cana yeah seemed to have a

2533
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:14,760
lot of favor with it it worked so

2534
01:31:11,118 --> 01:31:17,479
wanting to bring bring it on to uh the

2535
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:21,000
recck line I I I was like okay so we did

2536
01:31:17,479 --> 01:31:23,919
it in sack yeah a few times and then

2537
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:25,960
like three times in a row it Herm and so

2538
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:27,600
so they were like we can't we don't have

2539
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:31,000
time to fix this and we can't afford to

2540
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:34,039
grow this so they got rid of it which it

2541
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:35,639
is stressing right like so yeah whatever

2542
01:31:34,039 --> 01:31:40,158
maybe got some systemic bacteria who

2543
01:31:35,639 --> 01:31:42,639
knows right who knows they anytime a

2544
01:31:40,158 --> 01:31:44,920
like they've had to [ __ ] can some fire

2545
01:31:42,639 --> 01:31:46,800
ass strains because no matter what on

2546
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:48,880
the third time they you know they it Hur

2547
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:51,239
it grew once or twice good and then

2548
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:52,600
Hermes a little bit and then the then

2549
01:31:51,238 --> 01:31:54,158
the next time it's cool and then Hermes

2550
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:57,039
bad they're like yeah it's got to go

2551
01:31:54,158 --> 01:31:59,039
because it can't interex tra can [ __ ] up

2552
01:31:57,039 --> 01:32:02,319
a lot of things it's it's just not worth

2553
01:31:59,039 --> 01:32:05,760
it uhuh and that place is so many hunt

2554
01:32:02,319 --> 01:32:08,198
or have a catastrophic pollination orgy

2555
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:09,960
one it's not designed for that at all so

2556
01:32:08,198 --> 01:32:12,319
for sure I love all these new flavors

2557
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:14,920
coming out that are outside of the

2558
01:32:12,319 --> 01:32:18,599
spectrum of what the market is looking

2559
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:20,560
at right now I'm I'm excited for more of

2560
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:22,520
the long flowering varieties to get

2561
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:24,080
mixed in even if we mix them in with the

2562
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:25,920
gelados to see where it goes to get

2563
01:32:24,079 --> 01:32:29,319
people excited about those things again

2564
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:31,199
how long before we got lcg sour d yeah

2565
01:32:29,319 --> 01:32:33,279
I'm down to [ __ ] try it yeah I mean I

2566
01:32:31,198 --> 01:32:35,319
I made some cool C I did the Skittles

2567
01:32:33,279 --> 01:32:38,118
yeah we did some double Cherry gelato

2568
01:32:35,319 --> 01:32:40,920
with the weasel's diesel and we did the

2569
01:32:38,118 --> 01:32:43,479
Skittles backcross the zbx I have a zbx

2570
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:46,279
that I made that has uh weasel's diesel

2571
01:32:43,479 --> 01:32:48,678
in it and so that it looks crazy looks

2572
01:32:46,279 --> 01:32:52,439
crazy there's some interesting

2573
01:32:48,679 --> 01:32:55,279
fenos one of my friends in my network

2574
01:32:52,439 --> 01:32:57,759
said they just smoked some some lcg OG

2575
01:32:55,279 --> 01:32:59,399
that was really good nice and I if I

2576
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:02,560
could remember which one of you said it

2577
01:32:59,399 --> 01:33:04,638
I would be happily say who you were but

2578
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:07,039
I was I was like okay let's [ __ ]

2579
01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:08,920
check like lcg is not going away it's a

2580
01:33:07,039 --> 01:33:11,800
it's a wave it's it's not it's not going

2581
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:13,399
anywhere I hypothesize that there's a

2582
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:15,679
lot of people who like to smoke weed

2583
01:33:13,399 --> 01:33:18,759
that don't like to get Hella stoned

2584
01:33:15,679 --> 01:33:22,000
which would be perfect for the lcgs you

2585
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:23,960
know perfect for Skittles there's lcgs

2586
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:25,719
is a little the lcg is a little stronger

2587
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:27,639
skitt absolutely but it's not in it's

2588
01:33:25,719 --> 01:33:31,760
not in the gas range it's not the GMO

2589
01:33:27,639 --> 01:33:34,639
the OG the uh the G [ __ ] yeah Sour's

2590
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:37,199
probably lcg range it depends on who's

2591
01:33:34,639 --> 01:33:39,560
doing it s that would like it would test

2592
01:33:37,198 --> 01:33:42,039
it 14% but it would give you couch lock

2593
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:44,360
too it was so strong like to me like

2594
01:33:42,039 --> 01:33:46,198
sour is a gassy version of Skittles I'm

2595
01:33:44,359 --> 01:33:48,559
hope I'm not bastardizing either one but

2596
01:33:46,198 --> 01:33:51,319
like the the they have that distinct tur

2597
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:53,960
profile and a distinct potency level

2598
01:33:51,319 --> 01:33:55,519
that I don't know that one I I'm going

2599
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:56,600
to need to smoke some Sour again to see

2600
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:59,360
cuz it's been a while since I've had

2601
01:33:56,600 --> 01:34:01,679
some fire sour but like I never liked it

2602
01:33:59,359 --> 01:34:03,319
because I was a cush dude and sour was

2603
01:34:01,679 --> 01:34:05,480
like H okay we warmed up with the sour

2604
01:34:03,319 --> 01:34:08,039
where's the OG oh I love sour I love

2605
01:34:05,479 --> 01:34:09,399
just the turps over you know that one of

2606
01:34:08,039 --> 01:34:11,399
those things but I also like the effect

2607
01:34:09,399 --> 01:34:13,879
of sour it's something I relate to you

2608
01:34:11,399 --> 01:34:15,559
know I could smoke all day and enjoy I

2609
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:16,920
feel like sour was one of those ones you

2610
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:18,199
enjoyed in the morning you enjoy in the

2611
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:20,000
afternoon or the evening it's one of

2612
01:34:18,198 --> 01:34:21,399
those across the board Skittles can be

2613
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:24,800
kind of like that for me too but I feel

2614
01:34:21,399 --> 01:34:26,719
like the sour was like special and it

2615
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:28,119
was the effect was good I don't know if

2616
01:34:26,719 --> 01:34:30,399
either one of those would be evening

2617
01:34:28,118 --> 01:34:32,118
strange for me yeah especially if I've

2618
01:34:30,399 --> 01:34:34,118
been smoking them all day I'm definitely

2619
01:34:32,118 --> 01:34:36,118
turning it up a level or or turning it

2620
01:34:34,118 --> 01:34:38,118
down a level let's put it that way yeah

2621
01:34:36,118 --> 01:34:40,198
I mean I I like mixing up and and you

2622
01:34:38,118 --> 01:34:42,000
never know what you feel like what am I

2623
01:34:40,198 --> 01:34:43,960
doing that night yeah if I want

2624
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:46,079
something super strong yeah before bed

2625
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:49,359
for sure but that guava Cherry is a good

2626
01:34:46,079 --> 01:34:51,198
nighttime smoke that's another SF can of

2627
01:34:49,359 --> 01:34:52,479
guava Cherry good stuff they got some

2628
01:34:51,198 --> 01:34:55,399
cherry gushers that one's I like that

2629
01:34:52,479 --> 01:34:57,718
one too yeah we got the TC did the TC

2630
01:34:55,399 --> 01:35:01,158
for their cherry gushes super fire I've

2631
01:34:57,719 --> 01:35:03,198
been smoking uh like random gelan lately

2632
01:35:01,158 --> 01:35:05,599
that's been pretty [ __ ] I like Gelade

2633
01:35:03,198 --> 01:35:07,638
I'm super I like Gelade a lot I never

2634
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:10,159
had a phase with it so it's it's not

2635
01:35:07,639 --> 01:35:11,760
it's not new but I never like I never

2636
01:35:10,158 --> 01:35:14,000
had a zip of it I maybe you know hit a

2637
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:15,280
joint here or there how about lemon tree

2638
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:18,800
what's your thoughts on been a while

2639
01:35:15,279 --> 01:35:21,158
since I had lemon tree uh and melonade

2640
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:23,039
the melonade I was a huge fan of melon

2641
01:35:21,158 --> 01:35:25,079
like good melonade grown organic living

2642
01:35:23,039 --> 01:35:28,679
soil melon from can Organics I got them

2643
01:35:25,079 --> 01:35:30,198
to cut and dude that cantaloupe and

2644
01:35:28,679 --> 01:35:32,440
sometimes I get cantaloupe chps with

2645
01:35:30,198 --> 01:35:34,559
good Skittles where you smoke it and it

2646
01:35:32,439 --> 01:35:36,519
tastes like fresh melon okay like

2647
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:38,480
especially uh when they harvest it

2648
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:40,800
around like day 53 and it's like super

2649
01:35:38,479 --> 01:35:42,559
fruity but it's usually not super strong

2650
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:45,360
like that one is just all turs and all

2651
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:46,639
flavor okay and I can I can a big joint

2652
01:35:45,359 --> 01:35:49,000
like that I can sit there and smoke that

2653
01:35:46,639 --> 01:35:50,440
30 40 minutes I'm not super high but it

2654
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:52,600
like it leaves me fulfilled because it

2655
01:35:50,439 --> 01:35:54,479
tasted so good right right it's funny

2656
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:55,880
how that works right

2657
01:35:54,479 --> 01:35:58,638
where where you tast in your teeth where

2658
01:35:55,880 --> 01:36:00,118
it's like yeah a good dab of Skittles

2659
01:35:58,639 --> 01:36:02,719
can do that for me

2660
01:36:00,118 --> 01:36:04,039
too I got some Skittles rosin right now

2661
01:36:02,719 --> 01:36:05,319
I haven't had any good Skittles I

2662
01:36:04,039 --> 01:36:08,359
haven't had any Skittles rosin lately I

2663
01:36:05,319 --> 01:36:12,439
did get some uh Mountain Man melt some

2664
01:36:08,359 --> 01:36:13,920
their kmy yeah that was fire nice there

2665
01:36:12,439 --> 01:36:15,439
I like that because it gave me what I

2666
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:17,079
liked it gave me the gassy but I also

2667
01:36:15,439 --> 01:36:18,439
had that Z background to it I thought

2668
01:36:17,079 --> 01:36:20,840
that was pretty fire you got the little

2669
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:22,238
punch but also the FL exactly yeah I

2670
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:24,079
like the papaya crosses too there's a

2671
01:36:22,238 --> 01:36:27,158
lot of papaya stuff going around that

2672
01:36:24,079 --> 01:36:29,359
smokes amazing in rosin yep it's great

2673
01:36:27,158 --> 01:36:32,399
when I get like I like it when they come

2674
01:36:29,359 --> 01:36:34,839
in hash holes yeah um also it's like

2675
01:36:32,399 --> 01:36:36,559
when you're going to give me I want that

2676
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:38,319

Skittles with your Skittles you can do

2682
01:36:46,238 --> 01:36:49,238
that but I feel like it's in that that

2683
01:36:47,719 --> 01:36:51,239
is complimentary in a different way but

2684
01:36:49,238 --> 01:36:52,638
I feel like using the diversity that's

2685
01:36:51,238 --> 01:36:54,718
the beauty is like blending wine or

2686

the best we were in Hawaii while he was

2700
01:37:21,039 --> 01:37:24,319
winning so it didn't really get the

2701
01:37:22,479 --> 01:37:27,839
attention from us it it it should have

2702
01:37:24,319 --> 01:37:29,759
but right uh he had some of those and if

2703
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:30,960
I wasn't so high I could maybe remember

2704
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:32,480
what the combo was but whatever the

2705
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:35,319
winning combo was and you can look it up

2706
01:37:32,479 --> 01:37:39,079
on his page that was it was such a

2707
01:37:35,319 --> 01:37:42,039
killer combination of two different FL

2708
01:37:39,079 --> 01:37:43,599
like diverse enough to where you're like

2709
01:37:42,039 --> 01:37:45,359
okay you're the first three or four hits

2710

you're like and then that hash starts

2711
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:48,598

01:37:50,479 --> 01:37:56,198
pretty nice yeah good stuff yeah so if

2715
01:37:54,319 --> 01:37:58,359
you had one piece of advice for your

2716
01:37:56,198 --> 01:37:59,919
younger self that was coming up in the

2717
01:37:58,359 --> 01:38:01,079
industry what would that one piece of

2718
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:04,000
advice

2719
01:38:01,079 --> 01:38:06,760
be don't blow all your [ __ ]

2720
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:09,279
money I had so many snowboards and

2721
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:13,280
snowboarding jackets and [ __ ] Jordans

2722
01:38:09,279 --> 01:38:14,479
that I would have rather Sushi dinners

2723
01:38:13,279 --> 01:38:16,439
those were worth it because they were

2724
01:38:14,479 --> 01:38:18,479
community building right I had a homie

2725
01:38:16,439 --> 01:38:22,319
who gave me the best advice that I never

2726
01:38:18,479 --> 01:38:24,879
followed and I kick myself all the time

2727
01:38:22,319 --> 01:38:26,759
he was like T blow all your money on

2728
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:28,840
[ __ ] he's like I know you like

2729
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:31,480
spending money I like spending money

2730
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:32,360
he's like I go buy gold coins they're an

2731
01:38:31,479 --> 01:38:35,559
ounce

2732
01:38:32,359 --> 01:38:38,039
each he's like and this at this time

2733
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:40,280
they were 350 an ounce I remember those

2734
01:38:38,039 --> 01:38:43,319
the same as an ounce of weed he's like

2735
01:38:40,279 --> 01:38:46,000
so one of you know one ounce out of

2736
01:38:43,319 --> 01:38:48,960
every pound you go spend that money and

2737
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:52,399
on a [ __ ] on a gold coin he took me

2738
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:54,039
to his house one day and you might have

2739
01:38:52,399 --> 01:38:54,879
him you might have him your parents

2740
01:38:54,039 --> 01:38:56,479
probably have them they had these

2741
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:58,920
picture books from like the 70s with

2742
01:38:56,479 --> 01:39:01,118
like super colors on the front and like

2743
01:38:58,920 --> 01:39:03,399
had a little spiral plastic thing and

2744
01:39:01,118 --> 01:39:06,559
each page and this dude had a [ __ ]

2745
01:39:03,399 --> 01:39:10,238
gold coin in each one of these things

2746
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:12,639
and we were like 19 or 20 or whatever

2747
01:39:10,238 --> 01:39:15,279
and I don't know when or if he I don't

2748
01:39:12,639 --> 01:39:17,118
talk to him too much I wish I did but I

2749
01:39:15,279 --> 01:39:19,319
don't it was the best piece of advice

2750
01:39:17,118 --> 01:39:21,238
because I don't know if he sold them or

2751
01:39:19,319 --> 01:39:23,198
kept them or did some of both but the

2752
01:39:21,238 --> 01:39:26,959
ones he was buying at 350 and under are

2753
01:39:23,198 --> 01:39:30,238
now what 2,000 2,000 bucks

2754
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:31,719
Z400 right that was the advice I wish I

2755
01:39:30,238 --> 01:39:35,279
would have followed and I wish I

2756
01:39:31,719 --> 01:39:37,158
wouldn't have spent all my money flexing

2757
01:39:35,279 --> 01:39:40,439
yeah cuz that's all it was you know once

2758
01:39:37,158 --> 01:39:42,000
I got my car it had beat and rims and

2759
01:39:40,439 --> 01:39:45,839
tinted windows because I thought I was

2760
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:48,319
[ __ ] cool right and really had I

2761
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:51,480
bought property would have been much

2762
01:39:48,319 --> 01:39:54,359
[ __ ] better Real Estate gold yeah

2763
01:39:51,479 --> 01:39:56,198
gold crypto yeah all these things now

2764
01:39:54,359 --> 01:39:57,799
crypto was like it took me a long time

2765
01:39:56,198 --> 01:39:59,799
to believe in crypto in the first two or

2766
01:39:57,800 --> 01:40:04,920
three times I invested I lost everything

2767
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:06,880
so Doge come back no um but crypto's

2768
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:09,440
wild yeah it took somebody really smart

2769
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:10,960
to half explain how crypto worked now

2770
01:40:09,439 --> 01:40:12,759
was still was like it's still unicorn

2771
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:15,039
money he's like it's basically unicorn

2772
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:16,560
money he's like this if we both agree

2773
01:40:15,039 --> 01:40:18,800
it's a million bucks is a million bucks

2774
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:22,000
and that's kind of basically how crypto

2775
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:26,039
works and I'm like I'm on a super super

2776
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:28,158
basic that's how Mone Works to 100%

2777
01:40:26,039 --> 01:40:30,639
right but we're not taught that as a as

2778
01:40:28,158 --> 01:40:32,638
children you know paper money and coin

2779
01:40:30,639 --> 01:40:34,599
jingle jangle it's that's how you need

2780
01:40:32,639 --> 01:40:36,159
it you need that like you both have to

2781
01:40:34,599 --> 01:40:37,920
agree that it's worth that for it to be

2782
01:40:36,158 --> 01:40:40,799
worth that you know so we're told it's

2783
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:42,158
worth that yeah and it's been but we're

2784
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:43,440
indoctrinated into believing that

2785
01:40:42,158 --> 01:40:45,039
because it's been our whole life way now

2786
01:40:43,439 --> 01:40:47,678
somebody's like I got this new money

2787
01:40:45,039 --> 01:40:49,279
yeah it's 97 digits long and you never

2788
01:40:47,679 --> 01:40:51,239
hold it or it doesn't jingle it doesn't

2789
01:40:49,279 --> 01:40:53,359
fold you'll never see it until you pull

2790
01:40:51,238 --> 01:40:54,519
it out of the bank yeah you know but

2791
01:40:53,359 --> 01:40:56,519
this not I don't know how many [ __ ]

2792
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:58,840
numbers there are you know there's 150

2793
01:40:56,520 --> 01:41:00,719
numbers in your [ __ ] in your Bitcoin

2794
01:40:58,840 --> 01:41:02,560
address whatever it is but yeah this

2795
01:41:00,719 --> 01:41:06,520
this this is your uh this is your money

2796
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:08,520
value right here like you sure but today

2797
01:41:06,520 --> 01:41:10,280
it's worth 500 bucks less than it was

2798
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:11,639
worth yesterday but next week it'll be

2799
01:41:10,279 --> 01:41:14,679
worth 300 bucks

2800
01:41:11,639 --> 01:41:16,599
more okay I got a little bit I lost a

2801
01:41:14,679 --> 01:41:19,039
bunch but I got I you know I got a

2802
01:41:16,599 --> 01:41:21,360
little bit we'll see how that plays out

2803
01:41:19,039 --> 01:41:24,639
I like the I like the precious metals me

2804
01:41:21,359 --> 01:41:27,238
too yeah me too and the gold standard

2805
01:41:24,639 --> 01:41:29,679
may go we may go back to the gold

2806
01:41:27,238 --> 01:41:32,079
standard before too long this is not

2807
01:41:29,679 --> 01:41:33,800
good investing advice but maybe gold

2808
01:41:32,079 --> 01:41:35,479
ounces are worth gold is interesting and

2809
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:38,039
silver is interesting and I think you

2810
01:41:35,479 --> 01:41:39,678
shouldn't just look at working at 9o5

2811
01:41:38,039 --> 01:41:41,880
you should look at Investments I think a

2812
01:41:39,679 --> 01:41:44,279
young thing thing that young people can

2813
01:41:41,880 --> 01:41:46,960
do is look at Investments look at the

2814
01:41:44,279 --> 01:41:48,800
future not just so linear you know it's

2815
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:50,679
like smart man told me the way to be

2816
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:52,039
rich is to make money while you sleep

2817
01:41:50,679 --> 01:41:53,679
yeah figure how to make money while you

2818
01:41:52,039 --> 01:41:56,399
sleep how figure how to make your money

2819
01:41:53,679 --> 01:41:58,639
make money for you yeah whatever you do

2820
01:41:56,399 --> 01:42:01,799
you got to do but you that you're using

2821
01:41:58,639 --> 01:42:04,239
that to be you and probably don't yeah

2822
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:06,360
that's stay out of the canis industry if

2823
01:42:04,238 --> 01:42:07,759
you want to make money I mean it

2824
01:42:06,359 --> 01:42:09,880
technically makes money while you sleep

2825
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:11,719
it's just man one mistake like we talked

2826
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:14,599
about ear curing or [ __ ] drying or

2827
01:42:11,719 --> 01:42:16,520
flushing and it has no value or such a

2828
01:42:14,599 --> 01:42:18,599
little value well the value is the

2829
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:19,840
lesson you learned hopefully yep

2830
01:42:18,599 --> 01:42:22,800
hopefully someone will blast it and I

2831
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:25,159
can get some BH right yeah so it can

2832
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:25,159
pass test

2833
01:42:25,800 --> 01:42:28,760
remediation yeah that's the beauty of

2834
01:42:27,560 --> 01:42:31,560
this world we live in now you can

2835
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:33,760
remediate stuff out of stuff it's wild

2836
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:35,639
but uh if people are trying to find out

2837
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:37,239
more about Turtle pie company and about

2838
01:42:35,639 --> 01:42:38,199
yourself where should they go that's

2839
01:42:37,238 --> 01:42:40,959
actually a beautiful question because

2840
01:42:38,198 --> 01:42:44,479
that's something I want to talk about so

2841
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:47,399
ironically couple of weeks ago we did a

2842
01:42:44,479 --> 01:42:49,439
post about how I was switching my

2843
01:42:47,399 --> 01:42:52,559
posting Philosophy for Instagram because

2844
01:42:49,439 --> 01:42:54,799
of all of the [ __ ] that goes on when I

2845
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:56,320
just post weed like I'm not allowed to

2846
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:58,679
post weed there I've seen they change

2847
01:42:56,319 --> 01:43:00,198
their toou but then you and and they are

2848
01:42:58,679 --> 01:43:02,440
allowed to but then you do and you still

2849
01:43:00,198 --> 01:43:05,118
get dink so I did this post saying my

2850
01:43:02,439 --> 01:43:07,799
new philosophy is just to post content

2851
01:43:05,118 --> 01:43:10,960
or goofy [ __ ] or whatever and not so

2852
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:14,560
much weed porn yeah my my account was

2853
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:16,760
attacked so bad that it probably almost

2854
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:18,360
got shut down like for whatever reason

2855
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:20,199
people took that as a challenge to get

2856
01:43:18,359 --> 01:43:23,279
my [ __ ] shut down if it was people or

2857
01:43:20,198 --> 01:43:24,519
some person like I every every picture

2858
01:43:23,279 --> 01:43:26,000
that was archiv like everything got

2859
01:43:24,520 --> 01:43:29,040
reported and I'm like what the [ __ ] is

2860
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:31,800
going on here and as I've already known

2861
01:43:29,039 --> 01:43:34,519
for years like it's it's an important

2862
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:37,039
tool to have in in the industry that

2863
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:41,040
we're in but we're making a conscious

2864
01:43:37,039 --> 01:43:43,118
move to Twitter X because as disturbing

2865
01:43:41,039 --> 01:43:45,519
as I find a lot of the [ __ ] on that

2866
01:43:43,118 --> 01:43:48,158
platform at least I can post [ __ ]

2867
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:52,320
weed and talk about it and not get my

2868
01:43:48,158 --> 01:43:53,679
account taken down it's it's like I feel

2869
01:43:52,319 --> 01:43:57,960
like I'm

2870
01:43:53,679 --> 01:43:59,480
moving backwards to go forward um and

2871
01:43:57,960 --> 01:44:02,039
like I got my I haven't used Twitter in

2872
01:43:59,479 --> 01:44:03,359
so long like I got my assistant like I

2873
01:44:02,039 --> 01:44:04,800
need you to give me the crash course on

2874
01:44:03,359 --> 01:44:06,598
how to use [ __ ] Twitter and we got to

2875
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:08,480
start posting on it every day and just

2876
01:44:06,599 --> 01:44:11,079
blast weed porn on it and on our

2877
01:44:08,479 --> 01:44:13,479
Instagram I want to [ __ ] want to see

2878
01:44:11,079 --> 01:44:15,238
our new strain follow us on Twitter you

2879
01:44:13,479 --> 01:44:18,439
know what I mean because I don't feel

2880
01:44:15,238 --> 01:44:20,279
comfortable right posting what I feel

2881
01:44:18,439 --> 01:44:22,638
like we should be able to post at this

2882
01:44:20,279 --> 01:44:24,559
time yeah I I I don't use certain words

2883
01:44:22,639 --> 01:44:27,239
we have for a long time we don't use

2884
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:29,639
drop or [ __ ] coming soon like we

2885
01:44:27,238 --> 01:44:31,319
don't imply that it's for sale we don't

2886
01:44:29,639 --> 01:44:33,719
expressly imply that it's for sale

2887
01:44:31,319 --> 01:44:35,399
clearly it's for sale it's a commodity

2888
01:44:33,719 --> 01:44:37,158
it's a legal commodity especially in the

2889
01:44:35,399 --> 01:44:40,879
state of California and [ __ ] damn

2890
