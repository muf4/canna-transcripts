20
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,559
those great artists at the Cannabis Cup

21
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,280
too man so you know you were part of

22
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:54,280
High Times there you were in deep there

23
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,558
during the Cannabis Cup during the

24
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,480
Golden Age of cannabis cups I should say

25
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:01,439
those were amazing times man really good

26
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:03,078
times uh yeah it's it's changed a lot

27
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,518
the whole the whole world's changed a

28
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:06,920
lot since back then well you know for

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,320
you know especially for High Times I

30
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,719
mean this I been talk about this just

31
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:13,118
you know former colleagues and I think

32
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:14,920
you know one of the real problems is for

33
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:17,599
High Times is that you know the outlaw

34
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,079
Edge is gone you know it's you know

35
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,879
cannabis is becoming more and more

36
00:01:19,078 --> 00:01:24,438
mainstream so what is High Times now you

37
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:28,519
know protesting against it used to be a

38
00:01:24,438 --> 00:01:30,559
very very uh definite opposition to

39
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:33,039
government control and and way that's

40
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,439
what High Times was High Times motto was

41
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,200
you know like do what the hell you want

42
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:38,879
as long you don't hurt anybody and the

43
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:42,520
hell with anybody else you know [ __ ] him

44
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:46,959
you know it's that was High Times so you

45
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:49,560
know the whole cannabis thing uh has

46
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,319
kind of changed High Times a bit I think

47
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,478
theyve made some real poor decisions in

48
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:55,879
the last few years and the publishing

49
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:58,920
industry has certainly been a problem

50
00:01:55,879 --> 00:02:01,118
because do you see magazines anywhere

51
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,359
anywhere any anymore except the dentist

52
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:05,879
office possibly so um yeah it's uh

53
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:07,519
Everything's changed in the industry as

54
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:10,919
far as media is concerned there are a

55
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:12,598
lot of pot magazines out there and uh I

56
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,839
can't really say a lot of good things

57
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:16,318
about them they seem to be covering

58
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,878
their advertisers for the most part um

59
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:20,238
and they're kind of boring they're

60
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:22,479
they're great for rolling on um but uh

61
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:26,800
you know I can't really get real excited

62
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:28,759
about canabus media these days certainly

63
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,680
um you know there are a lot of corporate

64
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:33,878
entities now in the business and uh you

65
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,000
know you want to cover these people fine

66
00:02:33,878 --> 00:02:38,120
but right well you used to have to have

67
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,598
some balls to be involved in cannabis I

68
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,319
mean even on the the media side to do an

69
00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:43,639
event you had to have some balls to go

70
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:45,000
out there and try to do an event because

71
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:47,199
they wouldn't always allow you to do it

72
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,680
even if you'd planned and paid for

73
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:51,479
permits sometimes you we got raid you

74
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,920
know I remember Cannabis Cup I guess it

75
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:56,399
was I can't remember maybe 2011 2012 in

76
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:58,958
Amsterdam we had 150 cops come in raid

77
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,879
and raid the Cannabis Cup oh yeah um

78
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,598
seriously it was it was Unreal it was

79
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:05,759
you know they thought a drug Park was

80
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,598
going on which a drug Park in in Europe

81
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,079
is you know where people are doing meth

82
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:11,598
and they're doing shooting up and stuff

83
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,159
like that but you know then we listen

84
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:14,719
the one thing that people don't realize

85
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:17,359
a lot of people who are newcomers to

86
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:20,039
cannabis the Johnny come lately that

87
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,239
cannabis was very very dangerous to deal

88
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:23,439
with and a lot of people went to jail a

89
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,000
lot of people had their families broken

90
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:29,239
up had their property taken via the

91
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,598
these Draconian uh Rico laws does

92
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:34,920
forfeit laws I should say um you know

93
00:03:32,598 --> 00:03:36,959
terrible stuff happened so I think when

94
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:39,559
people you know these days don't

95
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,438
understand that the industry stands on

96
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,560
the shoulders of these people the

97
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:45,799
entrepreneurs The Growers the dealers

98
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,640
who kept this plant alive and believe me

99
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:49,239
it was dangerous during the Reagan Bush

100
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:50,839
administrations it was downright

101
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:53,158
dangerous and Clinton was no better by

102
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,079
the way and Obama wasn't even better I

103
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:57,719
mean we there was a lot of persecution

104
00:03:55,079 --> 00:04:01,079
for pot the War on Drugs has been a war

105
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:03,039
on pot why because meth is dangerous and

106
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:04,360
heroin is dangerous and cocaine is

107
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:05,479
dangerous I should say the people who

108
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,239
are dealing with that stuff they're

109
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:09,399
dangerous people but pop people are

110
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:11,480
pretty peaceful and so you got a grow

111
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,879
room you you know the the cops come in

112
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:14,840
they seize everything seize your

113
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:16,478
property break up your family it's a

114
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,639
hell of a lot easier the dealing with me

115
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:21,439
with meth dealers the War on Drugs has

116
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:24,720
been a war on cannabis

117
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:26,000
period yeah from from the beginning from

118
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,600
the beginning from the beginning that's

119
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,959
what it's all about you know when

120
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,919
Richard Nixon declared the War on Drugs

121
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:33,519
he was holding up a pound of pot okay he

122
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:36,799
wasn't holding up needles or anything

123
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:38,680
like that right so you know it's it it

124
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,720
was also war on hippies you know I mean

125
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,120
it was a war on counterculture it was it

126
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,759
was more than just drugs you know sure

127
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,399
was it sure was you know people have

128
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:47,720
pointed out to me that you realize

129
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:51,399
around

130
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:54,039
7879 you know disco got real popular and

131
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:56,038
you know these you know polyester shirts

132
00:04:54,038 --> 00:04:58,319
and you know looking like a disco guy

133
00:04:56,038 --> 00:05:00,399
really became the popular thing it was

134
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:03,000
like you it seemed to be this Insidious

135
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:04,839
war on hippie culture because suddenly

136
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,800
you have this manufactured music it's

137
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:08,839
not rock and roll and you have John

138
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,520
trola dancing around in tight pants

139
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:13,839
suddenly I what the hell happened to the

140
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:16,159
culture you know seriously because the

141
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:18,198
60s and 70s man it was all about you

142
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,160
know hippie and you know the great rock

143
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:22,120
groups of those times things changed man

144
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,360
they really

145
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,280
did yeah I believe it um so let's go

146
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,160
back into your history a little bit and

147
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:32,198
start talking about uh your experiences

148
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,400
with cannabis from the beginning where

149
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:35,680
did it all start you know my my

150
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:38,359
experience from the beginning I mean I

151
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:42,280
went to University of Michigan um uh

152
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:44,000
1975 and Ann Arbor Michigan is was the

153
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:46,279
most liberal place for pot in the

154
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,600
country period it was a $5 desk

155
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:49,478
appearance ticket if you were walking

156
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,879
down the street smoking a joint if you

157
00:05:49,478 --> 00:05:55,839
had an outs it was only a $25 F and

158
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:58,719
those these laws predated the

159
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:00,279
legalization by decades so that's where

160
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,840
I went to school and I experienced some

161
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:03,439
of the greatest pot ever I mean I had

162
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:04,839
some wak I remember one time it just

163
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:07,079
blew my mind I thought I was having an

164
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:08,839
anxiety attack this stuff Mr been just

165
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:10,560

celebrities and people in the Cannabis

228
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,840
industry who are really leaders who were

229
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:32,079
doing their thing you know on The Sly

230
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:33,759
and Loud seeds was one of them you know

231
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,560
when I've visiting you in San Francisco

232
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:37,718
things were still you had to keep things

233
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:40,679
undercover you know it was still a very

234
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:42,399
very dicey Arrangement so when I visited

235
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:44,359
you and you know toured your Grow rooms

236
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,759
with you we drove down to La together

237
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,159
there was pot being delivered down there

238
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:50,080
to a dispensary you know it was

239
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:52,240
different times that's only 10 years ago

240
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,278
man so when people say that they're

241
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:59,240
Pioneers or that they've you know forged

242
00:08:55,278 --> 00:09:01,679
a path on their own I I ain't buying it

243
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,560
I know what people went through I know

244
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:06,039
what the work had to be done by the

245
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:07,799
activists the entrepreneurs the dealers

246
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:11,439
and The Growers the people kept this

247
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:13,599
plant alive while it was being you know

248
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,200
vilified by the government right

249
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,120
Generations before me I mean I'm

250
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,079
standing on the the shoulders of giants

251
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,600
in the in the breeding world the

252
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:23,519
cultivation cannabis people like you

253
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,079
that you know believed in the industry

254
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,200
that you know tried to make a difference

255
00:09:26,078 --> 00:09:29,479
yeah well I think I think we all did I

256
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,560
mean I think we realized we were

257
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,000
involved in I think that was the

258
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:34,359
exciting thing about being with High

259
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,159
Times truly was just the fact that we

260
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,440
felt like we were we were on a mission

261
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:41,000
of some sort we weren't doing People

262
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:43,640
magazine or you know a food magazine we

263
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,360
were doing cannabis and it was dangerous

264
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:48,120
and believe me the Government tried to

265
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,240
stop uh shut down my times a couple

266
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:54,200
times first with green Merchant in the

267
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,799
early 90s when they actually subed UPS's

268
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,360
records to find out who was buying

269
00:09:55,799 --> 00:10:01,278
hydroponic equipment that was a you know

270
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,079
a war on you on on Growers they were

271
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:04,958
going after them you see if you you know

272
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:06,439
ordered hydroponic equipment you might

273
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,679
have the DEA showing up your door and

274
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,800
say can we see what you're doing with

275
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:13,439
that stuff that's how bad it was and

276
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:16,199
then of course in 2003 2004 operation uh

277
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,880
Head Hunter and operation pipe dreams

278
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,440
when they went after the the bong

279
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:22,078
industry they tried to go after our

280
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,880
advertising we had very very heavy

281
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:25,439
advertising High Times at that point in

282
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:29,399
the glass industry we were getting tons

283
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,720
of glass ads bongs were huge and uh so

284
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:34,360
they went after it and they arrested 57

285
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:36,839
people for shipping bongs and

286
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,959
paraphernalia over state lines they they

287
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:41,399
so they busted 57 people including Tommy

288
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:42,879
Chong Tommy Chong was the only one of

289
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:45,320
that group that went to prison he went

290
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:48,879
to prison for 10 months for selling for

291
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:52,639
for manufacturing a bong that was not

292
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:55,320
that long ago folks that was like 2005

293
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:57,000
so it's dangerous it was dangerous and a

294
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,720
lot of the country it remains very

295
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,958
dangerous yeah it's a strange thing in

296
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,720
the stigma is slowly changing I mean I

297
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:04,638
see it with the older generations and

298
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,519
also the the younger Generations like

299
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:09,519
myself that are getting older um you

300
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,959
know the there's a lot of people in the

301
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,759
United States that have tried cannabis

302
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:15,399
on some level whether it's an edible or

303
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:17,958
a joint or whatever whether it's high

304
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:20,078
school but I think the the stigma is

305
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:21,159
changing I think especially in places

306
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:24,479
like

307
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:25,838
California uh New York you know we have

308
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,278
this area in the the center of the

309
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,200
country where slowly but but even look

310
00:11:28,278 --> 00:11:33,278
at look at Oklahoma I mean Oklahoma's

311
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:35,040
changing Texas is changing so I know but

312
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:37,480
there are a lot of you know the the deep

313
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:40,159
deep south States Alabama Mississippi

314
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,920
yeah are that are they not uh friendly

315
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,199
to marijuana at all I mean you you're

316
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:44,719

Nebraska ain't so cool either that's

318
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,160
always the weird thing when you're in

319
00:11:46,278 --> 00:11:52,278
Colorado you have a choice of Nebraska

320

or Kansas those both border Colorado and

321
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:57,000
they're very very tough States on

322
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,600
marijuana you know I've heard of often

323
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,240
of people crossing state lines in

324
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,120
Colorado of going into Kansas and the

325
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,560
cops are just waiting you know you got

326
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,039

they're going to pull you over find out

328

00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:16,679
put a lot of people you know a lot of

334
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,760
people made money off the war on of

335
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:21,319
drugs you know prosecutors uh States you

336
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:23,399
know all the revenue people had to pay

337
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,920
court costs all that kind of stuff you

338
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:27,278
know and of course you know we

339
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:29,679
incarcerated Millions the United States

340
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:32,838
has the most people in prison in the

341
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:34,599
world we imprison people for everything

342
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:35,959
now I know granted there are a lot of

343
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,240
bad people you know who should be in

344
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,799
prison and I don't know if there's an

345
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,680
alternative I mean I've heard people

346
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:42,679
talk about you know are there

347
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:44,399
alternatives to prison and that's a

348
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,919
really really difficult question I

349
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,799
remember interviewing this woman named

350
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:51,479
Maya shenir an attorney in Chicago in

351
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:55,278
the in high times and she said you know

352
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:57,440
listen it uh prison evolves I mean you

353
00:12:55,278 --> 00:13:00,198
know people used to put people in Chains

354
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,440
we don't do that anymore you know so I

355
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:04,000
don't know in many ways I think we're

356
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,120
still a very primitive society as far as

357
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,519
how we treat people who uh disobey the

358
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,959
law you know especially when it comes to

359
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:15,600
drugs and uh our our treatment of people

360
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,479
who have addiction compared to places

361
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,240
like Norway compared to countries like

362
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:23,959
Norway and and Portugal and people

363
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,480
addiction especially 100% agreed yeah I

364
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:27,078
mean this is the thing these people I

365
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,879
remember kind I remember were

366
00:13:27,078 --> 00:13:30,599
discussions like this on and talk shows

367
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:31,958
back in the 70s honest to God talking

368
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,360
about why are we treating people with

369
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:35,638
addictions like this why are we putting

370
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,120
them in jail why are we treating them

371
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:40,240
isn't it cheaper to do this you know

372
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:42,198
maybe someday I don't know we we are

373
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,759
like I say the United States I mean we

374
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:45,399
always talk about how great a country we

375
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:47,480
are and stuff but I tell you it just

376
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:50,600
drives me crazy the

377
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:52,839
stupidity of of of our politicians and

378
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:55,560
it's all policy driven you know you know

379
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:57,360
cow Towing to their Pary uh leaders and

380
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:59,838
so forth I mean everybody's on the same

381
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,560
page as far as nobody nothing changes to

382
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,600
get people to actually come out and you

383
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:06,078
know use their backbone to support

384
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,879
something that makes sense you know all

385
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:09,838
suddenly they're a Maverick or a rebel I

386
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:11,519
mean we're talking common sense is

387
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,000
completely bizarre in this country these

388
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,159
days common sense is not so common but

389
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,360
you know it's

390
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:20,000
just it's so Money Motivated and and a

391
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,720
lot of it's motivated by greed as well

392
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,078
unfortunately and you know I don't I

393
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,879
don't even know what the answers are

394
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:27,679
we're in a difficult time right now I I

395
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:30,120
have to agree with with with our

396
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:32,399
political landscape and so forth I think

397
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,198
if people you smoked a little more pot I

398
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,519
think everybody would calm down a bit I

399
00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:38,679
mean if you know you see what happened

400
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,240
at Woodstock 1969 everybody's smoking

401
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:43,599
pot nobody's doing you know hard drugs

402
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,000
except for a fool a few fools um and

403
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,800
were there any fights were there any you

404
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,120
know any you know riots or anything like

405
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:52,000
that no I you ask

406
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,480
cops they go to an event and it's a POS

407
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,879
smoking event they know that nothing's

408
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,399
going to happen you know right if you go

409
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:59,480

410
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:01,078

into somebody man you can lose your life

415
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:13,198
seriously how many times have we seen

416
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:15,320
fights in the stands of uh sporting

417
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:17,000
events and me it's all it's all

418
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:20,000
motivated by drinking I mean people get

419
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,198
beer muscles I mean but people don't get

420
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,078
cannabis muscles they don't want to

421
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:26,039
start fighting you you know after they

422
00:15:23,078 --> 00:15:27,919

company that was the people causing all

424
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:30,799
the problems were the people drinking

425
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,000
alcohol you weren't seeing the Stoners

426
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:34,278
the people eating psychedelics pushing

427
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,839
and shoving there was a little pushing

428
00:15:34,278 --> 00:15:38,838
and shoving going on at the second the

429
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:40,680
last night at dead company in San

430
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,920
Francisco but let's talk about some High

431
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:45,799
Times photography one of my favorite

432
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:47,599
covers of all time I have a bunch of

433
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:49,719
them but I and I still have I still have

434
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,399
my magazines believe it or not but uh

435
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,839
one of them was the chocolate box they

436
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:57,039
had the different hash it CH the box

437
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:59,120
that was my I I I had a very short rate

438
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,519
as cultivation editor not knowing

439
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,839
anything about cultivation I they

440
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:04,839
actually made me editor for a year but

441
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:06,959
uh yeah that was my first cover uh that

442
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:09,440
was BC bud and I was covering BC butt up

443
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:11,518
in Canada and it was a Valentine's Day

444
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,560
cover and I remember I showed that cover

445
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,839
to some people um down in Arizona and

446
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:18,599
they had a daughter who was uh who was

447
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:21,720
somewhat autistic and she saw the

448
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,440
magazine and came over and tried to grab

449
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,480
some of the chocolate off the cover

450
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,079
which were

451
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:30,639
buds pretty realistic looking covers

452
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:32,758
that was like February 95 I'm going to

453
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,278
guess yeah February 95 that sounds about

454
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:37,600
right I remember seeing there was some

455
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:39,278
green hash and I I was so excited to try

456
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,360
green hash until I tried it for the

457
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:42,799
first time yeah excited for years I

458
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,560
don't think I it was probably two or

459
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:47,479
three years before I found some green

460
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:49,278
hash paid a bunch of money for it and it

461
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,319
was the worst tasting hash I'd ever

462
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:53,600
tasted

463
00:16:51,318 --> 00:16:56,078
so you can't believe everything that was

464
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,440
in High Times believe me

465
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:59,758
totally so as far as other photog

466
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,880
photography that you've done for High

467
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,640
Times magazine covers Centerfolds this

468
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:06,640
you know the centerfolds it was like uh

469
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,799
Playboy magazine for weed is kind of

470
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,199
what High Times was back in the day well

471
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:12,720
I think that's the way it was conceived

472
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:14,798
James yeah um it was to be a kind of

473
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,519
like a a parody of High Times magazine

474
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:18,798
of Playboy Magazine with with a

475
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:20,480
centerfold yeah I was really thrilled to

476
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:24,240
be able to shoot as many centerfols as I

477
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:26,640
did I think I shot 35 covers uh in all

478
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,439
that includes hemp times and high times

479
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,280
so I I you know I get to shooting

480
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:35,480
incredible stuff um you know I got you

481
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:37,000
know shot buds shot people shot models

482
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,038
you know it was it was great having

483
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,798
control of the cover um was was

484
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:42,798
wonderful I when you get a cover that's

485
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:44,639
like that's you know you've hit the you

486
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:46,879

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,600
shooting for the covers always always

489
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,640
always because you know it's it's it's a

490
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:55,199
huge rush to see your your image on the

491
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,960
cover I remember you know there are

492
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,000
sometimes that you know you things go

493
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,440
great I mean I remember we we shot Kevin

494
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,079
Smith on the cover and the art director

495
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,798
Frank Max put Jason Muse on his shoulder

496
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:07,359
so it looked like he you know a devil on

497
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:10,759
the shoulder like that and so it hit

498
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:13,199
news stands right as 911 happened and so

499
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:14,919
it died on the news stands nobody was

500
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,640
buying magazines then maybe some news

501
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:18,799
magazines and stuff so that was very

502
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,280
very disappointing and then I remember

503
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:23,038
one year we were have we were limping

504
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:24,519
along toward the end of the year and uh

505
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:26,558
you know not not really the our covers

506
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:29,158
were not selling you like two or three

507
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:31,918
you know bombs in a row and I shot Jenna

508
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:34,720
Jameson for the cover the uh the porn

509
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:37,360
queen and I went to her house in Arizona

510
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,558
and shot this this cover of her and we

511
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:43,359
ended the year on a bang no no no no pun

512
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:45,960
intended um but it was amazing I mean

513
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:47,479
the thing sold off the hook and not not

514
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,079
necessarily saved the year I mean High

515
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,159
Times always did well but certainly made

516
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:53,759
the owners extremely happy that they

517
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:57,880
ended the the year with a huge huge

518
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:59,480
paycheck so you know we we we turned in

519
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:02,640
some cover that were selling in the

520
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:04,558
hundreds of thousands um back then um

521
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,679
there were some bad bad decisions made

522
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:10,440
in 2003 they decided to take the pot out

523
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,320
of the magazine this honestly happened

524
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,960
they brought in John Buffalo maor who

525
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:16,720
was the son of the author Norman mailer

526
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,720
and another man named Richard Stratton

527
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,600
who was a Hollywood writer who had spent

528
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,279
some time in jail for hash smuggling and

529
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:25,079
they brought them in and they decided to

530
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:28,639
make it an outlaw Vanity Fair if you

531
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:31,119
will and the readers roundly rejected

532
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,159
within a few months High Times was on

533
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:35,279
his deathbed that is not an exaggeration

534
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:38,080
so the owners decided that they admitted

535
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:40,558
a mistake we rushed back to cannabis and

536
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:42,119
save the magazine and you know the best

537
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:43,720
part of that you know because the

538
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:45,959
publishing industry has been you know

539
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,880
dwindling for years the best part of all

540
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:51,360
that was that we decided to finally

541
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:53,760
bring a Cannabis Cup to uh America in

542
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:55,759
2010 the San Francisco cup that was our

543
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:57,720
first one and we realized we had

544
00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:01,319
something so we entered a absolutely

545
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:05,079
golden era of High Times from 2010 to

546
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:07,119
2015 our cups were just tremendous you

547
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:09,158
know in Denver I think our the fifth cup

548
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:11,359
we had there we had 40,000 people show

549
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:13,919
up over a three-day weekend I mean we

550
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:16,439
had you know just so it was while the

551
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,919
publish industry was dwindling and you

552
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,440
know was really struggling and magazines

553
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,919
were closing High Times was still

554
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:25,200
holding firm you know so uh yeah so I

555
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:27,280
was with High Times till

556
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,159
2017 and you know I think they've made

557
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:33,480
some very very questionable decisions in

558
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:36,320
the last few years um you they they uh

559
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:39,319
you know they have massive debt they've

560
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:41,798
had five CEOs since I left five

561
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:44,279
different CEOs which doesn't really bold

562
00:20:41,798 --> 00:20:46,158
well for a company and uh and apparently

563
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:49,359
they have massive debt which is uh

564
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:51,480
coming due in September so you know I I

565
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:53,599
don't know um I would hate to see High

566
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:56,240
Times go you know Wonderful magazine you

567
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:58,959
know certainly a huge part of my life

568
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,159
but uh who knows you know cannabis media

569
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,880
is a very very dicey things these days

570
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:04,480
yeah and I don't know if I'd be here in

571
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,760
the same place that I'm in without High

572
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:10,000
Times magazine winning the Cup in 2012

573
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:13,000
was a big big deal for me and my brand

574
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,200
and yeah my my friends and you know all

575
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,480
all the people around us that were

576
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,960
growing our genetics and I think we held

577
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,480
our genetics a little close we didn't

578
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,880
want them to get out as much so you know

579
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,440
I've made mistakes along the way but

580
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:27,120
High Times was definitely pivotal for us

581
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,880
when we first won in 2012 we had no idea

582
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:31,199
that we were going to win cuz I'd lost a

583
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,960
couple I lost in Seattle entering some

584
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,319
extract we we' done some stuff and we

585
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,880
went to Amsterdam thinking we were just

586
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:40,038
going to have a good time and then you

587
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,240
know we had uh Cali Connection right

588
00:21:40,038 --> 00:21:44,319
across from us with swerve in his 40 or

589
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,400
50 foot long booth that was like 20 feet

590
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:47,678
in the air and we're like oh man these

591
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,400
guys know how to do it we had a little

592
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,759
10 by 10 and we ended up winning the cup

593
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,960
it was pretty wild I love that with we

594
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:54,359
always love that when that happened

595
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,278
because you know the greenhouse and

596
00:21:54,359 --> 00:22:00,000
Barney always had these huge booths you

597
00:21:57,278 --> 00:22:01,960
know and C connection too but you know

598
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,038
it did happen a few times when DNA first

599
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:06,360
showed up they had a tiny little booth

600
00:22:04,038 --> 00:22:08,480
at the Sugar Shack in amstr a tiny

601
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:10,000
little booth and they took you know I I

602
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,599
I forget what it was I think it was for

603
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,519
CH Chou chalou you know and they they

604
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:17,558
you know just it was great it it just

605
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:19,200
absolutely uh put them on the map you

606
00:22:17,558 --> 00:22:21,079
know Arian from the greenhouse wanted

607
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,798
their strain immediately and I'm sure

608
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:24,359
you've had dealings with these guys too

609
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:27,038
when you're a winner they want their

610
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:29,759
strain your strain in their coffee shop

611
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:32,200
for you know so so yeah winning the cup

612
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:33,359
of the strain is a is a huge huge thing

613
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,159
you know it's a shame we haven't had a

614
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:37,359
cup there in years though I mean good

615
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:39,760
Lord like seven eight nine years since

616
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:42,000
we've had an Amsterdam cup um and they

617
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:43,200
were I'll tell you that was the most fun

618
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,960
I think I've ever had in the Cannabis

619
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,038
industry on a regular you know yearly

620
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,480
basis because you know it really gave

621
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:51,759
Americans a feeling of what real freedom

622
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:55,079
is I mean I remember the first time I

623
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:57,319
was at the C 1995 and I was there in the

624
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:59,119
greenhouse and I'm smoking a joint in

625
00:22:57,319 --> 00:23:01,960
the window of the coffee shop having a

626
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:04,519
cup of coffee I said what is you know

627
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,480
what is why is this so forbidden this is

628
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:09,240
the most natural thing in the world you

629
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,519
know just enjoying you know an evening

630
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,159
you know I it's wonderful now that of

631
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:16,240
course Amsterdam has got you know he's

632
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:17,760
getting a little bit more uh uh they're

633
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,558
getting a little bit more strict oh yeah

634
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:21,158
about no smoking on the streets they

635
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:23,678
still have the coffee shops but even the

636
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:25,480
amount of coffee shops compared to back

637
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,559
10 years ago there's a less than a

638
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,159
quarter of the amount of coffee shops

639
00:23:27,558 --> 00:23:30,918
there been real Crackdown you know

640
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:33,240
they're trying to you know like they

641
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:35,278
don't want Amsterdam any longer to have

642
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,599
this image of like an any anything goes

643
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:39,640
town with a red light district and you

644
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:41,558
know buying psychedelics over the uh

645
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,640
over the counter and you know buying

646
00:23:41,558 --> 00:23:45,319
seeds and stuff they want to soften they

647
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,440
want to they want to make their their

648
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:49,278
their image a little bit more

649
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:51,000
respectable it seems that's seems to

650
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:52,400
seems to be what's happening there well

651
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,720
and it's really unfortunate CU that's

652
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,159
one of the most beautiful things about

653
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,319
Amsterdam is you can go there and be

654
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:58,960
yourself and get whatever you want and

655
00:23:57,319 --> 00:23:59,960
you know you you want to smoke whatever

656
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,640
you want to you want to take some

657
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:05,600
psychedelics you want to go visit s s

658
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:07,520
s's I I just talked to him the other day

659
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:08,879
he was he's sick in the hospital and now

660
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:11,158
he's out of the hospital and I think

661
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,760
he's doing he's he's in a good mood

662
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:15,200
that's for sure yeah so s's a a real

663
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:17,079
character I mean i' I've known him for

664
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,240
years uh I've photographed him and

665
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:21,240
interviewed him for High Times uh you

666
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,400
know he's very interesting guy very very

667
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,038
strange you know odd background he's had

668
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,720
some heart problems I remember he pulled

669
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:29,480
up his shirt in one of the gam gups to

670
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,960
show his uh you know bypass scar down

671
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:34,640
the middle of his chest oh yeah that's

672
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:36,440
that's s for you yeah but he's a you

673
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,000
know he was a cohort of Jack hair I

674
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,360
remember you know before they went over

675
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,359
to the cup in 1995 I remember s and Jack

676
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:46,359
were just smoking up the the entire

677
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:48,359
office I mean just all day long so it

678
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:50,959
was wonderful I mean every time we'd go

679
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:53,918
back we'd uh go back and uh you know

680
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,679
talk to him and stuff like that uh and

681
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,520
jack it was it was a great great couple

682
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,320
days before the Cannabis c yeah good

683
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:02,639
time so yeah and then Steve hagger he

684
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:04,119
started the Cannabis Cup and then his

685
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,960
last year was I think

686
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:10,639
2012 the the year I won and that kind of

687
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,360
changed the vibe yeah Steve uh did did a

688
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,679
wonderful job inventing the Cannabis Cup

689
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:17,639
and I think I think uh I think the

690
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:19,159
people who started working the cup after

691
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,720
that probably did a better job of just

692
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:25,000
making it a more uh marketable

693
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:26,558
experience for everybody um you know I'm

694
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,880
not taking anything away from Steve

695
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:31,599
Steve didn't have much to do with the

696
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:33,840
Cannabis cups after 2008 or so I mean he

697
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:36,879
wasn't in the organizing of things right

698
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:39,558
so high times is and the Cannabis cups

699
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:42,399
are are synonymous and I and everybody's

700
00:25:39,558 --> 00:25:44,720
taking their queue from High Times uh

701
00:25:42,398 --> 00:25:47,558
and and our events uh throughout the

702
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:50,360
country we had tremendous success with

703
00:25:47,558 --> 00:25:52,599
our cups and I I don't see that same

704
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:54,199
success happening at this point I mean

705
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:55,599
now now there's all these there's all

706
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,159
these other events too you know what I

707
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:59,038
mean and emerald cup has kind of been

708
00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:00,919
around but now Emerald cup is this big

709
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:03,798
production and it was never like that it

710
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:06,640
was very underground and and you know

711
00:26:03,798 --> 00:26:08,519
very it wasn't private but it was yeah

712
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,159
there's there's money to be made James I

713
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:13,079
think that's why sure and spannabis is

714
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:15,278
still amazing I mean I like spannabis

715
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:17,678
it's a great event that's kind of turned

716
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:20,200
into for a lot of us that's like how

717
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,000
fish is to the Grateful Dead you know we

718
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,519
we end up at spannabis every year seeing

719
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,359
the same people that we saw at cups and

720
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:26,918
we've seen at cups for a long time you

721
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:29,319
know you're I think Europe sensibility

722
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:32,000
Geor gab is is very very unlike Americas

723
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:35,158
so uh you know just more cultured you

724
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,720
know we have a little bit too much uh

725
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:38,960
you you know how America is this

726
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,000
capitalism you know cannabis capitalism

727
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,558
right and you know it's really caused

728
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
problems California hasn't brought in

729
00:26:43,558 --> 00:26:46,639
the revenue that they thought they would

730
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,359
New York doesn't seem to be doing too

731
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:52,360
well either I mean legal Canabis has

732
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:54,798
been uh not a you know a great success

733
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:56,439
so far um as far as what the states

734
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:59,519
thought they were going to bring in and

735
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:01,480
the black market is a l well so my

736
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:03,240
favorite issue when I was a kid not my

737
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,079
favorite photograph but my favorite

738
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,240
issue was the million-dollar growroom

739
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:09,240
and I think there was something about

740
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,960
ecstasy in it but that was like my

741
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,720
favorite when I read a million dooll gr

742
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,159
room and then I was actually featured in

743
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,519
the the next million dollar grow room in

744
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:19,120
10 years later now I'm trying to get

745
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:21,398
somebody to do the billion dollar grow

746
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:24,278
room I think that's the next

747
00:27:21,398 --> 00:27:26,359
thing I've seen some big big Grow rooms

748
00:27:24,278 --> 00:27:28,519
I mean in Colorado I they they they

749
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:30,798
started using all these indust pars for

750
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:32,519
for cannabis out near the airport those

751
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:35,119
were the biggest Grow rooms I have ever

752
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:37,278
seen it was like an acre of pot I mean

753
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:38,639
just unbelievable stuff and I'm sure

754
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:40,480
that there are bigger Grow rooms like

755
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,600
that right now I mean if you think about

756
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,200
Holland and all the flowers they grow

757
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:46,359
and all the green houses that are just

758
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,319
lined up for Acres I mean this can be

759
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:50,079
done very very easily in the US and

760
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:51,879
Canada you know I think we're going you

761
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:54,798
know I would love to see a billion

762
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:56,080
dollar grow room I I I those are the

763
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,960
kind of things that you know that we

764
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:59,639
brought to High Times you know after a

765
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,798
while it became a you know like okay

766
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,679
we've seen it we've seen it before but

767
00:28:00,798 --> 00:28:04,319
when it first started happening it was

768
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:06,240
great it really was when we started

769
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:08,678
seeing the the big giant grou was people

770
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,960
like seeing that but then there was also

771
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:14,240
that underlying feeling like is this the

772
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:16,079
where we wanted the pot thing to go I

773
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,720
mean I still would you know I'm still

774
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:20,639
very much like Jack her I I I'd like to

775
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,759
see just like growing everywhere and you

776
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,278
know have v stands you know sell right

777
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:26,200
along with tomatoes I mean I hate all

778
00:28:24,278 --> 00:28:27,640
the regulations and that's what I made

779
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,960
High Times great was because we always

780
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:31,200
encourage people you know grow your own

781
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,000
grow your own grow your own right

782
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,759
totally yeah and I mean I I like I like

783
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,440
the boutique cannabis and I like the the

784
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:41,038
micro Brewery model for cannabis I think

785
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,798
there's definitely that's got a future

786
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:44,319
it's not going to be like how alcohol

787
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:46,278
was where there was just four big

788
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:48,720
companies it's going to be a lot

789
00:28:46,278 --> 00:28:51,798
different I I at least that's what I I

790
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:55,960
hope and I expect for the industry but I

791
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:57,519
also see these uh smaller businesses if

792
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,319
you're a kid coming in the industry when

793
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:01,319
I was 14 I started smoking but if you

794
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:03,079
look at you want something for those

795
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:04,480
kids to look up to it's not going to be

796
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:05,839
like they're going to you know the

797
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,440
average kid is going to be able to

798
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:09,798
afford a multi-million dollar business

799
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,759
but that's who's to say that he can't

800
00:29:09,798 --> 00:29:14,558
grow really good cannabis and eventually

801
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:18,158
build himself into a nice Boutique

802
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:19,359
cannabis brand well you know I think you

803
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,840
know like anything there's room for

804
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:22,439
everybody in this business if you do

805
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:24,558
your job well if you if you're a good

806
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,960
grower if you handle your business

807
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:29,359
responsibly and you know I deal with you

808
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,319
know similarly honest people I think you

809
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:33,479
can do very very well it's just you know

810
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:35,639
it's you know regardless of the

811
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,640
corporate in the influx of corporate

812
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:41,240
people I think you can still you know

813
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:43,120
create your own uh entity as you did

814
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:45,480
James I mean you obviously you know you

815
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:47,038
had a head start because uh you know you

816
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,079
were laying the ground work in it's very

817
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:50,278
very underground fashion but you know

818
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:51,960
now when you're able to come out of the

819
00:29:50,278 --> 00:29:53,599
closet you've already you know you

820
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:56,919
you've laid the foundation you're ready

821
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:58,639
to go so laying the foundation you know

822
00:29:56,919 --> 00:30:00,519
what you did you know it takes years it

823
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,919
takes years but if you want to get

824
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:04,960
involved in the Cannabis industry this

825
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,519
is that's what it takes it takes years

826
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,880
and for the most part with everything it

827
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:10,599
takes years I mean it's just it's you

828
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,278
want to you know some people have a

829
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:14,278
natural gift but sure that's not

830
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:15,640
everything you know what I mean like

831
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:17,798
just because you can grow really good I

832
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,919
think it's perfecting it it's at scale

833
00:30:17,798 --> 00:30:22,158
as you're growing up and you know and

834
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,799
even if you're not good it's like uh you

835
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:27,440
just do it over and over till you get

836
00:30:23,798 --> 00:30:29,398
better and just as far as my photography

837
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,960
the same thing when I mean I started out

838
00:30:29,398 --> 00:30:32,719
I was I was a good photographer when I

839
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,919
started out with high times but you know

840
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,120
I learned over the years how to get

841
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:39,360
better and I you know I I you know I

842
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:41,079
observed everything you know all other

843
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:43,319
photographers other you know I looked at

844
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:45,158
you know thousands of photos you know

845
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:47,918
try to figure out what works and you

846
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:50,200
know I over the years you know it took

847
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,559
me a long long time to really say I

848
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,798
think I'm I think I'm pretty good

849
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:55,798
photographer it took me a long time to

850
00:30:53,798 --> 00:30:58,240
actually say that you know it really did

851
00:30:55,798 --> 00:31:00,638
but at least 20 years and and I didn't

852
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,200
you know when I started like I say in

853
00:31:00,638 --> 00:31:04,759
working with High Times

854
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:07,159
1991 so yeah I think when I can say

855
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:08,919
20111 I can say like he's my my

856
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:11,480
photography is fairly consistent at this

857
00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:13,919
point so yeah look like anything and

858
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:16,079
that's why I'm so so pleased to you know

859
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:19,000
issue this book this book is coming out

862
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,798

864
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:29,359
of the movement some of the uh incident

865
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,038
that people don't really know about and

866
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:34,558
uh you know lots of uh Still Life

Chong all these people I photographed

873
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,440

874
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,880
uh it's it's you know people have been

875
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,919
asking for for the book and you know

876
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,159
it's been a SLO getting there but I

877
00:31:54,919 --> 00:31:59,600
think it's I think it's going to be a

878
00:31:57,159 --> 00:32:01,880
real representation of of at least my

879
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:03,798
career and which kind of coincides with

880
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:06,760
the legalization

881
00:32:03,798 --> 00:32:09,599
movement totally that's great I

882
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:11,720
mean these things take time and and you

883
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:14,359
have years and years and years of

884
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:16,480
Photography oh yeah I mean I I you know

885
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:18,558

886
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,120

career regular you know relatively late

891
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:33,038
in life at 29 years old I just got

892
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,839

how that's what I always say wow really

914
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,360
cool so let's talk about you're uh

915
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:35,919
working with the people in South Dakota

916
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:38,678
on the resz yeah in 2000 Alex White Plum

917
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:41,159
and uh some other people decided to grow

918
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:43,000
hemp they had pushed an ordinance

919
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:45,159
through through the tribal government

920
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,960
which had okayed the IND Industrial Hemp

921
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:51,278
cultivation so in 20002 crops were swn

922
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,880
on the Pine Ridge reservation they were

923
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:58,558
both plowed under and raided by the DEA

924
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:02,159
by the uh FBI and by uh local Tribal

925
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:05,960
Police they came in with guns drawn to

926
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:07,359
um to uh seized the crops and dragged

927
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:10,559
them away this was

928
00:34:07,358 --> 00:34:12,639
2000 and they did it again in 2001 they

929
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:15,759
tried to grow again and in 2002 they did

930
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:17,760
it again and finally a court injunction

931
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,200
was slapped on them a federal injunction

932
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,960
telling them not that they couldn't grow

933
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:24,118
anymore that was lifted in 2015 but the

934
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:28,240
funny thing about this in 2000 when they

935
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:30,960
first raided the crop in 2000 the F the

936
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:33,759
the the DEA dragged away the crops

937
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:36,960
dragged them away and seeds were

938
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:39,599
scattered everywhere so there was so

939
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,398
there's feral hemp growing all over the

940
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:44,039
reservation now courtesy of the DEA I

941
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:45,598
mean just an amazing thing because you

942
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:47,759
know this this this operation had to

943
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:50,159
cost a half million dollars and it was a

944
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,800
completely for what to to seize a you

945
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,398
know a couple acres of of hemp you know

946
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,039
seriously that's how that's how crazy

947
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:58,759
things were that is crazy I was I was

948
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:01,279
there and and you know and got to know

949
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:05,079
the Alex white plume very very well been

950
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:06,880
friends with him for 20 years now um and

951
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:08,599
uh yeah so I mean there something I've

952
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,200
been involved with a long time is with

953
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:12,760
is with the Pine Ridge reservation and

954
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:15,239
uh their attempts to grow hemp now

955
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:17,520
they're growing uh cannabis legally and

956
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:20,319
James loud seeds are in the ground there

957
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:22,599
from what I understand U Vic Camp who's

958
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:25,160
a very very prominent guy the

959
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:27,440
reservation uh is growing James loud

960
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:30,759
Seas right now um he were kind enough to

961
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,559
donate them and uh yeah so that's it's

962
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:34,160
something else there's legal growing now

963
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:36,400
they have a couple dispensaries on the

964
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:38,118
reservation and uh you know it's

965
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,000
becoming mainstream there like everybody

966
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:41,720
everywhere else they have tremendous

967
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:46,119
drug problems on the reservation you

968
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:49,399
know meth is a real Scourge so you know

969
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:52,200
not that cannabis can can can change

970
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:54,440
that in any way but certainly it's an

971
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:56,279
alternative doing meth which is the most

972
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:58,200
destructive drug out there right now I

973
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,920
believe well that and Fentanyl fentanyl

974
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:02,719
is killing people meth is just [ __ ]

975
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:05,800
people up yeah y

976
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:08,318
unfortunately so yeah I've you know been

977
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:10,960
working with I I go to the Lakota War

978
00:36:08,318 --> 00:36:12,599
pony races every year I I play kuster

979
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,480
I've played kuster in a number number of

980
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:15,800
them where uh you know I kind of ride

981
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,240
through all the Indians they come and

982
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,440
try to grab the flag from me it's kind

983
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:21,239
of a symbolic uh thing in the middle of

984
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,358
the race and whoever grabs the flag you

985
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:25,639
know gets like about $500 or something

986
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:27,799
like that it's a little bit dangerous

987
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:30,199
but I been doing that for' been doing

988
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:32,760
that for years um so yeah I've got to

989
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:34,239
got to know the Lakota people extremely

990
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,800
well over the years we have a lot of

991
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:38,279
friends there so it's one of the things

992
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:40,079
I'm most happy about but also in my book

993
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:43,280
there are a few other things I mean uh

994
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:47,240
you know the for example in 1996 Woody

995
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:49,599
harelson in Kentucky uh planted four

996
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:52,118
hemp seeds in order to draw attention to

997
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:54,160
these ridiculous laws that were

998
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:56,119
outlawing hemp cultivation in Kentucky

999
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:58,799
which was the biggest hemp producer in

1000
00:36:56,119 --> 00:37:02,400
the world I mean in in the country back

1001
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:04,760
in the 1800s the early 1900s yeah so he

1002
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,639
so he orchestrated his own arrest I

1003
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:09,200
covered that I was there at the planting

1004
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:10,639
and I covered his four years through the

1005
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:15,559
legal system and he was finally

1006
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:18,078
acquitted and uh ironically and not

1007
00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:20,400
coincidentally the lotas plants were

1008
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:23,079
raided on the same day that Woody was

1009
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:26,960
acquitted now I don't think that was

1010
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:29,359
coincidence I think it was purposeful it

1011
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,760
was the Federal Government showing we

1012
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:33,400
don't care we're going to continue to

1013
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:37,800
Outlaw hemp but we're going to continue

1014
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:40,720
to this mad mad war on on cannabis in

1015
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:43,680
any way we can so yeah i' mean I've had

1016
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:45,078
a lot of experiences um that you know

1017
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:49,519
were afforded through High Times

1018
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:52,720
magazine yeah really cool yeah so I mean

1019
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:54,679
Lakota like so that went all the way to

1020
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:56,318
the federal went to Federal Federal

1021
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:57,480
Court they went to the federal court

1022
00:37:56,318 --> 00:38:00,679
Miss

1023
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:04,719
um didn't go you know the uh the judge

1024
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:06,679
uh said although he understood and

1025
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:11,000
probably agreed with the fact that they

1026
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:14,358
should be allowed to uh grow hemp it was

1027
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:16,119
still up to Congress to change the laws

1028
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:17,838
and he couldn't do anything about that

1029
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:19,720
so it's kind of where it stopped right

1030
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:22,078
there it's kind of where it stopped and

1031
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:23,480
where it started I mean I think without

1032
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,440
that who knows if hemp would have been

1033
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:27,400
legalized and we would have passed the

1034
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,720
farm bill in 2018

1035
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,559
yeah well you know you know there were

1036
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:32,039
there were experimental crops going I

1037
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:33,480
mean they were allowing you know head

1038
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:35,480
crops to grow you know there listen

1039
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:39,400
there were experimental head crops uh

1040
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:42,559
growing in U Hawaii far back as 1996

1041
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:45,039
1997 um the the Hawaiian legislature

1042
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:47,119
allowed a a hemp quarter AC to be grown

1043
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:50,079
in experimental CRS if it needed to be

1044
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:52,599
experimented with um it crazy

1045
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:57,000
experimental hemp crop I mean what what

1046
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:58,800
did they expect um yeah so uh it's there

1047
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,559
were a lot of experimental crops up

1048
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,880
until the the the point where the farm

1049
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:04,799
bill was passed but here's the funny

1050
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,680
thing back in the early 90s we always

1051
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,160
thought it would be a domino effect like

1052
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:11,919
hemp would start things off then medical

1053
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:14,679
marijuana then recreational marijuana

1054
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:17,280
and what happened Rec it became medical

1055
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:19,960
first then recreational and then hemp

1056
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:23,440
came last I mean seriously it doesn't

1057
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:25,079
make any sense I mean not the PO legal

1058
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,519
on the on the federal level but

1059
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:28,640
certainly you know when you have

1060
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:30,880
California and and other huge States you

1061
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:33,199
know allowing recreational pot the

1062
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,079
gloves are off you know we still have a

1063
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:36,199
long way to go we still have a long way

1064
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:37,640
I mean we've come a long way but we

1065
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:38,838
still have a long way to go and I think

1066
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:40,598
a lot of this stuff is just so

1067
00:39:38,838 --> 00:39:43,039
counterintuitive it doesn't make sense

1068
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:44,519
necessarily like oh I know it's the

1069
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:47,559
hardest thing I think for activists back

1070
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:49,280
in the 90s and and the 2000s was talking

1071
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:51,519
to politicians and trying to explain to

1072
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:54,119
them the idiocy of the laws and the

1073
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:56,800
sanity of you know using cannabis in a

1074
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:58,400
way that can really help people and to

1075
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,160
just get NOS or to get outright

1076
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,000
hostility or to get people who you know

1077
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:03,159
say well this is not an issue that I

1078
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
want to get involved with because I

1079
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:07,960
won't get reelected it must have been

1080
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,800
extremely frustrating you know I was

1081
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:13,079
involved on the political level by any

1082
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:16,440
means I certainly testified it uh uh uh

1083
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:18,920
before a few legislatures I testified in

1084
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:22,280
Vermont and in North Dakota and I

1085
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:23,119
testified at the olala tribal council

1086
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,680
about

1087
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:28,760
he didn't change anything you know

1088
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:31,279
people they kind of listen MH MH you

1089
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,720
know then they go home you know yeah

1090
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,920
that's what's so refreshing about going

1091
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:36,879
to some other countries um St Vincent

1092
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,680
for example I I was down there and we

1093
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,920
lectured to the Cannabis Authority down

1094
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:43,919
there but they were sincere in the fact

1095
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:46,039
that they wanted to help people with

1096
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:49,079
cannabis we the the government the

1097
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:51,639
actual government was very focused on

1098
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:54,599
allowing people to to use cannabis for

1099
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:56,598
medical purposes especially and and I

1100
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:58,039
didn't feel like we were a a thorn th in

1101
00:40:56,599 --> 00:41:00,240
their side like in in the United States

1102
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:02,039
I still feel like to a degree we're like

1103
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:03,000
a thorn in the side of the government

1104
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:05,599
they're they're just they're going to

1105
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,559
let us do it but they're it's it just

1106
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:08,960
pisses them off a little bit still oh

1107
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:11,078
yeah yeah I don't think things have

1108
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:15,639
changed like that I mean you know Biden

1109
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:18,440
is you know he's an old guy and he he's

1110
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:20,279
no marijuana supporter um he's allowed

1111
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:22,400
it because I think he realizes that you

1112
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,680
know that most Democrats most liberals

1113
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,160
are you know think that you know should

1114
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:26,838
be legal it should be people should be

1115
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:28,639
allowed to use it but he's no fan of

1116
00:41:26,838 --> 00:41:32,519
cannabis he's made that very very clear

1117
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:34,480
over the years you know so certainly

1118
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:35,920
when he was uh running for office you

1119
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:39,199
know he never spoke out in favor of

1120
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:42,519
cannabis but still had you know so but

1121
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:46,439
he a lot better than the

1122
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:47,880
alternative but uh yeah it's it's it's I

1123
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,639
you know I I don't follow the industry

1124
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,160
as much as I used to I'm you know

1125
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:54,679
marketing my photographs for the most

1126
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:56,960
part um and you know trying to you know

1127
00:41:54,679 --> 00:42:00,318
Market my photography stuff but I'm

1128
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:02,358
still I'm I I I certainly know a lot of

1129
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:04,239
people they tell me about the problems

1130
00:42:02,358 --> 00:42:07,598
in the industry and it's overregulation

1131
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:11,679
for the most part that has caused uh the

1132
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:14,359
industry to kind of like St be stifled

1133
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:16,919
right yeah things are slowly changing

1134
00:42:14,358 --> 00:42:19,880
but not fast

1135
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:22,240
enough I don't know what we can do but

1136
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:25,480
uh yeah but this you know this High

1137
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:27,479
Times Like I said James was uh my ticket

1139
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,599

1140
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:33,598
different celebrities good Lord I mean

1141
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:35,800

1142
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,680

1144
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:41,318
really cool you you hang out with these

1145
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,920
people I got to meet you know I

1146
00:42:41,318 --> 00:42:47,880
interviewed Oliver Stone um you know the

1147
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:50,400
Lewis Black uh Jesse Ventura you know I

1148
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:51,800
remember when I interviewed Jesse ventur

1149
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,519
was he was still just doing his Radio

1150
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:56,519
Show in Minneapolis in 1998 and I just

1151
00:42:54,519 --> 00:42:58,119
called up his radio station you know and

1152
00:42:56,519 --> 00:43:00,039
said hey this is High Times we'd like to

1153
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:02,079
interview H you know he'll get back you

1154
00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:05,279
just a few minutes and he did he called

1155
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:08,960
me back so this was before he was a

1156
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:10,599
national uh a national figure so he was

1157
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,318
you know we just knew him as a wrestler

1158
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:14,160
so what do you think the the future of

1159
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:16,920
High Times is where where do you think

1160
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:19,558
that Magazine's going I mean from your

1161
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:20,720
inside perspective I know it's hard to

1162
00:43:19,559 --> 00:43:24,079
say

1163
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:25,679
but it's hard to say because I've read a

1164
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:29,039
recent article it's recent this last

1165
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:32,039
week says that they have massive debt

1166
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:35,400
and the debt is coming due that they

1167
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:38,440
have not and that uh

1168
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:40,599
their lender is also having problems and

1169
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,318
it could go into receivership which

1170
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:45,680
means that High Times could be owned by

1171
00:43:42,318 --> 00:43:47,838
somebody else you know so I thought the

1172
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:50,399
dis the dispensary model like we have a

1173
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:53,039
dispensary off Highway 880 and in

1174
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,559
Oakland I thought that was a great kind

1175
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:56,558
of I thought it was a great thing

1176
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:58,160
because everybody knows High Times

1177
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:00,240
magazine that smokes from back in the

1178
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:01,440
day at least now we have a lot of new

1179
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:03,318
people and I don't think they've done

1180
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,639
really well like they thought they would

1181
00:44:03,318 --> 00:44:07,239
or like I hoped they would well apply

1182
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:09,440
they owe an awful lot of rent on some of

1183
00:44:07,239 --> 00:44:11,799
these places um they've made some bad

1184
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,559
deals um I think that you know the

1185
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:15,240
dispensory business is not the Gold Line

1186
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:18,240
that everybody thinks it is it takes a

1187
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:21,239
lot of work it is a 247 job stocking the

1188
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:23,598
place Staffing the place you know it is

1189
00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:26,799
it's and and believe me you inventory

1190
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:28,240
goes fast so you know sure that you know

1191
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,440
High times has had their problems as far

1192
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:32,719
as the dispensary business in California

1193
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:36,519
as well I mean it's an over-regulate

1194
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:37,679
industry so all I could read James um I

1195
00:44:36,519 --> 00:44:39,679
mean I don't have an opinion about where

1196
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:41,558
it's going because I don't I don't

1197
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:43,318
understand High Finance at the least

1198
00:44:41,559 --> 00:44:45,359
they seem to keep going even though

1199
00:44:43,318 --> 00:44:47,318
they're carrying massive debt that's all

1200
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:49,159
I can can tell you from what I read and

1201
00:44:47,318 --> 00:44:51,838
you know people can look this up easily

1202
00:44:49,159 --> 00:44:53,920
enough you just uh you know Google High

1203
00:44:51,838 --> 00:44:56,558
Times debt you can see where the

1204
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,159
magazine is going so even though I have

1205
00:44:56,559 --> 00:45:00,480
you know you know fondness for the

1206
00:44:58,159 --> 00:45:03,440
magazine and uh you

1207
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:05,800
know I I'm very very thankful for my

1208
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,559
experiences you know I watched the last

1209
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:09,640
five six years and you know kind of

1210
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:12,319
wonder where it's going you know is if

1211
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:15,799
is it going to survive right you know

1212
00:45:12,318 --> 00:45:18,079
simple as that like all magazines you

1213
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:21,079
know so many magazines have died over

1214
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:22,318
the years I mean so many believe me it's

1215
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:25,760
you know the only magazine that seem to

1216
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:27,880
do any are celebrity magazines you know

1217
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,880
right

1218
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:33,400
tabloids yeah very very Niche magazine

1219
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,760
but like I say you don't see magazines

1220
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,358
anymore you don't people don't go to the

1221
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:38,000
news stands anymore I got to pick up the

1222
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:41,719
latest issue Esquire or something like

1223
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,920
that people don't do that anymore so

1224
00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:45,279
it's I I even think to a degree books

1225
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,559
will be going away I mean I think

1226
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,880
there's there well like books like yours

1227
00:45:47,559 --> 00:45:50,559
that's a different kind of book so

1228
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,838
that's a book that you're you know

1229
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:55,119
coffee table book those are great but I

1230
00:45:52,838 --> 00:45:58,318
mean even even books regarding

1231
00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:00,838
technology or breeding or growing I

1232
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:03,599
think the access to information on the

1233
00:46:00,838 --> 00:46:05,519
Internet is just so vast but the problem

1234
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:07,599
is is dialing the information in because

1235
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:10,239
now it's almost sensory overload you go

1236
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:11,760
on the internet and there's 20 different

1237
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:13,959
ways to do the same thing well which one

1238
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,400
do you pick and you know there's ratings

1239
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:16,519
on stuff so I'm going to pick the top

1240
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,519
rated one but maybe that's not

1241
00:46:16,519 --> 00:46:21,519
necessarily the best maybe it's not the

1242
00:46:18,519 --> 00:46:24,358
easiest so it's it's difficult and the

1243
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:26,880
future is uh going to be interesting

1244
00:46:24,358 --> 00:46:28,440
well you know I that's one of the the

1245
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,358
the reasons I think High Times is also

1246
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:33,838
struggling because we used to be the

1247
00:46:30,358 --> 00:46:35,719
go-to source for marijuana cultivation

1248
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:36,880
tips and techniques and so forth and all

1249
00:46:35,719 --> 00:46:40,480
the new

1250
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:42,039
Innovations um now all as you said all

1251
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,440
of that stuff is on the internet you

1252
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:46,079
know you can dial this up there are so

1253
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:48,559
many experts there's so many videos that

1254
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:52,440
you know that you don't need to buy High

1255
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:54,720
Times any longer um so that that is also

1256
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:56,480
U you know it's made it difficult I mean

1257
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:57,959
grow articles are not all that

1258
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,318
interesting anymore I mean you can write

1259
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:01,880
a thousand words you know in High Times

1260
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:04,800
or you can you know read the read it

1261
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:07,800
online and you can read other sources

1262
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:10,359
you can it you know that's that's

1263
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:11,519
becomes a difficult uh difficult for a

1264
00:47:10,358 --> 00:47:13,039
magazine to survive with all the

1265
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:15,480
information they used to publish is

1266
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:17,000
online yeah yeah it was a whole

1267
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,800
different world I mean photron if you

1268
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,559
wanted a Phototron in

1269
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:24,160
1995 you had to get it from you know you

1270
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:25,920
go in High Times magazine you read about

1271
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:27,838
it they didn't have a website you you

1272
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:30,039
could call them you could give them a

1273
00:47:27,838 --> 00:47:32,239
credit card number maybe but or you

1274
00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:35,318
could send a checkin that was like a big

1275
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:38,000
thing back then you'd send the check in

1276
00:47:35,318 --> 00:47:39,519
do people know what the photo tron was

1277
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,519
no you know what we've talked about on

1278
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:43,679
my show before but I that was my first

1279
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:46,159
uh attempted growing was in a Phototron

1280
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:48,558
and then I cut the top off and put a you

1281
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:51,078
know 400 watt light that was taken from

1282
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:52,519
the Sun Valley Mall I always loved

1283
00:47:51,079 --> 00:47:54,280
reading about the people who did

1284
00:47:52,519 --> 00:47:56,079
Innovative things to grow very very

1285
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:59,040
small the people would take an ordinary

1286
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:01,240
closet make a vegetation room on the uh

1287
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:03,358
and a flowering room on on top and have

1288
00:48:01,239 --> 00:48:05,279
you know Perpetual harvest in this tiny

1289
00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:07,318
little area I was always thought that

1290
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:09,440
was fantastic I really did all the

1291
00:48:07,318 --> 00:48:11,519
different ways people grow um I remember

1292
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,920
going into Las Vegas and you know guy

1293
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:15,800
took me into his garage you said you see

1294
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:18,400
the grow I said No No 7 and he had a he

1295
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:20,920
had a wall that actually you know came

1296
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,639
out of the that actually came out like

1297
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:25,960
you know like a horror movie like it's a

1298
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:28,679
secret room it was he all these shelves

1299
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:30,280
came out and you could walk behind it

1300
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:31,759
and he said cops had actually come over

1301
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:33,079
he could not you know you know and

1302
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,280
looked at it for something looked at the

1303
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:37,760
house for something else could not see

1304
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,480
it you would never know it was there so

1305
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,839
I always you know I know I saw a guy in

1306
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:44,400
Santa Cruz once who under the foundation

1307
00:48:41,838 --> 00:48:47,199
of his house and he was reading the

1308
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:50,160
house he did a sea of green grow room he

1309
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:51,759
only had three feet of space down there

1310
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:53,679
but it was amazing he had cut his

1311
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,280
floorboards in his closet in order to

1312
00:48:53,679 --> 00:48:57,519
climb down underneath the house in order

1313
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,280
to make a sea of green grow room so you

1314
00:48:57,519 --> 00:49:02,079
know that that was that kind of

1315
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:04,760
innovation back then just blew me away

1316
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:06,599
it really did yeah so one last question

1317
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:07,880
before we go what was the best thing you

1318
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:10,280
ever

1319
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:12,838
smoked oh

1320
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:15,760
jeez in all these years you got to have

1321
00:49:12,838 --> 00:49:17,639
one standout that I'm you know I I

1322
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:20,240
haven't had it in a while but I really

1323
00:49:17,639 --> 00:49:23,199
like Sour Diesel nice I really didn't

1324
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:25,239
like sour diesel and but I as I said the

1325
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:28,519
the most intense experience I've ever

1326
00:49:25,239 --> 00:49:31,959
had was on Waka that was back in

1327
00:49:28,519 --> 00:49:34,400
1976 and that just blew me away I felt

1328
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:37,159
like I was spiraling up it couldn't come

1329
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:40,240
down you know how New York of you for

1330
00:49:37,159 --> 00:49:41,279
sour diesel yeah that's that is the the

1331
00:49:40,239 --> 00:49:43,399
most

1332
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,720
popular as far as you know I think

1333
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:48,160
there's some other stuff coming for the

1334
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:51,000
longest time that was the one diesel

1335

1336
