it's been a minute uh yeah we had hie on

18
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,839
a episode I think five episodes ago four

19
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,680
episodes something like that yeah

20
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,240
amazing time we got really lit a lot of

21
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,720
fun she told me she told me yeah alie's

22
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,199
Allie's my daughter and um I was really

23
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:19,840
great that you guys got her in there

24
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,640
because she's really grown up in the

25
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,439
Cannabis space you know like she's seen

26
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:27,280
it all it's great to have the second or

27
00:01:24,438 --> 00:01:28,798
third generation people come on the show

28
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,040
I feel like they have a different story

29
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,400
especially growing up when you're you're

30
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,320
fully immersed into it from the time

31
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,000
you're a little kid yeah and then

32
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:37,078
growing up and evolving and seeing the

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,759
world as it's it's changed so much you

34
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:42,158
know in the last 20 years especially I

35
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,759
know it I know it it really has yeah I

36
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,118
mean that we could go over the stories

37
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,599
but I'm sure that you guys probably

38
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:50,359
covered them so totally a lot of good

39
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:52,438
stuff yeah so let's dive into your story

40
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:54,759
so I know a little bit about your story

41
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:57,559
especially with salmon uh you know in

42
00:01:54,759 --> 00:02:00,759
genetics the Cannabis breeding was out

43
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:03,000
of necessity for me and that was in the

44
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:05,319
late 990s when I was growing in the

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,840
woods gorilla style and it was like you

46
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:09,199
know we didn't have nurseries we didn't

47
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,719
have there was like the Amsterdam Seed

48
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:16,399
scene going on but it wasn't as

49
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:18,479
accessible you know and and so basically

50
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,360
for me I was like well I should just

51
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,280
probably figure out how to make sure I

52
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,400
have my own starting material for the

53
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:28,239
next season and so that just seeds made

54
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:32,319
sense and uh never once thought that it

55
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:34,319
would end with being a career and and a

56
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:36,878
you know something that we've been able

57
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:39,878
to sort of share with so many different

58
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:42,039
cannabis enthusiasts and uh I think a

59
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:45,479
lot of us are that way you know like I

60
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:48,039
mean you're a chef right right so you

61
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:50,959
know whether it's like inspiration from

62
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:53,400
being a taste maker or when High Times

63
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,120
magazine was my thing you know some guys

64
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,800
like play boy magazine when we were

65
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,360
teenagers whatever my thing was High

66
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,719
Times magazine that was the thing that

67
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,920
got me the most excited was reading

68
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:05,080
about cannabis and seeing cannabis and

69
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:07,839
seeing these people from around the

70
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,519
world Arian Ross cam uh and all these

71
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,840
other guys that were very inspirational

72
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,158
to me from a very young age I was like

73
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,959
those those were the people I looked up

74
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:18,479
to when I was a kid yeah yeah

75
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:21,959
so you asked about the whole salmon

76
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:24,238
thing you know back then I mean I was in

77
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,959
love with the fixing the rivers and the

78
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,039
S and helping restore salmon as well so

79
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,719
there were

80
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:33,479
passions uh with the breed in passions

81
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:35,759
with doing salmon stuff and and but you

82
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:38,158
certainly weren't in at least not in

83
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:40,639
California and humble or whatever

84
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:43,158
making careers and shouting from a

85
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:45,238
Mountaintop we're selling cannabis seeds

86
00:03:43,158 --> 00:03:49,079
here you know so it was a different time

87
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:50,840
and uh my job that I chose to have you

88
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:56,319
know as

89
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:59,400
my uh front-end job um was the salmon

90
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:01,878
restoration work and which did like it

91
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,760
we started with undam the clamo where

92
00:04:01,878 --> 00:04:07,598
that was 20 plus year project that just

93
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:10,519
we just finished off world's largest dam

94
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:12,280
removal and and uh world's largest like

95
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:13,840
really river river restoration

96
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,160
absolutely amazing by the way that's

97
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,600
really amazing well I I am not at all

98
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:23,880
like saying that it took so many people

99
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:26,879
it was like and really like tribes um

100
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:28,800
were so essential that our Native

101
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,240
American tribes up there in Humble count

102
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,520
well in Humble and all the all the way

103
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,639
up the river really Warren Buffett ended

104
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:39,839
up owning the the dams because it went

105
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,519
from a one power company to another kind

106
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:44,519
of Midway through our our fight against

107
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:46,680
the reler of the dam so it would have

108
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:49,279
been like another 50 years and that was

109
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:52,439
the impetus to really you know kick into

110
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:55,599
gear and then Burkshire hathway AKA

111
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:58,680
Warren Buffett ended up owning Pacific

112
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,360
War or Pacific Power um which like

113
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,400
provides Oregon Idaho

114
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,038
Montana a lot of the power up there and

115
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:07,120
the dams are on the border of California

116
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:11,719
and Oregon but the Utility Commission

117
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:16,000
line is literally at Humble County and

118
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:20,080
cisq County so the county north of us is

119
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,959
powered by the group we were fighting uh

120
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:25,839
owned by Warren Buffett and then um I

121
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:29,680
think we're all on uh pg&amp; of course

122
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:31,560
which has is their own horrific story of

123
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,240
corate greed that we've all been dealing

124
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,839
with um abely so like my house you know

125
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,199
I'd pay a power build a PG but you go

126
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:44,279
you know not very far up that River and

127
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:47,240
and it's um Pacific Power and so um yeah

128
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:50,559
just battling those guys and it was

129
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,800
really grass rootsy um at the time I did

130
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,038
a lot of the Grassroots stuff but I also

131
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,240
got really involved with uh doing some

132
00:05:55,038 --> 00:06:00,800
genomics work around salmon and worked

133
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,400
at the Salmon her restoration Council as

134
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,160
their Fisheries program coordinator for

135
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:09,399
like 10 years and did um just general

136
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,039
salmon biology work doing that and but

137
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:14,239
one of the highlights

138
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:16,959
was uh getting a grant to do genetic

139
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,879
research and determining the difference

140
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:23,159
between two different runs of salmon

141
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:25,719
that are of the same species but you

142
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:29,720
could call them subspecies because they

143
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:32,440
acted so differently um one being a my

144
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,680
Springtime migrator and and then the

145
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:37,879
Fall Run shinook which is sort of like a

146
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,120
little bit more common place across you

147
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:42,360
know even across the Pacific Northwest

148
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,759
it's uh it's a neat area up there

149
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,800
because the tribes are really intact so

150
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:51,680
you have this like cool culture that is

151
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,918
um you know actually still a living

152
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,918
growing

153
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:58,758
culture

154
00:06:54,918 --> 00:07:00,918
to anybody who lives there of course

155
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:04,840
tribes in particular a salmon that that

156
00:07:00,918 --> 00:07:07,799
navigates the waterways in April May and

157
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:09,359
June is just such like an amazing

158
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,879
blessing

159
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,000
because you know I I am always like well

160
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:17,360
I I'm restoring salmon so I can eat more

161
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,240
of them really and I mean I I hate to

162
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,280
sound like you know some people might

163
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:25,598
not appreciate that how that sounds but

164
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:30,159
if you ask me like the very best way to

165
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:33,719
take care of Earth is to like live with

166
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,720
her and or whatever and um you know

167
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:40,160
eating what

168
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:42,520
was I kind of feel like meant to be our

169
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,840
sustenance as much as you can is kind of

170
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:47,478
cool actually and so that Spring Run

171
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:49,239
Salmon oh my God it's the best it's like

172
00:07:47,478 --> 00:07:51,359
absolutely yeah yeah I'm finishing

173
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,720
Swedish so I I couldn't agree more I

174
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,598
think having respect for our food is so

175
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:01,120
important yeah just like respect for the

176
00:07:56,598 --> 00:08:05,519
plant yes so we did that genomics

177
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:09,158
study um and ended up being worked at UC

178
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:12,399
Davis um where I just had this crash

179
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:14,598
course I mean I'm not a geneticist by

180
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:19,120
training but it's something that it

181
00:08:14,598 --> 00:08:22,639
really you ended up looking into a a lot

182
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:25,918
and the study was published in Science

183
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:28,199
magazine which is kind of the

184
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:30,918
crowning publication that you can

185
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:34,519
publish your your research

186
00:08:30,918 --> 00:08:37,278
uh and then another one a followup one

187
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:40,120
where we had discovered some salmon

188
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:42,200
bones that were in caves you know likely

189
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:45,799
or more than likely

190
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,879
from uh indigenous peoples that were in

191
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:50,639
the upper upper clamo above where those

192
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:54,799
dams were uh because of our first

193
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:57,600
research we were now able to Sequin you

194
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:59,958
know salmon remains that were like 5,000

195
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,639
years old and and be able to tell what

196
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:03,359
type they were whether they were like

197
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:06,078
running up the river in spring or

198
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,680
running up in fall and and a lot of that

199
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:10,000
might just sound like minutia or

200
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:12,120
whatever but it it's really important

201
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,839
stuff when it comes down to like

202
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:19,679
managing uh a river system and trying to

203
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:23,399
bring back an intact salmon run but the

204
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:26,479
similarities to now what's also

205
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:29,519
interesting to me you know just as an

206
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,320
example like Autoflower and photo period

207
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:37,560
cannabis yeah Cornell just published a

208
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:41,200
paper that is so so similar to like what

209
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:43,039
we did to find the the marker for and

210
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,440
I'm sure you're very familiar with like

211
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:49,278
this uh what we call Marker assisted

212
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,480
breeding right and so I think a lot of

213
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:52,879
people are like oh my gosh this all of a

214
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,959
sudden they think you're Gene editing

215
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:57,879
you're doing editing totally different

216
00:09:54,958 --> 00:10:00,159
which there's a huge difference

217
00:09:57,879 --> 00:10:03,799
between you know running around

218
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:08,480
willy-nilly and and slapping spider DNA

219
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:12,078
into other species and

220
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:16,440
doing learning looking a genome is like

221
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:19,599
a book and if I want to read a book you

222
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:21,440
know like more power too you know like

223
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,360
and that's always what I'm like you know

224
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:28,560
basically if if you you can think what

225
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:32,159
you want about GMO crisper Gene editing

226
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:33,919
and all that anyone who who looks at you

227
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:35,639
sideways when you say you're you're

228
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:37,879
trying to understand more about the

229
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:39,919
genetic background of an organism it's

230
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:42,320
just like well why would you not want

231
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:45,439
more knowledge you know simply just

232
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:48,399
knowledge and some of it can be so

233
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:51,839
incredibly useful and and what Cornell

234
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:55,519
did they P they found that one spot in

235
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:59,440
the genome where Autoflower and photo

236
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:01,879
period are differentiated and so it it

237
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,600
it makes it so basically like you know

238
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:06,439
as you very well know if you make a

239
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,200
cross of an auto and a photo you're G to

240
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,600
have progyny that

241
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,200
inherits all auto of you know kind of

242
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,800
took all that and then some that took

243
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,399
all the photo well when that F1

244
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,519
generation a lot of people are confused

245
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,200
because the F1 generation is not an

246
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:24,320
Autoflower it's a fast flowering variety

247
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,480
and so you get traits that are you know

248
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,440
passed from the Autoflower which make it

249
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,440
trigger faster make it finish faster but

250
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,040
it's not a true flower you need two of

251
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,519
the recessive genes together to make it

252
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:39,519
Express Auto that is true and then but

253
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:42,440
it also as you well know goes to how

254
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:45,200
pure bread or how homozygous are your

255
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:48,600
two parental lines because yeah when you

256
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:51,160
have not like parental lines like so

257
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:55,240
many of the Cannabis genetic lines that

258
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:58,919
we see in the space these days that are

259
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:01,159
not at all homozygous or stable or pure

260
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:04,479
bread whatever you want to call them um

261
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:07,278
which is like 99.9% of everything yeah

262
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,800
then you you're right you can get the

263
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:12,720
quick but you can also sort you can

264
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:14,439
actually end up with more full

265
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,040
inheritance on one end and full

266
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:19,120
inheritance on the other end and uh

267
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:21,480
that's why it's so I think it's so much

268
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:25,000
more useful to be able I always

269
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,399
say you know if you don't have stable

270
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,120
lines and

271
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:32,679
uniform then it's not as scientific

272
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,919
because the core of science is being

273
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:38,519
able to do an experiment and repeat it

274
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:40,159
again and have the same outcome so um

275
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:44,039
the only way to really do that is to

276
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:45,519
have some some uniformity in the genetic

277
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:48,240
well now we're getting deep though I

278
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,360
think now we're getting into the well

279
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,680
and the best way to do that is with data

280
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:55,199
driven breeding and the more you know

281
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:58,679
the more power you have to be successful

282
00:12:55,198 --> 00:12:59,958
and then even tools like Ai and their

283
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:02,719
potential

284
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:03,958
in our space is just huge I think people

285
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,800
don't fully understand it so they're

286
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:08,638
scared of it but it's like AI with data

287
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:10,838
driven breeding and then predictive

288
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,680
modeling where you can take all your

289
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:16,079
genetic material uh have a database with

290
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:17,879
all of it and you can tell the AI

291
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:19,239
program exactly what you're trying to do

292
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:21,360
and they can help you get to that path

293
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,079
faster yeah

294
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,079
yeah at the same time I'm always like

295
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:29,159
well this ain't you know I because I

296
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:31,399
know we probably get pitched by the same

297
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:33,958
we do and our jeans and this that and

298
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:36,360
the other and and I love those guys but

299
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:39,518
I'm always reminding them like you know

300
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:42,959
cannabis is not soybeans like we're not

301
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:45,639
trying to breed something that is gonna

302
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:48,039
make our cows grow the fastest or you

303
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:51,600
know highest protein content highest oil

304
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:53,679
content most disease resistant there are

305
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,159
variables that are consistent like it

306
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:59,439
seems like people care about

307
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:01,719
TFC and as much as that is frustrating

308
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,399
sometimes to see you know we can breed

309
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:07,160
for those

310
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:09,839
individual uh sort of data points but I

311
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:11,600
know that folks like you and I aren't

312
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:15,320
aren't in it for that we're like it's

313
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:18,759
it's an art and I believe you know it's

314
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:22,440
also something like you know here we are

315
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:25,240
I'm trying this amazing whiskey that

316
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:27,880
you're sharing with me and by the way

317
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:30,320
it's I got these glasses because I had

318
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:32,519
issues with the corne scratch in my eye

319
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,079
so it's the first time I'm having a sip

320
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:37,360
of alcohol in about three weeks since I

321
00:14:35,078 --> 00:14:42,758
scratched my cornea but um this is

322
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:45,919
amazing and it's not it's very

323
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:48,560
subjective that you and I enjoy this and

324
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:51,439
I think you know as much

325
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:53,559
as you know we can get help and we

326
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,959
should be getting help from AI models

327
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:59,638
and we should be getting help from

328
00:14:55,958 --> 00:15:03,359
genetic sequences sure like this isn't

329
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:06,079
something that I would encourage uh the

330
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,680
Bayers of the world to just jump right

331
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:11,319
into because they're going to find out

332
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:14,239
real quick that the Cannabis consumer is

333
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,600
a like a subjective to the indivual

334
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,120
subjective to the individual and

335
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:21,320
absolutely and like you know I think

336
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:23,799
that this is amazing whiskey but you

337
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:26,000
know very well could be some whis

338
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:28,278
whiskey afficianado you could walk in

339
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,679
right behind me and tell me that's swill

340
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:32,480
garbage exactly I like my Jack Daniels

341
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,799
you know or or whatever it is you know

342
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,000
and that's that's the difference between

343
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:38,958
drug Discovery and the recreational

344
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,440
model or you know the model that we're

345
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:43,278
in which is somewhere in between you

346
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:46,680
know I think uh it's so subjective to

347
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:50,198
the individual and our unique body

348
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:51,879
chemistry is very different and and so

349
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:53,439
how the plant responds to us can be

350
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:56,720
completely different from one person to

351
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,079
the next and it's it's an art form we're

352
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,839
in a great space right now because I

353
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:01,719
feel like we're still the infancy of it

354
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,440
to a degree yeah you know we're only

355
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,839
going to improve on stuff uh but there's

356
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,040
you know there's a lot of snake oil out

357
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,560
there there's a lot of bad breeding out

358
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:11,278
there there's a lot of stuff going on

359
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:15,198
that's going to change over the next 10

360
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:16,639
years I think I agree I agree and for

361
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:19,719
those of us that have been in this for

362
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:22,959
long enough we've like learned a lot

363
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:26,920
from all the hype and trends that that

364
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:29,719
come and go and learned about all the

365
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:31,559
snake oil I like how that and I'm sure

366
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:35,240
that you've also come to the

367
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:38,799
conclusion after a time of potentially

368
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:41,440
like chasing the some of those dead ends

369
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:44,838
that like James

370
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:48,319
knows what to do yeah you know you

371
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:51,680
you're an expert you are an absolute

372
00:16:48,318 --> 00:16:55,078
efficient Auto expert of this plant I

373
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:56,198
would you know hope to think that I have

374
00:16:55,078 --> 00:16:58,958
some

375
00:16:56,198 --> 00:17:03,679
expertise and you know it's it's folks

376
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:05,119
like us that I think honestly our best

377
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:07,198
you know what people will discover

378
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:11,318
eventually that like you know just have

379
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:14,000
faith in some of these you know Season

380
00:17:11,318 --> 00:17:17,639
vets that have been loving this thing

381
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,078
for since 91 for me since 91 yeah since'

382
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,679
91 I started smoking in ' 91 and fell in

383
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:25,918
love with it I I think that's probably I

384
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:29,679
was 12 years old a skater

385
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:31,360
kid and like in the Gully you know with

386
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,600
the other skater kids that were much

387
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:37,599
older had my first toes and that would

388
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:40,599
have been probably like 91 literally 991

389
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:44,279
so we're right on bar and then you know

390
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:47,199
I moved to humbled in 95 and then it

391
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:49,759
wasn't on like just a pilgrimage to to

392
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:53,279
go to this weed Mecca of the world at

393
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:55,720
the time or at least the US I'll say it

394
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:57,839
just happened to be that I ended up

395
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,839
there traveling the

396
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:03,119
country with my my girlfriend at the

397
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:05,639
time and I just

398
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:08,678
stayed fell in love with the that place

399
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:11,280
in general and weed but but that place

400
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:14,440
you know like yeah I can't go to Humble

401
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:17,399
too often because I might end up moving

402
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:19,480
there to be 100% honest yeah I mean I I

403
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,880
got we have a lot of good mutual friends

404
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,919
yeah and I go up there and visit like

405
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,799
the guys from Royal gold oh yeah and

406
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:30,080
it's like it's you Rick oh yeahi they've

407
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:32,720
been on the show when I moved to humbled

408
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:35,079
um Rick was one of the first people that

409
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,880
I ended up being really you know tight

410
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:39,038
buddies with we lived together actually

411
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,360
on a hippie commune together for a time

412
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:45,919
it was a very very relaxed like not

413
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:48,959
culty kind of a thing but you know yeah

414
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:51,799
right right after the summer of love and

415
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,919
all that you know some of those hippies

416
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:56,240
like they call them the diggers and they

417
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,559
were sort of the hippies that were like

418
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,200
more let's get back to the land let's

419
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:03,678
get roots of what this counterculture

420
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,960
movement is which is to like make our

421
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:10,120
own way and and not be so conventionally

422
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:15,159
tied and an anti-war and all that good

423
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:17,079
stuff but um yeah then they Janus Joplin

424
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:20,039
people contributed money to buy this

425
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:22,158
piece of land up there and uh it's

426
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:25,679
called Black Bear and it still exists

427
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:28,440
actually so Rick and I landed there um I

428
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,960
did like a brief stint uh chasing around

429
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:34,000
the grateful Dad and then Jerry Garcia

430
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:37,480
of course died 95 was a rough

431
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,519
year yeah but that was the year that I

432
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:42,400
just you know didn't I mean my

433
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:44,720
girlfriend and I we had gone to many

434
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,280
Dead shows yeah Rick and I both landed

435
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,440
there at the same time and so I've known

436
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:52,000
Rick and uh and Rob Gail a humble turp

437
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:56,000
Council we all lived at that place in in

438
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,119
the 95 996 kind of time frame and and

439
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,200
then of course that was when the

440
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:02,839
proposition 215

441
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,640
yeah came to pass 1996 we hitchhiked

442
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:07,439
from that commune to go get registered

443
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,679
to vote I wasn't inspired by like

444
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,519
[ __ ] Bill Clinton running for

445
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:14,360
president for his second term I was

446
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:16,200
inspired to go register to vote to vote

447
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:20,119
Yes on proposition

448
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:21,960
215 which the first legalization of of

449
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:24,119
cannabis in any way shape or form kind

450
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,759
of I don't know I guess maybe that's not

451
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:27,798
there's been some things but it was the

452
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:29,798
major one it was the major one that

453
00:20:27,798 --> 00:20:33,440
really put us on the path to where we

454
00:20:29,798 --> 00:20:36,480
are now yes yes without prop 15 I don't

455
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,400
know if we would be where we're at today

456
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,880
I would say definitely not I always like

457
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:44,640
to shout out you know the Dennis Peron

458
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:47,400
yeah types of and Dennis I think was the

459
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,720
big push but there was other people

460
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:52,400
people in humbal even like Ken Miller uh

461
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:55,839
was an co-author on there there was

462
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:58,919
totally people helped Dennis in writing

463
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:01,759
that and um but we owe a great service

464
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:05,280
to him as in you know the Cannabis world

465
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:10,038
and and that was too good of a law it

466
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:13,879
was too well perfected for us to be able

467
00:21:10,038 --> 00:21:15,400
to really get to know the plan and enjoy

468
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:21,520
it

469
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:24,600
and many of us I think respected the um

470
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:26,639
true intention of the law which was

471
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:31,079
to you

472
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:34,880
know clear a path for people to a have

473
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:38,480
access in particular people that were in

474
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:41,360
great need with you know any medical

475
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:44,278
issue that they could have um

476
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:48,439
right uh obviously there was it came

477
00:21:44,278 --> 00:21:51,759
Dennis was in the Castro area of San

478
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:53,679
Francisco and HIV was a major issue at

479
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:56,519
the time they hadn't developed a lot of

480
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:59,278
the medic medications that they have now

481
00:21:56,519 --> 00:22:02,480
and so people were really suffering and

482
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:04,839
also you know we're still dealing with

483
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,038
cancer everywhere you look people have

484
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:09,558
cancer and that was another more now

485
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:10,679
more now it feels like maybe more yeah

486
00:22:09,558 --> 00:22:15,000
maybe it's because we're older but it

487
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:18,360
sure feels like more to me yeah so for

488
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,240
that to be compassionate use you know

489
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:23,519
was the the how we everybody it was

490
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,960
framed at the time it's like and and I

491
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:28,240
mean I think it was more than just

492
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,679
compassionate use it was it still is

493
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:37,798
always has been a medicine

494
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:40,440
and um but that was the The Cry for

495
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:42,519
common sense was like you know we got

496
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,960
people that are going to pass away if

497
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:48,119
they they want to ease their pain with

498
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,558
cannabis instead of opiates instead of

499
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:53,719
like you know all this other

500
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:55,000
mind-numbing stuff and you know who in

501
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,159
the world is to tell them that they

502
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,359
shouldn't be able to use it and then and

503
00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:02,039
and but it really was the way he wrote

504
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:05,558
that the initiative the voter initiative

505
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:08,759
was that you know any doctor can

506
00:23:05,558 --> 00:23:11,480
recommend that cannabis is probably not

507
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:14,640
not a bad thing to use for you you know

508
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:16,440
and and I had mine for any number of

509
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,000
things I mean half the time I would just

510
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,200
wait for the doctor to prompt something

511
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,278
I was like what do you want to write it

512
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:25,519
for this year you know but and and I

513
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:27,919
certainly did have back pain I mean I

514
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:30,839
had tons of back pain yeah I mean most

515
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:34,440
of it was from hauling heavy bags of

516
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:37,480
soil into my gorilla grows but yeah

517
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,400
miles miles down into the gorilla grows

518
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:42,679
yeah that'll do it it's like I was

519
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,679
taking cannabis for my

520
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:51,839
cannabis but um that that was an amazing

521
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:55,640
time to be alive in California uh and as

522
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:59,678
anything you know every amazing

523
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:02,159
thing does tend to get spoiled wants it

524
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,038
you know everything yeah everything

525
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,320
changes the the only thing constant is

526
00:24:04,038 --> 00:24:08,480
change that's correct yeah but it was an

527
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:10,599
amazing time I mean it still is an

528
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,798
amazing time it's just different right I

529
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:13,839
think it's amazing there's a lot of

530
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:15,038
jaded people unfortunately and I mean I

531
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:16,199
think there's been a lot of suffering

532
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:19,440
that have happened in the industry

533
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:22,159
especially up in Humble yeah um but yeah

534
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,840
n late 990s were a special time I mean

535
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,600
even in genetics right when we talk

536
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:28,038
about the diversity that we had yeah uh

537
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:29,959
you know stuff that was in Humble was

538
00:24:28,038 --> 00:24:31,960
different mesina was different than the

539
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:34,319
bay there was more genetics and more

540
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,679
diversity but you know I feel like each

541
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:38,079
Place had their own thing Europe was

542
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:41,120
completely different and now we've got

543
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:43,720
uh we've got this this uh internet and

544
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:45,599
social media that is kind of like made

545
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:48,360
cannabis a certain way or the way we

546
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:50,519
look at it is a certain way whereas back

547
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:52,519
in the day it wasn't about how it looks

548
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:55,079
so much it was like how did it make you

549
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:57,440
feel how did it taste look was kind of

550
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:59,519
secondary I mean obviously people you

551
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,240
eat with your eyes but I feel like some

552
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:04,359
of the best stuff wasn't the most

553
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:06,720
beautiful stuff 100% the the first

554
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:08,918
impression came from opening the bag and

555
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:12,038
smelling you know and that was how I

556
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:16,919
sold every pound I've I sold in the late

557
00:25:12,038 --> 00:25:19,079
90s early 2000s it's just all that and

558
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:20,880
yeah look matters of course well when we

559
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:22,798
were kids everything was less

560
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,320
homogenized you could go to Oregan and

561
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:26,839
get different soda and different candy

562
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:28,918
and you know I mean I'm I'm from

563
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:30,519
Portland Oregon originally and coming in

564
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:32,600
the Bay Area I grew up in the Bay Area

565
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:33,679
but we would go up there and I'd be look

566
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:35,119
looking forward to get the different

567
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,440
candy when I was a little kid you know

568
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:39,038
six seven eight years old we would go on

569
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,720
road trips and there'd be different

570
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:42,919
things and cannabis was the same way

571
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,159
you'd go up to Oregon and You' get

572
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:46,720
different varieties than you would in

573
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:49,240
humbled and and then Mendo had their own

574
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,600
thing going for sure and but there was a

575
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,079
lot of breeding going on back then I

576
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:55,038
mean I think people were breeding for

577
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:56,599
like yourself for seed stock to keep the

578
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:59,240
stock alive for the next year the best

579
00:25:56,599 --> 00:26:01,199
stuff yeah I mean there hasn't been a

580
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,839
year since

581
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:08,080
97

582
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:12,000
998 where I didn't make a batch of seeds

583
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:13,918
to have for the next year and it in

584
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,000
9798 it

585
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:21,960
was cross two or three things with one

586
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,960
male even by like

587
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:28,440
200123 it started to dawn on me that I

588
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:32,360
probably should have separate places is

589
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:34,759
for separate males and and you know yeah

590
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:37,038
when I one of my gorillas got

591
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:38,000
camped uh for those that don't know that

592
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:40,000
means

593
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,319
helicopters come in and they take all

594
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,558
your all your stuff yeah Camp was an

595
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:46,359
interesting organization yeah to say the

596
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:47,879
least well what it was always humble

597
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:51,959
State University the big school in

598
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:56,200
Humble now cowply humble is doing a oral

599
00:26:51,960 --> 00:27:01,200
history study so a lot of the time when

600
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:03,759
things are so storied that that and and

601
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:07,000
like back to like our whole genetics

602
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:09,319
thing like remember the the evil company

603
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,919
phos right oh

604
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:15,918
yeah I'll go I'll come out and say it

605
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:17,880
that you know all of us I think probably

606
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:20,759
you know I spotted that a mile away

607
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,520
though absolutely did smarter man than

608
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:24,839
me I mean I went to dinner with Ellen

609
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:27,119
from you from phos multiple times they

610
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:29,359
were interested in working with me yeah

611
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:31,639
um and I just knew something wasn't

612
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:33,479
right there was just no way it didn't

613
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,480
make sense to me yeah and I ended up

614
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,839
being right you know but Rob Clark he

615
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,960
was on their board of directors I have a

616
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:42,158
lot of respect for Rob yeah and what he

617
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:45,000
does and I think maybe Ellen you know

618
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,559
Ellen's still my my friend and and even

619
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,558
she's a good person what's her name is

620
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:51,599
still Alicia right yeah um and I don't

621
00:27:49,558 --> 00:27:54,440
even hold anything against you know mle

622
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:57,319
either it was that it was a lot of

623
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:59,519
speculation about what cannabis was

624
00:27:57,319 --> 00:28:03,759
going to be and I think that they had

625
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:05,798
taken a ton of really close investment

626
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:09,480
money like getting money from your

627
00:28:05,798 --> 00:28:12,240
buddies and then all of a sudden like

628
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,759
you know no one was not as many people

629
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,558
were interested in paying for just that

630
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:18,679
genotyping service so then it was like

631
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:21,359
they didn't have I mean it was either

632
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:24,320
like screw over their friends or screw

633
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:25,639
over the Cannabis space as a whole and I

634
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:28,720
think they chose the ladder you know

635
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:30,640
what I mean which who knows like if if

636
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,480
we got in that situation what we I don't

637
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,240
know but they were too big too fast and

638
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,278
it was kind of like a with great power

639
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:39,120
comes great

640
00:28:36,278 --> 00:28:40,519
responsibility you know and so like and

641
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:42,199
but you know what I don't even believe

642
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:46,120
that they ever really had great power

643
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:48,519
and still to this day the the anecdotal

644
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:51,439
list and this was kind of where my point

645
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:54,399
was was like this anecdotal list of

646
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,640
submissions that didn't even really have

647
00:28:54,398 --> 00:29:00,038
phenotypic full genome sequencing either

648
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,038
and they they were

649
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:07,200
we can look at 8,000 Snips for 40s I

650
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:09,799
mean exactly like my florid DNA they do

651
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:13,679
2,000 and it's 80 bucks or whatever 60

652
00:29:09,798 --> 00:29:15,558
80 bucks and so what they were doing was

653
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:18,559
I mean we came to find that out pretty

654
00:29:15,558 --> 00:29:21,000
quickly because like and and Rob and

655
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:23,319
Mojave Robert Clark and Mojave they it

656
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,440
was so wild they called me up one day

657
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:27,558
and I was so honored I'm like oh my God

658
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:31,360
you know like move Richmond and Robert

659
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:33,519
Clark to talk and and they're mad at me

660
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:35,158
and I'm like wait a second what in the

661
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:37,200
world I've never even met you what what

662
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:40,480
could I have possibly done they're like

663
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:43,200
how did you get that submission that

664
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,399
just you just called it train wreck seed

665
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,640
number I don't know it's still online

666
00:29:45,398 --> 00:29:49,359
people can look this up it was like

667
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:52,640
train wreck seed number 13 and it was

668
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:54,319
like we submitted it and I don't

669
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,960
remember

670
00:29:54,319 --> 00:30:00,240
20187 or something like that 2016

671
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:03,159
probably and um yeah and we weren't like

672
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,759
super in deep with those guys I mean at

673
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:06,440
some point they were cording us just

674
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:08,798
like they were recording you we

675
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:11,320
submitted some things into the

676
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:13,359
library you know and to me I I always

677
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:15,678
knew it was anecdotal you know like of

678
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:17,599
course like and and and people would be

679
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,080
like why would you submit their genetics

680
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:21,000
they can they could take them and use

681
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:24,038
them I was like they can take them and

682
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,359
use them tomorrow by going to the

683
00:30:24,038 --> 00:30:29,200
dispensary in Arcada that has all of my

684
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:32,678
seeds and spending

685
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,759
$500 and just buying one each of

686
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:36,679
everything then they have them alive

687
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:39,480
like I'm sending them dead leaf tissue

688
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:41,519
like that's a lot less dangerous than me

689
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,519
putting my seeds in a dispensary and

690
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:45,399
they can go get them right so I'm like I

691
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:47,798
don't understand what you're telling me

692
00:30:45,398 --> 00:30:50,839
to be scared about you're right they

693
00:30:47,798 --> 00:30:53,599
were obviously there was nefariousness

694
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:55,480
involved eventually what Robert Clark

695
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:59,359
and Mojave were interested in is how I

696
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:03,360
got the exact duplicate of their very

697
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:05,199
best thing their sage and and I said I

698
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:09,439
didn't have your very best Tuple I

699
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:11,440
submitted a uh seedling that well we had

700
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:15,240
phenotyped it out so it was like from

701
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:17,840
seed and it was um a beautiful we were

702
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:21,319
creating a line that was

703
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:22,879
most reminiscent or Mo we were copying

704
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:25,079
train wck and Seed form is what we were

705
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:28,159
trying to do which um you did a lot of

706
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:30,720
that too by the way that you had a OG G

707
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:33,039
Kush and a blue dream and well you know

708
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,639
to me it just made sense I like I had

709
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:38,398
people in Humble that were had been

710
00:31:34,638 --> 00:31:41,519
growing for 20 years that were like we

711
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:45,000
love growing from seed we love growing

712
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:48,038
your seed but now all of a sudden all

713
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,119
the buyers only want OG Kush and they're

714
00:31:48,038 --> 00:31:53,000
like why can't you just make a seed that

715
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:54,959
is OG Kush and I'm like well there's no

716
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,359
reason why you can't it just takes some

717
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:01,200
time and you know back when tomatoes

718
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:04,278
were the early days of

719
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,960
tomatoes you couldn't get a seed and

720
00:32:04,278 --> 00:32:08,398
know it was going to be a cherry tomato

721
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:11,600
or know it was going to be a slicer or

722
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:14,319
know it was going to be Aroma you had to

723
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:17,079
make had to work that out and that's

724
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:18,638
making home is likea seed lines right or

725
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:22,918
stable or uniform whatever you want to

726
00:32:18,638 --> 00:32:25,240
call it and so when they said you

727
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:28,038
know people that have been growing in

728
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:30,558
the hills of humble for

729
00:32:28,038 --> 00:32:32,759
30 years and way older than me and they

730
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:35,599
were my heroes and mentors and they said

731
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:39,000
like oh man we hate growing

732
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:41,119
from these clones that we have to get

733
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
now if we want to stay competitive

734
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:45,959
because the only thing people would buy

735
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,558
is this one strain can you just make

736
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:51,679
that and so I that was the thing that

737
00:32:49,558 --> 00:32:56,278
triggered humble Seed Company to start

738
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:59,240
working on doing pure breed lines and

739
00:32:56,278 --> 00:33:01,679
yeah and having uniform warm outcomes on

740
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:04,960
seed the irony of course and this is

741
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:08,080
like once again back to my warning to uh

742
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:12,558
Bayer and senta out there like it took

743
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:15,879
me about eight years to make an OG cush

744
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:17,798
strain and and don't you're right I I

745
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,480
put probably put the name OG Kush on

746
00:33:17,798 --> 00:33:23,319
that seed pack probably before I should

747
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:26,120
have but um now I know better but it

748
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:29,319
really it did take like six to eight

749
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:31,199
generations to have the the line to

750
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:33,638
where like 100% you know like we were

751
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,960
over at Soma Hills and they're like this

752
00:33:33,638 --> 00:33:40,439
is this is all like the entire 80 plants

753
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:43,919
that we planted is OG Kush from clone

754
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:46,840
like 100% And it's all from seed but it

755
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,559
is 100% that it's very difficult to do

756
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:50,038
and I a lot of people don't understand

757
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:51,879
they're like well I just put OG Kush

758
00:33:50,038 --> 00:33:53,839
with OG Kush I S1 it it's like we're

759
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:55,760
talking about recessive traits oh no and

760
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:59,119
we're talking about a lot of difficult

761
00:33:55,759 --> 00:34:01,119
traits to make Express right

762
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:02,638
one having a clone of it and it's one

763
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:05,678
thing maybe you pop a bunch of seeds and

764
00:34:02,638 --> 00:34:08,598
you have one or two or 10 or 20 but to

765
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:10,720
make the whole progyny Express OG cush

766
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:12,280
is why there was you know DNA did a good

767
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:14,519
job with having stuff that was very

768
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:17,839
gassy and cushy but like as far as a

769
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:19,679
real OG Kush in seed form it's it's like

770
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:21,000
you can't just S1 it and expect to get

771
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,720
the results you're looking for it's same

772
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,119
thing why there's no real Sour Diesel

773
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:27,480
seeds that are the real real Sour Diesel

774
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,280
I don't care there's some good bx1

775
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,679
there's some good bx4 some guys have

776
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,399
some really good inbred sour that

777
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:36,000
they've been working on Karma genetics

778
00:34:33,398 --> 00:34:38,918
JJ from Top Dog Leo from efficient Auto

779
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,119
yeah but it's very difficult to do yeah

780
00:34:38,918 --> 00:34:43,239
and to get it express to express across

781
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,838
the board is so much more difficult than

782
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:46,439
people want to give it credit for yeah

783
00:34:44,838 --> 00:34:49,320
and you're basically like you're selling

784
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:52,639
someone a feno hunt where hopefully they

785
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:55,440
find sour in it you know and that was

786
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:59,079
not what I wanted to do with making the

787
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:02,119
OG of course by the time not making the

788
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:05,519
strain OG don't yeah but making seeds

789
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:08,280
that were uh mimicked OG as as closely

790
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:10,320
as possible and I I would like actually

791
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:12,599
if Josh G's out there listening like I

792
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,760
would love to hear if you think that we

793
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:17,320
did okay because I feel like we did

794
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:20,839
eventually but the ironic part of it was

795
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:23,320
that it was we were finished way past OG

796
00:35:20,838 --> 00:35:25,639
Kush being cool and it was just like so

797
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:27,760
now I've got but now it's coming back

798
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:29,358
back now it's coming back I think OG is

799
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,400
make it comeback in the next year I mean

800
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:33,199
it's already I'm seeing it already again

801
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,240
in flour I see people getting excited

802
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:37,838
about it I hope it does same with sour I

803
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:40,639
hope it does yeah and I hope sour comes

804
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:43,239
back but that one proved to be a lot

805
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:45,799
more difficult in my opinion it's very

806
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:49,159
very the nose on the original Sour

807
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:51,760
Diesel is something that like I don't

808
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:54,199
even think there's many many of us old

809
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,640
farts out there that even remember what

810
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:58,759
that smell was you know and it's like

811
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:01,440
you find it in you're like oh my God

812
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:03,920
this is it God takes me back to like

813
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,119
1993 you know I was hoping to have some

814
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,639
today Dave from budalo and he's up in

815
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:10,440
Yukaya I don't know if you know Dave

816
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:12,078
Dave is the steward of the sour he's the

817
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:15,358
he came to me reg on the river it was

818
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:17,880
like hey I got this basically wanted to

819
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:19,880
know what I thought of it and I was like

820
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:22,838
this is the real Sour and that was when

821
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:24,680
in that moment I realized that all these

822
00:36:22,838 --> 00:36:26,039
sour I'd seen the stuff I'd seen you

823
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:27,960
know a lot of people have given me sour

824
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:30,079
the last couple years yeah this is gassy

825
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:33,440
sour well the real Sour had a very

826
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:36,119
distinct nose that wasn't it was gassy

827
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:40,599
and it was loud but it was so complex

828
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:42,400
and so Citrus and so you know funky and

829
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:44,559
it would burn your nostrils and he has

830
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,838
that yeah and you know there's not a lot

831
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:48,159
of people that are willing to grow it or

832
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:50,119
could even grow it to that level yeah

833
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:52,838
it's it's difficult on so and that's the

834
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:55,160
thing is it's not like a really

835
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:58,000
commercially viable thing this in this

836
00:36:55,159 --> 00:37:01,759
day and age because unfortunately it's

837
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:04,599
rare that people are willing to pay

838
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:07,280
double to get to smoke like me I would

839
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:11,000
in a heartbeat because it would just

840
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:14,720
take me back to like even high school

841
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,838
you know but definitely like the early

842
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:20,199
mid 90s is well it's hard to put a price

843
00:37:16,838 --> 00:37:22,039
on an experience I know for me it's like

844
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:24,000
for especially for sour it's like I just

845
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:26,279
want I want to smoke it yeah it's great

846
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,679
that he has put it on and then you know

847
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,560
it has a shelf life and all these other

848
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:31,480
things but it's hard for to get it to

849
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:32,719
express every time like that too yeah

850
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:35,960
and it's like you know you're looking at

851
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:38,159
10 plus weeks yeah uh you know and the

852
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:40,000
structure isn't the best it's a very

853
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:42,039
finicky plant but same thing with OG and

854
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,358
I've heard OG actually expresses better

855
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:47,559
under CMH and HPS that it does under all

856
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:49,759
the new LEDs which makes perfect sense

857
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:50,719
why a lot of people yeah if they do grow

858
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,480
it they're probably not getting the

859
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:56,639
results that we're looking for with OG

860
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:59,480
kush yeah and and that you touched on

861
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:03,598
with all sour thing like if it's real

862
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:06,599
Sour it also just doesn't look the way

863
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:09,200
that people expect buds to look these

864
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:13,519
days yeah which is like you know to be

865
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:16,519
honest I got to shout out to Mario

866
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:19,159
shinsky for I always loved the way that

867
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:22,239
like those you know kind of like cookie

868
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:25,039
crosses that came out of um gelato and

869
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:26,439
sunset sherbet yeah yeah and and like I

870
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:29,920
was

871
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:32,480
really taken by how beautiful that

872
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:35,639
cannabis looked yeah um and and the

873
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:38,800
smells are great too but that set a kind

874
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:41,159
of a difficult standard for like you

875
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:44,079
know when people are used to seeing the

876
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:47,159
Cannabis that looks that kind of cool in

877
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:50,280
a dispensary than if they were to see

878
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:52,399
sour and not have the background of of

879
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:55,519
us of being like smelling it and knowing

880
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:58,639
like whoa this is going to have a a

881
00:38:55,519 --> 00:39:01,759
really different if effect than what

882
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:04,440
you're used to um and and Trigger like a

883
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,920
whole different set of cannaboid

884
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:10,280
receptors in your mind which you know

885
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:12,519
like uh my business partner Ben and and

886
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:16,560
hie and everybody a bunch of us went to

887
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:22,280
Morocco and now I'm Tang I'm tanging but

888
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:26,279
uh like cannabis is a Pandora box of

889
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:29,079
capability and uh you know we got over

890
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:30,560
there and seeing what they are growing

891
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:33,680
over there the plants that they're

892
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:35,880
growing just such a different animal but

893
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:39,239
but you know they want to make a hash

894
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:43,119
only no such thing as trimmed buds at

895
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:45,838
all ever no you got to wash it they not

896
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:47,318
not wash it but they process it so the

897
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:49,920
static machines are what's going to blow

898
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:52,119
up over there because it automates their

899
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,519
process you know I think yeah it's it's

900
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:56,599
a different world over there and what

901
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:58,480
genetics work over there and compared to

902
00:39:56,599 --> 00:39:59,800
here is completely just different yeah

903
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,800
it's completely

904
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:06,400
different it wasn't a conventional I got

905
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:09,680
high from smoking it it was like just a

906
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:12,760
totally different feeling than what I

907
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:14,838
get when I smoke cannabis yeah you know

908
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:17,040
we're going to spark up right oh yeah

909
00:40:14,838 --> 00:40:21,358
yeah I'm not sure what we're about to

910
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:24,318
smoke yeah but for those folks out there

911
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:28,838
that think that like THC is what you

912
00:40:24,318 --> 00:40:31,759
should be shopping for or even like what

913
00:40:28,838 --> 00:40:35,838
the lab said the Turpin profile was or

914
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:39,000
anything it's just our science and in in

915
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:41,719
the Cannabis space yeah and don't get me

916
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,280
wrong like I have so much respect for

917
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:47,799
the folks that are out there doing the

918
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:51,000
lab work and pushing the right you know

919
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:53,560
understanding of what cannabis does but

920
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,838
you have to have to have to try it

921
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:56,880
before you pass any judgment or anything

922
00:40:55,838 --> 00:40:59,039
like that because I mean I know a

923
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,480
million people that would have looked at

924
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:04,358
that what they call belda out there

925
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:06,559
which is like the local uh Moroccan type

926
00:41:04,358 --> 00:41:08,279
cannabis and they probably would have

927
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:11,519
just been like I'm not even GNA bother

928
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:14,000
smoking that I'm not whatever and and

929
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:17,679
and would have totally missed out on

930
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:21,159
just a completely different experience

931
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:24,118
yeah from Cannabis so Dave from budalo

932
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:25,838
in Yukaya he's dude he's great cuz he

933
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:27,640
does long flyering varieties right so

934
00:41:25,838 --> 00:41:30,119
he's all about long fllying varieties an

935
00:41:27,639 --> 00:41:31,598
effect and I think we need to go back in

936
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:33,358
that direction to like how does it make

937
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:34,838
you feel yeah you know it's like with

938
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:36,239
fenal hunts like I smoke joints with

939
00:41:34,838 --> 00:41:38,078
people and I'm like well how does it

940
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:40,239
taste how does it make you feel yeah I

941
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:42,200
feel like the future for us especially

942
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:45,559
for some of this magic is to share it

943
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:48,598
with people in pre-rolls or hand rolls

944
00:41:45,559 --> 00:41:50,400
to where they get to experience it with

945
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:53,160
the you know as far as like everyone

946
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:55,160
wants convenience so having a a pen

947
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:57,399
that's great having a a joint is even

948
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:58,960
better in my opinion and then you get to

949
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,838
experience it for what it should be you

950
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,639
should be able to overlook the way it

951
00:42:00,838 --> 00:42:05,880
looks on social media I mean whatever

952
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:07,879
like people like the way stuff looks but

953
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,640
I feel like effect is just so much more

954
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:11,920
important and there's stuff like white

955
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:13,879
Thorn roses kind of taking over you know

956
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,280
Johnny Johnny's great you know he's been

957
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:18,160
on the podcast and really like every

958
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:21,240
single podcast somebody brings a white

959
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:23,440
Thorn Rose yeah and it's Feelgood weed

960
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:25,558
it's stuff that makes you feel great you

961
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,800
know it's like it's not you can't

962
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:29,960
categorize it as an indicia or TAA it's

963
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,960
not your typical run-of-the-mill thing

964
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,838
but it's one of those things that makes

965
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,400
you feel amazing yeah and it's like

966
00:42:32,838 --> 00:42:36,639
that's a lot like our blueberry muffin

967
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:39,960
strain which is always been just like to

968
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:42,358
me the most comforting cannabis high

969
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:44,559
that that you I've ever you know and and

970
00:42:42,358 --> 00:42:46,679
Johnny's White thn Rose I like it's

971
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:49,720
amazing and and a lot of these things

972
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:53,598
what I try to remind people is like look

973
00:42:49,719 --> 00:42:56,759
when you're swimming in different weed

974
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:59,640
all around you all the time and you have

975
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:02,400
a mill jars of strains and things that

976
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:04,759
you can try from and you don't you're

977
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:07,039
not just after getting as high as you

978
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:10,000
can quickly and and I think like what we

979
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:12,000
see with people going after like you

980
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,239
know just walking into a dispensary and

981
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,838
being like what's your highest CHC thing

982
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:19,639
it's kind of like I I don't know this

983
00:43:16,838 --> 00:43:23,239
for sure but I could easily imagine when

984
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:26,279
PE when they stopped prohibiting alcohol

985
00:43:23,239 --> 00:43:28,679
in the US that people probably were like

986
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:31,599
I mean during prob for example people

987
00:43:28,679 --> 00:43:33,759
for sure only were drinking hard stuff

988
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:35,640
you know or only moving hard stuff

989
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,280
around the heart of the better because

990
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:41,440
you know you're hiding it um and even

991
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:45,400
I'm sure you know in the first time

992
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:48,000
during legalization of of alcohol that

993
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:50,440
people probably it probably took a long

994
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,318
time for fine wine to really make a

995
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:53,639
comeback you know the government made it

996
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:56,358
difficult too I think they made it

997
00:43:53,639 --> 00:43:57,639
extremely difficult but but bardi 151 is

998
00:43:56,358 --> 00:44:00,039
not the number one sell are in the

999
00:43:57,639 --> 00:44:01,440
liquor store God thank God and I don't

1000
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:03,279
think the strongest cannabis is going to

1001
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,480
be like that either year from now it

1002
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:08,720
might be the strongest selling thing

1003
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:12,280
in I don't know I mean I don't know

1004
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:14,679
anybody that drinks 151 or ever clear

1005
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:18,960
but it's just it seems like if you're if

1006
00:44:14,679 --> 00:44:22,639
you're like you know only if you're just

1007
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:25,559
trying to achieve one goal which is to

1008
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:29,159
just INE inebriate yourself and forget

1009
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:30,920
about your suround young young people

1010
00:44:29,159 --> 00:44:33,000
maybe they like Long Island Ice teas you

1011
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:34,838
know that kind of thing but but yeah I

1012
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,239
think most of us the more sophisticated

1013
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:40,358
the more your pallette becomes educated

1014
00:44:38,239 --> 00:44:41,838
the less you're worried about the THC

1015
00:44:40,358 --> 00:44:43,558
percentage blueberry muffin's a great

1016
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:46,000
one I did some crosses with it I was

1017
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:47,200
hoping to have samples for you today uh

1018
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,239
because I feel like those clones are

1019
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:51,439
kind of special and so the finished

1020
00:44:49,239 --> 00:44:53,838
flower yeah I mean I love that I I got

1021
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,800
it I think I told the story on the

1022
00:44:53,838 --> 00:44:57,279
podcast with hie but I got blueberry

1023
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,359
muffin on axent I was trying toy by a

1024
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,920
clone of DJ shorts blueberry oh yeah I

1025
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:02,639
grew it out and I'm like this isn't it

1026
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:04,159
but this is pretty freaking special

1027
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:06,318
smells like blueberry muffins and turns

1028
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:08,318
out it was blueberry muffin yeah

1029
00:45:06,318 --> 00:45:11,119
everybody always assumes that we made it

1030
00:45:08,318 --> 00:45:12,400
out of TJ schs blueberry no there's no

1031
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:14,358
and we didn't have anything to do with

1032
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,599
that one and as much as you know like

1033
00:45:14,358 --> 00:45:17,598
it's funny because my wife who just

1034
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:20,359
dropped me off was very very close with

1035
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:21,838
DJ Short and she was just like he's

1036
00:45:20,358 --> 00:45:23,519
gonna want to kick your butt if you name

1037
00:45:21,838 --> 00:45:26,480
a stram blueberry muffin hun and I'm

1038
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:29,800
like and and then we actually met up

1039
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:32,199
with DJ short and he was just like what

1040
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,559
no [ __ ] do it man like what are you

1041
00:45:32,199 --> 00:45:35,598
talking about you can't name that

1042
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:37,599
anything else though cuz it's it smells

1043
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:39,240
exactly it smells exactly like that's

1044
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:41,200
what frustrates me with names now when

1045
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:43,000
somebody takes a name and then you have

1046
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:44,639
something that's that fits that

1047
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,760
description better because all the names

1048
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:48,318
are kind of taken from pling things you

1049
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:50,319
know you can't name something apple

1050
00:45:48,318 --> 00:45:52,079
crisp or apple pie because there's

1051
00:45:50,318 --> 00:45:54,079
probably five apple pies out there even

1052
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:56,160
if yours smells more like apple pie I

1053
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:57,800
know Kung chicken that's that I don't

1054
00:45:56,159 --> 00:46:00,399
know if that's taking but I've seen some

1055
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:03,800
kungpow chicken turps heck yeah man oh

1056
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:06,240
my God hie found this bizarre TP we were

1057
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:07,960
doing a big big hunt and she finds this

1058
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:10,719
one and she's just like what the heck

1059
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:13,519
this smells like a Sal like salami like

1060
00:46:10,719 --> 00:46:15,239
spoton and you know who in the world

1061
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:17,880
like would even want cannabis that

1062
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:20,558
smells like salami I mean we did try to

1063
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:24,519
get we got a qu Itali Italians they

1064
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:27,359
probably should that's true but um the

1065
00:46:24,519 --> 00:46:31,358
this plant is amazing and just a little

1066
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:33,358
like factoid that you know you probably

1067
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:37,719
know I mean you wrote the book on the

1068
00:46:33,358 --> 00:46:40,159
topic I always reiterate this one though

1069
00:46:37,719 --> 00:46:42,399
because I I think it's special cannabis

1070
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:47,558
is like one of

1071
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:51,039
six% of the plant kingdom that does not

1072
00:46:47,559 --> 00:46:53,640
screw itself on the regular or or is

1073
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:56,239
unlikely to screw itself so it's like

1074
00:46:53,639 --> 00:46:58,960
because it has a male and a female on

1075
00:46:56,239 --> 00:47:01,598
two SE separate plants that's really

1076
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:03,599
pretty rare it's like 94% of plants just

1077
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:06,318
like us for the most part just well

1078
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:09,440
humans dasis versus monious though yeah

1079
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:14,199
for sure yeah so it's ious versus manous

1080
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:18,119
and you know genetically that leads to

1081
00:47:14,199 --> 00:47:21,399
the potential for a lot more you know

1082
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:24,800
genetic paths to you know diverence or

1083
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:28,960
whatever you want to call it and with

1084
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:32,680
cannabis is like connection to humanity

1085
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:37,440
which I feel like is really really deep

1086
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:41,078
um it makes sense that we have all of

1087
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:42,559
these different Turpin profiles and and

1088
00:47:41,079 --> 00:47:44,559
yeah you know all these other amazing

1089
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:47,079
things that we're discovering beyond

1090
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:49,680
turpens that are just as important or

1091
00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:51,359
more important and and then even the

1092
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:52,879
most important thing is just at the end

1093
00:47:51,358 --> 00:47:57,558
of the day what it does to you when you

1094
00:47:52,880 --> 00:48:00,640
consume it or and how you know it's Med

1095
00:47:57,559 --> 00:48:03,000
medicinal for us as people and

1096
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:04,759
therapeutic for us as people and and

1097
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:08,719
freaking you know

1098
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:10,680
salami smelling cannabis you know I

1099
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:13,519
wouldn't want it to go away I want all

1100
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:15,960
the options we can get you know I agree

1101
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:18,079
yeah yeah all these different colors you

1102
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:20,240
know if you're a painter the more colors

1103
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:23,079
the better yes soami mother's Magnolia

to get that effect and this stuff for

1133
00:49:26,318 --> 00:49:30,639
whatever

1134
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:34,920
reason we did this soil versus cocoa my

1135
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:36,440
my buddies SF Cana did a trial in a room

1136
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:39,000
the only variable they changed which is

1137
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:41,960
the way you do a real trial is to tra

1138
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:46,119
yeah change one variable and they uh use

1139
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:48,358
soil versus cocoa uhuh and I really

1140
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:51,318
enjoy the soil so this is dirty Skittles

1141
00:49:48,358 --> 00:49:53,679
huh dirty Skittles I like the name yeah

1142
00:49:51,318 --> 00:49:55,279
and you know it's like I love Coco too I

1143
00:49:53,679 --> 00:49:57,440
have no no problem with I use rockwool

1144
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:59,798
for my moms and we do for for clones we

1145
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:03,880
use Rock Wool ston Wool

1146
00:49:59,798 --> 00:50:03,880
grodan shout out to my friends over at

1147
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:12,680
grodan but yeah there's something

1148
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:15,799
special about soil and especially for

1149
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:17,159
flavor I don't think soil always looks

1150
00:50:15,798 --> 00:50:19,318
necessarily the best but as far as

1151
00:50:17,159 --> 00:50:21,719
effect and flavor you get different

1152
00:50:19,318 --> 00:50:24,440
Expressions regardless of what you use

1153
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:25,679
for substrate it's different soil versus

1154
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:27,880
cocoa versus Rock you're getting

1155
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:28,960
different effect different Expressions

1156
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:31,440
so

1157
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:34,440
true it's the beauty of the plant man I

1158
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:36,838
mean and and it's like not just genetics

1159
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:39,440
too it's environment a lot of things

1160
00:50:36,838 --> 00:50:41,400
come into it environment nutrition ter

1161
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:43,599
they would say environment nutrition

1162
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:45,960
dictate phenotypes right it's like if

1163
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:47,680
we're talking about chemotypes that can

1164
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:49,599
be a whole another thing right you can

1165
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:52,118
you can have I think those things play

1166
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:54,640
into that a little bit too for sure for

1167
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:57,599
sure whereas the genotypes they stay the

1168
00:50:54,639 --> 00:51:00,598
genotypes yes true that I mean there

1169
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:02,559
what epigenetic changes can

1170
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:04,359
occur yeah we started talking about

1171
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:07,359
genetic drift that we go down that

1172
00:51:04,358 --> 00:51:09,039
rabbit hole U and then epigenetic

1173
00:51:07,358 --> 00:51:11,119
changes and then how tissue culture can

1174
00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:13,239
play a part in that I used to be really

1175
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:14,599
good at that you knock the Rings through

1176
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:16,318
the Rings I could knock the Rings

1177
00:51:14,599 --> 00:51:19,400
through the Rings and all that stuff and

1178
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:22,000
then it like then all the The Vape

1179
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:23,639
people were like experts Wizards at it

1180
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,960
and then I then I was kind of like oh

1181
00:51:23,639 --> 00:51:28,519
man they start ruined it for us lead

1182
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:30,559
heads Mak drawings in the air with stuff

1183
00:51:28,519 --> 00:51:33,679
it's wild it's wild yeah I mean how

1184
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:36,000
things evolve I mean back when like uh

1185
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:38,679
Texas holdom was really big you know and

1186
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,639
and all my friends would always and I

1187
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:43,639
liked playing it I I wasn't like super

1188
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:45,199
into it but I like going for the social

1189
00:51:43,639 --> 00:51:47,199
aspect of sitting around with a bunch of

1190
00:51:45,199 --> 00:51:50,558
buddies and and playing a game to hold

1191
00:51:47,199 --> 00:51:53,679
them and or turny or whatever and uh

1192
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:55,359
that was the thing we be like so thick

1193
00:51:53,679 --> 00:51:57,919
the room would be so thick you could cut

1194
00:51:55,358 --> 00:52:00,078
the smoke you know and and just all of

1195
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:02,838
us just playing around blowing smoke

1196
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:05,079
rings across the table we got good at it

1197
00:52:02,838 --> 00:52:08,880
for sure and then the vaporizers ruined

1198
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:10,640
it dabs vaporizing you know they it's

1199
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:14,039
just it's gone in an interesting

1200
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:15,519
Direction and it keeps getting uh more

1201
00:52:14,039 --> 00:52:17,880
interesting and evolves further and

1202
00:52:15,519 --> 00:52:19,599
further and further like the enails and

1203
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:22,838
then all of a sudden we've got these

1204
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:25,519
yeah uh electric you know dab devices

1205
00:52:22,838 --> 00:52:28,318
yeah really cool stuff I Vape I mean I'm

1206
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:30,639
not like against it but uh it just

1207
00:52:28,318 --> 00:52:32,838
wasn't the same as it was well I'm happy

1208
00:52:30,639 --> 00:52:35,759
that joint I love I'll never stop

1209
00:52:32,838 --> 00:52:38,279
smoking weed through a a joint no I feel

1210
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:40,839
like that's the best way to identify the

1211
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:42,640
flaws yeah are are you know whether it's

1212
00:52:40,838 --> 00:52:44,480
in the genetics or whether it's with the

1213
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:47,480
cultivation of it that's true drawing in

1214
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:50,798
the keing it's easier to have it's like

1215
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:54,639
simple to have flavors Express well yeah

1216
00:52:50,798 --> 00:52:57,599
in uh you know rosin or live resin

1217
00:52:54,639 --> 00:53:01,879
or Vapes maybe it's not as easy cuz I've

1218
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:04,599
had some terrible Vapes too but um yeah

1219
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:05,960
no you're right joints is like the test

1220
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:08,079
true good point I never thought of it

1221
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:10,798
that way yeah I mean I enjoy smoking a

1222
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:12,318
good joint and also like uh how far down

1223
00:53:10,798 --> 00:53:14,000
does it still taste good when you

1224
00:53:12,318 --> 00:53:16,318
relight it does it taste good when you

1225
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,880
light it up the next day totally all

1226
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:19,519
those things and and how does the flavor

1227
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:21,480
change because some stuff it smells

1228
00:53:19,519 --> 00:53:23,599
great and then or it smells good and

1229
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:25,358
then you go to light it and sometimes

1230
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:27,039
even off the first hit purple punch is

1231
00:53:25,358 --> 00:53:29,318
my you know I talk about a lot on the

1232
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:30,798
show but it's a big let down for me as

1233
00:53:29,318 --> 00:53:33,558
far as like it it's a beautiful looking

1234
00:53:30,798 --> 00:53:35,440
plant so from a cultivator perspective

1235
00:53:33,559 --> 00:53:37,720
yeah dud purple punches where it's at

1236
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:39,480
it's like looks beautiful yeah it smells

1237
00:53:37,719 --> 00:53:42,679
pretty good in fact the rosin and the

1238
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:44,400
extract is decent but the joint when you

1239
00:53:42,679 --> 00:53:45,679
have a joint and a lot of stuff that's

1240
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,079
breed with it has this too where you

1241
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:48,719
light it up and then all of a sudden

1242
00:53:47,079 --> 00:53:51,798
you're like where's the chirps chirps

1243
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:53,480
are missing so true and so you know and

1244
00:53:51,798 --> 00:53:55,960
that's that goes to like what we've been

1245
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:57,280
talking about you know as far as beay

1246
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:59,119
and all these companies that want to

1247
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,440
look at stuff I think a lot of people

1248
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:02,079
are like well let's just breed with the

1249
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:03,519
data it doesn't work like that you

1250
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:06,400
cannot just breed with the data because

1251
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:08,960
it's so subjective and on paper a lot of

1252
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:10,440
stuff looks great I mean even on on

1253
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,199
Instagram a lot of stuff looks great

1254
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:15,358
that's not you know so we get we get all

1255
00:54:12,199 --> 00:54:16,639
this variation that is very subjective

1256
00:54:15,358 --> 00:54:18,119
to the individual and it takes somebody

1257
00:54:16,639 --> 00:54:20,400
who knows what they're talking about to

1258
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:23,480
go through knows what they're looking at

1259
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:28,358
smoking smelling tasting experiencing

1260
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:30,400
true yeah I me imagine that two seasoned

1261
00:54:28,358 --> 00:54:34,000
cannabis veterans sitting here talking

1262
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:36,280
about how important it is to be seasoned

1263
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,880
cannabis no but there's it's like

1264
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:40,480
undeniable that it's true and and when

1265
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:42,000
some of these kids learn real quick i'

1266
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,798
I've see some of these younger guys like

1267
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,358
they're like oh well I like this stuff I

1268
00:54:43,798 --> 00:54:47,079
like this stuff and I don't like this

1269
00:54:45,358 --> 00:54:49,239
stuff and they they develop a palet

1270
00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:51,000
really quickly but it's also data points

1271
00:54:49,239 --> 00:54:53,598
like uh you know you come from a science

1272
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,960
background I'm a chef but have a lot of

1273
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:57,039
experience in science and it's like the

1274
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:59,199
more data points you have the better

1275
00:54:57,039 --> 00:55:01,079
and so experiencing it's the same way

1276
00:54:59,199 --> 00:55:02,519
the more times you tried it you have a

1277
00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:04,720
better idea of what you like and what

1278
00:55:02,519 --> 00:55:07,000
you don't like yeah um you know it's

1279
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:10,239
like if you have you know a year of

1280
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:12,400
experience it doesn't really add up to

1281
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:14,439
having a complete pallet yeah and then

1282
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:16,240
with outdoor it's like every year is a

1283
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:17,760
little bit different you know so if you

1284
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:18,959
grow the same thing Outdoors every year

1285
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:21,079
it's slightly different you really need

1286
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,599
to experience it multiple years to fully

1287
00:55:21,079 --> 00:55:26,798
understand that plant well that's the

1288
00:55:22,599 --> 00:55:29,240
truth and people ask us a lot you as

1289
00:55:26,798 --> 00:55:31,920
well I'm sure about you know what can I

1290
00:55:29,239 --> 00:55:36,639
grow this year that will finish at this

1291
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:39,119
certain time or has a resistance to PM

1292
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:41,558
be Petrus whatever it is you know that

1293
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:44,119
that got him the year before now you

1294
00:55:41,559 --> 00:55:47,440
know the the septoria was never really a

1295
00:55:44,119 --> 00:55:50,440
thing for anybody that in California at

1296
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:52,400
least like not traditionally it's coming

1297
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:54,559
out here I've been really surprised to

1298
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:57,240
see it so often lately and I feel like

1299
00:55:54,559 --> 00:56:01,798
it's almost like a more d ous monster

1300
00:55:57,239 --> 00:56:04,719
than the Hop Leon like yeah septoria is

1301
00:56:01,798 --> 00:56:06,599
gnarly but um that's a whole another

1302
00:56:04,719 --> 00:56:09,439
topic I guess what we were talking about

1303
00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:12,838
was uh the reactionary

1304
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:15,880
overcorrect that happens so often in

1305
00:56:12,838 --> 00:56:20,279
cannabis and it's nobody's fault I don't

1306
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:24,480
ever fault a grower but how many years

1307
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:29,519
did I have it just dump rain in you know

1308
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:32,318
on October 10 and then like two days

1309
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:34,719
later it was 85 again outside and

1310
00:56:32,318 --> 00:56:36,318
everything just molded yeah and then the

1311
00:56:34,719 --> 00:56:39,639
next year I just was like I'm not

1312
00:56:36,318 --> 00:56:41,599
growing anything that finishes later

1313
00:56:39,639 --> 00:56:43,519
than this certain day when the stuff

1314
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:46,519
molded or whatever it happened last year

1315
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:49,358
and then the next year it dumps

1316
00:56:46,519 --> 00:56:50,719
September 20th and yeah all the stuff

1317
00:56:49,358 --> 00:56:52,639
that you

1318
00:56:50,719 --> 00:56:55,239
Knowle Auto

1319
00:56:52,639 --> 00:56:57,480
flowers there's that well it was like

1320
00:56:55,239 --> 00:56:59,279
you'd always have a still a couple ones

1321
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:01,599
that were the the late ones because you

1322
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:04,000
had to grow them and uh those ones would

1323
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:06,039
just be beautiful and totally clean even

1324
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,519
though they got rained on yeah they

1325
00:57:06,039 --> 00:57:09,160
might get get crushed by rain but they

1326
00:57:07,519 --> 00:57:11,199
don't get any metritis they don't get

1327
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:13,519
any PM it like did them good you're like

1328
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:15,558
oh man they did it so that's exactly

1329
00:57:13,519 --> 00:57:17,599
what you were saying was sort of like uh

1330
00:57:15,559 --> 00:57:21,359
having not all your eggs in one basket

1331
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:23,119
or not all your turps in one genre and

1332
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:24,598
and all of those things data driven

1333
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:26,000
breeding towards some of these goals

1334
00:57:24,599 --> 00:57:28,000
like we want but the beautiful thing

1335
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:31,039
about Coastal environments like up in

1336
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:33,760
Humble you can really test for petritis

1337
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:37,000
and PM resistant plants yeah but from

1338
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:39,160
one Ridge to the next as we had Johnny

1339
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:41,039
and Jason talk about from Huckleberry

1340
00:57:39,159 --> 00:57:43,239
and ridg line it's like the plant will

1341
00:57:41,039 --> 00:57:44,240
Express differently so there's all these

1342
00:57:43,239 --> 00:57:46,358
different variables and with

1343
00:57:44,239 --> 00:57:48,879
microclimates you don't know exactly how

1344
00:57:46,358 --> 00:57:50,558
the plant's going to perform and then

1345
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,280
that gets us into another interesting

1346
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:54,079
conversation which is land race

1347
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:55,680
preservation I know you're doing some

1348
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:57,798
land race preservation working with land

1349
00:57:55,679 --> 00:58:00,519
race my business friend Ben has been

1350

1358
00:58:18,838 --> 00:58:22,119
think there's people that are willing to

1359
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,639
give back and people to share and you

1360
00:58:22,119 --> 00:58:25,559
know and not expecting anything in

1361
00:58:23,639 --> 00:58:28,440
return like that's the culture that's

1362
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:31,200
real can anabis culture right there is

1363
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:33,440
and and I know I'm sure my daughter

1364
00:58:31,199 --> 00:58:36,239
talked all about you know the $1,700

1365
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:40,079
pies auctions for the elementary school

1366
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:43,919
and absolutely you know paying $1,700

1367
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:45,760
for a blackberry pie so that the school

1368
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:48,880
gets to have a field trip again this

1369
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:51,240
year that's paying taxes I don't care

1370
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:54,880
how you look at it and so you know there

1371
00:58:51,239 --> 00:58:58,798
was a time when people grumbled a lot

1372
00:58:54,880 --> 00:59:01,200
about the prop 215 and and you know all

1373
00:58:58,798 --> 00:59:02,960
those dope Growers just they don't pay

1374
00:59:01,199 --> 00:59:06,000
taxes on it and all that this that and

1375
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:08,880
the other well there was a lot of taxing

1376
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:12,480
happening self taxing excuse me and um

1377
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:15,000
it changed so much in Humble um the

1378
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:17,838
economy you know I appreciate actually

1379
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:22,440
what you said about um one of the

1380
00:59:17,838 --> 00:59:25,599
hardest hit places because it really was

1381
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:27,519
um you know as a county whatever you

1382
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:29,359
want to call whole Emeral triangle as a

1383
00:59:27,519 --> 00:59:30,599
community as a county whatever however

1384
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:33,679
you want to put it however you want to

1385
00:59:30,599 --> 00:59:36,000
put it we were so because of humble in a

1386
00:59:33,679 --> 00:59:36,838
lot of ways in some ways yeah and and we

1387
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:41,358
were

1388
00:59:36,838 --> 00:59:43,920
so uh dependent on it and I don't know

1389
00:59:41,358 --> 00:59:47,078
how much some of like our County

1390
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:49,000
officials and and these aren't even

1391
00:59:47,079 --> 00:59:50,440
people that are like far removed from

1392
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,039
from the culture and everything like

1393
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:54,519
there's we have

1394
00:59:52,039 --> 00:59:58,960
definitely uh County Supervisors for

1395
00:59:54,519 --> 01:00:04,079
example who you know are full total

1396
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:08,039
supporters if not partakers in cannabis

1397
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:11,480
and um they didn't even I think have any

1398
01:00:08,039 --> 01:00:15,400
idea how much a town like Garberville

1399
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:17,719
was dependent on the economy of the

1400
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:20,079
Cannabis economy the Cannabis economy

1401
01:00:17,719 --> 01:00:23,759
whether it was pre pro pre you know

1402
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:26,760
recreational legalization or or post

1403
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:29,319
that there was those taxes self taxes

1404
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:32,760
were staying right there and helping the

1405
01:00:29,318 --> 01:00:35,480
schools helping fire departments helping

1406
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:38,319
all of these you know sort of Public

1407
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:41,639
Services then not to mention you know

1408
01:00:38,318 --> 01:00:44,079
tons of money spent at small business

1409
01:00:41,639 --> 01:00:47,480
that thrived in Humble we actually had

1410
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:50,079
the highest concentration of nonprofit

1411
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:51,920
groups in the entire United States in

1412
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:53,798
Humble County for a time I'm not sure if

1413
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:57,559
it's still that way probably

1414
01:00:53,798 --> 01:01:01,440
is so there was a lot of that and now

1415
01:00:57,559 --> 01:01:05,319
there's just no way that folks like

1416
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:07,240
Jason and and Johnny and and for that

1417
01:01:05,318 --> 01:01:11,480
matter people that are even like a lot

1418
01:01:07,239 --> 01:01:15,879
less well-known right uh cultivators out

1419
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:18,679
in the hills of humble could ever even

1420
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:22,000
be asked like I mean we've had to cancel

1421
01:01:18,679 --> 01:01:25,558
our County you know acreage or square

1422
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:27,760
foot tax for the last like five years

1423
01:01:25,559 --> 01:01:30,039
for four or five years which a lot of us

1424
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:31,720
Growers like wanted to pay it we were

1425
01:01:30,039 --> 01:01:35,319
more than willing and there wasn't a lot

1426
01:01:31,719 --> 01:01:37,639
of argument from the Cannabis Community

1427
01:01:35,318 --> 01:01:40,679
uh like my wife is on a long lived

1428
01:01:37,639 --> 01:01:43,279
Environmental Group and worked there for

1429
01:01:40,679 --> 01:01:46,679
close to 20 years now and uh put they

1430
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:48,400
put um all the tree sits and Woody

1431
01:01:46,679 --> 01:01:51,598
harelson up locking himself to the

1432
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:54,358
Golden Gate Bridge to protect redwoods

1433
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:56,880
and and um you know Bonnie R playing the

1434
01:01:54,358 --> 01:01:59,119
concert every single summer her her

1435
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:01,519
great story is that you know how many

1436
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:04,160
times someone would just come into the

1437
01:02:01,519 --> 01:02:06,920
to the office where that was a lot of

1438
01:02:04,159 --> 01:02:08,000
that was coordinated from and just drop

1439
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:11,720
off a

1440
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:14,880
non-descript brown paper bag and you

1441
01:02:11,719 --> 01:02:17,199
open it up and they they no names no

1442
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:20,960
nothing out the door but it was like big

1443
01:02:17,199 --> 01:02:24,798
sacks of of cash to help you know do

1444
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:26,318
this like pro bono from the thriving

1445
01:02:24,798 --> 01:02:27,960
cannabis economy from the thriving

1446
01:02:26,318 --> 01:02:30,000
cannabis County and I'm not saying it

1447
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:32,240
has to go back to that I believe in

1448
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,719
taxes and I believe in you know the

1449
01:02:32,239 --> 01:02:36,358
local government and the way that things

1450
01:02:33,719 --> 01:02:39,000
have worked up but but no one knew how

1451
01:02:36,358 --> 01:02:42,078
difficult it was going to be made by

1452
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:44,159
onerous regulation and there were also a

1453
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:47,000
lot of promises that weren't kept like

1454
01:02:44,159 --> 01:02:51,278
namely one of the biggest arguments for

1455
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:53,079
the prop 64 that was within the space

1456
01:02:51,278 --> 01:02:56,000
that we were in which was the growing

1457
01:02:53,079 --> 01:02:58,359
Community yeah which we had the most to

1458
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:03,159
gain or lose probably because we could

1459
01:02:58,358 --> 01:03:06,199
lose like the way that we interacted for

1460
01:03:03,159 --> 01:03:08,078
many years with the plant and then for

1461
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:10,480
probably if you were like me for the

1462
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:12,318
most part the way that we interacted

1463
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:14,599
economically although you know like I

1464
01:03:12,318 --> 01:03:17,358
always had a job with the you know doing

1465
01:03:14,599 --> 01:03:19,798
salmon biology stuff but that wasn't

1466
01:03:17,358 --> 01:03:22,920
really just to be honest paying all the

1467
01:03:19,798 --> 01:03:24,719
bills right uh so I was a music teacher

1468
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:27,079
for a short while at a school a local

1469
01:03:24,719 --> 01:03:28,959
school not like a real accredited but

1470
01:03:27,079 --> 01:03:31,480
that was just another way to put some

1471
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:32,960
money in the pocket but cannabis put

1472
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:35,559
cannabis put the food on the table put

1473
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:38,358
the food on the table but yeah it it

1474
01:03:35,559 --> 01:03:39,880
allowed you know I look at the

1475
01:03:38,358 --> 01:03:43,000
generation that's coming up right now

1476
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:44,640
and I can understand why people are

1477
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:48,719
there's a lot of like feels like a lot

1478
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:51,199
of unrest in in their country because I

1479
01:03:48,719 --> 01:03:55,199
just don't feel like there's equity and

1480
01:03:51,199 --> 01:03:58,199
like being able to own land or or own a

1481
01:03:55,199 --> 01:04:00,480
home is just so Out Of Reach I think it

1482
01:03:58,199 --> 01:04:04,399
feels that way at least for so many

1483
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:06,760
people that are young that you know if I

1484
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:09,160
was young right now that might be you

1485
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:12,839
know a passion that I would follow would

1486
01:04:09,159 --> 01:04:15,798
be trying to create more more Equity at

1487
01:04:12,838 --> 01:04:19,278
the time when I came out west and and

1488
01:04:15,798 --> 01:04:22,278
even before I moved out west I had I was

1489
01:04:19,278 --> 01:04:25,719
sort of imp passionate about nature and

1490
01:04:22,278 --> 01:04:29,000
yeah and and I still am of course but um

1491
01:04:25,719 --> 01:04:30,759
people got to live too so got on another

1492
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,920
tangent boy that that's some good stuff

1493
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:34,920
I like the dirty Skittles it's good it's

1494
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:37,039
dirty yeah it's good it's got good TPS

1495
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:38,760
it's yeah I mean you can't go wrong with

1496
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:40,559
people that say they don't like Skittles

1497
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:42,920
have not tasted this because it's it's

1498
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:46,519
hard if you like cannabis and you like

1499
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:48,039
candy it's pretty candy oh it's candy I

1500
01:04:46,519 --> 01:04:49,838
mean I think people that say they don't

1501
01:04:48,039 --> 01:04:52,480
like Skittles probably have tried to

1502
01:04:49,838 --> 01:04:54,278
grow it because it's not it's a pain in

1503
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:56,039
the neck to grow it's a pain in the ass

1504
01:04:54,278 --> 01:04:57,679
the plant is a pain in the ass I know if

1505
01:04:56,039 --> 01:04:59,760
anybody would argue with me on that one

1506
01:04:57,679 --> 01:05:01,759
when breeding breeding with Skittles you

1507
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,839
can find the Skittles Expressions real

1508
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:04,720
easily because they're the ones that

1509
01:05:02,838 --> 01:05:06,679
grow the shittiest they're the ones that

1510
01:05:04,719 --> 01:05:08,199
that look ugly you I can spot them

1511
01:05:06,679 --> 01:05:10,199
typically with my crosses and I've done

1512
01:05:08,199 --> 01:05:12,519
a bunch of work with Skittles trying to

1513
01:05:10,199 --> 01:05:14,000
tease out the Skittles turbs totally

1514
01:05:12,519 --> 01:05:16,519
it's like the ones that are real Skittle

1515
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:19,278
they all look like Skittles yeah so

1516
01:05:16,519 --> 01:05:21,440
wimpy and harded can't I can't take it

1517
01:05:19,278 --> 01:05:24,199
it's too bright it's too dark I'm gonna

1518
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:27,440
get milde right I'm not trying to beat

1519
01:05:24,199 --> 01:05:29,118
up any strain though and we have we've

1520
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:31,880
definitely got like we have a strain we

1521
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:34,278
call hibiscus that's half Skittles half

1522
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:35,960
blueberry muffin and they're not that

1523
01:05:34,278 --> 01:05:37,519
different really but but blueberry

1524
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:40,480
muffin is one of the easiest things

1525
01:05:37,519 --> 01:05:42,278
there is that I it's like beginner bud

1526
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:44,039
you know and I don't want to say that

1527
01:05:42,278 --> 01:05:46,039
but it's it's great if if you've never

1528
01:05:44,039 --> 01:05:48,559
tried any to grow before because it

1529
01:05:46,039 --> 01:05:50,278
doesn't get and have a lot of those

1530
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:51,798
problems yeah blueberry muffin is an

1531
01:05:50,278 --> 01:05:53,239
interesting one so let's talk about that

1532
01:05:51,798 --> 01:05:54,880
for a little bit because I really like

1533
01:05:53,239 --> 01:05:56,399
it and I think I think the genetic

1534
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:58,358
lineage is important it doesn't

1535
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:01,519
blueberry muffin do have Skittle but no

1536
01:05:58,358 --> 01:06:05,480
it but we cross it with it and blueberry

1537
01:06:01,519 --> 01:06:07,239
muffin really came from a day that I

1538
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:10,119
know a time that I know that you

1539
01:06:07,239 --> 01:06:12,838
remember as well where strains that had

1540
01:06:10,119 --> 01:06:14,519
names on them were a lot more rare than

1541
01:06:12,838 --> 01:06:17,480
just seeds that you got from the

1542
01:06:14,519 --> 01:06:19,960
community that were just like and and

1543
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:21,960
there were certainly plenty of things

1544
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:24,000
that that had names and came to us in

1545
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:26,159
that form with like you know this is

1546
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,719
granddaddy perss or something like that

1547
01:06:26,159 --> 01:06:31,278
was an old one you know I don't know

1548
01:06:27,719 --> 01:06:34,239
like just but more often than not the

1549
01:06:31,278 --> 01:06:36,920
our source material for breeding at that

1550
01:06:34,239 --> 01:06:38,959
time in the early 90s was not like

1551
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:40,680
anything that had a name especially you

1552
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:43,559
know in a place like humble where there

1553
01:06:40,679 --> 01:06:47,078
was so much

1554
01:06:43,559 --> 01:06:48,559
genetics kind of yeah ended up go coming

1555
01:06:47,079 --> 01:06:51,599
there because so many people were

1556
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:54,160
growing and uh yeah blue ray muffin was

1557
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:58,480
was really like a strain that there were

1558
01:06:54,159 --> 01:07:00,960
seeds that were M new skin supposedly

1559
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:02,838
that I had gotten there were a good

1560
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:05,159
batch of seed that's from Oregon that we

1561
01:07:02,838 --> 01:07:07,078
called the Oregon grape that was yeah we

1562
01:07:05,159 --> 01:07:09,118
had the Oregon blueberry it was an

1563
01:07:07,079 --> 01:07:10,798
interesting it was a spear-like plant it

1564
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:14,000
wasn't anything related to DJ shorts

1565
01:07:10,798 --> 01:07:16,480
short Inda plant uhhuh but uh yeah organ

1566
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:19,559
had some good genetics too yeah the or

1567
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:21,240
blackberry kush from Humble now that was

1568
01:07:19,559 --> 01:07:23,519
an interesting one that was like a CBD

1569
01:07:21,239 --> 01:07:25,919
variety before we had CBD varieties yeah

1570
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:29,920
I wasn't ever a huge fan of that one one

1571
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:33,798
but some of them were just and then um

1572
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:36,358
and then there was that uh the Raz and

1573
01:07:33,798 --> 01:07:38,239
and so the blueberry muffin did have all

1574
01:07:36,358 --> 01:07:40,000
of those things in it like the first

1575
01:07:38,239 --> 01:07:44,038
thing that I ever

1576
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:47,358
actually had ended up creating a moniker

1577
01:07:44,039 --> 01:07:51,200
strain name for um out of the

1578
01:07:47,358 --> 01:07:56,558
encouraging people over at um purple

1579
01:07:51,199 --> 01:07:58,598
heart uh which is right up the road yeah

1580
01:07:56,559 --> 01:08:02,119
literally of thead and they were so

1581
01:07:58,599 --> 01:08:03,559
sweet there was this one buyer in there

1582
01:08:02,119 --> 01:08:06,358
and and remember you'd go down in that

1583
01:08:03,559 --> 01:08:08,839
basement kind of space and if you you

1584
01:08:06,358 --> 01:08:11,759
know that was where you were allowed to

1585
01:08:08,838 --> 01:08:13,880
go if you were either selling or a part

1586
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:15,640
of the the management or something like

1587
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:18,400
that and I just thought it was so cool

1588
01:08:15,639 --> 01:08:21,358
get down there and and she said you know

1589
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:23,278
this is just so unique and special and I

1590
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:25,520
really just think you ought to name this

1591
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:28,440
and she was like it's beautiful it's per

1592
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:30,359
purple and and why don't you you should

1593
01:08:28,439 --> 01:08:33,479
just start calling the strain Purple

1594
01:08:30,359 --> 01:08:37,359
Passion and so I was like that's amazing

1595
01:08:33,479 --> 01:08:39,559
I love it and I do have the seeds like

1596
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:42,759
somewhat uniform

1597
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:44,400
stable so called it purple passion and

1598
01:08:42,759 --> 01:08:47,279
and it led to me writing a little bit

1599
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:50,278
for Oaker Dam news remember that little

1600
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:53,159
news newspaper that and when Oaker dam

1601
01:08:50,279 --> 01:08:56,159
was at its sort of um I mean that was

1602
01:08:53,158 --> 01:08:59,119
like the beginning of Harborside and

1603
01:08:56,158 --> 01:09:02,399
right dude I can't believe that they

1604
01:08:59,119 --> 01:09:04,960
just now they're like getting shut down

1605
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:06,519
or receivers they like they basically

1606
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:09,079
receivership well they went to State

1607
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:10,679
Line and right Steve and Andrew were

1608
01:09:09,079 --> 01:09:13,158
long gone you know they did on my

01:10:57,079 --> 01:11:00,960
nice purple passion and that was

1649
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:03,719
probably like

1650
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:05,719
200 you know two or three or something

1651

1652
01:11:05,719 --> 01:11:10,760
oaksterdam news was in circulation yeah

1653
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:14,440
that sounds about right then the purple

1654
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:17,640
passion turned into a strain that is now

1655
01:11:14,439 --> 01:11:19,599
an acronym on on our catalog there was a

1656
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:22,000
strain and it just so it happened that

1657
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:24,520
there was a party at the farm long story

1658
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:28,000
short the next morning right by the one

1659
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:32,400
of the offshoot of the purple passion

1660
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:35,800
that was like just beautiful dark purple

1661
01:11:32,399 --> 01:11:37,679
there was some panties at the base

1662
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:40,199
because somebody had had a really great

1663
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:42,039
night that night and uh turned into

1664
01:11:40,198 --> 01:11:43,479
purple panties and then so that's why I

1665
01:11:42,039 --> 01:11:46,079
called it the purple panty dropper

1666
01:11:43,479 --> 01:11:47,839
because I was like you know imagine that

1667
01:11:46,079 --> 01:11:49,960

medicinal cannabis community and uh if

1725
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:14,119

1726
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:16,440
a little bit like it was more stable and

1727

whatever so that was like always

1729
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,158
something that I enjoyed getting to go

1730
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:23,760

1731
01:14:21,158 --> 01:14:25,759

1738
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:40,960
the blueberry muffin came out of the PPD

1739
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:44,199

1773
01:15:56,520 --> 01:16:00,800
know I don't want to be a jerk yeah but

1774
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:02,600
a lot of them are but they didn't follow

1775
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:04,880
their dreams you know whatever they did

1776
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:06,440
most of most people don't yeah you know

1777
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:08,480
and I feel like I'm fortunate enough to

1778
01:16:06,439 --> 01:16:10,519
have followed my dreams that led me here

1779
01:16:08,479 --> 01:16:12,279
and people are always like oh my God you

1780
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:15,239
get the dream job and all this that and

1781
01:16:12,279 --> 01:16:18,158
the other it is TI it's unbelievably

1782
01:16:15,238 --> 01:16:22,238
difficult doing what we do I work my ass

1783
01:16:18,158 --> 01:16:24,439
off all the time yeah PE people want the

1784
01:16:22,238 --> 01:16:27,119
it's hard on relationships you know what

1785
01:16:24,439 --> 01:16:29,039
I mean yeah it's hard on everything uh

1786
01:16:27,119 --> 01:16:30,439
but but I feel like people they see it

1787
01:16:29,039 --> 01:16:31,679
and they're like well they want the

1788
01:16:30,439 --> 01:16:33,119
Glamorous side of it but they don't

1789
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:34,880
realize the hard work that it took to

1790
01:16:33,119 --> 01:16:37,238
get there in all the yeah sleepless

1791
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:39,319
nights and people laughing that [ __ ] too

1792
01:16:37,238 --> 01:16:41,879
you know I got one great question for

1793
01:16:39,319 --> 01:16:44,000
you if you could have one piece of

1794
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:46,159
advice to share with your younger self

1795
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:50,000
or your younger

1796
01:16:46,158 --> 01:16:52,759
colleagues what would that be dude

1797
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:55,880
that's a really tough question because

1798
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:59,600
what we were just talking about was like

1799
01:16:55,880 --> 01:17:02,079
how we our passions turned

1800
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:03,880
into you know hopefully successful

1801
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:07,198
business currently successful let's just

1802
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:09,960
say but um some sort of Legacy yeah

1803
01:17:07,198 --> 01:17:12,678
exactly and and so I'd love to be able

1804
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:15,198
to just be like you know do what you

1805
01:17:12,679 --> 01:17:17,440
love and the money will come yeah I'm

1806
01:17:15,198 --> 01:17:20,319
not so sure that we live in that world

1807
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:22,879
as much as we used to but but I still

1808
01:17:20,319 --> 01:17:25,198
think it's definitely worth a try and

1809
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:28,039
you can devote you know even if it makes

1810
01:17:25,198 --> 01:17:30,079
you four or five years before you really

1811
01:17:28,039 --> 01:17:31,840
think that it was even if you're not

1812
01:17:30,079 --> 01:17:33,880
making money I think that you said the

1813
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:36,239
word devote and I think devotional is

1814
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:38,600
the key to all this if you can devote

1815
01:17:36,238 --> 01:17:39,718
yourself to the whatever it is that you

1816
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:41,199
want to do whether you want to be a

1817
01:17:39,719 --> 01:17:44,079
musician it doesn't matter you want to

1818
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:45,599
be a priest if you can be devotional and

1819
01:17:44,079 --> 01:17:47,039
devote yourself to that thing like I

1820
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:50,400
have with cannabis and you have with

1821
01:17:47,039 --> 01:17:52,760
cannabis I think anything is possible

1822
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:55,679
yes right and you have to just eat sleep

1823
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:58,159
and breathe it live it yeah and

1824
01:17:55,679 --> 01:18:01,239
whatever you do you get back in return

1825
01:17:58,158 --> 01:18:03,638
usually yes I I totally agree so that to

1826
01:18:01,238 --> 01:18:05,638
answer your question yeah with like

1827
01:18:03,639 --> 01:18:07,480
utmost caution because I don't want to

1828
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:10,920
steer anybody the wrong way but you have

1829
01:18:07,479 --> 01:18:14,119
to you have to try and otherwise you'll

1830
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:17,920
probably there was a turning point where

1831
01:18:14,119 --> 01:18:19,679
I was like if I don't give this my all

1832
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:22,800
for a little while I will always wonder

1833
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:25,399
whether it could have worked and and I

1834
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:29,880
am so thankful that for that

1835
01:18:25,399 --> 01:18:33,839
like willingness but I also wasn't you

1836
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:36,440
know like living like I had a little bit

1837
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:38,800
of a savings and stuff like that not not

1838
01:18:36,439 --> 01:18:40,599
a ton I've never had like an economic

1839
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:44,400
cushion in my world at

1840
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:49,159
all but maybe enough to get through you

1841
01:18:44,399 --> 01:18:51,719
know a few three two three so months I

1842
01:18:49,158 --> 01:18:53,719
and also like once getting the little

1843
01:18:51,719 --> 01:18:56,800
first piece of land that I got in in

1844
01:18:53,719 --> 01:18:58,840
Humble County mmhm just like well hey

1845
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:02,159
I've got a daughter you

1846
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:05,039
know she probably told you she like went

1847
01:19:02,158 --> 01:19:07,198
was on my back in a back baby backpack

1848
01:19:05,039 --> 01:19:09,679
going to build out the first of my

1849
01:19:07,198 --> 01:19:11,678
gorilla grows and I never brought her

1850
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:15,158
after the plants were there but I was

1851
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:18,520
risk adverse at that time because of

1852
01:19:15,158 --> 01:19:22,799
that precious little you know person

1853
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:26,520
that now was I felt very responsible to

1854
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:28,800
and so like yeah with the utmost caution

1855
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:31,320
depending on your life circumstances try

1856
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:34,600
your best to get a little cushion

1857
01:19:31,319 --> 01:19:37,399
whether that's working at [ __ ]

1858

back in the day and it's pretty much the

1895
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:05,198
standard now well I used to say fed

1896

1899
01:21:10,238 --> 01:21:14,079
Company you guys are doing cool things

1900
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:15,760
I've met a lot of people that work with

1901
01:21:14,079 --> 01:21:17,439
you and you know it's like so it's great

1902
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:20,000
connecting with you on this level and

1903
01:21:17,439 --> 01:21:21,799
interviewing you and yeah um if people

1904
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,880
are looking to find out more about you

1905
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:27,520
and your company where can they go so

1906
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:28,719
they can go to our website of course um

1907
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:30,719
we're have we have like this

1908
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:36,560
relationship with the local Native

1909
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:38,359
American tribe um and it has given us in

1910
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:40,080
one way or another the ability to just

1911
01:21:38,359 --> 01:21:41,719
sort of kind of spread our wings more as

1912
01:21:40,079 --> 01:21:44,479
far as people being able to like order

1913
01:21:41,719 --> 01:21:47,719
our seeds and stuff and I mean I think

1914
01:21:44,479 --> 01:21:50,198
it's totally seeds are hemp seed seeds

1915
01:21:47,719 --> 01:21:52,039
when they are seeds are hemp because the

1916
01:21:50,198 --> 01:21:54,079
definition of hemp is anything so

1917
01:21:52,039 --> 01:21:55,719
anything below 3% THD in the United

1918
01:21:54,079 --> 01:21:57,559
States is considered hemp and seeds are

1919
01:21:55,719 --> 01:21:59,800
hemp until they changed the farm bill

1920
01:21:57,560 --> 01:22:01,600
saying otherwise which I doubt they're

1921
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:03,560
going to do because you know back in the

1922
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:05,520
day there was like the source where you

1923
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:08,120
grew but it's not like that anymore yeah

1924
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:09,760
that Shane Pennington right he was he

1925
01:22:08,119 --> 01:22:11,719
was all of our hero and it's funny

1926
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:13,199
because we have the same last name and

1927
01:22:11,719 --> 01:22:15,198
everybody always asks me is Shane

1928
01:22:13,198 --> 01:22:18,879
Pennington but I'll tell you what I

1929
01:22:15,198 --> 01:22:21,439
called him the day after that after he

1930
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:25,119
published the response from the DEA and

1931
01:22:21,439 --> 01:22:29,519
I was like you are my hero because webs

1932
01:22:25,119 --> 01:22:31,679
too you know of course yep and uh yeah

1933
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:33,920
we're watching the plant become just

1934
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:35,760
more accessible and and like and

1935
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:37,440
normalized and normalized which I think

1936
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:39,320
is a great thing I mean not just for our

1937
01:22:37,439 --> 01:22:42,000
businesses but I think it's a great

1938
01:22:39,319 --> 01:22:43,479
thing because the plant does more good

1939
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:46,800
than bad in fact I think it makes the

1940
01:22:43,479 --> 01:22:51,519
world a better place yes and and like as

1941
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:53,520
a chef I'm sure that you also got to

1942
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:57,159
understand that like there's no better

1943
01:22:53,520 --> 01:23:00,159
way to really know

1944
01:22:57,158 --> 01:23:03,399
um what you like when it comes to an

1945
01:23:00,158 --> 01:23:06,359
eggs benedict then than to cooking eggs

1946
01:23:03,399 --> 01:23:09,039
benedict five or six times and screw up

1947
01:23:06,359 --> 01:23:12,238
a little bit and try it with Paprika or

1948
01:23:09,039 --> 01:23:13,719
no paprika or Canadian bacon or real

1949
01:23:12,238 --> 01:23:16,119
bacon whatever you want to put on it

1950
01:23:13,719 --> 01:23:18,319
yeah and so like that I feel that is the

1951
01:23:16,119 --> 01:23:20,920
same with cannabis like we talked a lot

1952
01:23:18,319 --> 01:23:24,198
during this conversation about what

1953
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:27,679
makes cannabis good cannabis and I just

1954
01:23:24,198 --> 01:23:30,960
feel like you know having more options

1955
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:34,440
of cannabis at your fingertips makes for

1956
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:36,239
good cannabis situational we bottleneck

1957
01:23:34,439 --> 01:23:37,678
ourselves into gelato or into these

1958
01:23:36,238 --> 01:23:39,279
things and then we lose a bunch of the

1959
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:41,520
other colors along the way I think Kevin

1960
01:23:39,279 --> 01:23:43,840
jar talked about it recently yeah I saw

1961
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:45,080
on that yeah and I think he has a really

1962
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:46,279
good point with that like we breed

1963
01:23:45,079 --> 01:23:47,600
towards these certain goals where we

1964
01:23:46,279 --> 01:23:49,039
think this is what we want but then we

1965
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:51,120
lose all these other things along the

1966
01:23:49,039 --> 01:23:53,479
way and it's like the diversity is what

1967
01:23:51,119 --> 01:23:55,079
makes it so special also how you

1968
01:23:53,479 --> 01:23:57,519
introduce hybrid figger back into the

1969
01:23:55,079 --> 01:23:59,960
planet is diversity right exactly and

1970
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:01,440
you know Kev is like a hero my he's

1971
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:03,279
always been a little bit of like guy

1972
01:24:01,439 --> 01:24:05,359
that I've looked up to and a mentor me

1973
01:24:03,279 --> 01:24:08,399
too me too absolutely but I'll tell you

1974
01:24:05,359 --> 01:24:10,719
this like someone like Kevin as who is a

1975
01:24:08,399 --> 01:24:12,479
mentor to Guys Like Us who were probably

1976
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:15,639
mentors to other people out there that

1977
01:24:12,479 --> 01:24:19,919
are watching he wouldn't have said that

1978
01:24:15,639 --> 01:24:23,159
as in in as articulately as he said it

1979
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:26,199
when I watched that recent thing he did

1980
01:24:23,158 --> 01:24:29,119
about 10 years ago it was more like we

1981
01:24:26,198 --> 01:24:31,399
all just got to grow these commercial

1982
01:24:29,119 --> 01:24:33,119
things because we all got to make sure

1983
01:24:31,399 --> 01:24:35,559
that we

1984
01:24:33,119 --> 01:24:39,920
survive through this which he was right

1985
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:43,000
about that too but like it takes so much

1986
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:45,079
seasoning of being in the space to start

1987
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:48,439
for all this stuff to really like Dawn

1988
01:24:45,079 --> 01:24:52,840
on you where you're like diversity

1989
01:24:48,439 --> 01:24:55,519
is unbelievably important and it is in

1990
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:57,239
important to your seed business is

1991
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:59,679
important to my seed business and it's

1992
01:24:57,238 --> 01:25:02,879
important to every grower out there and

1993
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:06,760
people just don't even know

1994
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:08,840
how critical it is to having both like

1995
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:11,000
really good cannabis available and

1996
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:14,199
really effective cannabis and then also

1997
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:18,359
to like having a good business model for

1998
01:25:14,198 --> 01:25:21,839
this plant that is like resistant to

1999
01:25:18,359 --> 01:25:23,960
singena and resistant to Bear because

2000
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:24,880
there's subjectivity in the consumer

2001
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:28,079
there's

2002
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:31,039
people want that uh

2003
01:25:28,079 --> 01:25:34,158
diversity desperately and need it too

2004
01:25:31,039 --> 01:25:37,719
and and I am so glad that that's the

2005
01:25:34,158 --> 01:25:42,519
case because I think it's a bright

2006
01:25:37,719 --> 01:25:46,239
future for folks like us that have spent

2007
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:51,600
decades and yeah

2008
01:25:46,238 --> 01:25:55,079
lifetimes really diving into the beauty

2009
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:58,520
that the plant the you know the wealth

2010
01:25:55,079 --> 01:26:00,198
of diversity and what it has to offer

2011
