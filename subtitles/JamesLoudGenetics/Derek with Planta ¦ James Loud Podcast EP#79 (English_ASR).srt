opinion for

13
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:38,119
2024 I you know I was blown away because

14
00:00:35,878 --> 00:00:39,718
I feel like they fit the bill with candy

15
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:41,119
but they're not like the other candies

16
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,840
there's something special about both of

17
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:45,599
them they're their own thing so yeah so

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,600

00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:29,040
178 and shout out to Freddy for smoking

32
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:31,439
every single one of those because I am

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,240
the grower but at the end of the day

34
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,239
things that go in the jar he's in

35
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:37,519
control of right he makes all the

36
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:40,199
decisions on that end he has the the

37
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:42,078
pallet right so when he was on our show

38
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,478
he proved that he could smoke the entire

39
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:47,078
time he was on here he was chiefing hard

40
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:50,039
oh my boy so yeah I mean you gotta love

41
00:01:47,078 --> 00:01:51,279
it and so let's talk about your

42
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,280
relationship with Freddy how did you

43
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,920
guys meet so me and Freddy met um I'd

44
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,560
say probably 12 13 years ago we were

45
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,159
both fighting training

46
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:05,519
professionally uh MMA at Team Alpha Male

47
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,079
so very organic relationship uh you know

48
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:09,399
both trying to achieve something in the

49
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:11,719
fighting World we're both growing weed

50
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:12,680
and selling weed at the same time and so

51
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:15,840
he started doing a little bit of

52
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,719
business back then but he was also like

53
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,319
a big influence in my fighting career uh

54
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:24,439
he was one of my cornermen for pretty

55
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:28,238
much the last five professional fights I

56
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:31,639
had um which we won all five of

57
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,200
those by knockout submission on everyone

58
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:36,199
um but you

59
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:39,560
know him helping me prepare for fights

60
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:40,479
also working on the side together like

61
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,840
when you're getting ready for a

62
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,919
professional fight you're cutting weight

63
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,280
you're doing all these things right it's

64
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:48,318
it's hard takes a lot of discipline and

65
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,239
like it's very mentally draining right

66
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:51,759
but like having someone in your corner

67
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,039
that's there that you know is helping

68
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:56,399
you cut weight do all these things so

69
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:59,000
you know you develop a a real bond with

70
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,200
those guys right so it's like and we

71
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
were working and like he really was the

72
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:07,719
one that like pushed me to Brand my weed

73
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,759
right because shortly after I retired

74
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:11,759
from fighting when I was like 25 moved

75
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:15,158
down to uh

76
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:17,639
La uh had a 100 lighter and was just

77
00:03:15,158 --> 00:03:19,239
like putting out fire fire packs and he

78
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:21,719
was like bro you need to brand these you

79
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:23,000
need to brand these and I was like at

80
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:25,080
the time I was

81
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,080
already white labeling for some of the

82
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,840
biggest brands in La like in the in the

83
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:32,239
world to be honest I was like getting

84
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,640
top dollar for it so I was like no why

85
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,080
like dude I don't want to have to do all

86
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:36,919
this like you know like branding I was

87
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,719
like I'm just going to keep white

88
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:41,000
labeling for these guys cuz like for me

89
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:43,239
it was just about I enjoy being in the

90
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,080
garden and you know everything was just

91
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:46,799
like I just want to grow the weed right

92
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,879
I don't want to be the brand guy you

93
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,080
don't want to wear all those hats yeah I

94
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:55,158
don't want to wear all the hats right to

95
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:56,640
me growing weed is you know it's hard to

96
00:03:55,158 --> 00:03:59,158
grow really good weed especially at

97
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:01,039
scale yeah but for me it it just clicks

98
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:02,639
with me like right like for me I can

99
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:04,840
just walk I can walk into any grow room

100
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:07,359
in America and be like that's wrong this

101
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:10,239
is wrong like bro my ears are tuned in

102
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,360
oh that Deus is firing like there's a

103
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:16,680
leak in that line like I'm just zoned in

104
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,239
right I've done it for so long um so

105
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,478
doing the branding thing being out in

106
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:24,478
the public eye doing all of

107
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:28,439
that didn't really catch my interest

108
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:32,719
back then but then you know

109
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:34,719
2021 coming around and the market just

110
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,880
tanks

111
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,880
postco it was amazing if you were making

112
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:42,560
money durink Co you the end of 21 right

113
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:46,839
the end of

114
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:49,280
21 the market just tanks and I was like

115
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:51,399
still serving these Brands yeah and

116
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:54,239
they're still getting you know top

117
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:56,879
dollar and I was okay now it's time to

118
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,639
start the brand right because at the end

119
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,319
of the day you could have the same

120
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,840
strain from the same facility from the

121
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:07,759
same room this guy can sell it at you

122
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:09,560
know three times the price of the guy

123
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,000
just white labeling right because he's

124
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,120
putting it in his bag or in his jar

125
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,240
right the same flower the same exact

126
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:20,319
flower totally same exact flower 100%

127
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,639
yeah yeah so that's kind of a m and

128
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:24,720
Freddy's relationship and we've just

129
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:26,800
been you know we were racking up WIS

130
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,800
together fighting and now we're racking

131
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,240
up winds in the Cannabis space that's

132
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,000
awesome yeah

133
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,319
yeah you got a good team I mean and then

134
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,600
between your guys it's like you got a

135
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:38,520
bunch of other genetics I mean you

136
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,280
brought some of the stuff today but I've

137
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:43,918
also seen your gelato 41 which is

138
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,918
exceptional you got that Cleopatra well

139
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:47,959
and it's like there's a lot of gelato 41

140
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:50,279
in the market yeah yeah and so to have a

141
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:51,239
better gelato 41 where it's like oh yeah

142
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:53,399
I mean

143
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,400
it's I like it when it has a little bit

144
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:59,399
of color and and larger buds it's it

145
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:01,000
yields more typically yeah and uh it's

146
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:02,560
got to be sticky and that's the thing is

147
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,839
like I see a lot of gelato 41 on the

148
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,280
market it's not sticky yeah ex or it's

149
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:09,478
not this or it's missing one of the

150
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:12,038
boxes yeah for sure and you know I don't

151
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:15,399

little bit before uh the podcast like I

156
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,439
TC all of our genetics myself right so

157
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:31,799

worked I was like wow yeah I mean they

165
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,039
really tried or not even tried they

166
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:53,318
really simplified the tissue culture

167
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:54,759
model for the average person that wants

168
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:57,240
to learn about it I don't think it's

169
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:59,759
great for scale obviously but for for

170
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,918
doing small scale I think it's very

171
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:05,038
approachable and affordable for people

172
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:06,198
to get into yeah definitely and I wish

173
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:08,000
they would have came out with that like

174
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:09,960
two years prior to me buying a hood and

175
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,079
all this stuff because it would been a

176
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:13,638
lot cheaper yeah totally well and their

177
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:15,318
VPD domes we were kind of talking about

178
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:16,478
that earlier I like the VPD domes I

179
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:19,080
think they're good for tissue culture

180
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:22,159
and other things I think there's a lot

181
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:23,800
of you know Athena's got good branding

182
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,120
they've got good Mark you know branding

183
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,319
and marketing but then they have some

184
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,680
good products to back it up and they're

185
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,720
super consistent yeah that I feel like

186
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,639
anything in in cannabis like you're just

187
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,360
looking for the consistency right

188
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:38,840
because you already have all take out

189
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,080
like a large facility right you have 12

190
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:44,038
employees you have this you have uh

191
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:46,478
mechanical malfunctions every day um

192
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:48,560
AC's going out like to be honest like if

193
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:50,079
you've ran a large scale cultivation

194
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,158
every day something's breaking right

195
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:52,959
there's something new every day

196
00:07:51,158 --> 00:07:55,800
something new every day fire to put out

197
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:57,680
yeah so I always tell people like you

198
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,240
know people come to me with like oh

199
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,439
adjustable Spectrum lights or this or

200
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,598
that and I'm like dude I don't want any

201
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:06,399
of my cultivation managers trying to

202
00:08:04,598 --> 00:08:08,680
adjust the spectrum because they think

203
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:12,198
this or they think that right 56 Light

204
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:15,759
Recipes let's try them out no no exactly

205
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:17,919
exactly so I always tell people like

206
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:21,400
find a product that works and just do

207
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:23,240
that right so you know like you said

208
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:25,399
they have consistency you know Athena is

209
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,360
always super consistent yeah I mean one

210
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:29,198
of the most consistent Brands out there

211
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,038
you know and it's like like it or hate

212
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,360
it the consistencies there across the

213
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:36,158
board and uh you know and that's what

214
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,959
makes good brands exactly whether it's

215
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:39,599
flower whether it's lighting whe you

216
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:41,359
know it's all it's all about like

217
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,879
consistency is so important when you're

218
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,440
building a brand yeah 100% especially a

219
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:49,480
flower brand right like and with where

220
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:52,440
we're at right now

221
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:54,120
in the country with like the recession

222
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,200
things like that like that's like one of

223
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:59,159
our goals as a brand is to like always

224
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,519
always have a consistent product right

225
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:05,600
so like my main office is at my at the

226
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:08,639
drro so I QC personally QC every single

227
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,560
batch right making sure like you know

228
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:14,439
it's five nug it's two to five nugs that

229
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:17,359
that's our sop on that making sure that

230
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,959
every single pack that goes into it

231
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:23,440
is the best pack of the whole batch

232
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:25,639
right right so when that I want the

233
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,760
customer when they smoke they buy a jar

234
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:29,720
at the store because they're spending

235
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:33,319
their hard-earned money right um to have

236
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:35,879
the same experience I have when I leave

237
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:39,560
my facility you know have a couple nugs

238
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:42,039
from a premium picked batch and smoke it

239
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:44,719
right so like consistency means a lot in

240
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:46,000
this industry and it's means a lot while

241
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,040
like you said developing a brand you

242
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,440
want to be a brand that you can trust

243
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:54,399
right right like look at cbx for for uh

244
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,959
example they have 10 trains they run the

245
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,600
same ones every time hardly do any

246
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:04,039
marketing hardly [ __ ] crush it right

247
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:08,360
still selling $30 a to the store all day

248
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:10,480
no no exceptions right crush it why

249
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,480
they've been in the market for a long

250
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,440
time but also have always just been very

251
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,759
consistent right yeah and that's how you

252
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,399
develop your customer bases based on

253
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:20,120
consistency if they know they can get

254
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,559
the same thing going in but if it's good

255
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,120
one time and bad the next you're only as

256
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,958
good as your last batch so as long as

257
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,839
it's consistent you're okay it's like I

258
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:32,599
saw some of the brands early on in wreck

259
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,920
2018 coming in the market strong they

260
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,000
had a lot of money behind them they had

261
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:38,199
a lot of branding and then the flower

262
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,480
sucked yep well you buy that one time

263
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,920
and it sucks you're never going to buy

264
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,959
it again I'm never going to buy it again

265
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:45,679
I'm just like that you know and I still

266
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:47,838
buy wreck flour uh in fact I got some of

267
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:49,439
your flour on the wreck uh I went to

268
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,880
hook cookies Hayward and I went to

269
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,480
cookies Hayward and got your stuff and

270
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:55,399
it was the first day it dropped I was

271
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,480
like appreciate that brother I was

272
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:58,399
shopping there with my friend and then

273
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,480
I'm like planta you got planta here it's

274
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,000
like it it's caught me by surprise it's

275
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,759
like cookies Hayward we got planted

276
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,559
that's great and then they're like yeah

277
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:08,200
this stuff it sells out it sells out it

278
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:09,599
sells out right away oh yeah and so I'm

279
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,920
like okay perfect I got it right when

280
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,159
it's fresh and I feel like that is also

281
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:16,078
so important that the product moves if

282
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:19,078
it sits on the shelf for six weeks eight

283
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:20,799
weeks 10 weeks 12 weeks y it just gets

284
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:23,439
worse and worse I mean they don't have

285
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:24,679
not not all the places have controlled

286
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,279
environments and I think that's the

287
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:28,799
future is like controlled distribution

288
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:30,720
where they're keeping it refrigerated

289
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:31,958
all the way until it gets to dispensary

290
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,560
when it's in the dispensary they keep it

291
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:35,518
at a cool temperature so it stays as

292
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:37,518
fresh as possible how do they display

293
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,720
their weed too right because a lot of

294
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,600
the oxidation all those things happen

295
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,920
under you know those lights that they

296
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,079
have in the cases right right so if they

297
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:49,120
have all of like if they have everything

298
00:11:47,078 --> 00:11:50,239
laid out in the case you know and people

299
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,799
have clear

300
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:56,959
jars then those lights are just beaming

301
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:59,439
on it all day all night probably so that

302
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:01,359
makes the weed oxidize a lot faster

303
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,079
right so well I noticed a lot of guys

304
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,560
have fancy jars that are die or fancy

305
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:08,919
bags that are diecut and you guys went

306
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,958
with the jars that are opaque you have

307
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:12,799
the you know I feel like they're

308
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:14,679
original it's different um you went with

309
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:18,039
that so the Wii wouldn't get crushed yes

310
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:20,838
so exactly so dud like I said I'm in the

311
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:23,679
grow room every day like these these

312
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:25,839

facilities here in Oakland that's all

327
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:00,480
commercial wheat right you know

328
00:12:58,198 --> 00:13:03,639
thousands of Lights commercial weed our

329
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:08,399
facilities in La that is you know all

330
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:10,198
for the brand right um having the uh

331
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:13,958
trimmers dialed in having everyone

332
00:13:10,198 --> 00:13:16,240
dialed in to put the best weed in the

333
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:17,919
jar you know do you control the

334
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,720
environment that you guys trim in in

335
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:27,039
both places yes 60° 60%

336
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:29,680
hum0 so we dry 60 60 10 days um you know

337
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:31,480
uh here at the Oakland facility

338
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:34,239
uh like my La facilities everything is

339
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:37,879
DPS panels the Oakland facilities uh it

340
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:41,480
was a retrofit facility right so uh they

341
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:43,759
retrofitted it due to the old building

342
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,399
um so to get it done faster they didn't

343
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:49,879
do the DPS panels they didn't do that

344
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:53,120
still a great facility right but uh the

345
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:55,639
swings are a lot there's big swings

346
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,240
because the roof isn't insulated right

347
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:59,639
we're not uh you know you use a DPS

348
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,399
panels you're

349
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:06,278
a building inside of a building right so

350
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:07,799
this one we are playing to the elements

351
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:10,078
right so as long as

352
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:12,559
we're watching the weather like right

353
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:14,838
now you know we're having big swings but

354
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:18,359
as long as we're watching that adjusting

355
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:20,000
our uh temps humidities throughout right

356
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:25,240
it's perfectly fine but yeah we try to

357
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:27,519
shoot for 60 60 10 days um and that I

358
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,839
believe that's like the best way to cure

359
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,360
and dry weed well then you cure it out

360
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,160
for a little bit longer after that you

361
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,560
guys burp it or do you uh so we Buck it

362
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:38,799
all down into bins um and then it goes

363
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:41,159
to the trimmers um and the bags get

364
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:44,519
burped for you know I'd say probably a

365
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:46,559
week and then once the trim is done then

366
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:48,679
it just goes into production of either

367
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:51,559
it's going into jars or depending what

368
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:54,000
facility it's at it's going into uh the

369
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:56,359
drro and then being bulked out or white

370
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,559
labeled right yeah you ever tried Grove

371
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:03,440
bags there turp locks I have so

372
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:07,078
I have tried Grove bags uh they are

373
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,639
amazing right but on for the planta if

374
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:11,439
it's going into the jars I want it in a

375
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:15,039
loose bag right I want it to and it just

376
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,680
gets Jarred immediately right MH um on

377
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,599
if it's going to bulk and white label

378
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:21,479
it's just like the price doesn't make

379
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,759
sense for bulking it out right no you're

380
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:26,120
it's expensive per bag yeah it's

381
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:27,639
expensive per bag but ideally yes they

382
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,959
it's an amazing product if you were

383
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:31,480
using bags I would use gr bags right

384
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,838
yeah me too I like the Grove bags I like

385
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,759
the triple I like their bin liners they

386
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:37,480
have bin liners too those are great it's

387
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,959
just a good product I think especially

388
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,039
for long-term storage I got rid of most

389
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:42,318
of my jars the only problem is getting

390
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:45,198
smashed because I have a backpack I

391
00:15:42,318 --> 00:15:47,838
bring my flower around and yeah I mean

392
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:49,519
that's the only downside is that it gets

393
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,880
smashed yeah and that that's kind of

394
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,278
what I was trying to go into is just

395
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:56,318
that like getting a run all the way

396
00:15:54,278 --> 00:15:58,679
through getting it to the trimmers

397
00:15:56,318 --> 00:16:01,159
getting it coming out perfect and then

398
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:04,000
throw in a bag and getting crushed yeah

399
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:06,958
I was like it's like artbreaking totally

400
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,440
yeah cuz like your your your client gets

401
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:11,439
it you know they pick it up at they pick

402
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,160
it this jar up right they see it they're

403
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:17,079
like wow you know this looks really good

404
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:19,240
especially when I do do bags or when we

405
00:16:17,078 --> 00:16:21,879
have done it in the past get the clear

406
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,399
gusset right so at least your client can

407
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:26,318
see it on the sh not too smashed or

408
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,039
whatever well they you know it's hard to

409
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:30,159
sell weed especially for you're thinking

410
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:32,039
these Bud tenders right you know they

411
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:34,879
can't let you smell it typic can't let

412
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:36,879
you smell it it's not like deli style

413
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:38,838
how it used to be which is like you know

414
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:40,639
with the Chopsticks that was the best

415
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:42,040
dude that was the best but La that was

416
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,039
the best that was the best part about

417
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:45,759
going to all the dispensaries in La is

418
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:47,159
like you get to smell it you get the

419
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,919
Chopsticks they break it out you know

420
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:50,039
they're not touching with their hands

421
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:51,039
they're weighing it right in front of

422
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:54,039
you so you know you're not getting

423
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:56,679
ripped off all those good things and and

424
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:59,039
that would allow cannabis Brands to

425
00:16:56,679 --> 00:17:00,799
shine more right because how many times

426
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:02,599
like especially now right you have so

427
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:05,399
many with legalization with all these

428
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:09,838
things happening you have so many new

429
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:12,120
smokers right yeah and they come in and

430
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:14,399
they don't know what to buy right so

431
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:15,399
they get the shiny bag or they get this

432
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,400
right and then they go home and they

433
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,120
have a bad experience right right are

434
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,280
they going to come back and Shop are

435
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,918
they going to continue to do this you

436
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:25,558
know are they going to continue to go

437
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:28,319
down their weed Journey right right so

438
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:31,279
it's like you you truly don't know and

439
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:33,639
having style was so beneficial cuz they

440
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:35,000
speak for yes exactly I mean it just

441
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,120
speaks for itself it's like you don't

442
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,679
have to sell the weed in fancy packaging

443
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:40,558
exactly you can sell the weed people can

444
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:42,600
make their mind up they can look it they

445
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:43,678
can you know they maybe don't taste it

446
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:45,639
but then they get home and they're like

447
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,519
oh yeah this is what I want now it's

448
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,960
purple punch it looks amazing smells

449
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,519
amazing it smells okay but then you go

450
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,880
to smoke and it's a let down and that

451
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:54,720
there's going to be like that kind of

452
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,760
stuff throughout the you know yeah

453
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,480
always right always but you know having

454
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:01,720
a bag where they can't see the flower

455
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,000
like you know you want every sensory

456
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,279
detail right you want to be able to see

457
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,798
it you want to be able to touch it you

458
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:07,399
want to be able to smell it when you

459
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:11,200
smoke it you want to be able to taste it

460
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:13,798
right right so it's like if they're not

461
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,000
able to even see it before they buy it

462
00:18:13,798 --> 00:18:17,879
especially on like right now you know

463
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,759
we're in a recession like people are

464
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,640
spending their hard-earned money it's

465
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:26,079
like if they're spending you know top

466
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:27,919
shelf eth $55 $60 pre-tax yeah then they

467
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:30,639
go home and have a terrible [ __ ]

468
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:33,759
experience or they open the bag and like

469
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,360
oh wow this is not what I expected right

470
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:38,200
like they're going to have a bad

471
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:39,798
experience and like our whole goal is to

472
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,159
make sure the smoker is having an

473
00:18:39,798 --> 00:18:43,960
experience that I have right at least

474
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:47,159
what you're in control of providing

475
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:49,640
exactly yes very very true very true and

476
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:52,200
that you know with the wreck Market dude

477
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:55,559
it's tough like these shops want a lot

478
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:58,279
to help from from the brand to help sell

479
00:18:55,558 --> 00:19:00,879
right as a smaller brand like we're you

480
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:03,480
know it's me couple people like in our

481
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,640
in our facility and then you know our

482
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,558
Dro team and everybody so it's like we

483
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,559
all work really hard to make sure these

484
00:19:07,558 --> 00:19:12,480
experiences go well with customers

485
00:19:09,558 --> 00:19:15,079
making sure that our Bud tenders are TR

486
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,440
you know trained make you know it all

487
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:19,399
gets hard well and being a bud tender is

488
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,840
tough you know there there's so many

489
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,600
different things and then just because

490
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:25,279
it says biscotti it doesn't me mean

491
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:27,119
there's so much cut fishing that goes on

492
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:29,480
within our industry unfortunately where

493
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:31,759
people are like oh yeah here's rs1 yeah

494
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:34,200
the first rs11 that came out and that's

495
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:37,400
why I was so excited with 11 coffins

496
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:39,440
because the first rs11 was this I think

497
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:43,038
maybe 2018

498
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:45,600
2019 and it was it was 2019 and it was

499
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:49,599
graded it was like the first really

500
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:51,519
truly graded uh alleven siiz buds across

501
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:53,119
the board it had almost a pinkish tint

502
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:55,279
and when you open the bag it was like

503
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:59,239
this it was gassy but it was almost like

504
00:19:55,279 --> 00:20:00,960
smelling fresh ice cream or like sherbet

505
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,679
like like not like Sunset sherbet but

506
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,240
like actual sherbet like you're at ice

507
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,120
cream shop and it's like hits you in the

508
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,359
face and I was like you see you say

509
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:11,558
sherbet like actual sherbet like it had

510
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:14,359
like that pink and then it had the

511
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:16,759
orange hairs like a pinkish tint to and

512
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:20,798
it's like they were super golf ball like

513
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:22,919
circular buds nice shape you know and

514
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:24,798
they came out perfectly graded and that

515
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:27,120
was the first time I saw like perfectly

516
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:29,279
grated flour and I was so excited about

517
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:31,000
$4,500 a pound yeah you know and they

518
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:33,158
were killing it and then as they

519
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,440
expanded it changed but then also other

520
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:37,799
Cuts got out and people I think a lot of

521
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,759
people don't even know a real rs11 is

522
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:40,400
yeah you know and that's that goes

523
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:42,480
across the board with so many different

524
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,559
genetics that's the hard thing when

525
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,240
bringing a strain to market right so

526
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:49,200
like even with our trins right so all of

527
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,279
our trains that we feno hunted like they

528
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,759
will never leave our facilities anything

529
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:56,720
like I I I could easily bring them up to

530
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:59,720
the Oakland facilities and you know blow

531
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:03,200
them out have like you know a lot of

532
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:07,038
weed to bring to market right but you

533
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:09,279
know it's 3,000 lights three different

534
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:11,240
facilities you know total of probably

535
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:14,798
like 30 or 40 workers that are going to

536
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:16,679
be in those rooms yeah and anything can

537
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:20,278
happen a lot of people will pay a lot of

538
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:23,200
money for a cut right $10,000 $20,000

539
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:25,079
who knows thegu the limit exactly

540
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,640
exactly so it's like and I feel like

541
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:27,798
that's what happened right like it's

542
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,919
what happened across the board to so

543
00:21:27,798 --> 00:21:34,720
many people exactly my team at the

544
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:37,600
planta facilities at at my facilities um

545
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:40,079
in La have been working with me for

546
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:42,918
eight years plus yeah every single one

547
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:46,960
of them like 20

548
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:49,880
2015 till now right so nine years right

549
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:53,720
yeah we all have a vision of what we

550
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:55,559
want and we are all invested in that

551
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,919
right like no one could pay them any

552
00:21:55,558 --> 00:21:59,200
amount of money to take something so

553
00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:00,440
it's like trust those guys with my

554
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,640
well it's like family when you build

555
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,919
that culture at work yeah yeah it's one

556
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:07,200
of those things that money just can't

557
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:08,799
buy culture is one of those things you

558
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,679
know within the Cannabis industry but

559
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:12,278
especially within the workplace when you

560
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:14,200
have people that feel like they're part

561
00:22:12,278 --> 00:22:16,200
of the team that they're a contributing

562
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,519
member they love coming to work every

563
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,679
day you know you you can't beat that

564
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:22,400
right tot and like those guys and that's

565
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:25,480
a difference right work culture right

566
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,240
like you want to develop a space where

567
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,519
people want to come to work right where

568
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,240
we're all working towards the same goal

569
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:33,240
and it's like you know how do you do

570
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:36,839
that right like as cultivators like it's

571
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:38,919
very um monotonous work sometimes y so

572
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:41,359
it's like day in day out same thing day

573
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:43,919
in day out you know looking at graphs

574
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:46,278
adjusting feeds you know you have a few

575
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,799
big days a Harve a cycle you know you

576
00:22:46,278 --> 00:22:51,159
have your repop you have your undercut

577
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:54,480
your Def and your chop right other than

578
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:57,080
that it's monotonous data points y you

579
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,880
know logging data adjusting your feeds

580
00:22:57,079 --> 00:23:02,240
off of that data right so it's like how

581
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:05,120
do you keep them incentivized in doing

582
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,000
uh a better job every single time and it

583
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:09,079
kind of goes into like my slogan for

584
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
like planto like pursuing Perfection

585
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:16,439
right yeah like every single run every

586
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,159
single task I want I try to challenge my

587
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:22,480
guys and I try to develop that

588
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:24,240
um like ethos at our grows like every

589
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,919
like this round of cuts should be better

590
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,000
than last round right we have yeah and

591
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,679
it's never it's never done right the job

592
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,599
is never done we're I always trying to

593
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:34,679
improve it and there's so many different

594
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:36,759
ways you can improve it over time I'm

595
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:38,519
the same way and I see the best

596
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:40,359
facilities out there they have that same

597
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:42,278
mentality that's it's like it's never

598
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:43,759
perfect and the best Growers are like

599
00:23:42,278 --> 00:23:46,200
that too it's never even when it's the

600
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:48,720
best batch SF Cana y you know it's like

601
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,120
those guys I feel like they crush and

602
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,480
they have that same mentality that you

603
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:54,319
have it's like the job's never done it's

604
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,960
it could always be improved upon in some

605
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:58,879
way shape or form and if you're always

606
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,759
striving for that you're going to hit

607
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,159
higher every time even when it's not as

608
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:07,119
good you're still going to get a good

609
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:09,720
product yeah 100% And like I feel like

610
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:11,359
that's the only way that brands or

611
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:15,278
facilities are going to survive going

612
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:17,319
forward right like you see Bros for sale

613
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:19,839
every day right now every day right now

614
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:21,158
La Oakland and it's just like people get

615
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:22,720
in it and they're like oh we can make

616
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:24,960
money we can do this it's like dude the

617
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,360
Market's different yeah it it's unless

618
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:30,000
you're producing top quality weed you're

619
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:31,759
not going to be here and efficiently

620
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,599
right well then you're competing with

621
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:36,960
the guys who can produce it for $250 to

622
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:39,719
$300 a pound and how you can't compete

623
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,798
with those if if your costs are too high

624
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,079
which most people are because they're

625
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:45,200
not growing at that scale you're in the

626
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:46,798
same Market as those guys now there's

627
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,440
there's no way you're gonna win it's

628
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:50,720
just it's a race to the bottom and

629
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:53,640
you're gonna lose yeah and it's it's you

630
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:56,960
know even geographically it's a

631
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:59,720
challenge right like growing in Downtown

632
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:02,600
LA is 10 times more expensive than

633
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:05,240
growing an adanto right so it's like

634
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:07,959
yeah those guys producing for 350 a

635
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:10,599
pound 300 a pound indoor in ad alonto

636
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:14,000
paying way less in electricity paying

637
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:17,158
way less in either uh lease or mortgage

638
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,919
or any of those things um yeah it it's

639
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:23,840
crazy but getting your numbers down and

640
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:25,799
making sure you're producing under $500

641
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:27,959
a pound La should be between like five

642
00:25:25,798 --> 00:25:30,079
to six like yeah I think six is like the

643
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,319
normal like six is where you know if

644
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:33,398
you're getting less than that I have

645
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:35,599
guys that are doing three you know those

646
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:37,558
guys are crushing double stack and

647
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:40,158
they're getting three pounds of light y

648
00:25:37,558 --> 00:25:42,278
you know and then then it works but even

649
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,039
still you can't just grow a grade

650
00:25:42,278 --> 00:25:46,558
product anymore like a grade doesn't cut

651
00:25:44,038 --> 00:25:48,440
it you need A+ you need a triple plus

652
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:50,918
you need the fire and then you can't

653
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:52,558
just grow lemon chry gelato either no no

654
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:53,399
you can't that's one thing you won't see

655
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:55,879
in our

656
00:25:53,398 --> 00:25:57,558
jars but like I said everything has its

657
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,240
place right like the commercial our

658
00:25:57,558 --> 00:26:00,240
commercial

659
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:12,839
a I think you need to come with new

660
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:15,519
genetics often and try to create a

661
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:17,720
staple staple genetics right like you

662
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:19,720
look at people like oh you know look at

663
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,960
biscotti look at jel like look at all

664
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:25,240
these uh you know connected strains like

665
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:28,319
that are just like Staples lifetime

666
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,919
Staples before that OG right like yeah

667
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:32,639
Sour Diesel which we were talking about

668
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,200
earlier just like cookies cookies yes

669
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,200
can't forget cookies cannot forget

670
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,120
cookies like shout out to burner shout

671
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:41,240
out to cookies for like really creating

672
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:42,719
The Branding wave for for everybody I

673
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,558
mean they the flower that backed it too

674
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,200
it didn't yield very well and real

675
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:47,599
cookies I mean a lot of people talk down

676
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,399
on cookies cuz they don't know cuz they

677
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:51,519
weren't there but when cookies hit the

678
00:26:49,398 --> 00:26:53,359
market fire it's so good and it tastes

679
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:55,119
amazing and it's strong it's a heavy

680
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:56,719
smoke oh for sure you know it's not like

681
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:59,479
Skittles which I love Skittles but

682
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,600
Skittles is much lighter

683
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:04,079
daytime and then you smoke some really

684
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:06,558
good cookies and it's super sedative y

685
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:07,879
it'll get you and also it tastes amazing

686
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:09,879
you can still smoke it down to the roach

687
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,840
it has all the good qualities checks the

688
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,720
boxes I think it was one of the ones

689
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:15,879
that kind of developed the boxes

690
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:17,919
especially for that purple you know and

691
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:20,278
then oh for sure you know before that

692
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:24,080
was OG yeah before that OG there was

693
00:27:20,278 --> 00:27:26,398
Bubba OG yeah Bubba OG Gorilla Glue you

694
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:28,319
la you go you went to LA right before

695
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:30,038
that hit and you couldn't get anything

696
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:34,000
but OG there was 28 different types of

697
00:27:30,038 --> 00:27:36,480
OG you same OG yeah but I mean I think

698
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,079
Josh had several different ones Josh d

699
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,720
right but a lot of places in Kenji yeah

700
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:43,678
I mean these guys had you know and there

701
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,480
is a difference between the sfv and like

702
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,200
the original OG and then there's the

703
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:50,159
triangle and Diablo's a little bit

704
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,640
different and same thing with the Tahoe

705
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,519
and they're all good in their own right

706
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:56,440
I like them all I I do like a good

707
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:59,960
gassie that that has pine needles yeah

708
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:01,798
the SF like the s is like super gassy I

709
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,600
breathing with it and it's sfv does not

710
00:28:01,798 --> 00:28:05,200
breed well it's very difficult you

711
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:07,119
cannot reverse it and expect to get

712
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,600
pollen out of it really yeah it's so

713
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:11,719
stable and it's just difficult to work

714
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:13,879
with but like it's super super super

715
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,038
special and the smoke is

716
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:18,120
amazing uh and ju just something about

717
00:28:16,038 --> 00:28:21,679
the earthy pine needle with the Citrus

718
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:25,119
on there it's like do you find breeding

719
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:28,320
that the more finicky the strains are to

720
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:30,639
breed with like like Skittles right so

721
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:35,000
or like you're saying the sfog is like

722
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:36,799
do you find like that those are harder

723
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,319
to breed with typically cuz like growing

724
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:43,079
Skittles right super finicky

725
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:44,240
super even cloning it is super finicky

726
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:47,038
well a lot of these things have

727
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,200
recessive traits Y and so even if you do

728
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:50,879
self Skittles right you make s1's of

729
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,720
Skittles yeah it's the silliest thing

730
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,880
when people are selling s1s of Skittles

731
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,399
because it's recessive and the thing is

732
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,480
is like the ones that have the structure

733
00:28:57,398 --> 00:29:01,639
will definitely smell and taste like

734
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:03,000
Skittles you looking for the structure

735
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,640
but you're not going to find anything

736
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
better than Skittles you're not going to

737
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,600
find anything better in there in all

738
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,319
that work you will never find anything

739
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:14,480
better than the parent yep and a lot of

740
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:16,480
the ogs have recessive characteristics

741
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,720
so when you breed with that OG that's

742
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:22,240
really good you have a difficult time

743
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:24,798
finding something that's good uh the the

744
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,599
cookies and OG craze so that happened

745
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:28,398
that I was on that bandwagon right I was

746
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:30,359
all about OG times cookies because

747
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:32,359
cookies didn't yield and there was like

748
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:34,000
a bunch of ogs that yielded really well

749
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:37,119
yeah for sure right the Platinum that

750
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,038
that's what I work with with cookies and

751
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:40,959
it gave it the gassiness but it also

752
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:42,319
brought it out whereas they both had it

753
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,960
in there so if you get two things that

754
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:46,759
are recessive you can get it to express

755
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,399
right but if it's only on one side of it

756
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:51,599
a lot of times you're not going to get

757
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:53,158
it to express and I love working with

758
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:55,519
those plants and I love trying to figure

759
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:57,080
stuff out but a lot of times people are

760
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:58,359
like oh I crossed this and this and on

761
00:29:57,079 --> 00:30:00,879
paper it sounds really good they go to

762
00:29:58,359 --> 00:30:03,158
buy seeds of it yep and then you pop the

763
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,039
seeds and you're not you're not finding

764
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:07,559
anything that you thought was in there

765
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:08,919
and so yeah I feel like every like with

766
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:11,278
Skittles right like you said like the

767
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:13,080
cookies times everyone cuz because it is

768
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:17,119
so finicky they're like wow if I could

769
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:20,038
get this smell and taste but something

770
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:22,879
you know cross it with you know like an

771
00:30:20,038 --> 00:30:24,440
OG or like even OG is pretty finicky

772
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,360
nowadays like it's hard to do that but

773
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:28,759
like an apple fritter or like something

774
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:31,278
you know that's like super vigorous or

775
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:33,398
g41 g41 is a great example of something

776
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:35,278
to breed I as as far as breeding so I

777
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:37,239
have a skittles times g41 back to the

778
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:39,640
Skittles and we're doing some back

779
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,240
crosses with that but it's like you're

780
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,559
not finding stuff I'm finding some

781
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:45,200
really interesting stuff in there I have

782
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:48,240
a really sick Skittles back cross right

783
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,960
now yeah very nice well and I think it's

784
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,558
got to be different than Skittles if

785
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,079
people are just chasing diet Skittles

786
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:58,440
there's no point because it's not going

787
00:30:53,079 --> 00:31:00,879
to sell so I have a a skittles BX two or

788
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,759
Skittles bx1 it's a skittles time

789
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:06,960
Skittles times strawberry scato so

790
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:13,519
strawberry scato is uh gelato

791
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:19,558
33 times 18 coffins which is a uh it's

792
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:21,278
uh og8 cross to yeah og8 from DNA cross

793
00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:24,960
to

794
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:28,720
uh the coffin cut of strawberry Diesel

795
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:32,038
and so the zbx 2 is uh also

796
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:36,759
bred by Duke herb uh I firm believer in

797
00:31:32,038 --> 00:31:41,240
his seeds uh I run a lot of his gear um

798
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:44,359
very good um but yeah the zbx 2 that

799
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:47,120
we're launching uh we're going to call

800
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:49,759
it Paradiso so yeah no because it's so

801
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:51,918
that's the of my favorite bar is

802
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:54,798
Paradiso it's in Barcelona par it's one

803
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:56,480
of the top bars in Europe and in the

804
00:31:54,798 --> 00:31:57,558
world I think it's yeah it was like the

805
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,480
number two bar in the world for the

806
00:31:57,558 --> 00:32:01,359
longest time you going to spanis

807

935
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,960
like not afraid of it yeah I don't think

936
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:47,719
it's going anywhere and yeah they might

937
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:50,679
try to change some stuff around but yeah

938
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:53,078
uh we'll see yeah for sure I'm always in

939
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:54,799
that we'll see you know mindset

940
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:57,079
especially with our industry it's like

941
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,560
we're Cowboys yeah exactly it's the Wild

942
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:02,680
Wild Way all over and so many things

943
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:04,559
throughout my life have been kind of

944
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:07,838
counterintuitive femin seeds I was

945
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:10,239
scared of blur the LEDs I was like nah

946
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:12,599
Auto flowers I was like no they're trash

947
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:14,358
and so now I'm just like we'll see I

948
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:16,720
have that we'll see mindset and yeah you

949
00:37:14,358 --> 00:37:19,000
can't be married to anything right and

950
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:20,919
the advances that we've made are just

951
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,639
amazing you know I mean genetics wise

952

too I think there's a lot of room for

953
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:28,559
advancements in genetics oh for sure I

954
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:30,439

00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:02,118
like pheno

969
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:03,838
hunting is expensive you only know if

970
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:05,480
you know it's one of those things too

971
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:06,920
most people think oh yeah feno hunting

972
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,760
you just grow these out and you pop them

973
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,240
it's like no you first of all you got to

974
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:12,920
grow them out multiple times yeah

975
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:14,399
multiple times you have to smoke them

976
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,519
you have to actually try them because

977
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,480
anybody who's just growing out and

978
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:17,960
they're not trying it they're like

979
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,280
that's the winner that that doesn't work

980
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,760
like that that's not how pheno hunting

981
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,680
works there's a lot of people out there

982
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:25,160
doing that and like we'll see where they

983
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:28,440
go right right but the way that we do

984
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:30,239
our feno hunt so all pop you know we

985
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:32,599
were doing 500 a month right now we're

986
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:34,639
doing about 200 a month it's a lot yeah

987
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:36,079
it's a lot and that's very expensive lot

988
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:38,239
oh very because like those are all

989
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:42,318
lights that could be flowering product

990
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:45,118
right to go into these jars um but we

991
00:38:42,318 --> 00:38:46,960
need as a culture to continue to do that

992
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:50,280
right like to continue to find the new

993
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:52,400
thing or else we will be smoking Lemon

994
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:54,119
Cherry gelato forever and doing you know

995
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,519
the same thing over and over and it's

996
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:58,640
like well we're not in that kind of

997
00:38:55,519 --> 00:39:01,039
society we have like this short-term

998
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:03,039
memory and also it's like we want the

999
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:05,000
next best thing right away we have we

1000
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:07,039
need instant gratification and so

1001
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,679
America we want it now we want it now

1002
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:10,480
and we want it different and we want

1003
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,639
tomorrow we're like that's that's not I

1004
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,838
don't want what I had yesterday I want

1005
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:18,480
something new yeah and and

1006
00:39:14,838 --> 00:39:20,199
the uninformed smoker without with an

1007
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,119
uninformed pallet is getting something

1008
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:24,118
new every day but it's the same thing in

1009
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:26,200
a different bag exact thing the same the

1010
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:28,838
problem RS and Lemon Cherry gelato it's

1011
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:31,039
like it's named all other things and

1012
00:39:28,838 --> 00:39:33,599
even though some of it is different it's

1013
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:34,920
not different enough not for me exactly

1014
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,559
it's not even genetically different a

1015
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,800
lot of stuff is inbreeding right so

1016
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:39,239
where these people are like I made this

1017
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,800
new cross and it's like all you did was

1018
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:43,679
inbreed some [ __ ] because you cross runs

1019
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:46,560
with lemon Cherry gelato yeah exactly so

1020
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:48,519
and I I see that so often and I see you

1021
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:50,599
know this new flower or this new thing

1022
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:52,199
and it's just a derivative of something

1023
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:54,079
else and it's but that's what I love

1024
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:55,719
about like 11 coffins and coffin candy

1025
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:58,318
because when I tried them for the first

1026
00:39:55,719 --> 00:40:00,838
time I'm like whoa okay these things are

1027
00:39:58,318 --> 00:40:02,800
different they're unique they're unique

1028
00:40:00,838 --> 00:40:05,480
and they're they are candy so they fit

1029
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,960
the market yep but they're unique enough

1030
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,880
to where people are like they they have

1031
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,440
to stand back a little bit and go whoa

1032
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,760
where did this come from they both have

1033
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:14,639
a lot of depth too right so like the

1034
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:17,359
coffin candy it's like you're getting so

1035
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:20,879
many different flavors right right and

1036
00:40:17,358 --> 00:40:23,119
it hits right like that is probably our

1037
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:26,160
strongest hitting flow like we've had

1038
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:29,240
test it tests really high too very high

1039
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:31,440
um and like we use Encore Labs never

1040
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:33,078
like the cool thing like if you know

1041
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,318
like recently there was like a

1042
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:36,519
California shut down a lot of the

1043
00:40:34,318 --> 00:40:38,759
testing Labs a lot of them yeah for all

1044
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:40,960
the project stuff and it was funny

1045
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:43,560
because I saw a lot of Brands all of

1046
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:48,199
their THC percentages drop from you know

1047
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:50,639
35% across the board to 22 right ours

1048
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:53,159
stayed the exact same place the whole

1049
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:54,639
time yeah so it's like yeah it's it's

1050
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,719
funny like even I'll send it to like

1051
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:58,598
some of my other buddies that have

1052
00:40:55,719 --> 00:41:02,759
Brands I'm like damn like we got 39

1053
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:04,760
point something uh THC the other day 40%

1054
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,720
total plus I sent this to my buddies

1055
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:08,920
like yeah we've paid for test results

1056
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:11,159
too shut the [ __ ] up I was like no no

1057
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,880
bro this is this is legit you know what

1058
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:15,078
I mean well there's a handful of things

1059
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,760
that do test that high yeah you know but

1060
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:19,359
they are anomalies there's not a lot of

1061
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:22,599
them especially especially 40% canabo

1062
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:25,880
it's like that's a rare testes too like

1063
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:28,920
3% plus right I mean anything 3% and

1064
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:32,119
above is really high some FES I've heard

1065
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:34,760
of 7% which is mindblowing like people

1066
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:37,200
don't even understand what that means 7%

1067
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:40,880
is like that's like extract like just

1068
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:42,639
smoking extract yeah 100% 100% we we

1069
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,920
definitely try to bring something

1070
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:45,838
different to the market if it's going

1071
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,960
into our jars and it's something that we

1072
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:52,639
feno hunted like we've qced it heavily

1073
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:54,039
yeah you know Freddy has selected it and

1074
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:56,799
you know I think he has one of the best

1075
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:58,679
pallets in the world to be honest like

1076
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,599
when he so much he should have a good

1077
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:02,559
palette the thing is is like and you

1078
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:04,838
don't just develop a palette by I mean

1079
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:06,159
most people aren't gifted with a pallet

1080
00:42:04,838 --> 00:42:10,000
right just like fighting and everything

1081
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:11,639
else you could be a gifted fighter but

1082
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,280
it's putting in the work it's putting in

1083
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:15,239
the rep right at the end of the day like

1084
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,119
10,000 hours 10,000 hours you have to

1085
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:18,838
smoke a lot of herb to develop a really

1086
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:21,079
good palette and to differentiate this

1087
00:42:18,838 --> 00:42:22,679
from this from this yeah for sure and so

1088
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:24,240
many people are like oh yeah they go by

1089
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:25,759
the brands or whatever but like really

1090
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:27,598
it comes down to the different flavors

1091
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,839
and the different effects that's why I

1092
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:30,160
always try to tell people like

1093
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:31,558
especially in the wck market like trying

1094
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:33,759
to train Bud tenders trying to train

1095
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:35,160
people it's like THC percentages like

1096
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,280
you know you guys need to start steering

1097
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:42,440
the clients away from that right because

1098
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:44,920
yeah you can give them a a 95% THC

1099
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:48,400
disate cart right where's your high

1100
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:52,838
going to be right here very flat High

1101
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:55,920
you know you get a you take a 22% THC

1102
00:42:52,838 --> 00:42:58,880
flow with 3% tpin like you're going to

1103
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:01,838
be [ __ ] through the roof 14% Sour

1104
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,400
Diesel will wipe off most of these

1105
00:43:01,838 --> 00:43:06,199
strains that are testing in their T you

1106
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:08,720
know real good Sour Diesel grow growing

1107
00:43:06,199 --> 00:43:10,399
in the Sun that stuff was strong you get

1108
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:13,159
like the couch lock from it yeah for

1109
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:15,240
sure and I love that yeah for sure very

1110
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:17,679
sedative very sedative and I think a lot

1111
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:19,759
of people are misinformed about what

1112
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:21,919
canabo do and they need full spectrum

1113
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,200
and a lot of people aren't breeding for

1114
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,920
effect and you know I've been talking

1115
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:27,358
about on my show how I'm really trying

1116
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:29,559
to go back towards breeding for effect

1117
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:30,880
yep but it's also so subjective to the

1118
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:32,480
individual because people get different

1119
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,318
effects from different things that is

1120
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:37,280
true too right

1121
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:39,039
because you know some people love sativa

1122
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,880
dude if I have I'm probing have a heart

1123
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:42,558
attack right it's gonna you know you

1124
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:46,358
smoke some super silver and it's yeah

1125
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:49,319
two a big old joint of it oh done done

1126
00:43:46,358 --> 00:43:52,159
done but uh yeah so it is hard to do

1127
00:43:49,318 --> 00:43:55,920
that but I think that cannabis should be

1128
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:59,078
marketed for their effects right not so

1129
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:01,318
much THC percentage right more of the

1130
00:43:59,079 --> 00:44:03,680
effects of how this flower makes you

1131
00:44:01,318 --> 00:44:06,239
feel right yeah I think that that would

1132
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:08,440
do good for the the wreck Market

1133
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:10,000
especially trying to get that going well

1134
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:11,400
at least standardizing some of the stuff

1135
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,880
and I think that's great for Brands if

1136
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,519
they can start standardizing oh these

1137
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:18,240
are our Citrus Citrus varieties or these

1138
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:20,880
are the the chocolate or these are the

1139
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:22,598
the candies or these are the hazes you

1140
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,880
know U but yeah I mean if you can go

1141
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:27,519
with effect or at least Tarpin you know

1142
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:29,599
like perpen profiles flavor Prof files I

1143
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:31,280
mean I think that we're not putting

1144
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:33,680
enough emphasis on that and that's one

1145
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,559
thing that we could do a lot better yeah

1146
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:37,078
for sure and like that's one thing I'm

1147
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:38,480
currently working on that's why we're

1148
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:41,000
popping so many seeds I want to have a

1149
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:43,800
completely proprietary menu right so

1150
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:48,079
proprietary to our brand having strains

1151
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:50,280
that weo hunted selected and you know

1152
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:52,240
for the W Market I want to have you know

1153
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:57,040
one or two of each right I

1154
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:59,279
want I'm trying to find a OG that is the

1155
00:44:57,039 --> 00:45:01,159
the real OG like you know no look no

1156
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,480
further oh yeah dude let's do it look no

1157
00:45:01,159 --> 00:45:04,159
further we have the real you're ready

1158
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,480
for the real OG we got it in tissue

1159
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:07,679
culture I I want the I'm not sharing

1160
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,639
with a lot of people but I'll share it

1161
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:11,598
with you I want the OG that when you

1162
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:14,838
open the bag it burns your nose hairs

1163
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:16,599
right not the sweet OG not the earthy I

1164
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:18,318
want the gas you know part of that is

1165
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:21,318
how you grow it too like it performs

1166
00:45:18,318 --> 00:45:22,800
better under CMH than it does under LED

1167
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:24,199
and so I think that's part of the reason

1168
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,640
like a lot of guys are growing OG and

1169
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:27,960
they're not getting getting the results

1170
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:29,879
they're looking for uh growing sour

1171
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,800
diesel indoors I think I've been

1172
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:33,519
disappointed with almost everybody Sour

1173
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:35,039
Diesel except this guy Dave who came

1174
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:36,199
through with the real real you're

1175
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:38,759
telling me about that the other day I

1176
00:45:36,199 --> 00:45:40,039
gotta I Gotta See This I Gotta See It I

1177
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,559
yeah I mean I have it here it's it's

1178
00:45:40,039 --> 00:45:44,199
just super special oh yeah yeah by the

1179
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:46,440
way here you have a beautiful facility

1180
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:48,480
dude thank you super sick yeah I mean we

1181
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:51,039
tried to do it right and I feel

1182
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,960
like it's so important these days

1183
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:55,079
whether it's a facility I mean your

1184
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:57,159
facility speaks for who you are you know

1185
00:45:55,079 --> 00:45:59,160
I always believe in let my product do

1186
00:45:57,159 --> 00:46:00,960
talking I don't need to tell people how

1187
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:03,639
great I am I think that just because

1188
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,039
that that's ego and so you show people

1189
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:06,519
what you do you show people how good

1190
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:08,079
your flower is your flower does the

1191
00:46:06,519 --> 00:46:09,599
talking your seeds your genetics when

1192
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:11,440
they buy it they know they're going to

1193
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:13,240
get good stuff and then you don't need

1194
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,800
to Market it as heavily when you can

1195
00:46:13,239 --> 00:46:17,959
present somebody with a good product

1196
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:21,880
that wins every time yeah 100% like let

1197
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:23,920
the flower do the talking let you know

1198
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:25,119
let your flower shine and like dude

1199
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,000
you're you're going

1200
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:30,318
to you're going to develop lifelong

1201
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,159
clients as long as you're putting your

1202
00:46:30,318 --> 00:46:36,000
best foot forward in in that you know

1203
00:46:33,159 --> 00:46:37,920
well and I feel like the guys with the

1204
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,199
good flower everybody kind of knows each

1205
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,960
other there's one step of Separation I

1206
00:46:40,199 --> 00:46:44,679
mean it's not that big of a market that

1207
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:47,400
side of it is very small everybody's

1208
00:46:44,679 --> 00:46:49,759
interconnected because not everybody

1209
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:51,838
needs good flour not and obviously with

1210
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:54,520
the California Market you look at the

1211
00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:56,440
flower and the dispensaries it's all you

1212
00:46:54,519 --> 00:46:58,358
know at the max most of its a grade and

1213
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,920
then there's special class of flower

1214
00:46:58,358 --> 00:47:02,838
that fetches a higher dollar amount

1215
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:05,480
where you're seeing you know over $3,000

1216
00:47:02,838 --> 00:47:08,639
pounds y or even $100 Ace and then

1217
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:11,679
there's that tip of the iceberg which is

1218
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:15,400
like the NorCal Nemo yeah yeah the

1219
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:16,960
$1,800 an ounce Jesus Christ you know

1220
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,680
it's so good for all of us though right

1221
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:22,358
like I I love the fact that they have

1222
00:47:18,679 --> 00:47:24,440
$1,800 ounces or whatever uh 7200 for 2

1223
00:47:22,358 --> 00:47:27,078
PBS I heard y from those guys post

1224
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:29,720
Malone yeah post Malone yeah I know yeah

1225
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:31,760
I mean I heard2 for2 pound that's crazy

1226
00:47:29,719 --> 00:47:33,679
my buddy was there it's so good for all

1227
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,680
of us though and so people that hate on

1228
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:35,960
it and they're like dude that's so

1229
00:47:34,679 --> 00:47:37,759
stupid but there's something for

1230
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:40,760
everybody and there's a price point for

1231
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:42,640
every person's budget and it's only good

1232
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:44,440
for everybody when people are getting

1233
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:46,318
those kind of numbers especially the

1234
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:49,720
cultivators so I mean cultivators are

1235
00:47:46,318 --> 00:47:51,800
getting beat up these days uh like never

1236
00:47:49,719 --> 00:47:53,598
before yeah no definitely there's cold

1237
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:56,680
Vaders getting beat up left and right

1238
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:59,519
but the thing is it's like you know at

1239
00:47:56,679 --> 00:48:01,759
the the end of the day they need

1240
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:04,119
cultivators right they need us like yeah

1241
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,319
you can't just but you know it's how

1242
00:48:04,119 --> 00:48:07,358
it's how hard are you working are you

1243
00:48:05,318 --> 00:48:09,519
going out getting new clients doing

1244
00:48:07,358 --> 00:48:11,558
these things right because when you

1245
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:14,480
don't have clients and you have you know

1246
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:16,599
a thousand lights and you have bills

1247
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:19,039
coming every month and you're sitting on

1248
00:48:16,599 --> 00:48:21,359
five boxes and this guy's like well I'll

1249
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:24,239
take everything for 700 bucks yeah you

1250
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:26,199
know you're like done just take it right

1251
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:27,479
then now every time he comes back he's

1252
00:48:26,199 --> 00:48:29,960
going to want that

1253
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:32,000
price and say no I'll just go to the

1254
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:34,679
facility down the street or I'll go to

1255
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,760
atanto I'll go here right so it's like

1256
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:41,279
you got to you know me as a cultivator

1257
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:43,280
and brand owner um I try to go out and

1258
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:46,720
network as much as possible go to every

1259
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:49,680
event do all these things you know um

1260
00:48:46,719 --> 00:48:53,118
because like you know you could have

1261
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:54,879
whatever size facility you have only 10%

1262
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:56,880
is probably making it into your jars

1263
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:59,160
right right like you could have a you

1264
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:01,280
know just to be honest because a lot of

1265
00:48:59,159 --> 00:49:03,279
things don't meet QC or this you know

1266
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:05,319
what I mean you also can't just put

1267
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:07,440
everything in a jars and have it sitting

1268
00:49:05,318 --> 00:49:09,239
in a drro right like if you're running a

1269
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,119
brand you need to keep the flower fresh

1270
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:12,519
yeah so you have to play off the market

1271
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:14,680
right well then you can cherry pick the

1272
00:49:12,519 --> 00:49:15,920
best the best for your jars oh 100% And

1273
00:49:14,679 --> 00:49:17,719
so and not a lot of people are doing

1274
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:19,280
that I mean obviously the better brands

1275
00:49:17,719 --> 00:49:20,759
are but there's a lot of people that

1276
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:23,119
just put everything they don't grade it

1277
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:25,040
they put the smalls in there or the the

1278
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:27,280
one that bothers me the most is these

1279
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:29,400
guys with pre-rolls and the pre-rolls

1280
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:31,000
are just the scraps or they're just

1281
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,400
they're not even just the smalls cuz I

1282
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,838
have respect for people that put Smalls

1283
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,639
in I think that's a great place for your

1284
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:37,159
Smalls exactly you put Skittles Smalls

1285
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:40,039
in it tastes just like Skittles you can

1286
00:49:37,159 --> 00:49:42,078
get burn exactly everything yeah but the

1287
00:49:40,039 --> 00:49:44,279
guys that put [ __ ] in their pre-rolls

1288
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,280
and

1289
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:49,920
thens whatever it just and and when we

1290
00:49:47,838 --> 00:49:51,838
talk about it speaks for itself that

1291
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,599
that is you then like that's your

1292
00:49:51,838 --> 00:49:56,358
representation of your brand and your

1293
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:58,039
name to the world and to me that sucks

1294
00:49:56,358 --> 00:50:01,358
like I would never want to be that guy

1295
00:49:58,039 --> 00:50:02,719
we've been r&amp; ding joints for about six

1296
00:50:01,358 --> 00:50:04,759
months maybe seven months and we're

1297
00:50:02,719 --> 00:50:06,078
going to be doing R&amp;D for another six or

1298
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:08,319
seven months with our cultivation

1299
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:11,160
Partners before we release pre-rolls out

1300
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:13,119
on the wck market but it has to be

1301
00:50:11,159 --> 00:50:15,440
perfect in my opinion we're not going to

1302
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:16,920
unless it's absolutely perfect you know

1303
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,119
and the thing is is

1304
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:20,680
like it's got to be the perfect flower

1305
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:23,400
because you want the burn you want the

1306
00:50:20,679 --> 00:50:25,598
drip and you want if somebody's paying

1307
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:30,079
premium price it needs to check all the

1308
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:32,200
boxes oh 100% white ash Oil ring smooth

1309
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:33,440
smoke down to the roach tastes amazing I

1310
00:50:32,199 --> 00:50:35,118
don't want to put anything a joint that

1311
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,000
doesn't do that yeah exactly because

1312
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:38,358
there is stuff that that's good that

1313
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,639
doesn't do that but I would never put

1314
00:50:38,358 --> 00:50:43,719
that in a pre-roll yeah yeah true true

1315
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:45,838
that's why we've been so currently we're

1316
00:50:43,719 --> 00:50:48,358
only doing our jars our eighth jars

1317
00:50:45,838 --> 00:50:50,199
we've been trying to so we have a really

1318
00:50:48,358 --> 00:50:52,759
good pre-roll right uh I wouldn't call

1319
00:50:50,199 --> 00:50:54,719
it pre-roll it's hand rolls um and we

1320
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:56,760
roll them give them away at events it's

1321
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:58,919
like really just like the best marketing

1322
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:00,240
can you we can have giving them away

1323
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,559
right and it's so easy and you know

1324
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:06,558
they're going to smoke it and remember

1325
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:10,359
your name yeah 100% 100% uh getting hand

1326
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:12,760
rolls to market cost of goods is insane

1327
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:14,598
though right uh shout outs to all the

1328
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:15,760
rollers like that's like a whole new

1329
00:51:14,599 --> 00:51:17,559
it's a tough thing you know and it's

1330
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:19,799
like I think you got to do it in hous is

1331
00:51:17,559 --> 00:51:22,240
My Philosophy now is like so I've been

1332
00:51:19,798 --> 00:51:24,318
working on how can we do this at scale

1333
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:26,199
with our cultivation Partners to where I

1334
00:51:24,318 --> 00:51:29,000
can go in and teach these guys how to do

1335
00:51:26,199 --> 00:51:31,000
it grow the flower we do it ourselves

1336
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,880
basically and put it on the market and

1337
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,159
have a consistent quality product and

1338
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,480
it's like there's so many details to get

1339
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:40,838
something that's super consistent like

1340
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:43,719
that the right grind it's like as as the

1341
00:51:40,838 --> 00:51:46,199
right grinder right like you use the

1342
00:51:43,719 --> 00:51:48,598
wrong grinder and dude they've done a

1343
00:51:46,199 --> 00:51:50,639
lot of tests lately like uh like the

1344
00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:54,000
proper doink guys they did like a bunch

1345
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:56,358
of tests on like Grinders 95% of them or

1346
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,079
some [ __ ] had like uh metal shavings in

1347
00:51:56,358 --> 00:51:59,119
it

1348
00:51:57,079 --> 00:52:00,640
it's like I think flower Mill definitely

1349
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:02,680
popped on there but they've corrected

1350
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:04,798
that corrected it so I'm a big flower

1351
00:52:02,679 --> 00:52:06,519
Mill fan I I have my sweet leaf that

1352
00:52:04,798 --> 00:52:08,679
I've had since the beginning I I got one

1353
00:52:06,519 --> 00:52:11,480
of the first 10 prototypes of Sweet Leaf

1354
00:52:08,679 --> 00:52:15,759
Grinders in 1997 I was gifted by my

1355
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:19,400
buddy Gus and it was 97 you still have

1356
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:21,160
it uh no it got I got stolen it went

1357
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:23,519
through some crazy adventures and then

1358
00:52:21,159 --> 00:52:25,759
got I had a spray ground backpack that

1359
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:27,159
that had uh instead of Miller High Life

1360
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,480
it said High Life on it but it was that

1361
00:52:27,159 --> 00:52:31,318
same design Y and uh yeah it was in

1362
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:33,440
there got robbed in Oakland [ __ ] they

1363
00:52:31,318 --> 00:52:35,599
took my backpack left left in the car

1364
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,599
left it in the car yeah yeah that's what

1365
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:38,160
happened you can't you can't leave

1366
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:40,200
anything in your car no that was the

1367
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:41,558
second time in two weeks and you know

1368
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:43,078
and that that grinder went through all

1369
00:52:41,559 --> 00:52:46,200
this stuff with me and that happened I

1370
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:48,039
think in 2019 I lost it damn but it was

1371
00:52:46,199 --> 00:52:49,679
one of the original original Grinders

1372
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:51,400
before there was there was no Grinders

1373
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:53,239
people used to use scissors and you know

1374
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:55,480
a lot of times it'd be a shot glass and

1375
00:52:53,239 --> 00:52:58,679
you just chop it up with the shot glass

1376
00:52:55,480 --> 00:53:00,760
and there some fiskers yep yep I used to

1377
00:52:58,679 --> 00:53:03,598
do the hand breakdown technique back in

1378
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:05,480
the day but that's too sticky back in

1379
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:07,440
the day too but back then everyone was

1380
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:10,159
like we're smoking swishers right yeah

1381
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,639
so it's like you don't want a fine fine

1382
00:53:10,159 --> 00:53:13,279
grind when you're rolling a blun yeah

1383
00:53:11,639 --> 00:53:15,000
you're okay with course with that yeah

1384
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,880
exactly but rolling a joint you need

1385
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,039
super fine grind right yeah I well I

1386
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:21,400
like medium grind with because I I roll

1387
00:53:19,039 --> 00:53:23,838
big you know two and a half gram joints

1388
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:26,880
that's that's my big dogs you get the

1389
00:53:23,838 --> 00:53:29,400
best flavor you think I think if you do

1390
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:31,920
thin and long with 2 and 1 half grams

1391
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:34,559
that's like anywhere from two to three

1392
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:37,440
you can get amazing flavor but like from

1393
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:39,960
r&amp; ding from spending the time putting

1394
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,159
the Reps in yeah that's my joint of

1395
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:43,798
choice I feel like they burn the best

1396
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:45,440
they're they're cool if you do them thin

1397
00:53:43,798 --> 00:53:47,039
enough before I was doing these really

1398
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,880
thick ones where they get too hot you

1399
00:53:47,039 --> 00:53:50,719
got to do them thin enough you want them

1400
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,798
to have and the white ash actually I

1401
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:53,399
used to think that was a joke but the

1402
00:53:51,798 --> 00:53:55,798
white ash actually keeps the Cherry

1403
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:57,358
cooler yep right so most people don't

1404
00:53:55,798 --> 00:53:58,400
know that but that's why you want that

1405
00:53:57,358 --> 00:54:00,798
white ash and that's why you don't want

1406
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,519
to tap your that's why you don't Ash it

1407
00:54:00,798 --> 00:54:05,318
some people will [ __ ] kill you for

1408
00:54:02,519 --> 00:54:07,679
that what did you do and know and then

1409
00:54:05,318 --> 00:54:09,440
the oil ring is just kind of a a sign

1410
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:11,399
that the joint was yeah it was it was

1411
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:13,519
grown correctly there's lots of resin in

1412
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,920
it it's not necessary for everything

1413
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:17,039
I've smoked some amazing stuff that

1414
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:18,920
doesn't have an oil ring it also depends

1415
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:20,159
on your papers too it totally depends on

1416
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:21,798
your papers yeah like you use some

1417
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:23,358
[ __ ] papers like and how tight you

1418
00:54:21,798 --> 00:54:24,838
roll the joint and there's other things

1419
00:54:23,358 --> 00:54:26,920
there's so many things to I do like

1420
00:54:24,838 --> 00:54:28,960
there's people like one one of my

1421

1431
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,760
long not a long time ago maybe four or

1432
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:56,558
five years ago so I tried to avoid it if

1433
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:58,680
it's there's nothing else around I'll

1434

1439
00:55:08,679 --> 00:55:12,798
was like dude try it try it I was like

1440
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:14,160
and one of our buddies I was from Spain

1441
00:55:12,798 --> 00:55:15,559
he was like no this is like this how we

1442
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:17,480
smoke out here I was like all right I

1443
00:55:15,559 --> 00:55:19,880
was like it's actually [ __ ] nice it

1444
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:21,440
tastes pretty good it's it's clean it's

1445
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:23,079
smooth it's and it gives you a different

1446
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:26,000
kind of high too so like you get this

1447
00:55:23,079 --> 00:55:28,720
clear clean high from it cuz the ni the

1448
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,119
ni exactly and so I do like I think

1449
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:32,679
their tobacco is different out there

1450
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:33,920
though it's for sure different it's not

1451
00:55:32,679 --> 00:55:36,118
you know depending on who it is and how

1452
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:37,720
they're rolling it but uh but yeah also

1453
00:55:36,119 --> 00:55:39,920
the hash is different we're not seeing a

1454
00:55:37,719 --> 00:55:42,639
lot of the Moroccan style that's all it

1455
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:44,079
was you know all it was was that dude

1456
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:46,838
the Tangi a lot of people don't like

1457
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:49,240
Tangi here Tangi hash is so popular

1458
00:55:46,838 --> 00:55:51,279
there and it comes out so good and it SM

1459
00:55:49,239 --> 00:55:52,959
so good I like it a lot better in the

1460
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,359
hash form than I do in the flower form

1461
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:57,079
although Tangi had its day and it was

1462
00:55:54,358 --> 00:56:00,358
cool it's kind of linear right yeah yeah

1463
00:55:57,079 --> 00:56:05,079
for sure it had a short like Sacramento

1464
00:56:00,358 --> 00:56:06,719
like Who ah who bred that it was DNA DNA

1465
00:56:05,079 --> 00:56:08,039
DNA with Crockett Crockett Crockett

1466
00:56:06,719 --> 00:56:09,798
they're out of sack right yeah yeah well

1467
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:11,400
no well he's yeah he's the valley he's a

1468
00:56:09,798 --> 00:56:13,038
valley guy right and he was on the coast

1469
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:15,400
and he was in the valley yeah yeah know

1470
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:18,559
it had it's had like a short Heyday

1471
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:21,318
period it was the most warded strain of

1472
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:23,720
all time at one point in like the two

1473
00:56:21,318 --> 00:56:25,318
all the High Times cups it wasal cup I

1474
00:56:23,719 --> 00:56:27,358
think I think it was an emerald cup a

1475
00:56:25,318 --> 00:56:28,759
bunch but people it was also one of

1476
00:56:27,358 --> 00:56:30,598
those ones that were like if you were a

1477
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:32,079
judge you knew which one was the Tangi

1478
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:34,280
it was like the one that stood out and

1479
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:36,798
some people three Tangi entries because

1480
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:38,440
everyone's trying to win yeah and so DNA

1481
00:56:36,798 --> 00:56:40,480
was getting up on the stage you know and

1482
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:43,240
I saw them get up on the stage and you

1483
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,358
know multiple multiple times per cup

1484
00:56:43,239 --> 00:56:46,159
they were crushing because people were

1485
00:56:44,358 --> 00:56:47,558
growing their genetics yeah for sure

1486
00:56:46,159 --> 00:56:49,358
yeah so yeah those are my boys those

1487
00:56:47,559 --> 00:56:50,519
they do a great job yeah know they they

1488
00:56:49,358 --> 00:56:52,679
killed it with that and it's like that

1489
00:56:50,519 --> 00:56:54,559
was like what I feel like that cuz it

1490
00:56:52,679 --> 00:56:56,078
was like blue dream was popping back

1491
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:57,119
then for probably a couple years before

1492
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:59,400
that

1493
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:01,480
then when the Tangi dropped it was like

1494
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:03,000
orange turps you know what I mean and

1495
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:05,039
then well there was like the lemon tree

1496
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,679
so that's the good side of the yes so

1497
00:57:05,039 --> 00:57:08,880
there's agent orange and most of that

1498
00:57:06,679 --> 00:57:11,399
that was from seed that was from subcool

1499
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:13,798
and it was a very linear orange it was

1500
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:15,960
just like you were getting plain orange

1501
00:57:13,798 --> 00:57:18,639
there was no complexity to it at all and

1502
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:20,358
I hated it I was like e but then I tried

1503
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:22,639
House of cvar in Washington had out

1504
00:57:20,358 --> 00:57:25,038
agent orange that was complex it was

1505
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:26,519
very different than like Tangi and all

1506
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:28,680
these other things the agent orange that

1507
00:57:26,519 --> 00:57:30,880
I remember was like orangey but chemi

1508
00:57:28,679 --> 00:57:32,719
too like almost chemically that's how

1509
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,440
the one was a house of cultivar it was

1510
00:57:32,719 --> 00:57:36,118
that was a better one the ones that I

1511
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:37,880
had tried were probably from seed

1512
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:39,599
because they sold seeds of it and so it

1513
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:41,920
was very linear and then I I got this

1514
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:43,680
chemy gassy kind of yeah exactly that's

1515
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:46,200
that's Asian orange I remember yeah yeah

1516
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:49,000
yeah that's a good one that's good but

1517
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:51,239
like lemon tree I really like lemon tree

1518
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,960
but there was a lot of lemon finicky

1519
00:57:51,239 --> 00:57:54,159
plant finicky and there was two

1520
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:57,358
different fenos there was like the real

1521
00:57:54,159 --> 00:57:59,558
short feno there was super like lip

1522
00:57:57,358 --> 00:58:01,119
smacking lemon and that's that's what I

1523
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:03,359
I like that lip when when you grew it

1524
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:04,760
right it had that lip smacking like bur

1525
00:58:03,358 --> 00:58:07,400
your nose a little bit on the bag when

1526
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:10,000
you open it you know be real was [ __ ]

1527
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:12,599
he was repping it hard he was talking

1528
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:16,400
and burner too yeah yeah yeah day for

1529
00:58:12,599 --> 00:58:18,240
sure they were hard 2017 18ish you know

1530
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:19,960
and it was just popping and then that

1531
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:22,000
kind of evolved there was the gelonade

1532
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:24,480
and the melonade and I love melonade

1533
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,920
melonade is like I love gelonade I so I

1534
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:29,000
didn't get good gelonade tell

1535
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:30,559
four three three years ago May I'm I'm

1536
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,280
going to bring you some good gelonade I

1537
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:34,200
got you bring you some of our gelonade

1538
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:35,760
so the gelonade I had had before I was

1539
00:58:34,199 --> 00:58:38,159
like oh gelonade is not that good I like

1540
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:41,160
melonade way better uh we had a cut of

1541
00:58:38,159 --> 00:58:43,318
the melonade and it was like cantaloupes

1542
00:58:41,159 --> 00:58:45,000
right and the thing is just like when

1543
00:58:43,318 --> 00:58:46,519
Skittles grown right every once in a

1544
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,599
while it'll pop cantaloupe turps where

1545
00:58:46,519 --> 00:58:51,400
you open the bag and it's fresh melons y

1546
00:58:48,599 --> 00:58:54,079
dude that melonade used to pop thosea

1547
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:55,599
same cantaloupe smell when you smoke it

1548
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:57,200
all the way down and I was like I love

1549
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:58,480
this stuff then I'd got bad batches of

1550
00:58:57,199 --> 00:58:59,960
gelonade and all of a sudden someone

1551
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:02,480
brought me some connected gelonade and I

1552
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:05,318
was like oh that's that's really good

1553
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:08,679
that's amazing yeah smok's good flavor

1554
00:59:05,318 --> 00:59:11,199
is just amazing down to the roach yeah

1555
00:59:08,679 --> 00:59:14,159
no it's yeah galade is like one of my f

1556
00:59:11,199 --> 00:59:16,598
like favor Grove like it's just such a

1557
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:20,239
pretty plant too super resinous like

1558
00:59:16,599 --> 00:59:23,079
perfect bud structure like when I you

1559
00:59:20,239 --> 00:59:26,358
know probably

1560
00:59:23,079 --> 00:59:28,480
2018 19 when I first no I think 201 when

1561
00:59:26,358 --> 00:59:30,440
I first got that cut like doing

1562
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:32,079
monocrops right because back then you

1563
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:36,400
could do monocrop rooms where people

1564
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:39,559
would just buy you know 40 50 100 at a

1565
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:41,760
time right to going into Co it was crazy

1566
00:59:39,559 --> 00:59:43,359
oh yeah they'll take everything right

1567
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:45,799
they'll take everything can't do that

1568
00:59:43,358 --> 00:59:48,239
now no the prices shot up during Co and

1569
00:59:45,798 --> 00:59:50,400
then it people started expanding that's

1570
00:59:48,239 --> 00:59:52,959
the problem is people got so excited

1571
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:55,000
about the money that was coming in uh

1572
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:56,960
all over the us if you're growing good

1573
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,880
flower theice prices were high and they

1574
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:01,960
were shooting up towards 335 even for

1575
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:03,760
Stuff a lot for the for not even the

1576
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:05,199
best of the best but for really good

1577
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:06,799
stuff if you had something different

1578
01:00:05,199 --> 01:00:09,558
right bro if you had

1579
01:00:06,798 --> 01:00:11,719
anything de like dude decent with good

1580
01:00:09,559 --> 01:00:13,640
color didn't even have to smoke BR

1581
01:00:11,719 --> 01:00:16,838
you're getting $3,000 a pound in during

1582
01:00:13,639 --> 01:00:19,318
Co easy all day all these guys have I

1583
01:00:16,838 --> 01:00:22,199
cre k for 3K like what are we talking

1584
01:00:19,318 --> 01:00:23,798
about now right it's like wedding cake

1585
01:00:22,199 --> 01:00:25,759
even like you didn't give ice cream cake

1586
01:00:23,798 --> 01:00:27,719
away right now no wedding cake ice cream

1587
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:31,359
cake have had their day and I like ice

1588
01:00:27,719 --> 01:00:33,159
cream cake uh it's in the right scenario

1589
01:00:31,358 --> 01:00:34,598
I like ice cream cake I like the extract

1590
01:00:33,159 --> 01:00:37,000
from it I think the extract is really

1591
01:00:34,599 --> 01:00:39,720
good the second person I've heard say

1592
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:42,039
that second person I've never I've never

1593
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:43,078
seen it or or experienced it but I like

1594
01:00:42,039 --> 01:00:44,440
it better than the flour like if you

1595
01:00:43,079 --> 01:00:45,960
gave me some ice cream cake flour right

1596
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:48,240
now I'd be like oh whatever but you give

1597
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:49,760
me a jar of ice cream cake extract I'd

1598
01:00:48,239 --> 01:00:51,199
be like yeah and I'm not like purple

1599
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:54,119
punch is one that I won't smoke the

1600
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:56,879
flour I it just it bothers me bothers me

1601
01:00:54,119 --> 01:00:59,280
that people would even still grow it

1602
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:02,358
it had its Heyday though it did love it

1603
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:04,720
some people still talk about yeah people

1604
01:01:02,358 --> 01:01:06,598
that don't know what it is if you grew

1605
01:01:04,719 --> 01:01:08,358
it and you were a grow that didn't smoke

1606
01:01:06,599 --> 01:01:10,318
you'd be like this thing's amazing it

1607
01:01:08,358 --> 01:01:12,759
smells so good on the planet it yields

1608
01:01:10,318 --> 01:01:14,519
like crazy it's so Frosty resinous yeah

1609
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:17,240
so resinous but then like you go to

1610
01:01:14,519 --> 01:01:19,239
smoke it and it's it's worse of a let

1611
01:01:17,239 --> 01:01:21,439
down than Oreos at least Oreos has some

1612
01:01:19,239 --> 01:01:24,038
sort of flavor it's not my choice of

1613
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:26,159
flavor Oreos is just kind of very flat

1614
01:01:24,039 --> 01:01:28,920
it's very flat it's like we call

1615
01:01:26,159 --> 01:01:30,519
cardboard TS you for sure whereas purple

1616
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:34,000
punch is just missing the turps you

1617
01:01:30,519 --> 01:01:36,440
light it up and you might get one almost

1618
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,239
but it smells crazy it smells crazy but

1619
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:40,318
as you're smoking a big joint of it

1620
01:01:38,239 --> 01:01:42,399
there's no taste there's no flavor it

1621
01:01:40,318 --> 01:01:43,960
tastes like just weed and that dude

1622
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,720
that's what's so important about having

1623
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:47,760
someone that can select for your brand

1624
01:01:45,719 --> 01:01:50,159
or being able to select for your brand

1625
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:53,200

1629
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:04,639

this in the mall but like when you see

1699
01:04:37,239 --> 01:04:41,199
5-year-old kids might not even know what

1700
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:43,039
cookies means I we all know what it

1701
01:04:41,199 --> 01:04:44,480
means but because it's it's a lifestyle

1702
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:45,920
right like that's a Lifestyle brand we

1703
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:47,559

the market yep um because I feel like

1709
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:59,680
that's a important component I mean

1710
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:01,199
everything circles back to genetics but

1711
01:04:59,679 --> 01:05:03,919
that's a great way to get your name out

1712
01:05:01,199 --> 01:05:05,558
is by having a Lifestyle brand that has

1713
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:07,159
clothing whether it's t-shirts hats

1714
01:05:05,559 --> 01:05:08,839
hoodies all that stuff it's a

1715
01:05:07,159 --> 01:05:10,480
representation of you and so you can't

1716
01:05:08,838 --> 01:05:12,239
skimp on the quality that's what other

1717
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:14,760

1724
01:05:23,239 --> 01:05:28,358
it to the next level with loud time yeah

1725
01:05:25,358 --> 01:05:31,960

1726
01:05:28,358 --> 01:05:34,199
working like we do sweaters shirts stuff

1727
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:36,838

01:05:34,199 --> 01:05:38,519
sold a single one of those printed

1729
01:05:36,838 --> 01:05:41,480
hundreds probably thousands just give

1730
01:05:38,519 --> 01:05:43,159
them away yeah right because like I said

1731
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:44,838
it's like rolling the joints having

1732
01:05:43,159 --> 01:05:46,960
handrolled joints giving them away it's

1733
01:05:44,838 --> 01:05:49,440
just good for marketing right but we are

1734
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:51,920
working on a merch line as well which we

1735
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:54,159
should be dropping but it's like like

1736
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:55,960
you said high quality right like all

1737
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:57,598
custom made like you need to do high

1738
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:59,159
quality if it's like a real Lifestyle

1739
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:02,079
brand otherwise what kind of Lifestyle

1740
01:05:59,159 --> 01:06:04,598
are you rep representing exactly exactly

1741
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:06,318
and people want you know if they're like

1742
01:06:04,599 --> 01:06:08,359
goes back to like the economy like if

1743
01:06:06,318 --> 01:06:10,480
they're spending money on it they want

1744
01:06:08,358 --> 01:06:12,440
it to be good right they don't want to

1745
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:16,278
throw it in the washer and a dryer and

1746
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:18,240
then oh it's faded oh you knowes out of

1747
01:06:16,278 --> 01:06:19,880
it the screen printing is fading after

1748
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:22,798
[ __ ] you know like you said five

1749
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:24,720
washes it's like but you know it all

1750
01:06:22,798 --> 01:06:26,798
takes time and it's exciting to see

1751
01:06:24,719 --> 01:06:28,558
other brands do it it makes it all

1752
01:06:26,798 --> 01:06:31,239

amazing they've taken to that level

1770
01:07:07,639 --> 01:07:12,078
because they made it possible for all of

1771
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:14,960
us to potentially go in that direction

1772

James loud it's like we thought long and

1785
01:07:39,719 --> 01:07:44,719
hard we're going to do something that

1786
01:07:41,559 --> 01:07:47,039
reps the brand properly and like planta

1787

you guys it's that luxury brand look it

1788
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:51,720
feels like La yeah when I look at it I

1789
01:07:49,358 --> 01:07:55,639
think planta okay you guys are from La

1790
01:07:51,719 --> 01:07:58,639
yeah 100% like it was it was born in LA

1791
01:07:55,639 --> 01:08:00,838
we uh you know have been growing

1792
01:07:58,639 --> 01:08:02,719
downtown LA in the thick of it you know

1793
01:08:00,838 --> 01:08:05,440
dealt with every like you did if you

1794
01:08:02,719 --> 01:08:07,239
talk to anyone that grows in Downtown LA

1795
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:08,920
all these areas it's like we've dealt

1796
01:08:07,239 --> 01:08:10,879
with the robberies we've dealt with

1797
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:14,639
extortion we've dealt with all these

1798
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:19,719
things you know what I mean and uh I

1799
01:08:14,639 --> 01:08:21,639
feel like growing in La really like from

1800
01:08:19,719 --> 01:08:24,198
a 100 lights to building up to you know

1801
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:26,440
500 lights in in LA in the thick of it

1802
01:08:24,198 --> 01:08:29,519
right it's just like

1803
01:08:26,439 --> 01:08:32,399
that helped mold our brand right like

1804
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:36,560
tremendously so I really wanted the logo

1805
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:37,960
to speak for LA right so that's you know

1806
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:40,920
kind of where we went with it and like

1807
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:45,480
planta right it's just like in a world

1808
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:48,079
of fancy myars and diecut bags like we

1809
01:08:45,479 --> 01:08:51,198
just want to have a clean cut jar and

1810
01:08:48,079 --> 01:08:53,479
even the name like that's what matters

1811
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:55,158
the plant right the plant matters the

1812
01:08:53,479 --> 01:08:57,759
product matters that's the only thing

1813
01:08:55,158 --> 01:09:00,039
that's really going to sell it over you

1814
01:08:57,759 --> 01:09:01,359
know a long period of time right we're

1815
01:09:00,039 --> 01:09:03,439
not here for a short time like we're

1816
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:06,239
playing the long game right like I don't

1817
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:07,599
have an exit strategy like I'm not so

1818
01:09:06,238 --> 01:09:09,599
fast but it is the long game that you

1819
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:12,159
got to for for sure no for sure like

1820
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:14,440
years fly by right and it's like it's

1821
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:15,679

1824
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:19,520

years it's like dude there's no exit

1826
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:24,520
strategy like I like what am I going to

1827
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,920
do after that like I just want to grow

then put it in Crazy myar bags and I'm

1848
01:10:14,399 --> 01:10:18,079
not a huge fan of the TP concept because

1849
01:10:17,198 --> 01:10:21,039
I feel

1850
01:10:18,079 --> 01:10:23,399
like uh I like breeding good flower I

1851
01:10:21,039 --> 01:10:24,640
mean as a as a breeder I have so much

1852
01:10:23,399 --> 01:10:26,519
respect for guys that can do the

1853
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:28,119
selection yeah yeah that's where

1854
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:30,120
breeding happens it's it's not making

1855
01:10:28,119 --> 01:10:32,079
seeds anybody can make seeds yeah it's

1856
01:10:30,119 --> 01:10:34,158
that selection process that really makes

1857
01:10:32,079 --> 01:10:37,719
one company or one person stand out from

1858
01:10:34,158 --> 01:10:39,079
the rest yeah yeah and bro someone's

1859
01:10:37,719 --> 01:10:42,158
smoking tped weed and hands out to me

1860
01:10:39,079 --> 01:10:44,920
I'm not smoking that don't don't give me

1861
01:10:42,158 --> 01:10:46,759
that like bro I try to eat healthy like

1862
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:48,399
live healthy eat clean yeah why do you

1863
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:50,640
want to smoke a vape pen in the form of

1864
01:10:48,399 --> 01:10:52,839
a joint either at the same time we're

1865
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:54,360
talking about popcorn lung and all these

1866
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:55,920
other things that are potentially there

1867
01:10:54,359 --> 01:10:58,238
that we don't we don't know we don't

1868
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:00,679
know enough about it exactly the tests

1869
01:10:58,238 --> 01:11:02,919
the tests aren't the results aren't back

1870
01:11:00,679 --> 01:11:05,000
yet right like we don't know how this

1871
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:07,039
truly affects us right like it's really

1872
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:09,719
popular in some places which is New York

1873
01:11:07,039 --> 01:11:12,439
it's going crazy New York and Atlanta so

1874
01:11:09,719 --> 01:11:17,279
excited about it dude you hear like

1875
01:11:12,439 --> 01:11:19,519
but it is a new market right they they

1876
01:11:17,279 --> 01:11:23,119
don't have the pallets that we have in

1877
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:26,280
California or the understanding I feel

1878
01:11:23,119 --> 01:11:29,198
like right so it's like and I feel like

1879
01:11:26,279 --> 01:11:30,639
you know it might be different because

1880
01:11:29,198 --> 01:11:32,119
they smoke them through blunts too so

1881
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:34,199
like smoke through blunts if you're

1882
01:11:32,119 --> 01:11:36,439
smoking a blunt and it passes through

1883
01:11:34,198 --> 01:11:38,799
people get excited about that but as far

1884
01:11:36,439 --> 01:11:40,638
as like a healthy product is it a

1885
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:43,199
healthy product it's unlikely that it's

1886
01:11:40,639 --> 01:11:45,319
a healthy product right but yeah it just

1887
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:47,839
it doesn't taste good to me either right

1888
01:11:45,319 --> 01:11:49,960
like I like real flour right I mean I

1889
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:51,920
was so blown away the other day someone

1890
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:53,960
told me that it was chirped flour and it

1891
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:56,239
didn't even taste chirped and I was kind

1892
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:58,439
of like oh really it freaked me out a

1893
01:11:56,238 --> 01:12:00,079
little bit to be honest oh [ __ ] I mean

1894
01:11:58,439 --> 01:12:02,238
it was that it was that good to where it

1895
01:12:00,079 --> 01:12:04,039
was like whoa that you know it's like

1896
01:12:02,238 --> 01:12:06,198
throw some vanilla in there and it's in

1897
01:12:04,039 --> 01:12:09,039
small amounts I mean they can do all

1898
01:12:06,198 --> 01:12:12,279
kinds of stuff but also most people

1899
01:12:09,039 --> 01:12:15,198
aren't going to do that with the their

1900
01:12:12,279 --> 01:12:17,880
other people's uh best intentions in

1901
01:12:15,198 --> 01:12:20,119
mind no no I I feel like it's like a

1902
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:22,800
gimmick product right like it like

1903
01:12:20,119 --> 01:12:25,679
snowballs snowb it's like with a thca

1904
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:27,719
powder it's like yeah yeah that's just I

1905
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:30,679
mean and then it was like the thca

1906
01:12:27,719 --> 01:12:33,840
powder then a lot of them are doing like

1907
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:37,440
the 50/50 blends of thca CBD so it's

1908
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:38,480
like way cheaper right but like you know

1909
01:12:37,439 --> 01:12:40,759
there's always going to be the

1910
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:43,279
Revolutions of it it'll start here to be

1911
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:45,719
good then as the market drops as the

1912
01:12:43,279 --> 01:12:47,800
market drops you know what I mean but

1913
01:12:45,719 --> 01:12:50,000
those products are like they're gimmicks

1914
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:52,039
they're like shooting stars right they

1915
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,960
shine real bright and then fizzle out

1916
01:12:52,039 --> 01:12:56,198
right it's like moon rocks back in the

1917
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:59,399
day right you know all these things it's

1918
01:12:56,198 --> 01:13:01,238
like they're here for a for a small time

1919
01:12:59,399 --> 01:13:03,319
and they'll well and they'll catch a

1920
01:13:01,238 --> 01:13:05,319
little bit of and the guy who hits it in

1921
01:13:03,319 --> 01:13:06,639
the beginning if you're on that oh for

1922
01:13:05,319 --> 01:13:08,559
sure you're probably going to crush it

1923
01:13:06,639 --> 01:13:10,039
right if you're the the inator in that

1924
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:11,760
those guys are getting like $5,000 a

1925
01:13:10,039 --> 01:13:13,719
pound in New York and [ __ ] yeah like

1926
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:16,199
well and they have to keep changing the

1927
01:13:13,719 --> 01:13:19,158
flavors they use the same flour yeah

1928
01:13:16,198 --> 01:13:20,839
from here yeah for sure right and they

1929
01:13:19,158 --> 01:13:22,879
so funny cuz white runs right so they're

1930
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:24,520
using white runs as the flower at least

1931
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:25,800
to my knowledge they probably this was a

1932
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:27,560
while back that I heard this but white

1933
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:30,079
runs is the flower and they had to come

1934
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:32,920
out with different flavors constantly so

1935
01:13:30,079 --> 01:13:35,719
they wouldn't get knocked off um and

1936
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:37,600
they different bags and different yeah

1937
01:13:35,719 --> 01:13:38,960
that's a big thing on the like east

1938
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:41,440
coast and all these new markets just

1939
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:42,880
like the bags it's like you come out

1940
01:13:41,439 --> 01:13:45,119
come out and then now they're getting

1941
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:47,719
knocked off right yeah then now China's

1942
01:13:45,119 --> 01:13:49,840
blowing out you know 10 million of these

1943
01:13:47,719 --> 01:13:52,600
bags and now it's in every every store

1944
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:54,279
in Downtown LA right totally so it's

1945
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:56,600
like they're staying ahead of curan like

1946
01:13:54,279 --> 01:13:58,399
I said dude shout out to like the diecut

1947

guy like everyone has their own lane

1948
01:13:58,399 --> 01:14:03,439
right right like I just think that you

1949
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:06,719
know a lot of those lanes are going to

1950
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:08,479
be shortlived I think the best thing to

1951
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:09,639
do in this market right now is put out

1952

01:14:09,639 --> 01:14:14,359
flow and make sure that is the Focus

1954
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:16,440
right well if you're going to do diecut

1955
01:14:14,359 --> 01:14:19,359

1960
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:27,440
going to spend money on the flower or

this freaking bag yep you know and then

1965
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:38,639
then you get respect I think that that

1966
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:40,359
goes a long ways it's the guys who are

1967
01:14:38,639 --> 01:14:42,279
like I can just put mediocre flour in

1968
01:14:40,359 --> 01:14:45,639
this amazing looking bag and then try to

1969
01:14:42,279 --> 01:14:48,399
pass it off that and just making sure

1970
01:14:45,639 --> 01:14:51,319
like all like spend all the money on the

1971
01:14:48,399 --> 01:14:53,519
diecut bag have the strain for it right

1972
01:14:51,319 --> 01:14:56,439
and then keep that you see guys that are

1973
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:59,040

week it's that but same flower just

1975
01:14:59,039 --> 01:15:04,238
different bag right that that's what I

1976
01:15:02,279 --> 01:15:05,759
can't get behind right well I think

1977
01:15:04,238 --> 01:15:07,039
we've been talking about consistency

1978
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:09,079
right and it all comes down to

1979
01:15:07,039 --> 01:15:10,319
consistency and it's like yeah don't put

1980
01:15:09,079 --> 01:15:13,359
different flower in the bag make sure

1981
01:15:10,319 --> 01:15:14,799
your QA QC game is on point it's so

1982
01:15:13,359 --> 01:15:16,799
important across the board with

1983
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:19,279
everything that you do yeah yeah for

1984
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:21,679
sure for like the people that are going

1985
01:15:19,279 --> 01:15:25,158
to be around in 5 10 years they know

1986
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:26,480
that right and those are you know what

1987
01:15:25,158 --> 01:15:28,399
I'm striving to be right like we're

1988
01:15:26,479 --> 01:15:31,759
trying to play the long game so we try

1989
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:34,158
to QC everything make sure everything's

1990
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:36,600
as good or better than stuff that you I

1991
01:15:34,158 --> 01:15:38,079
would smoke right like like I'm not

1992
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:39,760
going to put anything in my jar that I

1993
01:15:38,079 --> 01:15:41,679
wouldn't personally smoke right or give

1994
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:44,199
to my friends and family to smoke like

1995
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:45,920
that we're proud of right totally so and

1996
01:15:44,198 --> 01:15:48,039
a lot of people a lot of brands are just

1997
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:50,399
like oh [ __ ] we're we have so much of it

1998
01:15:48,039 --> 01:15:52,198
just throw it all in a bags yeah and

1999
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:55,238
that's where they lose over over the

2000
01:15:52,198 --> 01:15:57,399
long run right well yeah they're just

2001
01:15:55,238 --> 01:16:00,039
that immediate money and I mean I think

2002
01:15:57,399 --> 01:16:02,198
yeah that's part of the problem in the

2003
01:16:00,039 --> 01:16:04,479
United States with the mentality is this

2004
01:16:02,198 --> 01:16:07,399
instant gratification I think a lot of

2005
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:09,319
it stems from the the internet and from

2006
01:16:07,399 --> 01:16:11,238
the accessibility of we have

2007
01:16:09,319 --> 01:16:12,719
accessibility to anything and everything

2008
01:16:11,238 --> 01:16:15,399
yeah for sure right whereas you look at

2009
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:17,920
the mindset over in some of these Asian

2010
01:16:15,399 --> 01:16:20,559
countries um where it's like gradual

2011
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:22,960
Improvement Kaizen you know it's like

2012
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:25,080
gradual Improvement every day every day

2013
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:26,480
sharp the sword every day yep we don't

2014
01:16:25,079 --> 01:16:28,319
even have TVs up right now in our house

2015
01:16:26,479 --> 01:16:29,799
we just moved six weeks ago we still

2016
01:16:28,319 --> 01:16:31,920
haven't put the TVs up which is actually

2017
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:34,079
a blessing I never would have thought

2018
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:36,319
yeah I took TV out of my room too I was

2019
01:16:34,079 --> 01:16:37,760
like yeah cuz that [ __ ] will keep you up

2020
01:16:36,319 --> 01:16:39,519
it'll keep you up because you'll just

2021
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:41,639
get locked into some show and then

2022
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:43,760
you're like wow [ __ ] it's 3 a.m. oh yeah

2023
01:16:41,639 --> 01:16:45,639
and you can now it's not like before

2024
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:47,199
where you had to watch it once a week

2025
01:16:45,639 --> 01:16:49,000
it's like you want to Mainline that show

2026
01:16:47,198 --> 01:16:51,000
and watch it back to back to back with

2027
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:53,039
all the episodes you can watch them all

2028
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:55,439
in a row you can spend 10 hours doing it

2029
01:16:53,039 --> 01:16:57,960
if you want to and you know so that goes

2030
01:16:55,439 --> 01:17:00,158
back to the instant gratification and I

2031
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:02,039
think we need to move slowly move away

2032
01:17:00,158 --> 01:17:04,519
from that as a society and recognize

2033
01:17:02,039 --> 01:17:06,039
that it's a problem and once we can I

2034
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:07,560
mean I think awareness is the biggest

2035
01:17:06,039 --> 01:17:10,359
thing with everything anyway once we can

2036
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:12,679
be aware of where the problems stem from

2037
01:17:10,359 --> 01:17:14,920
we can fix them but until then we're

2038
01:17:12,679 --> 01:17:16,639
going to have uh you know the latest

2039
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:18,158
greatest thing whether it's genetics

2040
01:17:16,639 --> 01:17:20,520
which I think eventually it's going to

2041
01:17:18,158 --> 01:17:23,238
stabilize where people are like I want

2042
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:25,600
11 coffins for forever from you guys or

2043
01:17:23,238 --> 01:17:27,319
I want coffin candy forever those are

2044
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:30,000
your staple your Flagship strains and

2045
01:17:27,319 --> 01:17:31,880
maybe you try other stuff but they'll

2046
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,399
have genetics from a company and those

2047
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:35,840
are their genetics that people are

2048
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:37,599
looking for and once we have interstate

2049
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:39,600
commerce they'll be able to go to any

2050
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:41,560
state in the United States hopefully and

2051
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:43,639
be able to pick up a jar of plant to 11

2052
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:45,360
coffins and it's going to be the same as

2053
01:17:43,639 --> 01:17:47,239
if they went to another state I mean

2054
01:17:45,359 --> 01:17:49,719
exactly I get excited about that part of

2055
01:17:47,238 --> 01:17:52,479
the industry that that is one thing that

2056
01:17:49,719 --> 01:17:54,560
I hope and look forward to right and

2057
01:17:52,479 --> 01:17:56,198
it's like with interstate commerce you

2058
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:58,600
know we're talking about Federal

2059
01:17:56,198 --> 01:17:59,799
legalization and it's like is that going

2060
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:01,159
to be good or bad if we look at the

2061
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:02,880
government and what they've done or at

2062
01:18:01,158 --> 01:18:05,879
least our state governments with

2063
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:08,600
cannabis and Taxation taxation they've

2064
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:11,800
kind of dropped the ball right yeah but

2065
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:14,120
you know we have to assume it's probably

2066
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:16,920
you know CH things don't change they

2067
01:18:14,119 --> 01:18:19,439
just uh evolve right right so I'm sure

2068
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:21,600
it's probably the same same blueprint

2069
01:18:19,439 --> 01:18:24,799
that happened with alcohol prohibition

2070
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:26,920
right yeah they bring it it and then as

2071
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:28,600
as it becomes more normalized hopefully

2072
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:31,679
the taxation becomes less and less and

2073
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:35,120
we get taxed like a normal business or

2074
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:37,560
normal uh commodity right but until then

2075
01:18:35,119 --> 01:18:39,599
like I'm not too hopeful that when they

2076
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:42,280
do the first roll out when that happens

2077
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:44,320
or if that happens do it right I could

2078
01:18:42,279 --> 01:18:45,399
probably say they're not going to no and

2079
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:47,399
there's going to be problems and these

2080
01:18:45,399 --> 01:18:49,319
are growing pains that every industry

2081
01:18:47,399 --> 01:18:50,879
goes through in the beginning or almost

2082
01:18:49,319 --> 01:18:52,039
every industry goes through yeah

2083
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:54,560
especially when you're involving

2084
01:18:52,039 --> 01:18:56,238
something that can be taxed so heavily

2085
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:58,920
uh and the government they want their

2086
01:18:56,238 --> 01:19:00,718
tax you Uncle Sam's your silent partner

2087
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:03,039
and they want every every step of the

2088
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:05,239
way they want to tax it in California

2089
01:19:03,039 --> 01:19:06,600
and I I can't wait for the day when they

2090
01:19:05,238 --> 01:19:08,599
I mean I think there's politicians

2091
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:10,560
involved that are invested in cannabis

2092
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:12,480
companies but once they recognize that

2093
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:14,440
okay these guys have to make money but

2094
01:19:12,479 --> 01:19:15,599
there's a huge consolidation phase

2095
01:19:14,439 --> 01:19:17,119
that's going on right now where

2096
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:19,320
companies are going out of business

2097
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:21,158
companies are getting absorbed yep so

2098
01:19:19,319 --> 01:19:23,359
Colorado already went through their

2099
01:19:21,158 --> 01:19:25,839
consolidation you know there's I think

2100
01:19:23,359 --> 01:19:28,119
three or four companies that own own 90%

2101
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:29,719
of the Colorado Market yeah you know and

2102
01:19:28,119 --> 01:19:33,399
California is much different than that

2103
01:19:29,719 --> 01:19:35,920
but we're slowly but surely going that

2104
01:19:33,399 --> 01:19:38,158
it's going that way like I've seen you

2105
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:40,880
know currently right now we're building

2106
01:19:38,158 --> 01:19:44,759
uh planta headquarters in uh Orange

2107
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:48,239
County nice so it would be grow drro

2108
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:52,159
sales offices um you know just our our

2109
01:19:48,238 --> 01:19:56,439
HQ right and before that I was looking

2110
01:19:52,158 --> 01:19:59,439
to buy a grow right in LA um and there's

2111
01:19:56,439 --> 01:20:00,879
new grows on the market every single day

2112
01:19:59,439 --> 01:20:02,559
just going out of business going out of

2113
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:05,000
business and they're just getting eaten

2114
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:07,400
up right like Pennies on the dollar

2115
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:09,079
pennies pennies on the dollar it's

2116
01:20:07,399 --> 01:20:11,759
pretty sick in a lot of cases where I

2117
01:20:09,079 --> 01:20:13,439
feel so bad for the person that invested

2118
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:16,560
that time and energy and that amount of

2119
01:20:13,439 --> 01:20:18,319
money exactly and probably even more to

2120
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:19,920
fail even more than the money is your

2121
01:20:18,319 --> 01:20:23,399
time because you can't ever get that

2122
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:25,760
back time and just like I don't know

2123
01:20:23,399 --> 01:20:28,759
like the feeling of failure like doing

2124
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:31,039
all of that and then having you know

2125
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:34,079
things out of your control for the main

2126
01:20:31,039 --> 01:20:36,600
part right like you know a lot of the

2127
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:40,158
like unless you're growing top top tier

2128
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:42,520
weed and doing it very efficiently yeah

2129
01:20:40,158 --> 01:20:45,079
um you're not going to survive right

2130
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:47,199
because of these taxes right would have

2131
01:20:45,079 --> 01:20:48,719
would these grows that went under have

2132
01:20:47,198 --> 01:20:52,238
survived if we were taxed like a normal

2133
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:54,079
commodity I'd say yes right so it's like

2134
01:20:52,238 --> 01:20:56,198
yes they definitely could have been on

2135
01:20:54,079 --> 01:20:57,719
their game more right but people thought

2136
01:20:56,198 --> 01:21:00,158
it was the green Rush right they just

2137
01:20:57,719 --> 01:21:03,239
think oh we do this I'm going to hire a

2138
01:21:00,158 --> 01:21:04,559
master grower you red flag bro you ever

2139
01:21:03,238 --> 01:21:06,439
hear someone call themselves a master

2140
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:08,000
grower it's the biggest red flag out

2141
01:21:06,439 --> 01:21:09,879
there oh my [ __ ] like if it's on your

2142
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:12,359
res yeah it's on your resume is Master

2143
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:16,199
grower I mean that's just that's a huge

2144
01:21:12,359 --> 01:21:17,920
red flag no 100% but yeah it's uh it's a

2145
01:21:16,198 --> 01:21:19,960
sad State of Affairs right now in like

2146
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:24,760
the Cannabis industry for cultivators

2147
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:28,158
and you know the only thing we can do is

2148
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:30,440
really try to put out top tier flower

2149
01:21:28,158 --> 01:21:35,119
and hold your ground right like know

2150
01:21:30,439 --> 01:21:36,839
your worth and put out good weed and

2151
01:21:35,119 --> 01:21:38,679
that's how you'll survive well and I

2152
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:39,920
think the other thing is a lot of people

2153
01:21:38,679 --> 01:21:42,639
forget the biggest part is the

2154
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:44,840
distribution chain if you want to go

2155
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:46,800
with a thousand lights and you've never

2156
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:48,880
grown before and you have no

2157
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:50,279
distribution chain you're going to

2158
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:52,840
you're going to burn through your money

2159
01:21:50,279 --> 01:21:54,198
so quick distribution is one of the most

2160
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:55,159
important components of having a

2161
01:21:54,198 --> 01:21:56,759
business

2162
01:21:55,158 --> 01:21:58,279
where do you get your product out to

2163
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:59,520
yeah where where are the end consumers

2164
01:21:58,279 --> 01:22:01,880
buying your product are you going to do

2165
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:03,040
a website you know what I mean and like

2166
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:04,480
try how are you going to Market

2167
01:22:03,039 --> 01:22:07,319
yourselves but also just that

2168
01:22:04,479 --> 01:22:10,638
distribution network is so huge yeah for

2169
01:22:07,319 --> 01:22:12,519
sure and like even as a cultivator but

2170
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:14,199
also like on like my Consulting side

2171
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:15,760

2172
01:22:14,198 --> 01:22:17,079

2173
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:18,280
this trying to do that and I'm like all

2174
01:22:17,079 --> 01:22:21,158
right that's like one of the main things

2175
01:22:18,279 --> 01:22:22,599
I look at right okay am I going to be

2176

going to be able to sell all this

2178
01:22:23,639 --> 01:22:29,560
product right cuz I could grow the bet

2179
01:22:25,279 --> 01:22:31,840
you know buyer and you know High grams

2180
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:33,440

2184
01:22:37,319 --> 01:22:41,479
said a lot of people lack that right

2185
01:22:39,039 --> 01:22:42,920
because of that green Rush era where

2186
01:22:41,479 --> 01:22:44,839
people thought oh we're just going to

2187
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:46,639
invest in cannabis you get all these

2188
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:48,360
suits coming in I'm going have 10,000

2189
01:22:46,639 --> 01:22:49,840
lights I'm going to have this that and

2190
01:22:48,359 --> 01:22:51,519
it's like where what you you don't even

2191
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:53,679
know anyone in the industry how are you

2192
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:55,120
going to sell it right well at a certain

2193
01:22:53,679 --> 01:22:56,800
point

2194
01:22:55,119 --> 01:22:59,319
it doesn't matter how good the product

2195
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:01,279
is if it's Lemon Cherry gelato and you

2196
01:22:59,319 --> 01:23:03,119
you're you have a thousand lighter and

2197
01:23:01,279 --> 01:23:06,519
every three months you're pushing out

2198
01:23:03,119 --> 01:23:09,198
2,000 pounds of it yep you're going to

2199
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:10,840
struggle oh 100% it doesn't even if it's

2200
01:23:09,198 --> 01:23:13,439
the best Lemon Cherry gelato in the

2201
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:16,159
world developing those relationships

2202
01:23:13,439 --> 01:23:19,638
takes a long time yep U I have that

2203
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:21,839
trust but verify saying that I I live by

2204
01:23:19,639 --> 01:23:24,960
and it's like people always tell you

2205
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:27,039
whatever you know but then it's like

2206
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:29,079
it's easy to go around and you know

2207
01:23:27,039 --> 01:23:31,319
another thing with the industry it's

2208
01:23:29,079 --> 01:23:34,119
like Growers for instance if you're

2209
01:23:31,319 --> 01:23:35,599
hiring a grower yeah right it's easy to

2210
01:23:34,119 --> 01:23:38,960
find out who they work for it's such a

2211
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:41,480
small community oh for sure for sure and

2212
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:42,880
it's yeah it's very small community and

2213
01:23:41,479 --> 01:23:44,000
the people especially I think you

2214
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:46,039
touched on this earlier like the people

2215
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,800
that are doing it right it's very small

2216
01:23:46,039 --> 01:23:50,238
like even if I don't personally know

2217
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:52,639

2242
01:24:42,079 --> 01:24:46,639
subjective a lot of people don't know

yeah unfortunately but I mean it's

2248
01:24:57,399 --> 01:25:00,599
unfortunate it's fortunate you know

2249
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:02,119
there has to be to be able to get the

2250
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:03,320
top dollar if everybody grew just as

2251
01:25:02,118 --> 01:25:06,679
good as you did you wouldn't be able to

2252
01:25:03,319 --> 01:25:10,158
Fitch the price that you get exactly and

2253
01:25:06,679 --> 01:25:11,880
also in this market like every there's a

2254
01:25:10,158 --> 01:25:13,920
there's a place for every grade of

2255
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:16,239
cannabis on the shelf right not everyone

2256
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:18,880
is trying to buy a $100 eth right right

2257
01:25:16,238 --> 01:25:23,279
not everybody can afford to right

2258
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:25,118
and some people want to or are just okay

2259
01:25:23,279 --> 01:25:28,439
with all they want want is to get high

2260
01:25:25,118 --> 01:25:30,238
right so they want that $100 ounce $50

2261
01:25:28,439 --> 01:25:33,439
and then but those people will also

2262
01:25:30,238 --> 01:25:36,638
every once in a while want to buy a $60

2263
01:25:33,439 --> 01:25:38,719
yep yep exactly but like you said they

2264
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:40,118
want the hunt dude I heard like a lot of

2265
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:42,520
the retailers I talk to you they'll be

2266
01:25:40,118 --> 01:25:43,759
like oh dude this is I'm like does this

2267
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:45,000
stuff even sound like dude people sell

2268
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:48,039
like ounces of shake they're like that's

2269
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:50,520
our number one seller yeah what or the

2270
01:25:48,039 --> 01:25:53,679
dollar or $2 joints and it blows my mind

2271
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:55,159
that y that those are so popular yeah

2272
01:25:53,679 --> 01:25:57,000
but some people don't have a palette

2273
01:25:55,158 --> 01:25:59,319
they just don't care I feel like yeah

2274
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:00,800
it's it's a budget thing and then also

2275
01:25:59,319 --> 01:26:02,880
most people don't have a developed

2276
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:04,320
palette or even know what good weed is

2277
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:05,239
right so like they're okay with just

2278
01:26:04,319 --> 01:26:06,840
smoking that because that's what they're

2279
01:26:05,238 --> 01:26:09,238
used to right well that's why Budweiser

2280
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:10,920
does so good it's the same thing exactly

2281
01:26:09,238 --> 01:26:13,359
consistency consistency it's

2282
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:15,279
consistently shitty and people are okay

2283
01:26:13,359 --> 01:26:18,279
because the price point is so good yeah

2284
01:26:15,279 --> 01:26:20,679
exactly exactly so if you had one piece

2285
01:26:18,279 --> 01:26:23,399
of advice for your younger self what

2286
01:26:20,679 --> 01:26:26,239
would that one piece be go harder take

2287
01:26:23,399 --> 01:26:29,638
more risks early on you know I'm older

2288
01:26:26,238 --> 01:26:32,479
now I you know have family all these

2289
01:26:29,639 --> 01:26:34,118
things uh it's like it's harder to take

2290
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:35,479
risks now right everything has to be

2291
01:26:34,118 --> 01:26:38,559
calculated I'm not just thinking for

2292
01:26:35,479 --> 01:26:40,718
myself right so my thing would just be

2293
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:43,520
double down on your strengths right go

2294
01:26:40,719 --> 01:26:46,760
harder take more risks without risk

2295
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:49,600
there's no reward right so it's like do

2296
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:51,440
that while you're young you know because

2297
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:53,800
you can start over at any age in life

2298
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:56,399
you know a lot of people didn't really

2299
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:59,119
get going until their mid-30s and then

2300
01:26:56,399 --> 01:27:00,479
you know or mid 40s mid 40s like you

2301
01:26:59,118 --> 01:27:02,198
hear the stories all the time and it's

2302
01:27:00,479 --> 01:27:04,559
okay to fail right that's the other

2303
01:27:02,198 --> 01:27:07,000
thing like it's okay to fail uh but

2304
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:09,760
fortune favors the brave right so like

2305
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:12,399
sure when I so when I used to do really

2306
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:13,800
dumb [ __ ] or you know do stuff that I

2307
01:27:12,399 --> 01:27:15,638
probably wouldn't do or even want to

2308
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:17,039
talk about on this show some crazy stuff

2309
01:27:15,639 --> 01:27:18,960
I would always say that fortune favors

2310
01:27:17,039 --> 01:27:21,399
the brave you got to take risks no you

2311
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:23,719
do you know even even when it was stuff

2312
01:27:21,399 --> 01:27:26,198
that I was scared of just in life these

2313
01:27:23,719 --> 01:27:28,439
people go down in history and like make

2314
01:27:26,198 --> 01:27:30,399
huge names of like look probate like the

2315
01:27:28,439 --> 01:27:32,759
kennedies they made all their money from

2316
01:27:30,399 --> 01:27:36,079
bootlegging right from doing illegal

2317
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:38,320
things right um so you know take risks

2318
01:27:36,079 --> 01:27:39,840
calculated risks calculated risks yeah

2319
01:27:38,319 --> 01:27:44,479
don't don't be stupid don't be afraid to

2320
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:48,480
fail cuz like dude failure has taught me

2321
01:27:44,479 --> 01:27:50,559
more about life than anything right you

2322
01:27:48,479 --> 01:27:54,439
know it's like when you win it's

2323
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:56,440
shortlived you know when you fail that

2324
01:27:54,439 --> 01:27:57,799
sits with you and sits with you and then

2325
01:27:56,439 --> 01:28:00,039
you dwell on it and you're like all

2326
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:03,279
right how do I not do that again right

2327
01:28:00,039 --> 01:28:06,560
yeah so you really get good lessons from

2328
01:28:03,279 --> 01:28:08,118
that and compared to you know you get a

2329
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:11,119
you get a win and you start stacking

2330
01:28:08,118 --> 01:28:13,960
wins right like a lot of people reflect

2331
01:28:11,118 --> 01:28:15,799
on their life when they're losing and

2332
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:17,319
not when they're winning right when

2333
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:21,119
they're winning they're riding that wave

2334
01:28:17,319 --> 01:28:22,880
they're high right so it it's also good

2335
01:28:21,118 --> 01:28:24,439
to like reflect on that stuff too

2336
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:27,480
reflect on your wins and like okay how

2337
01:28:24,439 --> 01:28:30,519
am I riding this wave right it's but you

2338
01:28:27,479 --> 01:28:33,158
know like I said just try to keep uh

2339
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:35,400
calculated risks and you know don't be

2340
01:28:33,158 --> 01:28:38,079
afraid to fail and when it times are

2341
01:28:35,399 --> 01:28:40,479
good reflect on that time too and see

2342
01:28:38,079 --> 01:28:42,279
you know look at how you're why you're

2343
01:28:40,479 --> 01:28:43,718
winning right you're treating everyone

2344
01:28:42,279 --> 01:28:45,359
good you're getting good karma you're

2345
01:28:43,719 --> 01:28:47,840
doing these things you're doing all the

2346
01:28:45,359 --> 01:28:49,279
right things when no one's looking right

2347
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:51,319
because karma believes whether you

2348
01:28:49,279 --> 01:28:53,800
believe in karma or not oh firm believe

2349
01:28:51,319 --> 01:28:56,479
you it's one of those things it's like

2350
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:58,440
uh Karma's there yeah you know it goes

2351
01:28:56,479 --> 01:29:00,279
both ways good and bad when you do good

2352
01:28:58,439 --> 01:29:02,158
stuff when you do bad stuff yep

2353
01:29:00,279 --> 01:29:04,439
everything comes full circle yeah for

2354
01:29:02,158 --> 01:29:07,638
sure comes full circle I'm a firm

2355
01:29:04,439 --> 01:29:09,678
believer in karma like always always try

2356
01:29:07,639 --> 01:29:11,279
to do the things right the first time

2357
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:12,960
and even when no one's around right

2358
01:29:11,279 --> 01:29:15,439
that's when it really matters right

2359
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:19,079
absolutely you know do doing everything

2360
01:29:15,439 --> 01:29:20,678
with uh Integrity is uh a big thing for

2361
01:29:19,079 --> 01:29:24,519
me and I feel like that has helped my

2362
01:29:20,679 --> 01:29:28,399
success a lot right Integrity is so huge

2363
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:30,840
and I think long term integrity and work

2364
01:29:28,399 --> 01:29:33,000
ethic goes just such a long ways yeah

2365
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:34,719
for sure Integrity work at think

2366
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,719
discipline right all comes down to

2367
01:29:34,719 --> 01:29:39,319
discipline right it's like if you want

2368
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:41,399
to lose weight you got to be disciplined

2369
01:29:39,319 --> 01:29:43,479
like it doesn't just fall off it doesn't

2370
01:29:41,399 --> 01:29:45,198
and it's it's not immediate it's not

2371
01:29:43,479 --> 01:29:46,519
instant the instant gratification at a

2372
01:29:45,198 --> 01:29:48,399
certain point like you might when you're

2373
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:50,440
young it comes off real quick but as you

2374
01:29:48,399 --> 01:29:53,158
get older you know it's like you got to

2375
01:29:50,439 --> 01:29:54,759
be disciplined and even when you don't

2376
01:29:53,158 --> 01:29:56,559
want to go to the gym those are the days

2377
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:58,119
you need to go to the gym the most yep

2378
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:59,639
you know when you don't want to do the

2379
01:29:58,118 --> 01:30:01,158
things that's when you should force

2380
01:29:59,639 --> 01:30:04,880
yourself to do them more than any other

2381
01:30:01,158 --> 01:30:08,079

Delivery Direct Delivery that's the way

2423
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:53,199
to go these days and I feel like

2424
01:31:50,359 --> 01:31:54,639
especially getting fresh product exactly

2425
01:31:53,198 --> 01:31:55,839
you know and that that's what excites me

2426
01:31:54,639 --> 01:31:58,159
about the future of the industry is

2427
01:31:55,840 --> 01:32:01,560
fresh product because I think that's

2428
01:31:58,158 --> 01:32:03,319
where we lack the most yep because it

2429
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:05,639
doesn't matter how you grow it if it

2430
01:32:03,319 --> 01:32:08,599
sits on the shelf for six months and

2431
01:32:05,639 --> 01:32:10,760
somebody buys it this happened with a an

2432
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:13,679
eth of backpack boys that was actually I

2433
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:15,079
paid $75 or whatever and it had been on

2434
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:17,039
the shelf for way too long didn't

2435
01:32:15,079 --> 01:32:19,039
realize it got home and I've got other

2436
01:32:17,039 --> 01:32:20,519
ones that were just amazing yeah I still

2437
01:32:19,039 --> 01:32:22,039
I still like buying Rec weed just to see

2438
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:24,360
what's going on with stuff what's going

2439
01:32:22,039 --> 01:32:26,158
on with these Brands you know Flor it's

2440
01:32:24,359 --> 01:32:29,118
like I I'm good friends with them I get

2441
01:32:26,158 --> 01:32:31,000
flower from Chris sometimes I you know

2442
01:32:29,118 --> 01:32:33,359
but like I do like going to the

2443
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:35,600
dispensary to actually pick it up see

2444
01:32:33,359 --> 01:32:38,359
what see what it's like and freshness is

2445
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:40,440
so key we just did a store takeover on

2446
01:32:38,359 --> 01:32:42,439
cookies Melrose this past weekend nice

2447
01:32:40,439 --> 01:32:44,238
but like I'm always buying competitor

2448
01:32:42,439 --> 01:32:47,719
flower right like I want to see what

2449
01:32:44,238 --> 01:32:49,479
they have right so yeah I feel like it's

2450
01:32:47,719 --> 01:32:51,800
very important to keep your finger on

2451
01:32:49,479 --> 01:32:54,479
the pulse as a brand owner as a

2452
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:57,039
cultivator all these things and you know

2453
01:32:54,479 --> 01:32:58,919
I can go to any of these my buddies that

2454
01:32:57,039 --> 01:33:01,359
own Brands and like they're always

2455
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:03,000
they're always giving me flower yeah but

2456
01:33:01,359 --> 01:33:05,719
seeing it in the store seeing what that

2457
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:07,319
final product is is always going to be

2458
01:33:05,719 --> 01:33:08,920
different than what your buddy who owns

2459
01:33:07,319 --> 01:33:10,359
a brand gives to you right yeah well

2460
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:11,960
you're getting the fresh of the fresh if

2461
01:33:10,359 --> 01:33:13,799
you're get for like my friends are

2462
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:16,840
always give me the freshest to the fresh

2463
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:19,639

2467
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:27,479
weeks it's going to be even

2468
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:29,760
better 100% but also seeing what's on

2469
01:33:27,479 --> 01:33:32,158
the market and seeing what how how stuff

2470

2478
01:33:43,158 --> 01:33:47,118
dabs anymore yeah even though I do like

2479
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:49,320

2484
01:33:56,920 --> 01:34:01,000
and I don't have time to heat that rig

2485
01:33:58,479 --> 01:34:03,079
up yeah for sure it's it's a process I

2486
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:05,920
mean dude you see these K like it's a

2487
01:34:03,079 --> 01:34:09,198
full kit you know you got your rig you

2488
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:11,639
got your torch you got your [ __ ] temp

2489
01:34:09,198 --> 01:34:14,719
regulator and that's what the like the

2490
01:34:11,639 --> 01:34:17,480
the puff Co and the ays and the focus

2491
01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:19,439

2492
01:34:17,479 --> 01:34:21,559
different you know all the different Dr

2493
01:34:19,439 --> 01:34:23,919
Dabber but I love that where you have

2494
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:26,199
the control of the temp they're digital

2495
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:29,039
they're consistent yeah it gives you a

2496
01:34:26,198 --> 01:34:31,118
consistent hit it's amazing to see where

2497
01:34:29,039 --> 01:34:32,880
that industry is going right like it's

2498
01:34:31,118 --> 01:34:35,079
mindblowing how they got here oh for

2499
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:37,118
sure like I feel like from curling irons

2500
01:34:35,079 --> 01:34:39,238
yeah yeah no like and seeing the

2501
01:34:37,118 --> 01:34:42,639
Innovation on that end is sick too

2502
01:34:39,238 --> 01:34:45,000
because like you look at just the rigs

2503
01:34:42,639 --> 01:34:46,840
that have come out and like they're

2504
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:49,439
getting more consistent to almost like a

2505
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:52,199
real dab like from a rig right so I feel

2506
01:34:49,439 --> 01:34:55,439
like that's what everyone struggled with

2507
01:34:52,198 --> 01:34:58,279
in the past now like the technology is

2508
01:34:55,439 --> 01:34:59,879
catching up right yeah I have a ays

2509
01:34:58,279 --> 01:35:01,319
somewhere over there but yeah that's

2510
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:04,118
that's my new favorite product CU it's

2511
01:35:01,319 --> 01:35:05,840
like not a pen it's like it's not a rig

2512
01:35:04,118 --> 01:35:08,719
it's not a pen it's somewhere in between

2513
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:11,400
and it gives me a great hit temperature

2514
01:35:08,719 --> 01:35:13,399
controlled and it's consistent and it's

2515
01:35:11,399 --> 01:35:16,279
not a pen it's not a pen hit it's like a

2516
01:35:13,399 --> 01:35:17,719
dab hit from a rig y but it's digital

2517
01:35:16,279 --> 01:35:20,439
controll its pocket size so I can put it

2518
01:35:17,719 --> 01:35:22,239
in my pocket I can throw some rosin in

2519
01:35:20,439 --> 01:35:24,719
there and I can go to a music festival

2520
01:35:22,238 --> 01:35:26,039
or a concert and

2521
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:29,000
you know cuz not you can't have joints

2522
01:35:26,039 --> 01:35:30,840
at every place yeah yeah no for sure if

2523
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:32,760
if I could I would but it's not always

2524
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:35,679

2538
01:36:04,679 --> 01:36:08,719
day y exactly you know and then they

2539
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:11,279
even before that they were like these

2540
01:36:08,719 --> 01:36:14,760
Monster Rigs that you had to have huge

2541
01:36:11,279 --> 01:36:16,759
cases for y and then they hadt yeah we

2542
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:20,320
were smoking on titanium for a while and

2543
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:23,360
Nails glowing hot glowing hot hot dab

2544
01:36:20,319 --> 01:36:25,238
hot that's that's the my least favorite

2545
01:36:23,359 --> 01:36:27,439
thing I really only stick to flour now

2546
01:36:25,238 --> 01:36:32,079
because I was scarred from those like

2547
01:36:27,439 --> 01:36:33,960
like 2015 just red hot the hotter the

2548
01:36:32,079 --> 01:36:35,920
better the guys are putting snakes on

2549
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:38,319
Instagram they're dropping these one G

2550
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:40,279
snakes in you know yeah people like why

2551
01:36:38,319 --> 01:36:42,319
why do people pass out from doing dabs

2552
01:36:40,279 --> 01:36:45,559
I'm like yeah bro they were doing a 900

2553
01:36:42,319 --> 01:36:48,198
degree dab and [ __ ] suffocated thems

2554
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:50,440
with it hot smoke in their throat and

2555
01:36:48,198 --> 01:36:52,879
passed out and went into convulsions yep

2556
01:36:50,439 --> 01:36:55,599
y yep I've SE seen many of that that

2557
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:57,800
happened at many OB sess sessions back

2558
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:59,520
in the day totally yeah I mean I've seen

2559
01:36:57,800 --> 01:37:01,920
people pass out and I've seen people not

2560
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:03,360
be able to talk ated Rosenthal I saw I

2561
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:05,679
dabbed him out one time and he couldn't

2562
01:37:03,359 --> 01:37:08,679
talk he went coma toast on me really

2563
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:10,399
yeah was it BHO or what was it it was B

2564
01:37:08,679 --> 01:37:12,279
it was we were making uh we were

2565
01:37:10,399 --> 01:37:14,960
whipping butter back in the day so it

2566
01:37:12,279 --> 01:37:18,359
was like a wax or a butter yeah yeah you

2567
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:20,600
know but in a Pyrex dish with BHO open

2568
01:37:18,359 --> 01:37:22,799
blasting whip it with a double burner

2569
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:24,719
and I thought that was so bad you know

2570
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:26,159
I'm like well using PVC so I'm like

2571
01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:28,920
there's no way this is healthy this is

2572
01:37:26,158 --> 01:37:31,759
gross yeah yeah my buddy came back a few

2573
01:37:28,920 --> 01:37:33,199
years ago with a COA and he's like I

2574
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:36,480
told you it wasn't bad there's no

2575
01:37:33,198 --> 01:37:39,359
residual butane zero zero yeah zero and

2576
01:37:36,479 --> 01:37:42,000
I was like Jesus I guess that's cool PVC

2577
01:37:39,359 --> 01:37:44,519
you know like yeah yeah still not good

2578
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:47,079
still not good but you know we we went

2579
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:49,080
through learning and growing pains and

2580
01:37:47,079 --> 01:37:51,760
uh to get us where we are today yeah

2581
01:37:49,079 --> 01:37:53,920
100% And like without people open

2582
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:56,119
blasting and doing all that sketchy [ __ ]

2583
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:57,599
getting blown up getting blown up I have

2584
01:37:56,118 --> 01:37:59,759
some friends that have gotten blown up

2585
01:37:57,599 --> 01:38:01,239
and have you know they're scarred for

2586
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:02,719
for Life yeah for sure but without that

2587
01:38:01,238 --> 01:38:04,839
like the holy water crew big shout out

2588
01:38:02,719 --> 01:38:07,079
to Holy Water dude those guys really CH

2589
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:09,840
those for sure Chang the game with the

2590
01:38:07,079 --> 01:38:12,079
turp sauce you know making real sauce

2591
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:14,599
yeah yeah for sure and now it's like

2592
01:38:12,079 --> 01:38:16,559
everybody knows you know the extracts

2593
01:38:14,599 --> 01:38:20,760
and the sauces but like they made stuff

2594
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:22,280
that was 30% tpin yeah exactly and it

2595
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:25,639
tasted mind-blowing too when I first hit

2596
01:38:22,279 --> 01:38:26,920
it I was like I knew from the first hit

2597
01:38:25,639 --> 01:38:28,760
that they had figured out something that

2598
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:29,920
was going to revolutionize extraction

2599
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:32,159
yeah I know those guys are the man we

2600
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:33,480
actually did a collab with them nice for

2601
01:38:32,158 --> 01:38:35,079
uh some of their pre-rolls so we

2602
01:38:33,479 --> 01:38:37,559
supplied the flower they supplied the

2603
01:38:35,079 --> 01:38:39,399
hash yeah it was pretty dope yeah those

2604
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:41,080
guys killed it killed it yeah they well

2605
01:38:39,399 --> 01:38:42,879
killing it yeah I me yeah killing it

2606
01:38:41,079 --> 01:38:44,279
killing it killing it yeah and it's like

2607
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:46,079
they well they changed the game

2608
01:38:44,279 --> 01:38:49,238
completely and I love that Innovation

2609
01:38:46,079 --> 01:38:50,760
yeah yeah 100% I mean without Innovation

2610
01:38:49,238 --> 01:38:53,638
you know we're we're going to be

2611
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:57,079
stagnant right so it's like whether it

2612
01:38:53,639 --> 01:38:59,679
be from open blasting BHO to you know

2613
01:38:57,079 --> 01:39:02,198
new tech with raos in or everything it's

2614
01:38:59,679 --> 01:39:06,000
just like watching how the game evolves

2615
01:39:02,198 --> 01:39:08,879
is always always you know good for good

2616
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:12,439
for the community right yeah and it's I

2617
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:15,118
mean for me it's motivating to try to

2618
01:39:12,439 --> 01:39:16,559
keep my hand on the pulse and and to try

2619
01:39:15,118 --> 01:39:17,960
to push it Forward whether it's with

2620
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:19,880
genetics like I have all these different

2621
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:21,639
angles because you know I'm not popping

2622
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:23,520
200 you're popping more seeds than I am

2623
01:39:21,639 --> 01:39:25,039
and I'm a breeder yeah yeah you know I

2624
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:26,639
mean that's more seeds than I'm popping

2625
01:39:25,039 --> 01:39:28,639
right now but I'm not breeding it right

2626
01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:30,719
so I have the easy job I just got to I

2627
01:39:28,639 --> 01:39:32,599
just got to grow it right yeah but still

2628
01:39:30,719 --> 01:39:34,239
200 seeds a month is wild most people

2629
01:39:32,599 --> 01:39:35,840
don't really understand like if you put

2630
01:39:34,238 --> 01:39:37,359
nine because I do nine plants per light

2631
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:38,960
so I can pick I could take a photo of

2632
01:39:37,359 --> 01:39:40,759
each plant right so we're we're able to

2633
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:42,118
take a photo I want to see I don't top

2634
01:39:40,760 --> 01:39:46,280
them I want to know what the structure

2635
01:39:42,118 --> 01:39:48,079
looks like but that's a lot of cost that

2636
01:39:46,279 --> 01:39:50,039
you don't see the return on for a

2637
01:39:48,079 --> 01:39:52,960
significant amount of time if you do see

2638
01:39:50,039 --> 01:39:55,000
the the return right like I've had many

2639
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:57,319
runs where there's not a single keeper

2640
01:39:55,000 --> 01:40:00,079
right we're very picky I mean I throw

2641
01:39:57,319 --> 01:40:02,118
away a lot of things that uh most people

2642
01:40:00,079 --> 01:40:03,439
would probably keep as their keeper

2643
01:40:02,118 --> 01:40:04,639
right I'll still hold on to some of

2644
01:40:03,439 --> 01:40:06,479
those things where everybody else is

2645
01:40:04,639 --> 01:40:08,599
like dude it doesn't yield and I'm like

2646
01:40:06,479 --> 01:40:11,799
well got the TPS I mean I don't really

2647
01:40:08,599 --> 01:40:13,079
ever look at yield for any like um

2648
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:15,719
that's like the lowest thing on the

2649
01:40:13,079 --> 01:40:19,359
check box right me too you know keep

2650
01:40:15,719 --> 01:40:20,800
some stuff but like that was an option

2651
01:40:19,359 --> 01:40:22,960
but now when you're running so many it's

2652
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:26,239
like there's limited space for storage

2653
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:28,639
right I've had Keepers that my

2654
01:40:26,238 --> 01:40:30,598
cultivation managers have lost right y

2655
01:40:28,639 --> 01:40:31,679
I've also seated out you know because

2656
01:40:30,599 --> 01:40:33,960
we'll run

2657
01:40:31,679 --> 01:40:35,520
them you know and this is like the [ __ ]

2658
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:37,960
that doesn't get talked about right

2659
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:39,960
everyone sees like the fire strains and

2660
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:43,039
like the winds right but no one sees the

2661
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:45,880
losses right yeah so it's like I pop

2662
01:40:43,039 --> 01:40:49,840
them grow them out take cuts off each

2663
01:40:45,880 --> 01:40:55,039
plant run them keep those cuts then

2664
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:57,560
select from you know 100 200 of whatever

2665
01:40:55,039 --> 01:41:00,920
however many we run of that coltivar we

2666
01:40:57,560 --> 01:41:02,800
select then uh I rerun them again right

2667
01:41:00,920 --> 01:41:05,118
so out of a 100 seeds we'll probably

2668
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:09,000
pick five right yeah Freddy will pick

2669
01:41:05,118 --> 01:41:11,839
five and then I'll rerun those five and

2670
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:13,520
then he'll select down and we'll do it

2671
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:15,719
until you know if we need to run it

2672
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:17,520
three times until he selects the one

2673
01:41:15,719 --> 01:41:19,118
when the genetics change from one run to

2674
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:21,599
the next and as you're dialing the

2675
01:41:19,118 --> 01:41:22,960
genetics in they can change that's why I

2676
01:41:21,599 --> 01:41:25,079
don't do the seed run I get rid of the

2677
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:26,760
seed I don't never I never grow from

2678
01:41:25,079 --> 01:41:28,559
seed if if I'm going to make clones of

2679
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:30,480
it and I plan on licensing or growing

2680
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:31,880
those clones out that seed start goes

2681
01:41:30,479 --> 01:41:33,319
away cuz what's the point of growing it

2682
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:34,118
out if you see something you'll never

2683
01:41:33,319 --> 01:41:36,319
get

2684
01:41:34,118 --> 01:41:38,039
again very true so you just save

2685
01:41:36,319 --> 01:41:40,039
yourself 100 days right it always

2686
01:41:38,039 --> 01:41:41,279
changes it does change a little bit a

2687
01:41:40,039 --> 01:41:42,639
little bit sometimes the ones I think

2688
01:41:41,279 --> 01:41:44,559
are the best the next time they're not

2689
01:41:42,639 --> 01:41:46,599
the best and other ones where I'm like

2690
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:48,360
no man there's no way that that's a good

2691
01:41:46,599 --> 01:41:50,800
one and then that's a good one so you

2692
01:41:48,359 --> 01:41:52,319
just get rid of that from seed yeah yeah

2693
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:53,520
and do the first clonal generation at

2694
01:41:52,319 --> 01:41:55,479
least starting there you're saving

2695
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:56,960
yourself a 100 days especially if you're

2696
01:41:55,479 --> 01:42:01,839
going to grow it from clone in the

2697
01:41:56,960 --> 01:42:05,158
future yeah yeah true so then once we so

2698
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:09,639
once we select it you know we rerun it

2699
01:42:05,158 --> 01:42:13,238
again and you know I've had where my

2700
01:42:09,639 --> 01:42:15,400
managers mislabeled it yeah then a maale

2701
01:42:13,238 --> 01:42:18,238
was in the room seated a whole 50 light

2702
01:42:15,399 --> 01:42:20,598
room right seated a whole 50 Lightroom

2703
01:42:18,238 --> 01:42:22,799
outch oh yeah recently you know like

2704
01:42:20,599 --> 01:42:24,319
within within like the last year like to

2705
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:26,800
most cultivations that's probably

2706
01:42:24,319 --> 01:42:27,920
detrimental right that might be death

2707
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:30,880
that might be it that might be we're

2708
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:32,239
shutting the doors exactly right still

2709
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:34,880
have those seeds though and I'm about to

2710
01:42:32,238 --> 01:42:36,759
make some [ __ ] heat someone's never

2711
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:40,039
going to live that down I guarantee for

2712
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:42,920
sure but yeah no uh that those are The

2713
01:42:40,039 --> 01:42:44,238
Growing Pains of like trying to you know

2714
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:46,279
which is crazy I see people like

2715
01:42:44,238 --> 01:42:49,238
chucking pollen in their facilities I'm

2716
01:42:46,279 --> 01:42:51,359
like I I can't do it like right when I

2717
01:42:49,238 --> 01:42:53,638
see well that's why you have a nursery a

2718
01:42:51,359 --> 01:42:55,198
breeding facility it makes sense yeah

2719
01:42:53,639 --> 01:42:56,760
exactly exactly or place where you're

2720
01:42:55,198 --> 01:42:58,439
pheno hunting if there was a little bit

2721
01:42:56,760 --> 01:43:01,159
of cross contamination it wouldn't

2722
01:42:58,439 --> 01:43:02,638
affect yeah that's that's what we have

2723
01:43:01,158 --> 01:43:04,079
going on here so it's like I'm not

2724
01:43:02,639 --> 01:43:06,800
producing any flour we don't produce

2725
01:43:04,079 --> 01:43:08,599
flour in the facility for sale uh and we

2726
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:11,880
try to minimize you know there is pollen

2727
01:43:08,599 --> 01:43:13,719
mitigation Sops so everything is done so

2728
01:43:11,880 --> 01:43:15,599
we're not contaminating if at all

2729
01:43:13,719 --> 01:43:17,239
possible yeah we have 10 separate

2730
01:43:15,599 --> 01:43:20,360
environments that we can create

2731
01:43:17,238 --> 01:43:22,118
reversals in we can leave males in yeah

2732
01:43:20,359 --> 01:43:23,880
that have you it's a beautiful facility

2733
01:43:22,118 --> 01:43:26,920
like you you have it

2734
01:43:23,880 --> 01:43:28,440
dialed in for breeding for sure yeah

2735
01:43:26,920 --> 01:43:31,399
yeah and that's the goal and I think it

2736
01:43:28,439 --> 01:43:33,559
just as I've gotten older I really like

2737
01:43:31,399 --> 01:43:35,960
looked at what am I focused on and what

2738
01:43:33,560 --> 01:43:37,880
do all the other things bring me so that

2739
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:39,439
they can take me back to my focus like

2740
01:43:37,880 --> 01:43:41,760
we got a breeding book I did my breeding

2741
01:43:39,439 --> 01:43:43,598
book and that's just a resume right yeah

2742
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:45,320
yeah and then it you know it also is

2743
01:43:43,599 --> 01:43:46,719
like okay all the stuff I've learned I

2744
01:43:45,319 --> 01:43:48,639
have it right there so if I forget it I

2745
01:43:46,719 --> 01:43:50,840
can go back in my book right but it's

2746
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:52,719
also taught me how to log data better Y

2747
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:54,639
and we we use software programs we have

2748
01:43:52,719 --> 01:43:57,158
an amazing software program where we can

2749
01:43:54,639 --> 01:44:00,159
take 50 different points over 50 points

2750
01:43:57,158 --> 01:44:02,000
per cultivar we measure node spacing we

2751
01:44:00,158 --> 01:44:04,479
measure wet and dry weight all that

2752
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:07,880
stuff nice hell yeah no that's amazing

2753
01:44:04,479 --> 01:44:10,359
like data is super important like we're

2754
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:12,239
especially in cultivation right like it

2755
01:44:10,359 --> 01:44:14,639
might get monotonous but like we take so

2756
01:44:12,238 --> 01:44:17,439
many data points every single day right

2757
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:20,599
so like people you know some Growers

2758
01:44:17,439 --> 01:44:22,319
take data to try like I've heard of guys

2759
01:44:20,599 --> 01:44:25,800
being like Oh I'm going to create an AI

2760
01:44:22,319 --> 01:44:27,719
system and oh I have this exact uh these

2761
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:29,360
data points so I know exactly how to

2762
01:44:27,719 --> 01:44:31,480
steer it like dude this is a living

2763
01:44:29,359 --> 01:44:33,319
thing yeah that will never [ __ ] work

2764
01:44:31,479 --> 01:44:35,000
right that will never work in my opinion

2765
01:44:33,319 --> 01:44:37,519
it won't this is a living thing every

2766
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:39,639
run even if it's you know biscotti I run

2767
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:41,880
the same room same everything 10 times

2768
01:44:39,639 --> 01:44:43,639
in a row like these clones are going to

2769
01:44:41,880 --> 01:44:45,880
come in with more vigorous Roots than

2770
01:44:43,639 --> 01:44:47,239
the last run and this and that so like

2771
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:49,920
everything needs to be steered

2772
01:44:47,238 --> 01:44:53,879
differently right but taking data points

2773
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:56,319
right so like if I know in like day 10

2774
01:44:53,880 --> 01:44:58,480
to 21 I should be growing 2 in

2775
01:44:56,319 --> 01:45:00,759
vertically a day 1.5 to 2 in vertically

2776
01:44:58,479 --> 01:45:03,118
a day yeah and I have my guys taking

2777
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:07,360
vertical measurements every day and at

2778
01:45:03,118 --> 01:45:10,359
day 13 we drop from 2 inches a day to

2779
01:45:07,359 --> 01:45:11,598
0.5 I know okay now we need to look top

2780
01:45:10,359 --> 01:45:14,319
down and start dissecting where the

2781
01:45:11,599 --> 01:45:15,719
problems at right where most people that

2782
01:45:14,319 --> 01:45:18,118
aren't doing that are going to get to

2783
01:45:15,719 --> 01:45:22,079
day 21 and they're miss their target

2784
01:45:18,118 --> 01:45:24,158
height by you know8 inches which is

2785
01:45:22,079 --> 01:45:25,559
detrimental yeah which it affects your

2786
01:45:24,158 --> 01:45:26,799
yield yeah it's going to affect yield

2787
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:28,840
it's going to affect a lot of things

2788
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:31,400
right and then yeah your bud size the

2789
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:34,000
yeah well then there's so like there's

2790
01:45:31,399 --> 01:45:35,638
there's ways to mitigate those issues

2791
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:39,479
yeah sure once you have them I mean

2792
01:45:35,639 --> 01:45:41,239
there's Plan B yeah but still there's

2793
01:45:39,479 --> 01:45:43,118
always plan B but if you can prevent it

2794
01:45:41,238 --> 01:45:46,319
it's the best way preventative is always

2795
01:45:43,118 --> 01:45:48,439
the best way whether it's IPM you know

2796
01:45:46,319 --> 01:45:49,920
you know it's properly looking at you

2797
01:45:48,439 --> 01:45:52,238
know it's like we have a closed facility

2798
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:55,079
but we still have plans you know we

2799
01:45:52,238 --> 01:45:57,598
still have M yeah know you have to right

2800
01:45:55,079 --> 01:45:59,039
people people look at IPM as like

2801
01:45:57,599 --> 01:46:00,880
they're fixing problems right like you

2802
01:45:59,039 --> 01:46:04,639
said everything needs to be preventative

2803
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:06,639
like we're doing IPM two to three a week

2804
01:46:04,639 --> 01:46:09,880
just maintenance no bugs right you know

2805
01:46:06,639 --> 01:46:13,719
sprays two two times a week and one

2806
01:46:09,880 --> 01:46:18,719
drench you know um up until day 21 yeah

2807
01:46:13,719 --> 01:46:20,639
uh that sop keeps even dude no bugs but

2808
01:46:18,719 --> 01:46:22,439
we're still spraying every week right

2809
01:46:20,639 --> 01:46:23,960
because you'll never have bugs if you do

2810
01:46:22,439 --> 01:46:26,519
it

2811
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:28,359
exactly and then you know if if you do

2812
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:31,119
get run into a problem then you have an

2813
01:46:28,359 --> 01:46:35,359
sop for that right but a lot of people

2814
01:46:31,118 --> 01:46:38,118
are just only using IPM or doing this uh

2815
01:46:35,359 --> 01:46:39,719
for to try to when they have a problem

2816
01:46:38,118 --> 01:46:42,359
you're already too late that's why we

2817
01:46:39,719 --> 01:46:45,079
take the data right like have a full

2818
01:46:42,359 --> 01:46:46,598
data sheet you know whether it be stock

2819
01:46:45,079 --> 01:46:49,840
measurement height measurement Bud

2820
01:46:46,599 --> 01:46:51,920
measurement every day you know EC water

2821
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:54,599
content but also you know through the

2822
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:56,840
room is you know is there any leaks like

2823
01:46:54,599 --> 01:46:58,960
is there anything right because these

2824
01:46:56,840 --> 01:47:00,679
facilities are out to get you nothing

2825
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:03,960
nothing is meant to run how we run these

2826
01:47:00,679 --> 01:47:07,039
facilities right like we're running AC

2827
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:10,239
oh dude AC's are just at Max Capacity

2828
01:47:07,039 --> 01:47:12,399
deuses are at Max Capacity running 247

2829
01:47:10,238 --> 01:47:14,839
right so it's like these facilities are

2830
01:47:12,399 --> 01:47:17,238
out to get you so having people who are

2831
01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:19,279
tuned in and making sure that they're

2832
01:47:17,238 --> 01:47:21,399
like consciously going through these

2833
01:47:19,279 --> 01:47:24,118
data points right yeah because you don't

2834
01:47:21,399 --> 01:47:26,039
want guys that just come in clock in to

2835
01:47:24,118 --> 01:47:27,839
just do their work and then check out

2836
01:47:26,039 --> 01:47:29,760
right get their check right you need

2837
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:32,159
people who are dedicated who have a

2838
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:34,599
vested interest in like growing fire

2839
01:47:32,158 --> 01:47:37,079
weed you know what I mean so that's why

2840
01:47:34,599 --> 01:47:39,960
I take the data right and to show them

2841
01:47:37,079 --> 01:47:42,198
on paper like you know when we switch

2842
01:47:39,960 --> 01:47:43,880
this irrigation strategy and this

2843
01:47:42,198 --> 01:47:46,039
environment strategy you see what it

2844
01:47:43,880 --> 01:47:48,279
does to the plant like instantly we can

2845
01:47:46,039 --> 01:47:50,319
I can make grow stop you know within the

2846
01:47:48,279 --> 01:47:53,279
first like 21 days yeah you know we can

2847
01:47:50,319 --> 01:47:55,519
control the height pretty pretty good so

2848
01:47:53,279 --> 01:47:56,719
that's why we have fixed lights you know

2849
01:47:55,520 --> 01:48:00,199
people like oh that's crazy why don't

2850
01:47:56,719 --> 01:48:01,960
you have the you know the up and down uh

2851
01:48:00,198 --> 01:48:03,678
it's like if you can steer plants really

2852
01:48:01,960 --> 01:48:05,279
well and you're on schedule and you're

2853
01:48:03,679 --> 01:48:07,199
making sure your plants are coming in at

2854
01:48:05,279 --> 01:48:09,840
your target height yeah you won't really

2855
01:48:07,198 --> 01:48:11,960
have those issues right it takes a very

2856
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:14,199
dialed facility though for sure yeah

2857
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:16,118
know it's yeah that that's how I feel

2858
01:48:14,198 --> 01:48:18,079
about the data and what it's good for

2859
01:48:16,118 --> 01:48:20,000
I'm doing trials with them right now on

2860
01:48:18,079 --> 01:48:23,359
seed production because I want to push

2861
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:25,760
over 50,000 seeds per 4x4 yeah feel like

2862
01:48:23,359 --> 01:48:27,759
under canopy Horizon we're doing both

2863
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:29,320
the under canopy with the favin we're

2864
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:31,639
going to do the Horizon Light Lift bring

2865
01:48:29,319 --> 01:48:34,359
the ppfd way up yeah yeah and then I'm

2866
01:48:31,639 --> 01:48:35,920
going to use both and see okay side by

2867
01:48:34,359 --> 01:48:38,319
side what kind of results are we getting

2868
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:39,800
are we pushing those boundaries because

2869
01:48:38,319 --> 01:48:41,479
that's what I that's the beauty of this

2870
01:48:39,800 --> 01:48:44,119
facility too we can R&amp;D everything we

2871
01:48:41,479 --> 01:48:45,959
can trial this a versus B and we can do

2872
01:48:44,118 --> 01:48:47,359
that a million times over to really

2873
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:48,960
Empower our customers at the end of the

2874
01:48:47,359 --> 01:48:50,799
day for getting better results with

2875
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:53,639
every piece of equipment there's a good

2876
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:56,719
practice for it right um

2877
01:48:53,639 --> 01:48:59,239
as far as like commercial and doing you

2878
01:48:56,719 --> 01:49:01,000
know seed production amazing right you

2879
01:48:59,238 --> 01:49:03,718
want to be able to can get the light

2880
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:05,520
control as much as possible right um

2881
01:49:03,719 --> 01:49:06,599
especially with seeds too because like

2882
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:09,080
you know it's not going to grow like a

2883
01:49:06,599 --> 01:49:11,239
clone right or no and then seed

2884
01:49:09,079 --> 01:49:12,800
production it's like most people have

2885
01:49:11,238 --> 01:49:14,678
white seeds on the bottom because

2886
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:17,360
there's not enough penetration okay and

2887
01:49:14,679 --> 01:49:19,239
so the the favin I think are going to be

2888
01:49:17,359 --> 01:49:21,880
a game changer we we don't know yet but

2889
01:49:19,238 --> 01:49:23,158
I'm going to my educated guess is that

2890
01:49:21,880 --> 01:49:25,279
we're going to get more seeds we're

2891
01:49:23,158 --> 01:49:27,960
going to get better quality seeds oh

2892
01:49:25,279 --> 01:49:29,479
yeah and so even in the seed game it's

2893
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:31,158
different than the flour but it's still

2894
01:49:29,479 --> 01:49:33,559
it's all about having the best quality

2895
01:49:31,158 --> 01:49:34,920
product and the better more even seeds

2896
01:49:33,560 --> 01:49:37,880
you have the more money you can get for

2897
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:39,920
your seeds uh the easier it is to sell

2898
01:49:37,880 --> 01:49:42,920
them it's just like good flow yeah for

2899
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:45,319
sure and like with increase like ppfd

2900
01:49:42,920 --> 01:49:48,440
lighting under canopy all that like it's

2901
01:49:45,319 --> 01:49:51,279
all very linear right like more light

2902
01:49:48,439 --> 01:49:53,919
has always equaled more weight right um

2903
01:49:51,279 --> 01:49:57,880
so I I would assume that transfers over

2904
01:49:53,920 --> 01:50:01,279
into uh seed seed production as well

2905
01:49:57,880 --> 01:50:02,639
totally yeah no uh we're doing have two

2906
01:50:01,279 --> 01:50:05,880
benches at the Oakland facility right

2907
01:50:02,639 --> 01:50:08,840
now that were triing some under canopies

2908
01:50:05,880 --> 01:50:12,760
um so we'll see how that goes I I think

2909
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:14,520
it could definitely be beneficial I mean

2910
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:16,039
I have yet to see the results like in

2911
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:18,320
person everyone says they're amazing

2912
01:50:16,039 --> 01:50:20,880
right but I'm a very show me person

2913
01:50:18,319 --> 01:50:23,158
right right we do a lot with a little

2914
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:25,400
right like really good irrigation

2915
01:50:23,158 --> 01:50:28,759
strategy and environment strategy and

2916
01:50:25,399 --> 01:50:31,638
you know proper defs and all that like

2917
01:50:28,760 --> 01:50:34,360
will produce a lot of weed high quality

2918
01:50:31,639 --> 01:50:36,199
weed well the like faven or under

2919
01:50:34,359 --> 01:50:37,279
canopies I think if you have the

2920
01:50:36,198 --> 01:50:39,799
electric not everybody has the

2921
01:50:37,279 --> 01:50:42,319
electricity for them if you have power I

2922
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:44,039
think they're a great investment um and

2923
01:50:42,319 --> 01:50:46,359
not just the yield because I you will

2924
01:50:44,039 --> 01:50:47,960
get better yield but also the color like

2925
01:50:46,359 --> 01:50:49,479
if you're running LEDs and you want more

2926
01:50:47,960 --> 01:50:51,359
color you're have more color on the

2927
01:50:49,479 --> 01:50:53,678
bottom than you on the top now exactly

2928
01:50:51,359 --> 01:50:55,198
and so I see it as a benefit even from

2929
01:50:53,679 --> 01:50:57,399
that it's like regardless of yield yield

2930
01:50:55,198 --> 01:50:59,799
is great but let's look for a better

2931
01:50:57,399 --> 01:51:01,759
product Quality quality yeah and that's

2932
01:50:59,800 --> 01:51:04,279
like I feel like a lot of people have

2933
01:51:01,760 --> 01:51:06,159
gotten away from that right it's like

2934
01:51:04,279 --> 01:51:07,479
when all these big facilities came on

2935
01:51:06,158 --> 01:51:09,319
you have all these people just like how

2936
01:51:07,479 --> 01:51:11,078
many pound how many pounds of light can

2937
01:51:09,319 --> 01:51:12,880
you grow this this this and this and

2938
01:51:11,078 --> 01:51:16,238
it's like there's definitely a Tipping

2939
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:20,000
Point of like getting high yields and

2940
01:51:16,238 --> 01:51:26,238
quality right right so you know you can

2941
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:29,800
blast 1,500 ppfd and push four 4.5 EC at

2942
01:51:26,238 --> 01:51:33,198
the dripper and get crazy crazy yields

2943
01:51:29,800 --> 01:51:35,960
but that yeah yeah like not not even lar

2944
01:51:33,198 --> 01:51:37,919
like [ __ ] big yeah yeah but can you

2945
01:51:35,960 --> 01:51:39,000
sell big monster buds too especially if

2946
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:40,399
they're purple on that outside and green

2947
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,760
on the inside exactly that's what I was

2948
01:51:40,399 --> 01:51:45,078
going to say is that like it's a point

2949
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:48,440
of diminishing returns right so I feel

2950
01:51:45,078 --> 01:51:50,399
like you know pushing it properly I know

2951
01:51:48,439 --> 01:51:53,198
connected was running under canopies for

2952
01:51:50,399 --> 01:51:55,519
a long time I think uh the faving guys

2953
01:51:53,198 --> 01:51:57,198
actually help yeah came from they came

2954
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:59,639
from connect but they were running like

2955
01:51:57,198 --> 01:52:01,598
the the purple spectrums that connected

2956
01:51:59,639 --> 01:52:03,760
like the blur Pooles right and I always

2957
01:52:01,599 --> 01:52:07,480
wondered cuz like in my opinion you're

2958
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:09,320
you know plants only uptake light from

2959
01:52:07,479 --> 01:52:12,879
the top of the lights right that's what

2960
01:52:09,319 --> 01:52:15,439
I used to think no I mean so here here's

2961
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:18,319
my thought so if you remember like back

2962
01:52:15,439 --> 01:52:20,919
in the day connected also had like a

2963
01:52:18,319 --> 01:52:23,039
bunch of like uh when they were using

2964
01:52:20,920 --> 01:52:26,239
those I like some of their like the

2965
01:52:23,039 --> 01:52:27,439
biscotti C I wondered if that was from

2966
01:52:26,238 --> 01:52:31,039
you know they took care of the problem

2967
01:52:27,439 --> 01:52:33,118
for sure uh and started you know but I

2968
01:52:31,039 --> 01:52:35,000
was wondering if that was from the under

2969
01:52:33,118 --> 01:52:38,198
canopies and that's why I was hesitant

2970
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:40,960
to use them right is because I would

2971
01:52:38,198 --> 01:52:43,359
think you know sometimes and it might

2972
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:46,158
work on 85% of the plants but you know

2973
01:52:43,359 --> 01:52:49,759
that one finicky plant right that

2974
01:52:46,158 --> 01:52:52,279
finicky strain which biscotti is very

2975
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:54,719
finicky like does not like light yeah

2976
01:52:52,279 --> 01:52:57,479
like if you give it too much ppfd in the

2977
01:52:54,719 --> 01:53:00,239
early flower you're getting super Fox

2978
01:52:57,479 --> 01:53:02,078
tailed buds like it just does not like

2979
01:53:00,238 --> 01:53:04,638
light like that so it's like always

2980
01:53:02,078 --> 01:53:06,840
wondered like does that stress the plant

2981
01:53:04,639 --> 01:53:08,599
right so I'm excited to see where like

2982
01:53:06,840 --> 01:53:10,319
our trials with them go yeah and then

2983
01:53:08,599 --> 01:53:12,679
dialing in over time if you see good

2984
01:53:10,319 --> 01:53:16,039
results I mean I'm yeah yeah for sure

2985
01:53:12,679 --> 01:53:17,599
it's uh ever evolving right which is

2986
01:53:16,039 --> 01:53:20,000
cool whole thing yeah the whole thing is

2987
01:53:17,599 --> 01:53:23,480
ever evolving from every angle yeah yeah

2988
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:25,880
for sure it's uh it's cool to see too

2989
01:53:23,479 --> 01:53:28,559
that like all of the under canopies

2990
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:30,239
being made right now are from real

2991
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:33,079
cultivators too right yeah the

2992
01:53:30,238 --> 01:53:35,799
Innovations coming from real guys yeah

2993
01:53:33,078 --> 01:53:37,679
from real guys cuz it's like you see you

2994
01:53:35,800 --> 01:53:39,560
used to see like these everybody's doing

2995
01:53:37,679 --> 01:53:41,560
it though we got everybody jumping on oh

2996
01:53:39,560 --> 01:53:43,639
for sure for sure but you know a lot of

2997
01:53:41,560 --> 01:53:45,840
the big guys you know faven I know craft

2998
01:53:43,639 --> 01:53:48,078
farmer has farer has them Mango's doing

2999
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:50,360
mango has them all like real Farmers

3000
01:53:48,078 --> 01:53:52,679
though like I can get behind that right

3001
01:53:50,359 --> 01:53:55,118
like that's I think that's good for the

3002
01:53:52,679 --> 01:53:57,158
industry right um but yeah like back in

3003
01:53:55,118 --> 01:53:59,359
the day you'd see like these a like

3004
01:53:57,158 --> 01:54:02,118
people come out with AC come AC's oh

3005
01:53:59,359 --> 01:54:05,359
this AC does this this and this and it's

3006
01:54:02,118 --> 01:54:07,118
like they're not anytime I've had like

3007
01:54:05,359 --> 01:54:09,679
grow equipment made by someone that

3008
01:54:07,118 --> 01:54:11,039
wasn't a grower like the some AC company

3009
01:54:09,679 --> 01:54:12,960
that tries to design something it's

3010

have enough service Tex plenty of Stu I

3015
01:54:22,198 --> 01:54:25,479
get so I get a lot of products all the

3016
01:54:23,599 --> 01:54:27,400
time for people that want to me to show

3018
01:54:27,399 --> 01:54:32,839
so I've seen everything anything and

3019
01:54:30,760 --> 01:54:36,840
everything as far as different things in

3020
01:54:32,840 --> 01:54:41,440
the industry from irrigation systems

3021
01:54:36,840 --> 01:54:43,199
irrigation methods to new forms of

3022
01:54:41,439 --> 01:54:45,319
trimmers new forms of everything some of

3023
01:54:43,198 --> 01:54:47,839
them are amazing a lot of them are just

3024
01:54:45,319 --> 01:54:48,759
like whoa like you trying to reinvent

3025
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:51,319
something that doesn't need to be

3026
01:54:48,760 --> 01:54:52,599
reinvented exactly and it happens a lot

3027
01:54:51,319 --> 01:54:53,679
you know I think that happens every

3028
01:54:52,599 --> 01:54:55,239
industry though you know when you're

3029

looking for Innovation it will happen

3030
01:54:55,238 --> 01:54:58,439
but a lot of the stuff is just going to

3031
01:54:57,118 --> 01:55:00,238
be derivatives that aren't good and then

3032
01:54:58,439 --> 01:55:02,719
