00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,359
uh been around it for a while and trying

25
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,679
to you know find my place in the

26
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:00,899
Cannabis scene these days and that's

27
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:05,159
kind of leaning towards the educational

28
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:06,599
realm and home Growers uh very a big

29
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,340
population of Home Growers I mean every

30
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:09,780
year there's new States coming online so

31
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,299
the amount of Home growers in the

32
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:15,900
country grows every day every week and

33
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:18,118
people have you know much more access to

34
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,680
information than I did you we did when

35
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:21,780
we first started growing you know in the

36
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,299
90s uh I was afraid to go to the local

37
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,320
library to look you know botany books

38
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:26,640
because you're afraid the sheriff's

39
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:28,559
department are coming and check the card

40
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,239
catalog or something silly so now with

41
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,040
the amount of information out there and

42
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:35,459
people have access to it all it's kind

43
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,860
of unfiltered uh Avalanche and people

44
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:41,459
make these big purchases and uneducated

45
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:43,438
decisions and I feel like I uh took a

46
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:45,899
shot to uh we moved our family out to

47
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:48,539
Oregon to try to do the OLCC commercial

48
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:51,060
production and got our license in just

49
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,560
before the moratorium got caught up in

50
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,700
that whole nonsense for a year and a

51
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,359
half or so we ended up having to sell

52
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:59,759
our farm and uh kind of gave up back and

53
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:02,459
forth Oklahoma legalized I'm from

54
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,159
Oklahoma originally so we took a couple

55
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:07,438
of trips back and uh toward this idea of

56
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,179
moving back and and partnering in on a

57
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,519
couple of grows and it was Oregon is way

58
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,620
better for cultivation than Oklahoma man

59
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,300
that was talking about wild west that's

60
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,980
uh finally starting to settle down a bit

61
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,280
out there but it was kind of chaos and

62
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:21,899
uh and yeah you know um got family wife

63
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,239
and kids and kind of happy in my

64
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,980
situation and finding that people are

65
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,360
hungry for information and want to want

66
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:30,119
to grow their own and I think there's a

67
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,739
big crowd of people that are uh you know

68
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,180
really passionate as well about it and

69
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:35,459
that's uh like I said I appreciate that

70
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,840
and I feel very strongly and I have very

71
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:40,020
opinionated sometimes about certain

72
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,219
aspects of the of the process but at the

73
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,680
end of the day I think I just want to

74
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:46,259
share my my passion and and be able to

75
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,400
let someone that's never grown a plant

76
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:49,378
before

77
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,879
have that experience of taking a seed

78
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:52,199
harvesting it and then having a really

79
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:55,318
nice product that they did themselves

80
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:57,598
it's a very satisfying experience very

81
00:02:55,318 --> 00:02:59,518
rewarding so yeah and it's an experience

82
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:01,799
I think those are those are great life

83
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,900
experiences to see something that starts

84
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,459
as a seed and then finishes as a usable

85
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,260
product that you can smoke or there's

86
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:08,580
other uses as well you know you can put

87
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:10,560
it in an edible you can do so many

88
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,420
different things with it definitely very

89
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,039
versatile yeah you can juice it you can

90
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:15,839
make ropes with it you know it's like

91
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:19,139
the sky is the limit and I think it's

92
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,420
just a really amazing thing that slowly

93
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:23,759
but surely as

94
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:25,318
we get more technology we start losing

95
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,840
these things like Butchery as a dying

96
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:29,759
art too you don't see real butchers very

97
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,500
often like you used to every town used

98
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,479
to have a butcher every place had a had

99
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,180
actual butchers that would break down

100
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:37,560
cattle but a lot of you know I mean I

101
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,799
would say that all grocery stores for

102
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,598
the most part are just yeah not all but

103
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,000
the majority of them have have actual

104
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:46,439
just packaged meat yeah and it's cows go

105
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,120
on one end of a building and packages

106
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:49,979
come out the other and into a truck and

107
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,480
shipped out yeah The Butchers cut out of

108
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:52,979
that process now well yeah and even

109
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:54,658
vegetables so many people used to grow

110
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:56,759
their own vegetables or grow some of

111
00:03:54,658 --> 00:04:01,019
their own vegetables and now most people

112
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:03,060
I would say more than 90 just by produce

113
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:04,680
from the grocery definitely so and I

114
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,000
think there's some real enjoyment that

115
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,159
you can get and you can learn a lot

116
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,500
about nature and you can learn a lot

117
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:11,878
about failing and and learning from your

118
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,860
mistakes I think those are important

119
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:14,878
valuable life lessons and you can get so

120
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,799
many different things about cultivation

121
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:19,199
yeah spot on you said it right there

122
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,939
it's just like the the physical the

123
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,579
reward of being in the garden moving

124
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:25,019
your body interacting with plants

125
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:26,879
learning from your mistakes and people

126
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:28,379
you know in the age of social media

127
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,540
pretend like they're perfect and only

128
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:32,279
put their best face online and you you

129
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,360
know assume that they don't make the

130
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:34,799
mistakes and it's like they've made

131
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,000
those mistakes for years and years and

132
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,439
learned from them to be able to get to

133
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,478
the point to show you these you know

134
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:41,100
pretty pictures right but I think it's

135
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:44,219
also it's very important to acknowledge

136
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,720
your mistakes and you know be humble and

137
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,060
learn from your mistakes and be honest

138
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,100
about uh be honest to yourself oh yeah

139
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,139
be honest be honest to yourself and you

140
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,360
know that's the best way and I think you

141
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:55,680
don't get good at something without

142
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,780
making mistakes

143
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,759
you don't it's just not how life works

144
00:04:57,779 --> 00:05:01,799
you know and I think you can be

145
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,780
naturally gifted and have a natural

146
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,579
green thumb and get good results right

147
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:08,159
from the beginning but you can also be

148
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:09,779
someone who's passionate but stubborn

149
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,759
and they don't give up and learn how to

150
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:13,258
be a really good grower you know if

151
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,520
you're passionate about it just because

152
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:16,319
you don't get it right the first time

153
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:17,639
that doesn't mean you shouldn't try and

154
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:19,560
try and try again until you get it

155
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,300
perfect if you love it yeah and I see

156
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,280
you see you see that a lot unfortunately

157
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,259
people you know spend a couple Grand on

158
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,179
a tent and it's for sale in six months

159
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:29,520
because they bombed their first run it's

160
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,840
like you put put that in your notebook

161
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:32,459
what did you do wrong learn from that

162
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:34,198
like where how do you build on that

163
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:36,120
don't just one and done and quit and

164
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:37,800
give up you know well yeah and I see

165
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,180
what happens a lot of times is you know

166
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,919
people they get into it and they're like

167
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,959
they want to build a six lighter right

168
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:44,758
out the gate and then spend all this

169
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,019
money and invest all this energy into

170
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:47,400
something they don't really know about

171
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:49,500
and the best thing they could have done

172
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:51,719
is probably just got one light and put

173
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,478
it in a room or in a closet and

174
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,699
experimented with one or two or five

175
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,379
plants instead of putting the room with

176
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:00,780
36 plants because it's so much different

177
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:02,879
and these scale yeah as far as people

178
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:04,559
don't think of 36 plants is a big scale

179
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:07,219
but compared to one plant or two plant

180
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,180
it's significant yeah it's yeah

181
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,860
exponentially and it takes all you know

182
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,840
for each one of those plants to properly

183
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,639
care for it you know and there's

184
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:16,439
automated watering and there's some cool

185
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,660
stuff but like I think people should

186
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:21,418
learn how to water by hand I think I

187
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:23,580
would never do large scale by hand and

188
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:26,159
I've been a big proponent a proponent of

189
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:27,899
automatic watering at scale

190
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,520
but I don't think that there's anything

191
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:30,839
wrong with waking up in the morning and

192
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:33,240
going Watering your plants in your

193
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:35,339
backyard I've really got enjoyment over

194
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,199
over the period of my life from the

195
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:38,698
plants where I've watered you know right

196
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,520
when the sun's coming up I'll go hit my

197
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:43,080
plants with water or whatever and I feel

198
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:45,538
like you're there's a lot to be learned

199
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:46,978
from that too definitely 100 and not

200
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:48,360
only that it's like the more you're

201
00:06:46,978 --> 00:06:49,740
interacting with your plants on a daily

202
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,660
basis you're going to catch issues

203
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,280
before they become problems right you

204
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,080
know if you've got a your automatic

205
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,519
watering and you pop into the tent once

206
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:58,800
a week to check the reservoir we could

207
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:00,359
have spider mites that were in there you

208
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,740
know the last time and now they're well

209
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,000
established in a problem instead of

210
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,680
being in there every day and seeing some

211
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,500
pest damage or pest pressure and being

212
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:10,139
able to react immediately totally

213
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,819
yeah you know I think being able to

214
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:13,259
recognize problems early is great and

215
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:15,000
also one of the beauties of automated

216
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:16,620
watering that a lot of people don't

217
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,180
realize is that it allows you to spend

218
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,340
more time with your plants so you can

219
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:23,038
find those problems before they become

220
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:25,258
issues definitely yeah I've been become

221
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:27,478
a huge fan of of the automated watering

222
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:29,819
at least in partial replacement of hand

223
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:32,219
watering because uh just you know in my

224
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:34,800
my my four by eight I was having issues

225
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,240
with uh pH fluctuations because I was

226
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,819
getting dry pockets and just the volume

227
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,000
of soil uh you know going from 20 or 30

228
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:44,280
gallon bags to 430 gallons of soil uh

229
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,598
just that that change was enough to

230
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:47,698
throw a wrench in the system and then

231
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,699
adding the automated water to keep the

232
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:51,780
soil moisture to more consistent level

233
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:53,819
changed changed overnight you know

234
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:55,379
improved things overnight so let's talk

235
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:56,819
a little bit about how you grow because

236
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:59,159
I feel like that's important part of the

237
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:01,620
story too you do no-till living soil I

238
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,120
do yeah I and that's taken me a long

239
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,639
time to get to this point you know I

240
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,259
might we started uh just kind of shotgun

241
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:10,019
planting seeds back in the river bottoms

242
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:12,060
and late 90s in Oklahoma and it was you

243
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:13,978
know gorilla style go out and plant them

244
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:16,500
come back in October maybe one of 20

245
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:18,959
plants would survive and like going from

246
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:21,660
that hands off to now every day Hands-On

247
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:23,459
and being involved as you want and kind

248
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:25,379
of ran through the the nutrients I did

249
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:28,198
you know you know start off in Miracle

250
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:30,240
Grow and Botanicare and emerald Harvest

251
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:32,459
and you know ran through the Gambit and

252
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,799
then that kind of started uh getting

253
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:36,718
into the organic side I smoked some

254
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,098
organic flour you know years ago and and

255
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,140
kind of did a side by side and was

256
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:42,120
really intrigued by just the process and

257
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:44,639
then kind of started down that road and

258
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:47,519
it's led me to the no-till and trying to

259
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:49,860
be uh close the loop as much as possible

260
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:53,220
in in my personal growth so that led to

261
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:55,740
some Modern natural farming uh methods

262
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,839
and composting is huge I've been by

263
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:00,839
little bug friends or do a bunch of the

264
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:03,120
work and really trying to dive into the

265
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:05,100
soil biology and just the the life that

266
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,959
exists under that multi-layer and that's

267
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,120
where all the magic happens so I really

268
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:11,099
really enjoy the process

269
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,419
um you know get that kind of the mad

270
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,860
scientist in the lab with all the

271
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:15,899
ferments and you're doing a lot of those

272
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,580
inputs making that stuff yourself

273
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:19,320
another another something that's very

274
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,420
rewarding is that your you know you're

275
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,160
hand crafting a lot of your inputs

276
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:24,719
yourself so that's another level of

277
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:27,000
satisfaction that you coming back to

278
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,440
yourself right and uh any I I enjoy the

279
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,179
process it does you know takes a little

280
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,320
longer that's always the thing that

281
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:33,838
people come at me with you know the

282
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,879
organic soil and yeah hydro's faster I'm

283
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,680
not going to argue against that it is

284
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:39,778
but it's it's you know apples and

285
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:41,159
oranges situation it is it's very apples

286
00:09:39,778 --> 00:09:43,740
and oranges that's a great way to put it

287
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:44,939
so you know it has it's a tool I think

288
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,919
there's a lot of people that want to

289
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,720
have you know this black and white

290
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:50,219
you know definitive this is the best

291
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,839
this is the best you got to do it this

292
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,580
way or you're you know doing it wrong

293
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,779
it's like you know there's a thousand

294
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,060
different ways to grow and none of them

295
00:09:54,778 --> 00:09:58,559
are wrong or incorrect or bad you know

296
00:09:57,059 --> 00:10:00,000
there are tools that can be applied in

297
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:02,039
certain situations that they work best

298
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,139
in the situation right you know and if

299
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:06,179
you're uh depending on what your goals

300
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:07,799
your personal experience and preference

301
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:10,259
are is going to kind of lead you and

302
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:11,639
draw you more towards one style of

303
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:13,679
growing or another you know we've got a

304
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:15,299
buddy that's a plumber and he's not ever

305
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,859
going to quit growing hydroponically

306
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:18,240
because he's a plumber and he loves it

307
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,459
you know he gets going tinker and build

308
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,899
manifolds and do the pumps and uh sure

309
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:24,719
it's just like that's his that's his

310
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:25,740
deal it's so individual it is the whole

311
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,200
thing and there's so many different

312
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:30,480
things on every level whether it's

313
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,820
lighting or genetics and it's all

314
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,019
subjective to personal preference yeah

315
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,940
and I think that's what people don't

316
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:38,100
understand is and and it's it's all

317
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:40,320
subjective you know best is just like

318
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:43,019
what what the best is it's like saying a

319
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,459
Picasso is better than a Monet yeah and

320
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:46,860
really the sky's the limit but then you

321
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:49,319
start talking about organic

322
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:52,320
living soil like no-till living soil or

323
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:54,839
even just soil as opposed to Cocoa as

324
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,420
opposed to you know rock wool or

325
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:59,220
different substrates I think when you

326
00:10:57,419 --> 00:11:01,139
start diving into that then you start

327
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,000
looking at things like effect right

328
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:05,458
that's the one big thing that stands out

329
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,659
the most for no-till living soil I think

330
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:09,599
you can get pretty good flavor out of

331
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:12,419
cocoa really good flavor uh yeah Ash

332
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,600
white good flavor Oil ring all that good

333
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:17,819
stuff and it's a great product it's a

334
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,200
great commercial product but then as you

335
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,600
start getting into some of the boutique

336
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,278
stuff the the thing that stands out the

337
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,180
most is

338
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:28,860
the effect of living soil smoke where I

339
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:30,659
feel like it has the best effect for me

340
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,940
and if you go side by side comparisons

341
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:34,980
which I've done many times I feel like

342
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,540
the effect on the living soil it has a

343
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,740
better effect and if you like smoking a

344
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:40,559
lot and you like the effect of it that's

345
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:43,200
important yeah and even without the

346
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:44,578
higher THC numbers a lot of the times I

347
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,379
I don't hit the I don't hit the high

348
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:48,719
numbers in in my living soil that I do

349
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:51,000
but I feel like all of the other

350
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,000
all the other cannabinoids that are

351
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,159
coming into play are are balancing that

352
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,559
out and making it that full that full

353
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:00,120
spectrum effect the Entourage effect

354
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:03,000
what kind of numbers are you hitting

355
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:06,419
roughly mid-20s you know low to mid 20s

356
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,240
with with the with just water and you

357
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:12,240
know not pushing anything not doing too

358
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:14,220
much supplemental feeding at all um you

359
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,740
know I I had a

360
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,420
so nitrogen deficiency not because there

361
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,799
was a lack of nitrogen in the soil but

362
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:22,078
you know when the Woody mulch starts to

363
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:23,879
break down the bacteria tie up the

364
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:26,578
nitrogen so I had to feed some fish

365
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:28,799
amino acids and fish hydrosylate off and

366
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:31,199
on to bump the nitrogen up to acceptable

367
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,578
levels but once the mulch breaks down

368
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,560
and starts cycling properly it's

369
00:12:32,578 --> 00:12:36,838
basically water water only it really is

370
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:39,539
and you can you can add the beneficials

371
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,760
and do compost teas worm teas and add

372
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:43,799
stuff to it but and then that's another

373
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:45,360
conversation about diminishing returns

374
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:48,179
it's like well you have this living soil

375
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,519
this you know 430 gallons of soil that's

376
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:52,319
like a self-contained ecosystem and

377
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,879
really all the work that you've done for

378
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,000
the last few months six months a year

379
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:58,860
jump starting that to life is so you can

380
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,839
step back and really let it do its own

381
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:03,240
thing and only have to add water and

382
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:05,160
make sure that soil moisture stays in an

383
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,839
appropriate range so the nutrient cycle

384
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:08,458
and then it's all up to the plant you

385
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:10,560
know and that's the that's going to be

386
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:13,199
kind of the the heart of the class I'm

387
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:15,419
putting together here on uh I hate to

388
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,420
say it we call call it a master class

389
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:20,278
no-till master class and it's basically

390
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:23,159
geared towards people who want to

391
00:13:20,278 --> 00:13:25,019
transition away from uh synthetic bottle

392
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:28,078
feeding even bottle feeding Organics but

393
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:30,539
transition from that to a more no-till

394
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:33,239
hands-off just don't give Master ger

395
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:35,059
certificates out at your master class I

396
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,320
was not I was not a fan of the name

397
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:39,419
Master Class I'm okay with but I feel

398
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,519
like the master girl it's just such a

399
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:43,019
generic thing you know I've seen it on

400
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,179
resumes when

401
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:48,179
I was going through those processes it's

402
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:50,219
like you know it just it tells a lot who

403
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:52,500
told you you were mad who gave you that

404
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,240
certificate it's just it's one of those

405
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,820
interesting things so

406
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,680
let's walk through your process for so

407
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,600
what do you do you do tests you send

408
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:02,759
your soil out for testing do you have a

409
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,740
microscope how are you doing tests and

410
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:06,419
then as far as identifying issues like

411
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:09,120
nitrogen deficiency how are you doing

412
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:12,059
that yep so uh by build you know mix my

413
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,100
own soil and uh send in for soil tests

414
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:16,619
after every Harvest so see if I need to

415
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:18,120
catch up on anything at dry amendments

416
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,740
and

417
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,060
um I don't I don't have a scope yet I'm

418
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,680
kind of playing with that the

419
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:24,599
microbiology scope there's a couple of

420
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:27,659
companies that offer testing kits as far

421
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,940
as uh you know what bacterial fungal

422
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:32,100
levels your soil is at and so do you

423
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:34,079
test in one zone multiple zones how do

424
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,600
you yeah multiple so in my four by eight

425
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:39,120
bed I'll take six samples basically six

426
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,699
different samples uh at all about the

427
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,620
same depth so uh well you know a six

428
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:46,559
inch core sample taking the entire core

429
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:48,240
and and two pounds of soil tested out so

430
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:50,278
it's pretty good average right you know

431
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,980
it gets a pretty good uh cross-section

432
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:55,259
of everything in the soil nice yeah and

433
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:57,120
it's you know since I mixed it myself I

434
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:58,620
know it's pretty pretty even mix it's

435
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,360
not going to have too many hot spots and

436
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,459
when I had amendments it's very

437
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,980
consistent and evenly spread so there

438
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:07,439
shouldn't be you know hot spots so you

439
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:09,420
build your soil from scratch yes some

440
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,940
people use build a soil some people use

441
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:14,159
vital as a starting point so you know

442
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,480
and then build on top of those soils but

443
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:17,159
those are those are great that's where I

444
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,560
started Coots mix you know that was my

445
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:22,379
kind of 101 and I don't think that you

446
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:24,000
should just dive right into it and make

447
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:25,919
your own recipe there's tried and true

448
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,659
recipes that are great for your first

449
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:29,639
bed build a small bed use someone else's

450
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:31,379
recipe don't try to reinvent the wheel

451
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:33,299
right off and then in your situation you

452
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:34,980
can decide after a harvester two like

453
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:36,958
okay well I'm going to bump this add

454
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:39,480
this change this more aeration more

455
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:41,698
compost and then start making those

456
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,959
decisions but yeah people come in and be

457
00:15:41,698 --> 00:15:45,599
like well I'm going to add six extra

458
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:47,159
cups of blood meals a bump the nitrogen

459
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,800
it's like well you got horrible pH

460
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:52,078
issues you haven't you know nitrogen you

461
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:54,778
know clawed plants in the first two runs

462
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:57,239
because you just the soil is too hot and

463
00:15:54,778 --> 00:15:58,980
there are definitely lots of there's

464
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,659
lots of room to play and adjust and make

465
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:03,300
your own recipe but just like with

466
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:05,338
anything else you you don't just assume

467
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:06,659
that you're going to understand soil

468
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,980
biology better than the people that have

469
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:09,980
been doing it for 30 years and come in

470
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:13,379
and totally do it differently you know

471
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:15,379
they're not set in stone and you know

472
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:18,299
the Coots mix has got a lot of of

473
00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:20,100
controversy last few years but it was a

474
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:21,479
good starting point you know that it was

475
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,639
kind of the first

476
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,320
soil recipe that people could just grab

477
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:27,539
off the internet and then kind of start

478
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,980
on their own doing it and uh and before

479
00:16:27,539 --> 00:16:29,759
it was a lot of trial and error a lot of

480
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,220
people

481
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,659
mixing their own batches and doing like

482
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,399
eight or ten batches next to each other

483
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,899
and trying to decide what what worked

484
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:39,360
better in their in their environment and

485
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:41,759
situation right so I do and that's like

486
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,220
uh yeah mixing the soil Source I try to

487
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,800
Source local inputs as much as possible

488
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,839
that's awesome I had when you have good

489
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:50,519
inputs you're up in Lincoln City I got I

490
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,800
got a nice pick in there yeah I got the

491
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:55,259
the coast is right there so I can

492
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:58,679
Harvest you know seaweed and do the kelp

493
00:16:55,259 --> 00:17:00,539
Bowl kelp oyster shells and seawater for

494
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:03,239
minerals and you know the forest is

495
00:17:00,539 --> 00:17:06,119
Bountiful uh harvesting as well for lots

496
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,740
of ferments and inputs uh horsetail and

497
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:11,279
I just filled up a barrel of horsetail

498
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:13,199
for silica for uh you know Nettles

499
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:15,240
blackberries I got a nice spread to

500
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,039
forage through so the blackberries are

501
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,900
popping this time of year they're out of

502
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,759
control and it's they're an invasive

503
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,500
species so as many as you can cut back

504
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:24,599
the better and that's what I've heard

505
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,818
yeah this time of year especially it's

506
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:30,359
great for uh for ferments or

507
00:17:26,818 --> 00:17:33,240
putrification for jdam because you have

508
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:35,879
all different aspects of the plant you

509
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:37,798
got fresh growth immature flowers and

510
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:40,500
ripe fruit so you get a nice broad

511
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:42,900
spectrum fertilizer right there growing

512
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,220
Wildfire yeah yeah but this year now you

513
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,900
guys got to worry about fire danger so

514
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,460
I've heard like starting like you

515
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:50,280
probably don't on the coast it's not as

516
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:53,038
bad but it is not as bad and we we moved

517
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:56,220
to Lincoln City seven coming out eight

518
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:57,538
years ago now and the Wildfire was not

519
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,980
you know we're in the temperate

520
00:17:57,538 --> 00:18:00,480
rainforest on the coast we don't have to

521
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:03,058
worry about wildfires and we almost lost

522
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,460
our home two years ago uh a fire we

523
00:18:03,058 --> 00:18:07,379
burned the well house and uh had some

524
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,058
smoke damage but our neighbors up the

525
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:12,059
hill you know a few hundred yards away

526
00:18:09,058 --> 00:18:13,319
was the fire line basically and some of

527
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:15,480
our neighbors were not so lucky still

528
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:16,678
recovering and it's definitely something

529
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,599
that everyone's having to have a

530
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:21,840
conversation about unfortunately now so

531
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:23,699
we have our fire plan and uh well you

532
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:25,740
were there recently it's uh one Road in

533
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:28,558
one road out it's right it's not a great

534
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,880
place to have to evacuate from yeah for

535
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:31,740
sure

536
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,660
yeah it's a trip you know and then even

537
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:36,480
Hawaii there we had one of the worst in

538
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:38,640
history yeah In Our Lifetime yeah that's

539
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,319
that's rough yeah and then I was

540
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,299
wondering about my trip down here this

541
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,519
was uh when the shower air but it was

542
00:18:42,298 --> 00:18:47,639
tropical storm threats and oh yeah

543
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:50,519
hurricane possibilities yeah so driving

544
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:54,000
from Oregon the other day yesterday

545
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:56,220
there was Smoke in Oregon I was driving

546
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,099
through Eugene it looked apocalyptic

547
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:02,038
where you keep the bright red Sun and

548
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:04,980
you can't see more than like 200 300

549
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:06,720
feet like clear and it's all just worse

550
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,599
than La yeah surprisingly yeah we call

551
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,220
that the the PTSD orange now that Smoky

552
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:13,918
orange tent and you're just in in that

553
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:15,720
well and even with the recycling air on

554
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,820
your car where it's recirculating oh

555
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,440
yeah I could still smell it so let's

556
00:19:17,819 --> 00:19:21,119
keep it up it's no good but then we get

557
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,220
into California and it's torrential

558
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:24,479
downpour and you know the roads are

559
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,160
greasy because we haven't had any rain

560
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,538
so you know you don't want to drive too

561
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,580
fast on those

562
00:19:27,538 --> 00:19:31,259
and uh yeah there was flooding in La

563
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:34,019
they had an earthquake

564
00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:35,579
pretty wild pretty wild times man so

565
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:38,220
let's talk about autoflowers because you

566
00:19:35,579 --> 00:19:41,519
want an Autoflower cup a while back uh

567
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,839
2021 yeah yeah which is great and you

568
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:44,160
know I love having people on the show

569
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:46,798
talking about autoflowers because I

570
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:49,019
think autoflowers are amazing and uh so

571
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:51,418
did you grow in soil or tell us the

572
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:53,700
story yeah no so it was uh kind of

573
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:56,640
serendipitous actually I had got and

574
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:58,860
ordered a pack of photo period seeds and

575
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,500
got a couple packs of autoflowers as

576
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:03,359
freebies and the last time I had grown

577
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:06,240
an Autoflower was back in the like the

578
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:08,159
low rider era so I wasn't like super

579
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,038
impressed with the low rider and I hated

580
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,960
Autoflower too much annoyed but but yeah

581
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:15,000
so times have changed yeah for sure so

582
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,860
that was a great great experience you

583
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,980
know I had a you know nice big plan

584
00:20:16,859 --> 00:20:21,839
beautiful flower uh smoked great chunky

585
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,519
butts big chunky buds it was really nice

586
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:26,459
but it was like I said it was kind of an

587
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:28,798
offhanded uh freebie and it turned out

588
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:31,019
beautifully and then it's like I just

589
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:33,298
had joined uh Instagram at that point in

590
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:35,220
my life and so there was a come across

591
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:37,500
the Autoflower cup up in Washington

592
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:38,880
state I was like man I was into

593
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,460
autoflowers I was kind of you know

594
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,840
trying to find my entry back into the

595
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:45,120
world of cannabis and thought you know

596
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:47,639
same autoflowers are great they've got a

597
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:49,199
very uh a big application I think here

598
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,419
in the near future they're they're up

599
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,860
and coming yeah and I could kind of see

600
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:54,538
that then and wanted to be involved in

601
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:57,599
the community and meet some people so I

602
00:20:54,538 --> 00:20:59,579
was like I'll enter this cup uh and and

603
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:01,019
you know no expectations really of

604
00:20:59,579 --> 00:21:03,119
winning it so it was the first

605
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:04,980
Autoflower I had grown since a low rider

606
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:07,500

607
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:09,298
um and it entered a couple two or three

608
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,819
weeks before the cup and was excited to

609
00:21:09,298 --> 00:21:13,980
go and meet people and it just kind of

610
00:21:11,819 --> 00:21:16,259
worked out and I I won the for the

and that was you know the the weather

653
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:48,840
the climate she found a job that she

654
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:51,120
liked and kind of all the stars aligned

655
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:53,519
and the the wreck Market was open at

656
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:57,298
that point so that was I was gonna go

657
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:58,500
and grow for OLCC yeah and uh I love the

658

you know so but but yeah a lot of fun

668
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,940
and I think there's really good food

669
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:20,279
there there's diversity yeah it's a nice

670
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:22,798
it's a nice mix there was uh you know 20

671
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:24,839
years ago because of the mild climate it

672
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:26,000
was a big draw for retirees and then

673
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:28,319
that kind of a

674
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,179
whole Market kind of came up around that

675
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:31,859
but now it's kind of the people moving

676
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:34,620
from Portland and Salem out of the

677
00:23:31,859 --> 00:23:37,500
Cities down there brought some uh some

678
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:38,879
nice amenities to to town where it's

679
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,099
usually closed down at seven o'clock I

680
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,720
don't know if it was okay it was like

681
00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:44,879
seven o'clock lights out so there's only

682
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,319
Town well when we took the Uber because

683
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,299
I didn't want you know if we have some

684
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:50,038
wine or whatever I like wine we went we

685
00:23:48,298 --> 00:23:51,779
went to the Bay house at South Shan

686
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:53,038
we're going there for dinner and I was

687
00:23:51,779 --> 00:23:55,319
gonna have some wine so I don't drink

688
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:57,538
and drive that's my one big thing and I

689
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:58,678
don't drink very much anyway so I

690
00:23:57,538 --> 00:24:00,538
definitely don't drink and drive so I

691
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:02,280
was like well they got Uber so we got an

692
00:24:00,538 --> 00:24:03,419
Uber it took like 10 minutes for them to

693
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:04,980
get there that's not a big deal but we

694
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:06,659
get in the Uber and the guy's like we

695
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,579
you know there's only two Uber drivers

696
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:10,380
in the whole Lincoln City yeah

697
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:12,240
turns out there's actually three because

698
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:14,700
we got picked up by the third one but it

699
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,819
was only his second pickup and drop off

700
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:19,259
we just got Uber yeah just brand new to

701
00:24:17,819 --> 00:24:20,939
Lincoln City yeah it's like a year old

702
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:23,400
or something like that yeah despite the

703
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:25,440
taxi love you taxi 101 if you need a

704
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,298
ride sometime but yeah the taxi it would

705
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,320
be like an hour after you called they'd

706
00:24:27,298 --> 00:24:29,279
show up with four other people in the

707
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:30,899
car and be like we got to make five

708
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,058
stops before we drop you off right

709
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,320
that's great it's like come on over when

710
00:24:33,058 --> 00:24:36,058
are you gonna get here yeah well so as

711
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:37,500
far as Autoflower advice if somebody's

712
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,759
gonna grow Autoflower for the first time

713
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:41,038
because I feel like there's a lot of

714
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:42,900
skeptical people that are like oh

715
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:45,960
Autoflower sucks

716
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:47,580
I you know I think the autofire are

717
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,440
special and it's Unique and I think it

718
00:24:47,579 --> 00:24:50,699
maybe not for everybody but like for the

719
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,400
people that are interested in growing on

720
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:56,880
a flower it finishes from seed 70 days

721
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:59,759
80 Days 90 days depending on the the

722
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,080
variety yeah uh so there is that beauty

723
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:04,440
where it's predictable and when you're

724
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:05,639
gonna Harvest uh what advice or tips do

725
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,558
you have for people that are interested

726
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,780
in getting into autoflowers man I think

727
00:25:07,558 --> 00:25:12,058
the biggest thing for autoflowers is

728
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:13,980
less is more like people want to like

729
00:25:12,058 --> 00:25:15,599
drown them and feed them and burn them

730
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,099
up in that first two weeks and the the

731
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:18,240
first you know three weeks of an

732
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,918
autoflowers

733
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,720
super critical it's the most important

734
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,038
part I think for the first three weeks

735
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,600
because if you [ __ ] up in the first

736
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:26,759
three weeks you're not going to get a

737
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:28,619
big plan that's the one you know and I

738
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:30,000
think that is the biggest issue that

739
00:25:28,619 --> 00:25:31,439
people have is in that first three weeks

740
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,700
they just they're what they're doing too

741
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,620
much yeah you know they don't understand

742
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,240
Autoflower is very light feeder light

743
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:38,099
Drinker it's easy and they have a small

744
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,140
root Zone compared to a photo period

745
00:25:38,099 --> 00:25:42,719
plant of the same size definitely yeah

746
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:44,278
so I think right less is more and I also

747
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,500
think everyone should grow an Autoflower

748
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:48,298
yeah it's an awesome if you've only

749
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:50,220
grown photos if you like myself and you

750
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:52,319
know had a bad experience years ago with

751
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,640
an Autoflower they've come so far you

752
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:55,740
know I think everyone should try it out

753
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,419
because like you say you plant a seed in

754
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:59,640
you know 80 to 90 days later it's

755
00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:01,080
harvest and I've just vegged for 90 days

756
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,000
you know what I mean in my photo period

757
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:05,038
so it's a nice turnaround and I think

758
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,900
that once people start to see the

759
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:09,058
versatility and the utility and it's

760
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:11,159
like I have primarily grown from seed

761
00:26:09,058 --> 00:26:12,599
the last few years so I'll start my

762
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:14,640
photo period seeds and I'll start Auto

763
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:16,319
flower seeds along with them and you

764
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,179
know two and a half months later when my

765
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:20,038
photos are ready to go into flower the

766
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:21,778
our the autoflowers are ready to harvest

767
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:23,759
yeah so you get that you know the little

768
00:26:21,778 --> 00:26:25,200
bumper crop in between for a transition

769
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:27,240
where you would otherwise yeah the

770
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,380
bumper crop is cool yeah for sure so

771
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,880
even if you're not like you said if

772
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,679
you're not getting pound plants yeah

773
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,059
it's like it's it's taking up extra

774
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,140
space in the bedroom and you're getting

775
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:35,460
a harvest that you wouldn't have had

776
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,840
flour you can still get four ounce

777
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,819
plants oh it's not like you're getting

778
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:40,859
minimal efforts yeah I mean a lot of

779
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:42,538
people don't get four I had friends that

780
00:26:40,859 --> 00:26:44,158
I got better yield from my Autoflower

781
00:26:42,538 --> 00:26:46,019
plants than they do from their photo

782
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,640
period oh yeah you know what I mean so

783
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:49,500
yeah I mean four ounces is on a plant

784
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,538
indoor is pretty good and four ounces

785
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:54,240
outside that's fantastic and I mean I

786
00:26:51,538 --> 00:26:55,798
think that's the higher end but uh you

787
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,419
know I've seen some some plants on the

788
00:26:55,798 --> 00:27:00,298
internet where I'm like that's got to be

789
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:03,120
at least 200 grams yeah like close to

790
00:27:00,298 --> 00:27:04,500
those yeah the auto pots I think is the

791
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:07,319
one the biggest ones I've seen the

792
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:09,240
self-watering the bottom uh sub

793
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:10,558
irrigated planner set up right against

794
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,179
the big Auto flowers and those things

795
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:13,558
for sure bigger isn't always better it

796
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:15,840
doesn't mean it's gonna you know smoke

797
00:27:13,558 --> 00:27:17,819
the same as a smaller plant but you know

798
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:20,339
each to their own it's still a fun plant

799
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:22,558
to grow definitely definitely do you so

800
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:24,839
side note do you think that plant size

801
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:26,399
affects the The Taste and flavor and

802
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:28,740
quality because I've kind of been on

803
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,360
that I do yeah I do I think having

804
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:32,179
smaller buds as opposed to having

805
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:35,459
monster colas

806
00:27:32,179 --> 00:27:37,200
uh is beneficial you know but but I also

807
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:39,600
love looking at big huge colas and

808
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,819
arm-sized colas but as far as like

809
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:43,678
concentration of cannabinoids and

810
00:27:41,819 --> 00:27:47,038
terpenes I think you're going to get

811
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:50,100
from smaller colas but it's also so

812
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:52,019
specific to the cultivar and and you

813
00:27:50,099 --> 00:27:53,819
know the genetics a lot of that has to

814
00:27:52,019 --> 00:27:55,918
do with genetics is some plants are

815
00:27:53,819 --> 00:27:57,960
meant to be big and some plants are

816
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,220
forced to be big you know people force

817
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,720
them to try to get them big and you

818
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,519
don't get the same benefit Blue Dream

819
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,860
Sour Diesel those are naturally just big

820
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:08,400
plants but like sour diesel for instance

821
00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:10,500
it's more Airy so you're not gonna get

822
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,059
you know Blue Dream the bigger it gets

823
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:15,179
it's it gets pretty dense and you can

824
00:28:12,058 --> 00:28:16,859
get some serious botrytus in there too

825
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:19,320
um whereas Sour Diesel I feel like it's

826
00:28:16,859 --> 00:28:20,879
more Airy so it lets water in and water

827
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:22,740
out some of those equatorials the reason

828
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,260
they're like that is so that they can

829
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:27,960
allow humidity in and humidity to escape

830
00:28:25,259 --> 00:28:29,579
from the plant yeah it's 98 98 humidity

831
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,919
and rains for two hours every day you

832
00:28:29,579 --> 00:28:33,899
gotta have some sort of moisture we're

833
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,000
there for a reason you know yes sir yeah

834
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,500
I just having a conversation a couple

835
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,419
weeks ago about

836
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,099
like you said a 10 pound plant yeah

837
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:43,440
gorgeous it's a thing of beauty but I

838
00:28:41,099 --> 00:28:45,119
feel like too like a pound plant tastes

839
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,179
better than that 10 pound plant if

840
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:49,199
they're yeah or whatever side by side I

841
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:52,140
feel like

842
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,940
the plant struggles to produce 10 pounds

843
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,500
worth of cannabinoids where it can focus

844
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:57,778
some more of its energy on a smaller

845
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,400
plant and and be more efficient in that

846
00:28:57,778 --> 00:29:01,500
production and it's not but I think even

847
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:04,019
within the zones of a plant you can take

848
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:06,839
a Bud from the top of the plant under

849
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:08,158
strong concentrated lights and then you

850
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:10,019
can take a side branch and you could

851
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,179
smoke I mean you'll have even if you

852
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:14,038
smell them the one on the side is going

853
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:15,419
to smell stronger typically than the one

854
00:29:14,038 --> 00:29:17,038
on the top that's exposed to all the

855
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:18,659
light it's not always the case but I

856
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:20,278
think a lot of times like you'll get

857
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:22,620
that difference and it translates into

858
00:29:20,278 --> 00:29:25,019
the smoke too yeah no it's 100 of the

859
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:27,119
last the the best smelling bot I had in

860
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:29,220
my last run was like Up Under The Canopy

861
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:32,278
and shade like a little Airy little golf

862
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:34,200
ball smelt fan just fantastic yeah so

863
00:29:32,278 --> 00:29:36,119
when you see guys smelling the colas on

864
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,140
Instagram a lot of I mean if you get the

865
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:40,798
experience guys they're going to be

866
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:42,480
selling the side but this side colas so

867
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:43,918
it's just and that's just you know

868
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,019
that's a personal preference thing but I

869
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:48,778
notice you get way more Terps smelling

870
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:50,158
the sides yeah for sure exactly like the

871
00:29:48,778 --> 00:29:52,440
proximity to the light and the intensity

872
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,520
and the heat up there a little bit so

873
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,899
what kind of genetics are you working

874
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:56,879
with up there

875
00:29:54,898 --> 00:29:59,398
um man I've been uh I've been all over

876
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,679
the place uh I'm kind of going back to

877
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:03,839
play with some land race stuff right now

878
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,298
um like uh talking about just trying to

879
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:08,220
get ahead a little bit and I think you

880
00:30:06,298 --> 00:30:10,440
know in Oregon especially man we've

881
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:12,179
there's a few strains that just got so

882
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,120
hyped and played out so fast and

883
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:17,100
everybody's tired of the same thing

884
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:18,298
no I'm not Jaeger yeah that's like a lot

885
00:30:17,099 --> 00:30:20,339
of the cookies crosses and stuff and

886
00:30:18,298 --> 00:30:21,898
then yeah sure I mean that's all we

887
00:30:20,339 --> 00:30:23,339
talked about the funneling kind of how

888
00:30:21,898 --> 00:30:24,719
everything kind of goes towards one

889
00:30:23,339 --> 00:30:26,519
thing because people get so excited and

890
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,500
that's all the hype yeah and they call

891
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:31,379
it exotic but yet that's all everybody

892
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,940
has yeah and everyone demands yeah it's

893
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:34,860
not rare and then that's the same things

894
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:38,159
like that when I think exotic I think of

895
00:30:34,859 --> 00:30:41,119
that like 16 to 18 week flowering uh

896
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:43,919
plant that nobody has but

897
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:45,658
that's exotic you know so trying to

898
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,880
capture some of the qualities from those

899
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:49,380
super long flowering plants cross it

900
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,600
back to something that's been worked

901
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:53,580
better shorter flowering period and kind

902
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:54,778
of having the Best of Both Worlds or at

903
00:30:53,579 --> 00:30:57,798
least when you're doing some breeding

904
00:30:54,778 --> 00:31:00,480
too uh a little bit see production so

905
00:30:57,798 --> 00:31:02,879
breeding may be a stretch I'm trying to

906
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,440
educate myself enough to to start down

907
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,960
that way we're making seeds I am making

908
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:08,880
seeds yeah so you're making seeds yeah

909
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,380
so you're a seed producer a seed

910
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,760
producer baby yeah yeah whatever making

911
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:13,679
seeds I think that's great and I think

912
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:15,839
everybody should do it you know being a

913
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,460
Sega I just

914
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:18,778
I think everybody should have that

915
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,579
experience so they understand the

916
00:31:18,778 --> 00:31:21,778
difficulties of it you know it's like we

917
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:23,759
talk about

918
00:31:21,778 --> 00:31:25,798
how to select for these certain things

919
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:28,019
and then how do you find out

920
00:31:25,798 --> 00:31:29,519
what traits get passed on and really

921
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:31,200
from experience from growing out the

922
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:34,500
progeny you really see what gets passed

923
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,360
on by mother and father you know donor

924
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:38,579
or receiver however you want to put that

925
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:40,079
but like that's that's the interesting

926
00:31:38,579 --> 00:31:41,398
fun stuff for me is because you get

927
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:44,220
these recessive traits that sometimes

928
00:31:41,398 --> 00:31:45,658
they don't pass on to the progeny you

929
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,919
get some gas and you breed it and none

930
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:49,460
of them have the kind of gas that you're

931
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:52,440
looking for yeah

932
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:54,480
I'm fascinated by the process and and

933
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:56,278
love seeing like you said the

934
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,019
what are you going to get like what's

935
00:31:56,278 --> 00:31:59,460
the seed gonna do if there's not much

936
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:01,440
better than popping new seeds I love

937
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,519
that that just the anticipation you know

938
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,440
a couple months and you start to see

939
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:06,298
flower set and get some Aroma coming off

940
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,558
of it and right you're disappointed

941
00:32:06,298 --> 00:32:09,119
because it doesn't have that gas or it's

942
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:10,379
like oh man this is exactly what I was

943
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:11,639
hoping or it looks amazing in the plant

944
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:13,620
then you go to smoke it and you're like

945
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,960
oh man it doesn't translate into the

946
00:32:13,619 --> 00:32:17,579
smoke yeah so it's just such a myriad of

947
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:20,579
possibilities in that little tiny seed

948
00:32:17,579 --> 00:32:22,199
so right and I I want to

949
00:32:20,579 --> 00:32:24,298
we're talking about I was like I have a

950
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,580
plan maybe one day in three years I'll

951
00:32:24,298 --> 00:32:29,278
be comfortable to like to sell a seed

952
00:32:26,579 --> 00:32:31,319
but I have I have I have you know a goal

953
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:33,538
I have a plan to get to where I want to

954
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:34,918
be and then it's like you go online and

955
00:32:33,538 --> 00:32:36,898
everybody's a breeder you know you can

956
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:39,240
throw a rock and hit 100 breeders on on

957
00:32:36,898 --> 00:32:40,319
social media anybody can make seeds you

958
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,058
can call yourself a breeder online

959
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:44,700
whatever you want but like anybody can

960
00:32:42,058 --> 00:32:47,398
make seeds it's the Fino hunting that is

961
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:49,319
the hard part selecting new you know

962
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:51,778
funeral hunting is only used in cannabis

963
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:54,000
like yeah we're doing selections for

964
00:32:51,778 --> 00:32:57,000
phenotypical expressions or you're

965
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,859
selecting for genotypes but

966
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
the thing is is like that's where the

967
00:32:58,859 --> 00:33:02,459
magic comes in and you have to be able

968
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,919
to grow the plant good enough for it to

969
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:07,380
express to be able discern between the

970
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:09,419
different plant expressions so you're

971
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:11,159
looking at different phenotypical

972
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:13,200
expressions and if you grow shitty

973
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:15,000
they're all going to look very much the

974
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,259
same and even when you smoke them

975
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,819
they're all probably going to taste the

976
00:33:16,259 --> 00:33:19,980
same and not that great but the second

977
00:33:17,819 --> 00:33:22,079
you start becoming good at cultivating

978
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:23,278
enough to that's how you you're good at

979
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:24,778
cultivating too when you're popping

980
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:26,579
seeds and this one's like this and this

981
00:33:24,778 --> 00:33:28,919
one's like that and this one it's

982
00:33:26,579 --> 00:33:30,359
completely different or all these are

983
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:32,820
the same and these are all pretty good

984
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:35,459
but this one smokes way better yeah you

985
00:33:32,819 --> 00:33:37,678
know it's it's really so cultivation is

986
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:39,659
always the starting point for being a

987
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,820
good breeder for being a breeder that's

988
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:43,260
making good seeds even and I think

989
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:45,298
that's another benefit for the the

990
00:33:43,259 --> 00:33:47,278
living soil is you're not

991
00:33:45,298 --> 00:33:49,379
you're not feeding the plant you're not

992
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:51,000
steering it with your you know your

993
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:52,440
nutrient selection it's you put it in

994
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,640
this this healthy environment and it's

995
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,440
going to do its own thing and it's going

996
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,580
to communicate to the soil what it needs

997
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,159
when it needs it and it's going to

998
00:33:56,579 --> 00:34:01,019
express itself kind of differently I

999
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:03,059
think that it would in uh synthetic

1000
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:04,679
nutrients it's allowed to to show what

1001
00:34:03,058 --> 00:34:06,778
it would do you know in the wild and

1002
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:08,398
right that's when you see like you see

1003
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:10,858
the really different expressions in the

1004
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:12,118
plant in the organic in the organic

1005
00:34:10,858 --> 00:34:14,159
environment where they're allowed to to

1006
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:15,659
do their own thing yeah what do you see

1007
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,300
of the future for Oregon I think they've

1008
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:20,820
gone all around with allowing everybody

1009
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:23,460
to get a license and then people

1010
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:25,619
struggling yeah so Oregon

1011
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:27,480
um we we

1012
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:29,280
it was two and a half years ago put in

1013
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,480
we got our license right before the

1014
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,359
moratorium they stopped taking

1015
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:36,240
applications for a new license yeah uh

1016
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:39,000
we had a 33 Acre Farm up in Tillamook

1017
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:40,500
County and we're planning on you know my

1018
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,300
sister moved up from Texas my brother

1019
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:44,099
moved up from Arkansas we're gonna do

1020
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,780
bootstrap it up and and kind of slow

1021
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:49,379
build out yeah

1022
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:51,419
and the OLCC made the rules such that uh

1023
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:53,398
previously it was like your caseworker

1024
00:34:51,418 --> 00:34:54,779
basically for the OLCC calls you was

1025
00:34:53,398 --> 00:34:57,659
like hey you ready for a facility

1026
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:59,040
inspection come by make a list of things

1027
00:34:57,659 --> 00:35:00,838
you need to fix call me when it's done

1028
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:02,940
come back in two months when you get get

1029
00:35:00,838 --> 00:35:05,699
all the problems resolved the shifted

1030
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:08,099
from that to your caseworker calls you

1031
00:35:05,699 --> 00:35:10,919
okay 30 days from now we're coming for a

1032
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:13,320
site inspection it's pass or fail so for

1033
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:15,599
us to have been able to do that we would

1034
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,220
have had to build out a facility not

1035
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,680
knowing if or when we would get

1036
00:35:17,219 --> 00:35:21,299
inspected for a license so you know

1037
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:23,879
talking a half a million dollars

1038
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:26,700
invested in a facility out there

1039
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:29,099
not knowing if it would be eligible for

1040
00:35:26,699 --> 00:35:31,799
a license ever and we got we ended up

1041
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:33,300
having to sell the place and uh it was a

1042
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,760
year and a half after we put our license

1043
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:37,200
application in that they contacted us to

1044
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,000
see if we were ready for our uh

1045
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:39,719
inspection and by that point we'd moved

1046
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,199
on

1047
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:44,639
so I think that they early on uh with

1048
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:47,519
the big canopies and stuff they made it

1049
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:50,338
very easy for whoever wanted one to have

1050
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:52,440
a license and the overproduction kind of

1051
00:35:50,338 --> 00:35:55,019
changed the direction of that and now

1052
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:57,480
it's uh it's a struggle and with the

1053
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:58,858
testing laws and regulation changes it

1054
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,719
seems like they're putting pressure on

1055
00:35:58,858 --> 00:36:02,819
the smaller farms and the organic

1056
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:04,858
Growers uh I don't know if you saw the

1057
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:07,260
the aspergillus testing that they just

1058
00:36:04,858 --> 00:36:09,960
implemented no in a couple within the

1059
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:15,119
last couple of months so you know no no

1060
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:17,280
studies no data no cases to you know to

1061
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:19,980
imp to no reason to implement this

1062
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,359
testing law other than these companies

1063
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:23,159
coming into the state and lobbying for

1064
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:25,619
the laws to be changed because you know

1065
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:27,598
this remediation company comes in and

1066
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:28,920
has a solution but no problem so they

1067
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,980
changed the law where now everybody's

1068
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,940
failing for aspergillus and now what

1069
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:34,380
pretty much everywhere it's everywhere

1070
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,639
it's on everything it's a it's on

1071
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:37,619
everything and it's everywhere and it's

1072
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:39,719
never caused an issue uh like I said

1073
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:42,180
there's seven minutes right here yeah

1074
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:43,919
exactly 100 and it's not causing any

1075
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:45,960
health issues and has never been

1076
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,059
documented you know right smoking

1077
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,858
cannabis causing any health issues but

1078
00:36:48,059 --> 00:36:51,119
because this company came in and lobbied

1079
00:36:49,858 --> 00:36:52,980
for the rule to change that because they

1080
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:55,559
had the solution to the problem that

1081
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:57,260
they created basically so

1082
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:59,639
I don't know yeah

1083
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:02,099
no it's just like and that's kind of the

1084
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:04,379
what I've you know up and down and when

1085
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:06,720
Oklahoma went online we're from

1086
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:09,059
originally from Oklahoma so I had uh

1087
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:10,439
friends and family building out and I

1088
00:37:09,059 --> 00:37:12,358
flew back and forth a couple of times

1089
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:14,039
early on in Oklahoma

1090
00:37:12,358 --> 00:37:15,598
and uh

1091
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:16,858
you know that kind of burnt me out again

1092
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,039
and I just kind of stepped back away

1093
00:37:16,858 --> 00:37:22,679
from it and it's just such a a rat race

1094
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:24,239
and like it's a Cutthroat deal in the

1095
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:25,379
commercial I mean I I can't speak on it

1096
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:27,899
as well as you probably know person

1097
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:29,940
personally firsthand but whenever I

1098
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:31,980
first started growing it was like this

1099
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:34,139
super close-knit group of people it was

1100
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:36,719
like a community right yeah it was it

1101
00:37:34,139 --> 00:37:38,400
was very uh hush-hush it was a very

1102
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:40,199
close-knit group of friends and family

1103
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,760
that did this illegal thing together

1104
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:44,460
because you couldn't talk about it and

1105
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,440
post pictures on it and now it's like

1106
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:48,720
the industry right it shifted from the

1107
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,519
community to the industry and now

1108
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:52,319
understandably so because it's a

1109
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:53,820
multi-billion Dollar business yeah

1110
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,380
people aren't friendly to each other on

1111
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:57,960
the commercial side of things and you

1112
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:59,820
know yeah I agree to a degree and I

1113
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,380
think that we need some more of that the

1114
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:03,180
passionate people and you just stick

1115
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:04,619
together and quit trying to bash each

1116
00:38:03,179 --> 00:38:06,659
other and troll each other online it's

1117
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:08,579
silly because we're in this together and

1118
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:11,639
the more of us that are still here doing

1119
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:13,260
it the better as far as like you want to

1120
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:14,460
see quality cannabis don't get rid of

1121
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:16,320
the little guys and

1122
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,280
you know we should all be joining forces

1123
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,140
and not

1124
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,460
separating we should we should get

1125
00:38:19,139 --> 00:38:23,460
together I think that's the big thing

1126
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:25,500
100 and I I'm starting uh trying to

1127
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:27,900
start a non-profit up to hire a lobbyist

1128
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:30,000
on the national level to promote and go

1129
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:32,039
to bat for home Growers because we we

1130
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,559
have nobody and like you said and you go

1131
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:36,599
online and it's it's horrible uh social

1132
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:38,699
media go on and everybody just talks

1133
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:40,800
constantly talking bad about other

1134
00:38:38,699 --> 00:38:42,299
people's grow right and honestly like

1135
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:46,220
the last three four years I haven't seen

1136
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:48,539
a picture of a bad looking Bud online

1137
00:38:46,219 --> 00:38:50,338
now the cameras are so good you see

1138
00:38:48,539 --> 00:38:52,079
every little Mite every little bit of

1139
00:38:50,338 --> 00:38:54,000
powdery mildew all those things if you

1140
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,560
look at pictures you know so like people

1141
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,119
are really aware of it but then you know

1142
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:59,159
we've got filters for all the cameras

1143
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,660
too it seems like yeah yeah but you have

1144
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:02,460
that you have that everybody's bashing

1145
00:39:00,659 --> 00:39:05,159
each other and it's like especially like

1146
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:06,599
it's it's especially absurd in the home

1147
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:08,519
grower like we're not competing against

1148
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:11,160
each other like we should be banding

1149
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:13,440
together to ensure that we have the

1150
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:15,239
rights to continue growing at home in

1151
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,700
the future yeah absolutely I think that

1152
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:21,319
is kind of where my energy and focus is

1153
00:39:17,699 --> 00:39:24,480
going in like now moving forward is to

1154
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:26,400
provide a community instead of an

1155
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,440
industry provide that Community for home

1156
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,660
Growers to come together and and all

1157
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:32,220
band together to fight for our rights as

1158
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:33,719
home Growers and ensure that we're able

1159
00:39:32,219 --> 00:39:36,059
to continue doing that in the future

1160
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:37,319
right ten years ago everybody's like oh

1161
00:39:36,059 --> 00:39:38,699
man that's so awesome you're doing such

1162
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,900
great like kind of see to you know

1163
00:39:38,699 --> 00:39:41,759
sharing information about each other

1164
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:44,460
back and yeah it's just that social

1165
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:47,160
media toxicity where you gotta be better

1166
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:50,720
than everyone or you know right whatever

1167
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:53,279
uh ego you need a stroke to yeah

1168
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:55,500
ego is just yeah the ego needs to go

1169
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,480
with a lot of people and they don't even

1170
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:59,460
know it now that I'm older I recognize

1171
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:01,199
it even more you know in my 20s I had

1172
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:03,420
way bigger of an ego and I thought it

1173
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:05,460
was way cooler than I was realize I'm

1174
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:08,760
not that cool I'm just a dude

1175
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:10,320
but uh I think as you get older as you

1176
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:13,020
start losing friends as you start

1177
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:15,359
experiencing life more I mean I think

1178
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:18,119
that years go by faster for one thing so

1179
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:20,279
as you're alive longer you it's more

1180
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:22,740
relative I talked about data points all

1181
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,940
the time living life is the best way to

1182
00:40:22,739 --> 00:40:25,500
collect data points because you're going

1183
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:27,300
through life and the more data points

1184
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:29,460
you have the more you understand things

1185
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:31,700
in living life and going through life

1186
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:35,159
you really start picking up those

1187
00:40:31,699 --> 00:40:36,779
experiences and seeing what's real and

1188
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:38,279
what's not real what really matters and

1189
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:39,900
what really doesn't matter

1190
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,880
you know are you really passionate about

1191
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:43,680
quality are you really best passionate

1192
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,780
about quantity yeah those kind of things

1193
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:47,279
and without home Growers though there's

1194
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:49,440
not going to be the same level of

1195
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,599
quality because I feel like those guys

1196
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,800
are the passionate ones the you know

1197
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:55,380
they're the majority of the people that

1198
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,760
watch my show too I think and uh you

1199
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:58,740
know super passionate people we get

1200
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:00,599
people that are in the industry too but

1201
00:40:58,739 --> 00:41:05,399
the home Growers like that's something

1202
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:07,320
special it is and it is so just uh

1203
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,838
rejuvenating like uh seeing somebody

1204
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:12,300
grow for the first time legally like

1205
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:15,000
there's there's so like so much joy and

1206
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:16,560
passion coming out and I like said I've

1207
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,260
been doing it for a while and I lose

1208
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:21,299
some of that childlike wonder and I

1209
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:22,560
gotta like it's nice to to see somebody

1210
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:24,599
so excited about it and it kind of

1211
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:25,739
rekindles that fire in me uh that

1212
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:27,059
there's still people out there that are

1213
00:41:25,739 --> 00:41:28,500
doing it for the first time and it's

1214
00:41:27,059 --> 00:41:30,179
like this is all new and they want to

1215
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,679
they want to soak up all the knowledge

1216
00:41:30,179 --> 00:41:32,940
they can and do it as to the best of

1217
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:36,179
their ability and I think that's just

1218
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:39,420
fantastic because you get so cynical and

1219
00:41:36,179 --> 00:41:42,059
I've been I've been cut uh backstabbed a

1220
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:43,980
couple times on deals and you get you

1221
00:41:42,059 --> 00:41:46,500
lose faith in humanity and you just It's

1222
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:48,179
a Grind and you're growing is becomes a

1223
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,960
chore and you got to remember this is

1224
00:41:48,179 --> 00:41:51,118
like

1225
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,460
this is still new for some people and

1226
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:55,079
they're still they're still got that the

1227
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:56,820
passion and fire to get out and oh

1228
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:58,920
that's the best yeah in the beginning

1229
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:00,300
that passion in that drive and it's like

1230
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,619
that's one of the reasons you're on the

1231
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,000
show because I saw the passion you're

1232
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:04,280
like you got the real [ __ ] passion

1233
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,260
for the the plant

1234
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:10,079
and and I appreciate that and I feel

1235
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:11,700
like and it gets uh overlooked a lot of

1236
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:13,859
times but people that have been around

1237
00:42:11,699 --> 00:42:15,179
it a while can can appreciate it I I

1238
00:42:13,858 --> 00:42:17,400
thank you for having me again it's

1239
00:42:15,179 --> 00:42:18,598
awesome yeah I know it's a lot of fun

1240
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,700
and it's like it's all about the

1241
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:22,500
diversity on the show and being able to

1242
00:42:20,699 --> 00:42:23,939
see different perspectives and to be

1243
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:26,239
able to capture all this stuff on film

1244
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:28,980
great stories and you know it's like

1245
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:30,539
you're in the industry at this point but

1246
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:32,760
five or ten years it's going to be great

1247
00:42:30,539 --> 00:42:34,199
to look back and see these conversations

1248
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,119
that we had and see where the industry

1249
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:37,500
ended up because it's definitely not

1250
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:39,240
going to be in the same place the one

1251
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,800
thing for sure is

1252
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:42,358
it's not going to be in the same spot

1253
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,740
you know it's like we evolve and we

1254
00:42:42,358 --> 00:42:45,659
change and no matter what the only thing

1255
00:42:43,739 --> 00:42:48,239
constant really is change definitely

1256
00:42:45,659 --> 00:42:50,699
well yeah it's scary 10 years uh Federal

1257
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:51,838
legalization and it's scary beautiful at

1258
00:42:50,699 --> 00:42:54,000
the same time I don't want to see people

1259
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:55,739
going to prison for cannabis I don't

1260
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,338
think that people belong in prison for

1261
00:42:55,739 --> 00:43:00,838
for a plant no you know and I think that

1262
00:42:59,338 --> 00:43:02,880
we've come a long ways but we still got

1263
00:43:00,838 --> 00:43:04,920
a long ways to go I saw this coming over

1264
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,140
20 years ago I saw legalization

1265
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:08,818
happening in my lifetime I had no idea

1266
00:43:07,139 --> 00:43:10,379
it was going to look like this I had no

1267
00:43:08,818 --> 00:43:12,480
idea I'd be sitting here talking to you

1268
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:14,519
but I knew that it was gonna happen in

1269
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,260
my lifetime and it's still not fully

1270
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:17,519
happen though we're still not all the

1271
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,260
way there we're not at the Finish Line

1272
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:21,599
no no and that's the thing is he's like

1273
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:23,520
gotta remember this is like an industry

1274
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,140
that's in infancy this is just starting

1275
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:26,460
up and there's there's a lot of

1276
00:43:25,139 --> 00:43:29,098
directions that could go at this point

1277
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:31,858
totally we could go back to no

1278
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:33,480
legalization and totally Black Market we

1279
00:43:31,858 --> 00:43:36,059
could you know and then

1280
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,559
everything in between yeah my I just I

1281
00:43:36,059 --> 00:43:40,019
tell people I might I'd like to be able

1282
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:41,818
to sell 15 pounds a year farmers markets

1283
00:43:40,019 --> 00:43:43,380
a couple Zips online here legally

1284
00:43:41,818 --> 00:43:45,838
illegally you know that's where I would

1285
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:48,420
like to see it Go and and be able to

1286
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:49,980
have the farmer's market I agree I would

1287
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:52,200
love the vertical integration model and

1288
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:53,639
the terroir for the guys we I talked

1289
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:55,799
about this on my last podcast too but

1290
00:43:53,639 --> 00:43:57,358
like terroir with the outdoor farmers

1291
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,800
and it's vertically integrated so you go

1292
00:43:57,358 --> 00:44:00,539
to the farm you can smoke the weed that

1293
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,619
they grew there if you go to the right

1294
00:44:00,539 --> 00:44:04,019
part of the year you can watch them

1295
00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:05,220
harvesting the plants definitely a set

1296
00:44:04,019 --> 00:44:07,259
of bed and breakfast everywhere whatever

1297
00:44:05,219 --> 00:44:09,539
they want to do but I feel like going

1298
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:11,640
back to that Boutique model is is great

1299
00:44:09,539 --> 00:44:12,960
too I feel like that's another great

1300
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:14,879
direction that the industry should be

1301
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,519
going in I mean commercial cultivation

1302
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,800
it's great there's nothing wrong with it

1303
00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:21,179
genetics on a scale or on a commercial

1304
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,099
scale there's nothing wrong with that

1305
00:44:21,179 --> 00:44:27,059
but I also like the boutique aspect of

1306
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:28,559
it I'm a big fan of uh micro Brews I

1307
00:44:27,059 --> 00:44:31,440
don't really drink beer anymore as much

1308
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:32,940
but I do like the micro Brewery model

1309
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,920
where there's all these micro breweries

1310
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:37,500
all over Oregon you have for example

1311
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:39,720
like there was more uh microbreweries

1312
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,800
there than anywhere else per capita in

1313
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:42,299
the world and I think I like that

1314
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,039
analogy I think that's something that

1315
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:45,300
people can really relate to wrap their

1316
00:44:44,039 --> 00:44:46,980
heads around you know it's like there's

1317
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:48,720
always going to be the the market for

1318
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:50,159
you know the cheap beer you get a big

1319
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:52,139
case for 10 bucks and then there's going

1320
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:54,118
to be the 500 bottle of scotch and

1321
00:44:52,139 --> 00:44:56,940
there's going to be the the market for

1322
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:58,619
those well and I also look at it from

1323
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:00,240
the perspective of someone that's young

1324
00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:03,119
that becomes very passionate about

1325
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:05,759
smoking weed when they're 14 like I was

1326
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:07,858
being able to acquire a billion dollar

1327
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,660
company or 100 million dollar or even a

1328
00:45:07,858 --> 00:45:11,818
10 million dollar company that's a lot

1329
00:45:09,659 --> 00:45:14,818
further away than being able to open up

1330
00:45:11,818 --> 00:45:17,099
my own custom you know my own dispensary

1331
00:45:14,818 --> 00:45:18,779
or my own shop that's vertically

1332
00:45:17,099 --> 00:45:20,700
integrated where we grow the weed on

1333
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:23,280
site and it's just you know a

1334
00:45:20,699 --> 00:45:24,659
mom-and-pop type business I think those

1335
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,940
are going to keep the passion alive in

1336
00:45:24,659 --> 00:45:29,098
the industry and and it's great to be

1337
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:31,318
able to see that you know because I

1338
00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:33,240
think it that's when the passion for a

1339
00:45:31,318 --> 00:45:36,179
lot of us it started was when we were

1340
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:39,059
young you know for me it was 14 16

1341
00:45:36,179 --> 00:45:40,980
myself yeah yeah High Times magazines

1342
00:45:39,059 --> 00:45:43,259
back then I love I still have my High

1343
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:45,358
Times magazines we couldn't find so

1344
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:47,700
Tahlequah Oklahoma was the town I grew

1345
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:49,679
up in there was one record shop in town

1346
00:45:47,699 --> 00:45:52,259
they didn't have any explicit lyric

1347
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:53,818
albums there you had to have an 18 year

1348
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:56,099
old come into the store and order it for

1349
00:45:53,818 --> 00:45:57,960
you yeah so super conservative religious

1350
00:45:56,099 --> 00:45:59,940
small rural Town Oklahoma we didn't have

1351
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:02,220
high times at the gas station that was

1352
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:04,500
not it was not an option right yeah so

1353
00:46:02,219 --> 00:46:06,598
it was like you go visit your cousin in

1354
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:09,079
Tulsa and they have High Times magazine

1355
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:09,079
it was like

1356
00:46:09,619 --> 00:46:15,119
yeah just seeing it and then uh kind of

1357
00:46:12,539 --> 00:46:17,159
joking around too so uh we had a lot of

1358
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:20,519
you know brick like literal brick weed

1359
00:46:17,159 --> 00:46:21,719
in high school so uh somebody knew

1360
00:46:20,519 --> 00:46:23,818
somebody or had an older brother or

1361
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:26,699
cousin uh they had something that wasn't

1362
00:46:23,818 --> 00:46:28,318
brick weed it was called Dro just

1363
00:46:26,699 --> 00:46:29,939
because we Associated hydroponic with

1364
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:32,400
Hydro it was like that was good weed you

1365
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:34,318
know so find some Dro and I was like 30

1366
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,240
bucks a gram or something you know for a

1367
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:38,759
nug of dro which was fine it was it was

1368
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:40,979
worth it at that time and then that this

1369
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:43,740
that that mentality seeing that bleed

1370
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:45,659
over into the Oklahoma Medical Market I

1371
00:46:43,739 --> 00:46:46,979
talked to a couple of people and tried

1372
00:46:45,659 --> 00:46:49,139
to they they wanted me to come out and

1373
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:50,039
help build out a hydroponic facility and

1374
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:52,739
I was like well I think you should

1375
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:55,318
really consider like soil organic soil

1376
00:46:52,739 --> 00:46:57,059
and they it was because of that Dro you

1377
00:46:55,318 --> 00:46:58,739
know that mentality from 20 years ago

1378
00:46:57,059 --> 00:47:00,358
the dro was good that's what they wanted

1379
00:46:58,739 --> 00:47:02,098
to grow yeah so they built their

1380
00:47:00,358 --> 00:47:03,900
Hydroponics system out and then six

1381
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:05,579
months later two harvests later they

1382
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:07,980
were tear it all out and go on organic

1383
00:47:05,579 --> 00:47:10,619
living soil just because the the demand

1384
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:13,079
for it but kind of the holdovers from

1385
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:15,480
the the before times when it was you

1386
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:17,160
know illegal and the mentality of people

1387
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,960
crossing over into the legal Market it's

1388
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:22,440
like oh it's changed a lot and the thing

1389
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:24,119
is is I think at one point anybody could

1390
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:25,260
grow and make money and now like you

1391
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:27,420
have to have the best quality if you

1392
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:29,579
want to be successful in this industry

1393
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:31,858
now you better strive for Perfection

1394
00:47:29,579 --> 00:47:34,920
because all the big companies they can

1395
00:47:31,858 --> 00:47:38,759
grow middle grade they can grow B plus a

1396
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:41,338
minus maybe even a grade but if you

1397
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:43,680
grow that a plus if you're that one

1398
00:47:41,338 --> 00:47:44,519
percent or better and that applies to

1399
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:46,078
everything in life but I think

1400
00:47:44,519 --> 00:47:48,000
especially with flour and if you want to

1401
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:49,800
be a cultivator you better be a badass

1402
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,480
cultivator it just doesn't it doesn't

1403
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:54,000
you know it doesn't make sense to grow

1404
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:55,440
middle of the road stuff even in some of

1405
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,480
these Emerging Markets you might get

1406
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,460
away with it for a little bit but like

1407
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:01,800
Montana you got skunk VA over in Montana

1408
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:03,179
and that dude's crushing some badass

1409
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,400
flower yeah

1410
00:48:03,179 --> 00:48:07,019
so and you know all over there's people

1411
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,180
all over that are really good

1412
00:48:07,019 --> 00:48:10,380
cultivators and before where it used to

1413
00:48:09,179 --> 00:48:12,299
be you know and the part of the reason

1414
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:16,380
it was illegal

1415
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:19,079
but now with legalization and popularity

1416
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:21,119
and awareness and also we have all these

1417
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:23,640
tools yeah I know like I said you know

1418
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:25,858
15 years ago you could nasty looking

1419
00:48:23,639 --> 00:48:27,900
flower was still going for a few grand a

1420
00:48:25,858 --> 00:48:30,480
unit and then no more it better be

1421
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:32,760
pristine gorgeous check all the boxes

1422
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:35,039
there was outdoor pounds going for a

1423
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:37,020
hundred bucks last year it's 300 bucks

1424
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:39,239
you know it's like and how do you make

1425
00:48:37,019 --> 00:48:41,639
money as an outdoor farmer when you used

1426
00:48:39,239 --> 00:48:43,979
to get a thousand bucks and now you get

1427
00:48:41,639 --> 00:48:45,779
a hundred bucks at best sometimes for

1428
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:47,940
some of these people it's like

1429
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:50,339
times have changed

1430
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:52,139
yeah sometimes for the better sometimes

1431
00:48:50,338 --> 00:48:54,119
for the worse yeah like I said they're

1432
00:48:52,139 --> 00:48:55,980
changing not anything we can do to stop

1433
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:58,559
it just try to anticipate what direction

1434
00:48:55,980 --> 00:49:01,079
it's going and find a find a way to

1435
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:03,119
being able to Pivot you know have enough

1436
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:05,940
sense in to make the right business

1437
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,858
decisions to Pivot when necessary and

1438
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:09,659
know when and which way to go and

1439
00:49:07,858 --> 00:49:11,460
sticking to your roots I think is good

1440
00:49:09,659 --> 00:49:13,440
too though being able to stick to the

1441
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:15,420
roots like what you believe in not not

1442
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,858
straying away from your beliefs yeah I

1443
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:19,079
think and that's that's been huge for me

1444
00:49:16,858 --> 00:49:20,460
as well just like the not trying to to

1445
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:22,980
jump to the next

1446
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:24,659
trendy thing I understand people need to

1447
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:26,039
play that game and have to and they do

1448
00:49:24,659 --> 00:49:28,618
their own thing and no judgment but I

1449
00:49:26,039 --> 00:49:30,420
felt like it was you know even even

1450
00:49:28,619 --> 00:49:32,220
though I had like you know a few hundred

1451
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:33,539
people follow me on the social media and

1452
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:34,858
it was like it didn't matter I was like

1453
00:49:33,539 --> 00:49:37,440
able to communicate with these people

1454
00:49:34,858 --> 00:49:40,559
and talk passionately about uh organic

1455
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:41,940
soil and living soil and how to how to

1456
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:44,818
kind of close the loop on your own

1457
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:47,460
personal Garden right and then you know

1458
00:49:44,818 --> 00:49:49,559
uh very fortunate last couple years I've

1459
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:51,358
kind of met some met the right people

1460
00:49:49,559 --> 00:49:53,299
made the right connections

1461
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:55,739
um invited myself on awesome shows and

1462
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:57,960
you know trying to trying to like I said

1463
00:49:55,739 --> 00:50:02,098
find my find my niche in the emerging

1464
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:04,220
market and got my uh fluoropharm.com and

1465
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:07,200
we're doing the the living soil class

1466
00:50:04,219 --> 00:50:09,838
and I think that's kind of I'm just

1467
00:50:07,199 --> 00:50:12,000
gonna embrace it and lean into that the

1468
00:50:09,838 --> 00:50:13,559
home home grower education and try to

1469
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,659
fight for the home Growers place in the

1470
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:18,119
world yeah that's great

1471
00:50:15,659 --> 00:50:19,259
I think that's awesome and I think you

1472
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:21,240
know passion is going to take you a lot

1473
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:23,400
of places it's just the way it goes and

1474
00:50:21,239 --> 00:50:25,439
everything I mean more passionate people

1475
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:27,119
are about the better products the chefs

1476
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:30,240
that they love food and everything about

1477
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:32,099
food the best chefs definitely so but

1478
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:33,959
yeah it's really interesting the whole

1479
00:50:32,099 --> 00:50:36,000
evolution of cannabis and where it's

1480
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:37,980
going to go and the home Growers and the

1481
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,739
home Growers aren't going to go away

1482
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:42,780
I think uh you know maybe the the guys

1483
00:50:40,739 --> 00:50:44,399
doing it for money are going to go away

1484
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:45,780
to a degree yeah but the people

1485
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,519
passionate about growing stuff in their

1486
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:49,260
house just like people making beer in

1487
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:52,079
their house that that's people still do

1488
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:54,720
that yeah definitely no and it's like uh

1489
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:56,220
there's a lot of conversation about you

1490
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:58,199
know hunger is getting pushed out

1491
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:59,639
because the you know the the bigger

1492
00:50:58,199 --> 00:51:01,019
production facilities don't want that

1493
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:03,960
competition they want to have the market

1494
00:51:01,019 --> 00:51:06,179
it's like well there are a huge amount

1495
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:07,980
of people that aren't able to grow their

1496
00:51:06,179 --> 00:51:09,000
own don't want to grow their own they

1497
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:10,260
just why they want to go to the

1498
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,179
dispensary and pick up it's the vast

1499
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:14,520
majority of them so like if everyone

1500
00:51:12,179 --> 00:51:16,318
that wanted to grow at their home did

1501
00:51:14,519 --> 00:51:17,519
it's not going to take money off the

1502
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:18,480
plate in the long run for these

1503
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:20,400
companies you know so I don't think

1504
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,380
there's a need to there's not to

1505
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,639
demonize the home Growers for any reason

1506
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:26,280
it's not going to make any kind of

1507
00:51:23,639 --> 00:51:28,858
Denton anyone's portfolio

1508
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:30,240
um and I think that it's it's important

1509
00:51:28,858 --> 00:51:33,358
like you said just for the the culture

1510
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:34,739
the the quality and and sharing those

1511
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:37,858
genetics and

1512
00:51:34,739 --> 00:51:39,598
uh the passion yeah is that it's people

1513
00:51:37,858 --> 00:51:41,159
are still passionate in the home growth

1514
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:43,740
situation and they're

1515
00:51:41,159 --> 00:51:45,058
new and exciting and

1516
00:51:43,739 --> 00:51:46,500
trying to learn all the new stuff that

1517
00:51:45,059 --> 00:51:48,180
they haven't been able to do it's cool

1518
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:50,639
too it's like I talked to a gentleman

1519
00:51:48,179 --> 00:51:54,058
last week who the last plant he grew was

1520
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:56,639
you know in the early 90s uh in like

1521
00:51:54,059 --> 00:51:58,800
outdoor in the Ozark Mountains like way

1522
00:51:56,639 --> 00:52:01,379
gorilla so he's like this is

1523
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:04,440
night and day difference like LED lights

1524
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:06,420
indoors with oh LED control your LED

1525
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,679
change the game and I hated LEDs in the

1526
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:09,659
beginning but then once they dialed the

1527
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:12,358
LEDs in their big time Game Changer I

1528
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:14,699
think so I was I was always hid lamps

1529
00:52:12,358 --> 00:52:17,460
I'm two years into the LEDs now working

1530
00:52:14,699 --> 00:52:20,578
with uh Grand Master Level Up in Canada

1531
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:22,920
and yeah I have no complaints there

1532
00:52:20,579 --> 00:52:24,960
uh my only issue with them is I keep

1533
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:27,358
underestimating how intense and Powerful

1534
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,619
the LEDs actually are yeah and yeah so I

1535
00:52:27,358 --> 00:52:31,259
had to kind of dial it back a bit

1536
00:52:28,619 --> 00:52:32,940
parameters yeah just just the learning

1537
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:34,740
curve with something a new technology is

1538
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:35,720
what it was but yields are definitely

1539
00:52:34,739 --> 00:52:38,939
bigger

1540
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:40,919
VPD and led are the two big game

1541
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:43,380
changers I think in the last

1542
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:45,780
12 years that have increased yields

1543
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:47,400
significantly yeah and going back to you

1544
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:49,079
know people that have a bad experience

1545
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,460
right off the bat because they treat it

1546
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:52,680
like something else like I'm saying with

1547
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:54,480
autoflowers it's like you come from HPS

1548
00:52:52,679 --> 00:52:57,179
and you run your room the exact same way

1549
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,559
you did with LEDs the HBS it's like of

1550
00:52:57,179 --> 00:53:00,299
course your results are going to suffer

1551
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:02,700
you're not getting the same weight you

1552
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:03,780
were with your HPS it doesn't mean that

1553
00:53:02,699 --> 00:53:05,399
the lights are bad or that the

1554
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:07,200
technology is bad it doesn't mean you're

1555
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:09,000
a bad grower it means

1556
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:10,919
you need to learn something new and you

1557
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,900
just need to say I don't know I need

1558
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:14,280
help I need to learn somebody there's a

1559
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:15,838
learning curve to stuff that's all there

1560
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:17,940
is to it and people are so proud and and

1561
00:53:15,838 --> 00:53:19,920
I appreciate that especially from a

1562
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:21,420
grower that someone growing on scale

1563
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:23,338
it's like you have to be very

1564
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:25,019
confident in your ability right you

1565
00:53:23,338 --> 00:53:26,519
gotta you gotta feel like you're doing

1566
00:53:25,019 --> 00:53:28,679
the right thing and the the best thing

1567
00:53:26,519 --> 00:53:30,420
but it's also like with that knowledge

1568
00:53:28,679 --> 00:53:32,219
and experience comes the knowledge and

1569
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:33,900
experience to know that you need help

1570
00:53:32,219 --> 00:53:36,838
and there's well you can't have to be

1571
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:39,420
afraid to lose or make mistakes because

1572
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:41,400
that's the best way you can't let your

1573
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:43,800
ego tell you that you're gonna do it

1574
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:45,180
right perfectly every time ego you just

1575
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:47,160
you said it you mentioned it earlier I

1576
00:53:45,179 --> 00:53:48,358
think that's that's a huge thing and if

1577
00:53:47,159 --> 00:53:49,618
you can take the ego out of most

1578
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:51,420
equations you're going to do a lot

1579
00:53:49,619 --> 00:53:53,338
better solve so many problems yeah and

1580
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:56,220
not being afraid to fail in business in

1581
00:53:53,338 --> 00:53:58,679
life in general like take risks and

1582
00:53:56,219 --> 00:54:00,000
believe in yourself and believe that the

1583
00:53:58,679 --> 00:54:02,159
next time you do it even though you

1584
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,099
[ __ ] up you might you might even

1585
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:06,779
completely fail and it's a learning

1586
00:54:05,099 --> 00:54:08,099
experience and you know

1587
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:10,440
it's not a failure if you learn

1588
00:54:08,099 --> 00:54:13,019
something from it yeah right in life you

1589
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:14,940
just really never know what's what and

1590
00:54:13,019 --> 00:54:16,559
what what things mean and if they're

1591
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:17,760
good or bad until

1592
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:19,980
you know until the future until

1593
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:22,980
everything kind of unfolds yeah

1594
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:25,920
hindsight it's always uh

1595
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:26,818
always easier to see how it is from a

1596
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,519
distance

1597
00:54:26,818 --> 00:54:31,019
no cheers thank you cheers so we've been

1598
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:33,239
working on these for about six months

1599
00:54:31,019 --> 00:54:36,539
using different papers

1600
00:54:33,239 --> 00:54:38,818
different tips different flower grinds

1601
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:40,679
like the flour mill got me on the

1602
00:54:38,818 --> 00:54:44,880
different flower gardens like so you

1603
00:54:40,679 --> 00:54:46,858
grind it thick you you know real real uh

1604
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,119
small or you go of course it makes a

1605
00:54:46,858 --> 00:54:51,000
difference and somewhere in the middle

1606
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:52,980
is what I like and then these organic

1607
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,838
tips these are bamboo

1608
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:56,460
um they're they're disposable but I feel

1609
00:54:54,838 --> 00:54:57,960
like they're natural they're pretty good

1610
00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:00,059
and then professional general or the

1611
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:01,260
Instagram big shout out to him he helped

1612
00:55:00,059 --> 00:55:02,640
me with some of these and then I've been

1613
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:05,520
working on them on my own different

1614
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:08,338
papers I like the raw but I also like

1615
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:09,838
rice papers uh you know we're not

1616
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:12,058
releasing these on the market anytime

1617
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:14,578
soon but it is something that's going to

1618
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:17,280
be for sampling when we do our selection

1619
00:55:14,579 --> 00:55:18,599
process every time we get bags of these

1620
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,099
and I prefer

1621
00:55:18,599 --> 00:55:21,359
I know what the plant looks like I know

1622
00:55:20,099 --> 00:55:22,559
what the plant smells like but what does

1623
00:55:21,358 --> 00:55:24,659
it taste like to you is this something

1624
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:25,920
you want to taste or is this something

1625
00:55:24,659 --> 00:55:28,440
you don't like and it's really

1626
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,539
interesting doing the blind selection

1627
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:32,099
process or the Fino hunting blind where

1628
00:55:30,539 --> 00:55:34,500
it's like smoke this smoke this smoke

1629
00:55:32,099 --> 00:55:36,000
this give me some feedback yeah it's so

1630
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:38,039
it's so subjective like you're saying

1631
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,599
it's like you probably every person that

1632
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:41,039
samples it has a different opinion or a

1633
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:42,539
different experience they do and some

1634
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:43,920
people like the effect really and I

1635
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:45,480
don't think a lot of people realize like

1636
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,920
they like the effect or the taste or

1637
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:49,019
whatever they most people are just like

1638
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:50,818
I like this or I don't like that but

1639
00:55:49,019 --> 00:55:53,400
what I like about this size is it

1640
00:55:50,818 --> 00:55:55,800
doesn't burn too hot is 3.5 grams in

1641
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:57,660
here by the way so it's a big joint but

1642
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:59,039
it doesn't burn too hot when it's rolled

1643
00:55:57,659 --> 00:56:01,019
this thick I tried

1644
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:02,099
The Wider ones and those just burn a

1645
00:56:01,019 --> 00:56:03,900
little bit too hot you don't get the

1646
00:56:02,099 --> 00:56:05,280
full Terps but if you can provide

1647
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:07,019
somebody with this then they get the

1648
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,760
best experience possible

1649
00:56:07,019 --> 00:56:10,139
and really at the end of the day I want

1650
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:12,359
people to have the same experience that

1651
00:56:10,139 --> 00:56:15,179
I have so being able to share my flower

1652
00:56:12,358 --> 00:56:16,619
or stuff I'm working on with them I want

1653
00:56:15,179 --> 00:56:18,058
them to have the same experience so they

1654
00:56:16,619 --> 00:56:19,740
can judge it kind of the same way I

1655
00:56:18,059 --> 00:56:21,119
would and then people that are

1656
00:56:19,739 --> 00:56:22,558
connoisseurs out there that already roll

1657
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:26,280
joints when they roll it they're like oh

1658
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:28,680
[ __ ] that's a good one nice so yeah

1659
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:30,599
yeah well done it's a fine looking

1660
00:56:28,679 --> 00:56:33,239
specimen there yeah they burn pretty

1661
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:34,980
even uh you know you get some good stuff

1662
00:56:33,239 --> 00:56:35,879
with white ash and the oil ring around

1663
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:37,380
it

1664
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:39,960
you're looking good but what what

1665
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:41,818
flowers this do you know yeah so this is

1666
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:44,940
the zerio's

1667
00:56:41,818 --> 00:56:48,139
Skittles uh zerbert it's nice I like it

1668
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:50,519
yeah yeah candy Terps and we got some

1669
00:56:48,139 --> 00:56:52,139
skittles-s ones and so I did a lot of

1670
00:56:50,519 --> 00:56:54,300
stuff with Skittles because I really

1671
00:56:52,139 --> 00:56:56,338
like the candy Terps yeah and it's

1672
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:58,500
interesting seeing what it gets passed

1673
00:56:56,338 --> 00:57:01,858
on to like in other things structure

1674
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:03,480
wise and the structures heavily tied to

1675
00:57:01,858 --> 00:57:05,039
the flavor profile

1676
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:06,420
so if you want the stuff that's real

1677
00:57:05,039 --> 00:57:07,980
skiddly and you cross it to something

1678
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:09,480
that's very different

1679
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:11,760
the ones that are going to taste real

1680
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:13,920
skiddly are the ones that are going to

1681
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:16,980
be the most similar to the structure

1682
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:18,599
nice so that do you start making calls

1683
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:19,679
early on based on that structure then if

1684
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:22,079
you're if you're just looking for that

1685
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:24,299
candy no because I every once in a while

1686
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:27,119
you get like some crazy like I don't I

1687
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:28,619
don't pull I'm not pulling stuff that

1688
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:30,119
smells amazing like if it smells like

1689
00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:32,160
Skittles and it grows like [ __ ] I'm

1690
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:33,420
still gonna grow it out because Skittles

1691
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:35,338
looks like [ __ ] pretty much when you

1692
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:36,960
harvest it small like it's not the

1693
00:57:35,338 --> 00:57:38,460
nicest looking it's the most finicky

1694
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,900
plant it looks good in the bag or

1695
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:42,240
whatever but like

1696
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:44,099
I think that it's also very difficult to

1697
00:57:42,239 --> 00:57:45,598
grow and so like it might take you a

1698
00:57:44,099 --> 00:57:47,039
couple rounds to actually grow it

1699
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:48,359
properly so even if you're popping seeds

1700
00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:50,818
you should probably grow it out multiple

1701
00:57:48,358 --> 00:57:52,980
times if not for the sexual maturity

1702
00:57:50,818 --> 00:57:54,480
Factor just for the fact that you might

1703
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:56,760
have to learn how to grow

1704
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:58,920
those specific plants definitely you

1705
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:00,240
know better so and then same thing with

1706
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:01,920
pheno hunts when we're going through the

1707
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:03,299
first time we might have a different one

1708
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:05,760
the second time that we think is the

1709
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:07,559
best and the third time typically by the

1710
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:09,180
third time we we understand it and we we

1711
00:58:07,559 --> 00:58:11,579
have our selection and we're like that's

1712
00:58:09,179 --> 00:58:12,838
the one nice or those are the three that

1713
00:58:11,579 --> 00:58:15,000
we really like the best and we keep

1714
00:58:12,838 --> 00:58:17,460
those around you know out of

1715
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:20,039
however many seeds were popping

1716
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:22,699
and that's that's one thing it's like I

1717
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:25,199
have very rarely run something

1718
00:58:22,699 --> 00:58:27,419
consecutively or multiple times or

1719
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:29,338
enough to become intimately familiar

1720
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:30,420
with it uh like I said he likes the

1721
00:58:29,338 --> 00:58:32,219
difference of the gross back in the day

1722
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:35,159
we all used to grow the same thing over

1723
00:58:32,219 --> 00:58:37,798
and over and over and over 10 10 runs 20

1724
00:58:35,159 --> 00:58:39,659
runs and might only grow two cultivars

1725
00:58:37,798 --> 00:58:41,280
yeah but like what you do is you'll grow

1726
00:58:39,659 --> 00:58:43,558
the same thing for just a couple runs

1727
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:45,420
and switch it up yeah yeah and like I

1728
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:48,599
said I'd like to uh been primarily

1729
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:50,460
growing from seed the last few years and

1730
00:58:48,599 --> 00:58:51,838
I just you know new seeds every round

1731
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:53,539
you know starting something new every

1732
00:58:51,838 --> 00:58:56,519
two months or so and then

1733
00:58:53,539 --> 00:58:58,259
that's kind of I forgot I was talking to

1734
00:58:56,519 --> 00:58:59,880
you it's like do you call the early ones

1735
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:02,400
and that's like something that kind of

1736
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:04,920
uh we're forced to do as home Growers is

1737
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:06,900
like I can't run a thousand plants and

1738
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:08,880
keep a hundred keep a thousand cuttings

1739
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:10,798
back to you know hold on to to make make

1740
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:13,019
those selections after the flower has

1741
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:14,940
been processed and smoked uh so I gotta

1742
00:59:13,019 --> 00:59:17,400
like start making some decisions early

1743
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:20,179
on and and you know am I throwing away

1744
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:22,980
some potential Keepers sure

1745
00:59:20,179 --> 00:59:24,838
do I have the option no I'm you know I

1746
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:26,699
got a small small little basement grow

1747
00:59:24,838 --> 00:59:28,798
and a lot of people are confined

1748
00:59:26,699 --> 00:59:30,598
confined to the you know plant count you

1749
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:32,639
know you get four or six plant count and

1750
00:59:30,599 --> 00:59:34,260
uh first and foremost I select for the

1751
00:59:32,639 --> 00:59:37,139
nose typically when I'm going through

1752
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:39,119
the rooms no even the shitty structure

1753
00:59:37,139 --> 00:59:41,159
you know my partner Jason Hutto up in

1754
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:43,500
Seattle we've done a lot of funeral

1755
00:59:41,159 --> 00:59:45,960
hunting or selections together he he

1756
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:49,798
definitely has an eye for the way the

1757
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:52,019
plant grows as opposed to yeah the nose

1758
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:53,818
first and then but me I'm all about the

1759
00:59:52,019 --> 00:59:55,619
nose first and sometimes I'll get and I

1760
00:59:53,818 --> 00:59:57,358
can be off I could be wrong I've been

1761
00:59:55,619 --> 00:59:59,338
wrong before and and that's another

1762
00:59:57,358 --> 01:00:01,920
thing like translating into

1763
00:59:59,338 --> 01:00:05,099
from the smell on the plant to the smoke

1764
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:07,139
in the joint so one thing smells amazing

1765
01:00:05,099 --> 01:00:10,019
and the other thing might the the other

1766
01:00:07,139 --> 01:00:11,940
plant might not smell as strong but then

1767
01:00:10,019 --> 01:00:13,500
when you go to smoke it it's like whoo

1768
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:14,639
that's the one it tastes totally

1769
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:16,920
different than it's totally different

1770
01:00:14,639 --> 01:00:18,539
than or it just tastes louder where

1771
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:19,980
sometimes they smell really good and

1772
01:00:18,539 --> 01:00:21,019
then it just doesn't translate into the

1773
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:23,519
smoke

1774
01:00:21,019 --> 01:00:25,440
so yeah that's always disappointing I

1775
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:27,480
hate that I think you got the one the

1776
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:29,519
winner and it just smells like I would

1777
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:32,099
say that the majority of stuff in the

1778
01:00:29,519 --> 01:00:33,780
dispensaries does that for me I go to

1779
01:00:32,099 --> 01:00:36,000
look at it or you see the samples like

1780
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:37,440
even in Oregon some of the stuff that I

1781
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,960
checked out it's like

1782
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:41,220
[ __ ] it looks pretty [ __ ] good and

1783
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:42,720
you smell it it's like it smells pretty

1784
01:00:41,219 --> 01:00:44,459
good but then you smoke it and it's like

1785
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:46,318
oh like

1786
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:48,420
not necessarily cardboard chips all the

1787
01:00:46,318 --> 01:00:50,818
time but like lack of yeah lack of

1788
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:52,680
flavor or the initial it tastes good and

1789
01:00:50,818 --> 01:00:55,798
then as you're burning it down you kind

1790
01:00:52,679 --> 01:00:57,960
of lose that yeah no I I agree and I

1791
01:00:55,798 --> 01:00:59,338
think that's kind of like a you know

1792
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:01,920
byproduct of the commercialization

1793
01:00:59,338 --> 01:01:03,539
people are selecting for bag appeal or

1794
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:05,579
high numbers and that's unfortunately

1795
01:01:03,539 --> 01:01:08,159
like so many people the nose is like the

1796
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:10,798
last thing selected for when it's a lot

1797
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:13,199
harder to select for the flavor than it

1798
01:01:10,798 --> 01:01:15,298
is for the look right oh look it's very

1799
01:01:13,199 --> 01:01:16,199
obvious and then the flavor and all

1800
01:01:15,298 --> 01:01:18,179
those things are still somewhat

1801
01:01:16,199 --> 01:01:19,558
subjective right where the look it's

1802
01:01:18,179 --> 01:01:21,659
like if it's frosted that's the one

1803
01:01:19,559 --> 01:01:25,140
that's it I want the Oreos yeah no it's

1804
01:01:21,659 --> 01:01:26,519
the Oreos looks freaking amazing it's

1805
01:01:25,139 --> 01:01:28,440
absolutely amazing but as far as the

1806
01:01:26,519 --> 01:01:30,900
smoke it's my least favorite thing

1807
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:32,400
pretty much to smoke

1808
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:35,220
um I'd rather have the worst Autoflower

1809
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:37,858
typically yeah but but no honestly the

1810
01:01:35,219 --> 01:01:39,358
Oreos is like all these things you know

1811
01:01:37,858 --> 01:01:42,298
because I I don't I'm not a huge fan of

1812
01:01:39,358 --> 01:01:44,818
apple fritter Oreos purple punch but

1813
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:48,900
they're all one step away from being

1814
01:01:44,818 --> 01:01:50,219
good yeah in one generation or one cross

1815
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:51,298
you know it's like you could find

1816
01:01:50,219 --> 01:01:52,679
something good in there there's

1817
01:01:51,298 --> 01:01:54,298
definitely good genetics in there

1818
01:01:52,679 --> 01:01:57,179
there's definitely

1819
01:01:54,298 --> 01:01:59,519
things that desirable traits that can be

1820
01:01:57,179 --> 01:02:00,779
passed on so when's the next cup that

1821
01:01:59,519 --> 01:02:03,659
you're going to do

1822
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:06,000
uh I missed the a bunch of stuff going

1823
01:02:03,659 --> 01:02:08,219
on this summer as far but the the class

1824
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,079
together with Dr zymes I've got a couple

1825
01:02:08,219 --> 01:02:11,879
of other projects going and kind of

1826
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:15,780
dropped the ball on the uh the Oregon

1827
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:17,460
Growers Cup this year so uh next year

1828
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:19,140
like probably a few months off but

1829
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:21,780
they're probably hit a couple of next

1830
01:02:19,139 --> 01:02:23,159
year nice yeah yeah got some interesting

1831
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:24,540
genetics for you to check out it might

1832
01:02:23,159 --> 01:02:27,000
be a little super excited a little care

1833
01:02:24,539 --> 01:02:28,739
package of stuff to try out and

1834
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:31,019
so I think there'll be some winners in

1835
01:02:28,739 --> 01:02:32,759
there I got some unique yeah I try to

1836
01:02:31,019 --> 01:02:34,679
breed for Unique stuff with auto flowers

1837
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:36,119
yet you want the least amount of

1838
01:02:34,679 --> 01:02:37,500
phenotypical variation for what I'm

1839
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:38,338
doing if you're trying to grow a row

1840
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:40,079
crop

1841
01:02:38,338 --> 01:02:41,338
you definitely want something that comes

1842
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:42,539
out pretty even across the board

1843
01:02:41,338 --> 01:02:44,578
definitely

1844
01:02:42,539 --> 01:02:45,838
so yeah that's kind of like that's what

1845
01:02:44,579 --> 01:02:48,839
I was saying earlier I think that's kind

1846
01:02:45,838 --> 01:02:50,880
of one of the the applications I see in

1847
01:02:48,838 --> 01:02:52,679
the near future for autoflowers it's

1848
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:54,298
like you see so you still see them you

1849
01:02:52,679 --> 01:02:57,179
see it popping up now and again but you

1850
01:02:54,298 --> 01:02:59,159
know 100 acres of row crop oh yeah it's

1851
01:02:57,179 --> 01:03:01,558
almost hands down it's the obvious

1852
01:02:59,159 --> 01:03:04,199
choice if you're going 100 200 300 acres

1853
01:03:01,559 --> 01:03:06,119
for extract it's just because they're so

1854
01:03:04,199 --> 01:03:08,879
consistent they're so predictable as

1855
01:03:06,119 --> 01:03:11,338
opposed to photo period and you got you

1856
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:13,380
know Greenhouse is okay but Autoflower

1857
01:03:11,338 --> 01:03:15,058
you know is very easy

1858
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:16,200
and it's grown like a row crop you grow

1859
01:03:15,059 --> 01:03:17,819
like a tomato

1860
01:03:16,199 --> 01:03:19,379
and you can pull a couple of harvests

1861
01:03:17,818 --> 01:03:22,079
without any infrastructure some places

1862
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:24,660
like three harvesting you're maybe maybe

1863
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:26,760
even four in some places but typically

1864
01:03:24,659 --> 01:03:29,098
like to be able to you know and the

1865
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:31,200
yields are really incredible too so at

1866
01:03:29,099 --> 01:03:33,599
scale if you're talking about 1500

1867
01:03:31,199 --> 01:03:36,298
pounds is normal but some people just

1868
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:38,220
crush it yeah it's not bad and like no

1869
01:03:36,298 --> 01:03:39,780
infrastructure for pulling tarp to light

1870
01:03:38,219 --> 01:03:41,039
depth too you know but even three

1871
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:42,960
thousand pounds let's say you got three

1872
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:45,719
thousand pounds you can do three pulls

1873
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:47,940
up to 9 000 pounds out of an acre

1874
01:03:45,719 --> 01:03:49,318
that's pretty good you can't do that

1875
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:52,200
with photo period

1876
01:03:49,318 --> 01:03:54,058
not really no no I've never seen it not

1877
01:03:52,199 --> 01:03:55,439
three yeah especially not not because

1878
01:03:54,059 --> 01:03:56,400
you're getting three three bumps a year

1879
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:58,679
like that

1880
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:00,900
yeah [ __ ] baked

1881
01:03:58,679 --> 01:04:03,179
yeah so these Doogie lit but I feel like

1882
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:05,579
this has a ceiling so as far as like we

1883
01:04:03,179 --> 01:04:07,739
talk about the effect

1884
01:04:05,579 --> 01:04:10,140
um I like effective this because it's

1885
01:04:07,739 --> 01:04:11,759
not like overly powerful in the sense

1886
01:04:10,139 --> 01:04:14,879
that I can smoke a big [ __ ] joint of

1887
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:16,940
it feel pretty good and it has a ceiling

1888
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:21,000
whereas like you smoke some of these

1889
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:22,500
equatorial land races or equatorial

1890
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,480
crosses even

1891
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:25,739
you know any of the sativa stuff these

1892
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:27,298
hazes where they don't have a ceiling

1893
01:04:25,739 --> 01:04:29,639
you just keep smoking you get more high

1894
01:04:27,298 --> 01:04:30,838
and more high and sometimes you get more

1895
01:04:29,639 --> 01:04:32,519
height and then it creeps up when you

1896
01:04:30,838 --> 01:04:35,279
get even more high after that yeah yeah

1897
01:04:32,519 --> 01:04:38,579
I just uh had a bad experience with some

1898
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:40,619
some hash last week the too much too

1899
01:04:38,579 --> 01:04:41,760
panicky kept going then didn't stop like

1900
01:04:40,619 --> 01:04:43,260
he said there was no ceiling it just

1901
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:47,700
kept getting more and more like a dab

1902
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:49,200
yeah just uh just hash I I did dab there

1903
01:04:47,699 --> 01:04:50,639
for a little while and I just man I

1904
01:04:49,199 --> 01:04:53,219
don't know I don't it just doesn't do it

1905
01:04:50,639 --> 01:04:56,879
for me you know I I like flour I like

1906
01:04:53,219 --> 01:05:00,539
good rosin dabs some good living

1907
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:02,579
like the live live resin oh for sure I

1908
01:05:00,539 --> 01:05:04,619
just love the I like Flavor I chase

1909
01:05:02,579 --> 01:05:07,140
flavor I'm constantly looking for

1910
01:05:04,619 --> 01:05:08,760
something new flavor-wise no I do that's

1911
01:05:07,139 --> 01:05:11,159
my favorite thing is I guess it's got a

1912
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:13,200
little two inch uh plate press uh but to

1913
01:05:11,159 --> 01:05:14,759
do to press flour and then do the rosin

1914
01:05:13,199 --> 01:05:17,939
and then just like drizzle it on a bowl

1915
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:19,859
you know the same flour on it same idea

1916
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:22,260
rest on a bowl yeah so that's my that's

1917
01:05:19,858 --> 01:05:24,119
my go-to for sure right yeah there's

1918
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:26,339
something special about rosin

1919
01:05:24,119 --> 01:05:29,700
I like rosin I like the effects from it

1920
01:05:26,338 --> 01:05:33,078
too oh one more thing what about soil

1921
01:05:29,699 --> 01:05:35,279
outdoor versus living soil and or

1922
01:05:33,079 --> 01:05:37,400
what's what's your opinion there that's

1923
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:40,079
a loaded question so it is

1924
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:41,700
the sun is special right you know uh

1925
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:43,619
indoor lighting has come a long way it's

1926
01:05:41,699 --> 01:05:45,779
great that you get I think I'm hooked up

1927
01:05:43,619 --> 01:05:48,900
with best company out there uh personal

1928
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:51,240
experience anyway they it's the sun's

1929
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:53,220
the sun you know and then you could take

1930
01:05:51,239 --> 01:05:54,838
plant you know cuttings from the same

1931
01:05:53,219 --> 01:05:56,399
plant plant them on opposite sides of

1932
01:05:54,838 --> 01:05:58,139
your property and have two different

1933
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:00,240
expressions in those plants just because

1934
01:05:58,139 --> 01:06:02,578
of the soil chemistry in those two

1935
01:06:00,239 --> 01:06:05,399
different locations yeah so I think that

1936
01:06:02,579 --> 01:06:07,680
outside in the earth in Under the Sun is

1937
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:09,180
is very special right yeah if if you're

1938
01:06:07,679 --> 01:06:12,118
able to do that I think you should take

1939
01:06:09,179 --> 01:06:15,598
advantage of it and I I I pretty much

1940
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:17,280
committed to indoors uh uh because I

1941
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:19,318
can't get stuff to finish if I pull tarp

1942
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:21,720
or an Autoflower finish outside but full

1943
01:06:19,318 --> 01:06:23,099
term photos on the coast oh you saw how

1944
01:06:21,719 --> 01:06:25,019
cool it gets at night there in Lincoln

1945
01:06:23,099 --> 01:06:27,119
City it's like this time of year it's

1946
01:06:25,019 --> 01:06:29,338
down into the 40s and like 80 humidity

1947
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:32,640
already so it's tough to get something

1948
01:06:29,338 --> 01:06:34,500
to finish Outdoors uh but I do I have a

1949
01:06:32,639 --> 01:06:37,379
few plants outside because it they're

1950
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:39,659
special it's it's nice I love outdoor

1951
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:42,240
plants in the Earth for sure they just

1952
01:06:39,659 --> 01:06:44,639
grow different and if you if you have

1953
01:06:42,239 --> 01:06:47,159
some place that you can really uh put

1954
01:06:44,639 --> 01:06:49,379
some some energy into the soil you can

1955
01:06:47,159 --> 01:06:51,779
do some some awesome stuff yeah in the

1956
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:53,940
Earth yeah totally yeah I mean huge fan

1957
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:55,680
of mixed light too yeah yep yeah

1958
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:57,960
supplemental Lighting in a greenhouse I

1959
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:59,759
think you get a little bit of sun Best

1960
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:01,260
of Both Worlds Best of Both Worlds the

1961
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:03,240
future cannabis I think a lot of the

1962
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:06,359
stuff is top shelf you can go really top

1963
01:07:03,239 --> 01:07:07,739
shelf amazing sticky Bud yep you can do

1964
01:07:06,358 --> 01:07:09,239
that on every level though in all

1965
01:07:07,739 --> 01:07:10,798
reality I mean I think they're sticky

1966
01:07:09,239 --> 01:07:13,439
Bud that can be grown in

1967
01:07:10,798 --> 01:07:16,318
with every substrate for sure yeah yeah

1968
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:19,318
like I said though it's uh Law changes

1969
01:07:16,318 --> 01:07:21,779
and emissions and the energy stuff

1970
01:07:19,318 --> 01:07:24,538
coming down to the pipeline like uh

1971
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:26,160
mixed mixed lighting may be a realistic

1972
01:07:24,539 --> 01:07:28,140
thing in the near future as far as like

1973
01:07:26,159 --> 01:07:30,480
indoor commercial production especially

1974
01:07:28,139 --> 01:07:32,098
in the cities and pushing the CO2

1975
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:34,019
emissions and I just read some

1976
01:07:32,099 --> 01:07:35,818
ridiculous uh that was one of the

1977
01:07:34,019 --> 01:07:38,579
arguments against home Growers is the

1978
01:07:35,818 --> 01:07:42,019
the CO2 the extra CO2 emissions you know

1979
01:07:38,579 --> 01:07:46,680
of course and it was like oh like

1980
01:07:42,019 --> 01:07:49,500
138 pounds of CO2 to grow a pound of

1981
01:07:46,679 --> 01:07:51,480
flour dried flour produced like 138

1982
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:52,920
pounds of CO2 for well I don't know what

1983
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:55,019
average they used or anything but then

1984
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:57,240
like on the same the opposite side of

1985
01:07:55,019 --> 01:07:59,519
that same coin it's like an hour of a

1986
01:07:57,239 --> 01:08:01,199
private jet creates two tons of CO2

1987
01:07:59,519 --> 01:08:02,818
right and nobody's trying to stop those

1988
01:08:01,199 --> 01:08:05,460
but it's the home grower with the little

1989
01:08:02,818 --> 01:08:07,139
you know 200 watt light that we is like

1990
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:09,780
the criminal and destroying the

1991
01:08:07,139 --> 01:08:11,338
environment which is you know yeah I

1992
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:13,500
mean there's so many people that try to

1993
01:08:11,338 --> 01:08:15,119
manipulate data it's just ridiculous all

1994
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:17,698
over and everything everything yeah yeah

1995
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:19,679
so have you experienced cannabis any in

1996
01:08:17,698 --> 01:08:22,439
any other parts of the world or pretty

1997
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:24,000
much just the U.S Mexico I've been able

1998
01:08:22,439 --> 01:08:25,858
to go to Europe that's definitely on the

1999
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,079
on the list I'd love to go to Europe and

2000
01:08:25,859 --> 01:08:30,060
and have some traditional hash and go to

2001
01:08:28,079 --> 01:08:30,960
the you gotta go for Spanish yeah now

2002

2006
01:08:36,659 --> 01:08:41,219
an amazing place the culture there is

2007

what they're up to and talking about the

2023
01:09:12,838 --> 01:09:16,500
genetics and because genetics are kind

2024
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:17,939
of popping different all over I mean I

2025
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:22,279
think gelato is pretty much everywhere

2026
01:09:17,939 --> 01:09:22,278

great food in Spain is amazing the food

2041
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:54,179
in Europe in general is really good but

2042
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:56,760
especially Spain yeah it's definitely a

2043
01:09:54,179 --> 01:09:59,960
start a start there somewhere and train

2044
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:59,960
around for a few weeks

2045
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:03,238
on the internet you have a website you

2046
01:10:01,979 --> 01:10:05,399
have an Instagram tell us a little bit

2047
01:10:03,238 --> 01:10:07,619
about it yeah so fluorofarm.com is

2048
01:10:05,399 --> 01:10:09,420
coming up that's where my uh online my

2049
01:10:07,619 --> 01:10:11,880
living soil master class is all going to

2050
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:14,760
be funneled through there on my

2051
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:16,679
Instagram florofarm same same handle all

2052
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:19,320
across all the socials and my YouTube

2053
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:20,579
channel as well so trying to spend a

2054
01:10:19,319 --> 01:10:22,738
little more energy

2055
01:10:20,579 --> 01:10:24,779
um on the YouTube producing some media

2056
01:10:22,738 --> 01:10:26,698
content for this for the for the class

2057
01:10:24,779 --> 01:10:28,979
and YouTube as well so

2058
01:10:26,698 --> 01:10:30,419
I'll be more involved there than

2059
01:10:28,979 --> 01:10:32,698
Instagram I think it's just so

2060
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:34,440
frustrating like censored constantly and

2061
01:10:32,698 --> 01:10:36,960
post removed and playing that social

2062
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:38,819
media nonsense so I'm kind of kind of

2063
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:40,980
burnt out on that end and try to focus

2064
01:10:38,819 --> 01:10:43,259
more on my my website and the YouTube

2065
01:10:40,979 --> 01:10:44,939
side of things yeah yeah we've really

2066
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:47,699
been focused on the YouTube I mean

2067
01:10:44,939 --> 01:10:49,559
Instagram is still Instagram but we've

2068
01:10:47,698 --> 01:10:50,819
you know I really like YouTube doing the

2069
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:52,860
videos and I think that's been a lot of

2070
01:10:50,819 --> 01:10:54,479
fun and I got a great team we got a
