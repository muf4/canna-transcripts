from Heritage hash company gave me some

71
00:02:46,378 --> 00:02:51,359
of the Orange turbo and I've been saving

72
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,980
it so we could try it together ah man I

73
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,200
can't wait I've of course tried it a

74
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:57,719
couple times but

75
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,339
I've heard about it though yeah so this

76
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:02,959
is the hash I got from Belle when I went

77
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:05,219
on to uh the tour with Mila at Heritage

78
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,680
and uh this is some of Frenchy's

79
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:09,959
favorite uh this is his favorite

80
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,120
genetics the Orange turbo which I think

81
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:13,800
is awesome and we're gonna smoke it

82
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,560
yeah I've always heard about the orange

83
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:19,560
too but never had a chance to really

84
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,560
taste it and all the flavors in it

85
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,939
but I think it's going to be nice cause

86
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,939
you know

87
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:29,280
turbo Orange turbo that says it all yeah

88
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:32,039
all right what do you think about those

89
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,919
rigs I really like mine I I really like

90
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:37,079
it I like the control and I I like lower

91
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:39,598
temp yeah and I like smaller depth so

92
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,519
this is perfect for me yeah and uh

93
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:44,598
especially when you could regulate you

94
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,599
know the Heat and right

95
00:03:57,658 --> 00:04:04,500
really nice flavor

96
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:08,158
it's nice yeah man oh

97
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:10,680
citrusy turbo yeah a little terrible way

98
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:12,719
there for sure little citrusy turbine I

99
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,099
like the Citrus in it I could smell the

100
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,719
Citrus in there it's really cool it's

101
00:04:14,098 --> 00:04:17,339
nice

102
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:21,418
oh I like that temperature what

103
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:25,379
temperature is that on 420 429 no 365.

104
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:27,839
oh wow I do like 420 but 365 for that

105
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:29,879
390 anywhere in there I think is great

106
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:32,819
but 365 for that low temp yeah yeah

107
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:34,800
that's like a really low temp dab

108
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:36,719
tastes good though

109
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,280
yeah so uh

110
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,139

00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:27,660
sightseeing

249
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:30,080
anybody that thinks the music industry

250
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:30,079
is easy

251
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:35,220
I just saw Adam saying oh you know what

252
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,500
I don't like to be a DJ because

253
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:40,560
everybody think being a DJ is so easy

254
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:43,620
yeah well it's kind of the same thing

255
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:46,078
for being an Entertainer everyone sees

256
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:49,560
the glamor and glitter on the stage but

257
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:52,039
man there's a lot behind that that makes

258
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:56,219
that movement special yeah yeah

259
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:58,199
sometimes for years years and Amanda I

260
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:01,500
know traveling takes away

261
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:03,420
from your you know your being you know

262
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:07,078

you know for me being a musician is I

268
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,039

331
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:51,059
think it's solid it's a solid piece

332
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,240
yeah my Minds is very

333
00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:56,278
convenient to cause

334
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,560
you know sometimes you want to smoke and

335
00:13:56,278 --> 00:14:01,320
you can't blow clouds in certain places

336
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:03,179
you know for sure this is have you tried

337
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,860
on the airplane yet oh no yeah I'm just

338
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:06,958
kidding

339
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:10,039
why are we going to Jamaica we probably

340
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:10,039
try that nice

341
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:15,299
yeah I think these are efficient the I

342
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,680
mean I think I read some of the comments

343
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:19,019
online about the battery not being very

344
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:21,000
good my battery seems to be just fine I

345
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:23,399
haven't had problems with it too much

346
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,799
how's that taste oh that is phenomenal I

347
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:28,500
like the lemon flavor in it lemon juice

348
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:30,838
it's like so it's sour cherries and it's

349
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,820
definitely got that cherry kind of like

350
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:35,519
citrusy cherry

351
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:37,740
smooth I like I like the way they get

352
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:42,560
the Terps in when they it's live resin

353
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:42,560
you know it really hits the spot

354
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,440
yeah I feel like this is just so smooth

355
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:48,659
too Lemon Cherry

356
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:51,480
I like

357
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:52,799
taking dabs or hitting pens I have a

358
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,959
rosin cart

359
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:57,359
before I go to the gym I take one good

360
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:58,078
hit yeah yeah keeps me focused I feel

361
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,120
like

362
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:00,778
I prefer doing dabs typically in the

363
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,519
morning

364
00:15:00,778 --> 00:15:04,500
but these aren't even like real dabs

365
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:07,078
like not like we used to do or no we're

366
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:09,799
heating up some some yeah nail and then

367
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:09,799
some crazy nails

368
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:14,039
yeah and then people looking at us funny

369
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,919
like we're doing something wrong yeah

370
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:19,740
man it's it's nice where it's it's at

371
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:21,120
now though yeah I could dab in my car I

372
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,440
feel like the extracts are good yeah you

373
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,820
can dab it yeah this fits in your cup

374

376
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:34,078
like everything about it it's cool I

377
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:36,419

00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:21,599
more genetics too in the near future oh

421
00:17:18,298 --> 00:17:24,418
yeah so right now we're trying to get

422

some Blends together and make you know

423
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:29,940
grow out some stuff and make sure that

424

we have the right you know we we put out

425
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:35,160

seats here now has some of the stuff and

434
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:55,859
we'll be uh launching some new gear

435
00:17:53,099 --> 00:17:57,659
really soon yep definitely that's

436
00:17:55,859 --> 00:18:00,178
something you guys can look out for is

438
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:03,298
good one yeah of course let me tell you

439
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,720
this it changed the mood and the high

440
00:18:03,298 --> 00:18:09,980
that I was feeling before so that is

441
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,980
definitely a nice one

442
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:14,819
so yeah we got some

443
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:18,240
BP Times Wilson that was given to me by

444
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:21,538
uh Sam at one of the events they had

445
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,819
BP Plus from rosin Tech yeah BP I'm not

446
00:18:21,538 --> 00:18:25,740
sure if that's blue Power

447
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:28,259
there could be any number of genetics

448
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:31,279
I'm not 100 sure

449
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:31,279
smells really good

450
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:37,940
yeah and that cream tape too

451
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,538
it smells good I give the last one a 10

452
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,220
on it that's like yeah yeah I think

453
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:45,419
that's the one that I like that's a tent

454
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,400
yeah

455
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:48,780
for flavor and like I still taste it

456
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,220

457
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:52,319
so this year has been your most

458
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:54,179
productive year ever how many tour dates

even though I had to do less shows

463
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:10,699
oh really yeah I had to do less shows

464
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:13,079
this year to facilitate uh recording and

465
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:14,880

00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:53,179
all right

505
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:05,879
just like old times

506
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:08,839
taking dabs that's pretty good right

507
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,840
that is good

508
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:16,460
that one is

509
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,460
burning of the nose

510
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:22,700
yeah Jane that one is strong

511
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,700
yep

512
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,079
that's a good one yeah I think you're

513
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:30,899
gonna be

514
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:33,599
giving that one a 10 to

515
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:35,580
not so much for flavor it's not as

516
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:37,619
flavorful but no but it's it does have

517
00:21:35,579 --> 00:21:40,019
good flavor yeah but it's kind of strong

518
00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:42,058
too yeah it's the strongest one so far

519
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:43,859
yeah so far

520
00:21:42,058 --> 00:21:45,139
we did it in the right order

521
00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:49,079
um

522
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:52,860
has by far the strongest one

523
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:53,639
I wonder what determines the potency in

524
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:56,459
the

525
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:58,200
dabs well it's just like with the

526
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:01,079
flowers the cannabinoids and the

527
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:04,919
terpenes and the Entourage effect

528
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:06,960
between the two of them and I think that

529
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:10,799
high THC does now is give you the

530
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,840
strongest High yeah and some of these

531
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:15,179
yeah definitely these terpenes and

532
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:18,178
flavonoids affect your your high

533
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:18,179
significantly

534
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:25,798
enhance the high because of the flavor

535
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:28,919
and taste that you constantly get in

536
00:22:25,798 --> 00:22:31,259
your palette so yeah

537
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:33,120
yeah I'm all about tasting yeah it's

538
00:22:31,259 --> 00:22:35,339
good it's good we're gonna do ten more

539
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:37,399
yeah I could do 10. I know you could I

540
00:22:35,339 --> 00:22:38,759
don't know if I could

541
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,460
[Music]

542
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:43,619
yeah you know we we we kind of pace

543
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:46,200
ourselves differently over the years

544
00:22:43,619 --> 00:22:49,019
when it comes to dabbing going with that

545
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:52,500
back to back like for hours we just sit

546
00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:54,779
around yeah yeah and the high was crazy

547
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:56,400
too back then you would be like I feel

548
00:22:54,779 --> 00:22:57,960
like we had high tolerance too though so

549
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,500
it was different we'd sit and shoot the

550
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:04,380
[ __ ] and drink worm Heinekens yeah I'm

551
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:06,419
goodness yeah hot goodness this guy hot

552
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:08,640
Guinness so that is a tradition that

553
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:11,220
goes back a long time in the Caribbean

554
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:14,580
right yeah well in the Caribbean people

555
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:16,620
think that you got nothing in their

556
00:23:14,579 --> 00:23:19,259
stomach that is cold you know no

557
00:23:16,619 --> 00:23:20,759
refrigerator down there I heard I heard

558
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:23,220
from somebody down there that it's like

559
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:26,220
uh Viagra yeah it's like it's a liquid

560
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:28,798
that's what I'm seeing yeah so you have

561
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:31,200
nothing cool down there so if you drink

562
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:33,779
some cold you have to heat it up your

563
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,679
body will have to heat it up before you

564
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:38,099
can

565
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:40,620
even use what you know what you you just

566
00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:43,798
drank coal right but when you drink it

567
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:47,279
room temperature now it goes directly

568
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:49,079
to your bloodstream so it just it just

569
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:52,798
gives you that boost of energy and you

570
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:55,980
know it makes you powerful so yeah it's

571
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:59,220
I like drinking it warm because you know

572
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:02,099
I sing and cool stuff kind of mess my

573
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:04,319
vocal up so having a hug Guinness is

574
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:06,918
hard against what's your secret with tea

575
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:10,798
I know you got a secret like honey honey

576
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:14,460
and lemon probably some peppermint

577
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:18,119
sometimes uh tea you know

578
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:20,400
is very important to relax your vocal

579
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:23,099
you know cause

580
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,720
sometimes we

581
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:26,158
as a singer you're not really supposed

582
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,019
to be

583
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,419
talking all day

584
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:32,339
right having your vocals and you end up

585
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:34,259
talking and smoking yes before you

586
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:36,480
perform yeah because I am that kind of

587
00:24:34,259 --> 00:24:38,640
person I I like to interact with the

588
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,220
crowd I like to you know so I always

589
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:44,100
find myself in the crowd talking with

590
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:47,880
somebody smoking before I show so yeah

591
00:24:44,099 --> 00:24:51,480
so it definitely helps me to have a hot

592
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:52,700
cup of tea before I go on the stage yeah

593
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,140
yes

594
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:58,340
Davin just reminds me of we're at the

595
00:24:55,140 --> 00:25:01,080
catch a fire you're you're uh

596
00:24:58,339 --> 00:25:02,819
San Francisco and we go backstage and

597
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:05,819
these guys have like the old hot knife

598
00:25:02,819 --> 00:25:08,700
rig oh man they they were crazy they

599
00:25:05,819 --> 00:25:10,700
dabbing like they just found out about

600
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:13,380
the evolution

601
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:15,720
1995 again you know like we used to do

602
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:17,220
hot knife hits yep uh I went through a

603
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,440
bunch of my parents lives even when I

604
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:22,380
was a kid we would take him and put them

605
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,940
on the burner and get him put you know

606
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,140
old school hash rosin doesn't work like

607
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:27,120
that on those hard times you can't hit

608
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:28,799
them up that much but man and then we'd

609
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:30,359
use a cardboard tube and if you weren't

610
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:30,839
used to doing it man it would take you

611
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:32,519
out

612
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:33,439
[Laughter]

613
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:37,798
yeah

614
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:39,000
was definitely crazy hot knife

615
00:25:37,798 --> 00:25:42,240
man

616
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,980
I I I must say

617
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,980
catch a fire

618
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:50,159
and seeing them dabbing that way brought

619
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:52,380
back a lot of memories because you know

620
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,539
when we were just starting we would not

621
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:56,700
know that we didn't want to dab on a hot

622
00:25:54,538 --> 00:25:59,220
nail yeah you know what I'm saying and

623
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:01,259
it's over the years we started realizing

624
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:02,880
oh man we should make it a little cooler

625
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:06,658
and yeah catch a fire is from New

626
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:09,360
Zealand yeah yeah definitely so so it

627
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:12,059
was It was kind of strange to see it

628
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:14,399
there but then it brought back the

629
00:26:12,058 --> 00:26:17,538
memories of I wouldn't normally do one

630
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:20,700
of those dabs but they were so into it

631
00:26:17,538 --> 00:26:23,278
yeah they were doing it like like it's

632
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:25,080
nothing but but for me

633
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:27,659
they were dabbing Bud like that too yeah

634
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:29,099
yeah exactly on the hot nights pressing

635
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:32,039
the hot knives together with the thing

636
00:26:29,099 --> 00:26:34,980
and then they had a tube yep yeah it was

637
00:26:32,038 --> 00:26:37,140
a trip yeah so for me

638
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:39,480
I couldn't see myself doing too much of

639
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:42,120
that no that ruins your throat too yeah

640
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:44,460
exactly because the heat yeah

641
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:48,418
was not uh

642
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:50,038
good for any vocal after that

643
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:52,799
but it was nice though I don't know how

644
00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:54,119
they do it and sing too yeah it's it's

645
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:57,960
trippy

646
00:26:54,119 --> 00:27:00,359
but I guess willpower yeah yeah I must

00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,740

and when are we going back to St Vincent

676
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:06,659
ah man we should go to Saint Vincent

677
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,759
soon because you know I'm going to

678
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:11,100
Trinidad with like within the next

679
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:13,319
couple weeks yeah I'm gonna go down

680
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:14,399
there and do some shows nice I'm gonna

681
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:17,278
try to

682
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:21,659
have some seeds back there yeah

683
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:22,798
and do a few experiments nice because I

684
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:25,500
want to see

685
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:27,778
how the average person will grow the

686
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,700
seed down there yeah you know not the

687
00:28:27,778 --> 00:28:32,460
guys we've given out quite a few seeds

688
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:35,038
all over the world and they always grow

689
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:37,919
the weed down a Trinidad and smoke it

690
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:39,720
and then say oh my God yeah the weed was

691
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:43,200
good but this is the first guy that

692
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:46,140
actually saved some for me nice and yeah

693
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,840
that was it's nice to see that it grew

694
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:51,600
so well but I would also like to see how

695
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:53,879
the average person I wanna I wanna give

696
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:56,639
some seed to just some random people who

697
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:58,860
oh I got two trees at home you know just

698
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,659
to see how it would grow with them too

699
00:28:58,859 --> 00:29:03,599
yeah yeah

700
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:07,320
so that will definitely give me an idea

701
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:09,778
on how on what seed to give right and

702
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:11,700
what seed to use down in Trinidad nice

703
00:29:09,778 --> 00:29:13,679
so yeah

704
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:15,120
yeah the funny thing with that is that a

705
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,740
lot of people want the OG Kush down

706
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:18,298
there and it's like not that there's

707
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:21,179
anything wrong with OG Kush but I think

708
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:23,398
breeding it it's a hard I don't think

709
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:25,919
they have the experience with OG as yet

710
00:29:23,398 --> 00:29:28,259
to climatizing that genetic to that

711
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:30,360
environment is kind of rough as we've

712
00:29:28,259 --> 00:29:32,879
seen yeah it's gonna be rough it don't

713
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:36,479
really grow down there it's this short

714
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:38,039
on the ground and so yeah so I'm not

715
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,980
sure how

716
00:29:38,038 --> 00:29:44,038
you know the people down there perceived

717
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:45,538
the growing of OG yeah but I can tell

718
00:29:44,038 --> 00:29:46,859
that they don't really have the

719
00:29:45,538 --> 00:29:50,700
experience

720
00:29:46,859 --> 00:29:53,099
and the strain is not really climately

721
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:55,380
it's for yeah that weather down there

722
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:56,579
yeah I think over the next five years

723
00:29:55,380 --> 00:30:00,000
they're going to get a lot more stuff

724
00:29:56,579 --> 00:30:02,339
down there and definite so I I think the

725
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,200
banana is going to do good down there we

726
00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:06,000
got a bunch of bananas yeah for

727
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,700
specifically for Saint Vincent maybe

728
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,319
some fraternity banana crosses that I

729
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:13,259
think will do well that are definitely

730
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:15,240
more on that tropical equatorial leaning

731
00:30:13,259 --> 00:30:18,058
man we gotta

732
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:21,179
we gotta definitely go to Trinidad right

733
00:30:18,058 --> 00:30:23,879
now and because

734
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:25,320
I've been asked a lot of questions about

735
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,559
soil

736
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:32,398
content and you know yeah so it'll be

737
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:34,440
nice to go visit a few places and

738
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:37,158
you know kind of give them an Insight on

739
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:41,880
how to really

740
00:30:37,159 --> 00:30:43,980
neutralize and keep their soil alive for

741
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,778
planting you know yeah testing their

742
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,579
soil I think that's the biggest thing if

743
00:30:45,778 --> 00:30:48,898
you watch the scamness from Crest of

744
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:51,658
soil episode he was talking about living

745
00:30:48,898 --> 00:30:53,219
soil yeah yeah microbiology and I think

746
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:54,899
that stuff is really important testing

747
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:57,058
in soil I mean to know what's in your

748
00:30:54,898 --> 00:30:58,558
soil especially exactly so I think they

749
00:30:57,058 --> 00:31:00,359
have a lot of fertile soil though yeah

750
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:03,178
they have a lot of fertile soil they

751
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:05,278
have fertile soil because we had a lot

752
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:07,559
of agriculture in Trinidad

753
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:10,200
but at the same time I don't know what

754
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:13,678
they were using to grow as far as

755
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:16,080
chemicals and sure all of that so but

756
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:18,419
the soil is fertile but I don't know

757
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:20,759
what the farmers were putting in the

758
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:25,380
soil while they were growing so that's

759
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:27,658
why you know it's very necessary to test

760
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:30,360
the soil down there and see how you know

761
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:33,480
what is in there and What needs to come

762
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:35,099
out for sure yeah yeah well thank you
