00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,679
she works for Oaker Dam as well thank

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,719
you for coming on the show thank you for

15
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:46,439
having me absolutely so we work together

16
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:48,679
uh every day for about N9 months

17
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:51,519
literally and you got me focused in a

18
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:53,439
way that most people could never get me

19
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,359
focused and I think part of that was

20
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:57,718
that you were waking up at 4:00 a.m. and

21
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:00,000
I was waking up at 5:00 a.m. and it's

22
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,399
hard to find people that kind of match

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,960
your speed when it comes to work

24
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:05,118
especially early morning like that not

25
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,640
everybody likes waking up and working

26
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:10,759
first thing right out of bed but that

27
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,200
was my way of finishing this book and uh

28
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:13,680
yeah you're a big reason the book is

29
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,118
actually here that that we have a

30
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,439
printed version of it so thank you so

31
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:20,560
much for that of course and you

32
00:01:18,438 --> 00:01:22,559
contributed the book you know beyond

33
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,159
editing and going you know I think

34
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,478
perspective in so many different things

35
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:27,920
um you know and the whole getting me

36
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:29,920
Focus part was great because I've been

37
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,640
working on this book for five years and

38
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,640
and tried writing this book over and

39
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,359
over and I didn't have it exactly how I

40
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,079
wanted it and finally we figured it out

41
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:40,280
there was this recipe for success I

42
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:42,279
wrote this draft I think the draft was

43
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,239
pretty good by the time you got it and

44
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,920
then we still had a lot of refining to

45
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:48,798
do and a lot of work uh more than I

46
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,439
would have ever expected would go into

47
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,000
something we put into that book it was a

48
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:54,078
really fun project for me to work on

49
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,840
because I've worked on a lot of

50
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:57,718
horiculture content and a lot of

51
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,920
genomics content but I still had this

52
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:02,038
blind spot when it came to breeding and

53
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,039
getting to do this book filled in all of

54
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:06,079
the blind spots so that was really fun

55
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:08,840
for me yeah it's funny from the outside

56
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:10,878
breeding seems like A+ b equals c and

57
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,800
it's so much more complicated than that

58
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,560
and they're so much more involved one

59
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,360
it's one thing making seeds but actually

60
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,159
breeding and breeding towards goals and

61
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,760
breeding intention depending on what

62
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:22,919
you're looking for an outcome uh you

63
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:24,679
know there's just so many different

64
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:26,039
directions see that's funny to me

65
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,640
because the way I've distilled it to

66
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:30,079
people when I explain to them oh I

67
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:32,039
understand breeding now is it's growing

68
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,640
except you take notes and pay attention

69
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:36,400
yeah record it's a lot of it's a lot of

70
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,318
data collection and I think like with

71
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,439
our facility that's what we do it's data

72
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:41,560
collection uh collecting data on

73
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:43,479
everything and I'm I'm one of those

74
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,640
people I like collecting data I like

75
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:47,280
looking at things over time it's you

76
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:49,279
know growing flow it's like you're

77
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,759
looking at that Harvest and maybe you're

78
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,439
looking at the next Harvest how how can

79
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:54,039
I improve it but with genetics you're

80
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:57,318
looking like how can I improve it over

81
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:59,560
time uh and what is that thing that I

82
00:02:57,318 --> 00:03:00,878
created and how can I make it better you

83
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,598
know you're trying to improve the gene

84
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:04,158
pool as opposed to taking away from the

85
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:07,318
gene pool which I think is what a lot of

86
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:08,679
people do uh not intentionally but I

87
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:10,759
think a lot of people are just breeding

88
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,200
to breed and to make seeds and you're

89
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:14,000
looking at the whole plant right you're

90
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:15,479
not just looking at the end product like

91
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,680
you're looking at every little detail

92
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:19,479
about how it grows and its environment

93
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,080
and I think that gets lost a lot when we

94
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:22,439
talk about cannabis varieties because

95
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,200
everyone just wants to know what kind of

96
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:27,719
high they're going to get yeah or you

97
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:31,759
know I think we we have an overemphasis

98
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:33,759
on look and bag of feel and we need to

99
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:35,120
go back to like how does it make me feel

100
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:37,479
like I've been talking about that a lot

101
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,080
on the show it's like uh ever since my

102
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:43,438
friend Dave passed uh Dave mesford he

103
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,680
was in the book yeah and he passed on

104
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:47,479
420 and so we've put a re-emphasis at

105
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,159
our facility and how does it make you

106
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:50,719
feel at the end of the day what are we

107
00:03:49,158 --> 00:03:52,359
doing this for we're doing this for the

108
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:53,959
effect the medical benefit whether you

109
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,000
want it for recreational or whatever

110
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:57,680
it's medical at the end of the day so I

111
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,280
think Dennis PR said it best a long time

112
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,439
ago it's funny because even uh with my

113
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,360
lower tolerance now some of some of my

114
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:08,479
favorite varieties I've ever smoked were

115
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,959
some old hippies 1970s strains like

116
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:11,719
they're just so much more pleasant than

117
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:13,759
a lot of the stuff today yeah there's

118
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:15,400
such a wide variety of stuff I mean

119
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,959
we've kind of pigeonholed ourselves into

120
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,759
this galato Market especially in the Bay

121
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:23,600
Area but then if you drive up to Humble

122
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,080
or you go to Menino or you go over to

123
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,680
any of the other countries there's a lot

124
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:30,079
more variety and uh we need to get back

125
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,439
into the variety and looking at what's

126
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:34,800
going to improve the Vigor of the plant

127
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:36,600
what's going to have you know long-term

128
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,240
improved effects on the plant I think

129
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,879
that's so important well and I know as a

130
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,439
patient that's what I get excited about

131
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:43,279
when I walk in a dispensary and I see

132
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:45,120
what's there it's the variety that gets

133
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:47,399
me excited it's not one thing or the

134
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,600
other thing it's the options and I think

135
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:50,000
that that's what we get lost on too

136
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,080
there's never going to be the one thing

137
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,839
I want lots of things yeah me too I I

138
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:56,758
think it's so subjective to the

139
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:59,799
individual as you've written in other

140
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:01,360
books as well um that what one person

141
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,199
likes isn't necessarily what the next

142
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,280
person likes or needs and it's so

143
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,160
subjective to the individual you know

144
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:10,079
across the board and some people like

145
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,720
that narcotic effect and some people

146
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:15,800
like that uh you know the the stimulant

147
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,199
effect and some people like somewhere in

148
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,079
the middle and then some people just

149
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,560
like hanging out and feeling a little

150
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:22,758
bit you know I want the stimulant every

151
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,360
time I want the thing that's going to

152
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:26,639
narrow me in and focus and actually I've

153
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,400
just started playing with thcv strains

154
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,360
yeah a friend of mine from phos actually

155
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:32,318
sent down an extract called get [ __ ]

156
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,360
done nice and when I smoked that it

157
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:36,560
didn't taste very good it didn't look

158
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,479
very good the first thing I did was made

159
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,079
this like big list of like the cleaning

160
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:44,038
projects and the work projects I was

161
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:45,758
going to take on and I did it yeah thcv

162
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:49,240
has you know it's funny CU you sent me a

163
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:51,680
picture of the ratios of thcv in one of

164
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,478
the products that you got and I was like

165
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,079
wow these you know it's like we're

166
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:57,079
talking about huge percentages and yeah

167
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:59,240
it's an extract but we're talking about

168
00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:00,680
two to one and then I start reading more

169
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:04,160
on some of the stuff that was in our

170
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:06,199
book the um what was Pink boost goddess

171
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,639
pink boost goddess and the pink boost

172
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:10,120
goddess they're they're breeding it into

173
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:12,478
a on to one now which is Leaps and

174
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,519
Bounds from the stuff we were looking at

175
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:16,439
like eight years ago where it was like

176
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:19,959
showing up as a small

177
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:21,639
percentage uh you know and I think I've

178
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:24,318
been turned off by the

179
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:26,120
thcv as straight thcv it doesn't do

180
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,840
anything for me that I enjoy I don't I

181
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,399
don't like the effect really um but

182
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:33,038
maybe as a full spectrum product I would

183
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:34,638
you know I think I only try the full

184
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:36,159
spectrum products anymore I've already

185
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,120
learned that lesson I'm not ever

186
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,800
interested in anything that's isolated

187
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:44,319
or artificially high in one canono yeah

188
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,120
I mean I got a vial of pure thcv and I

189
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,520
like was dabbing it and trying it and

190
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,199
then like waking up in the morning and

191
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:52,159
trying it and then trying it in the

192
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,759
afternoon after I'd smoked a bunch and

193
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,199
the effect it got me high but it didn't

194
00:06:54,759 --> 00:07:00,038
get me like an enjoyable High it wasn't

195
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,240
like I wanted to go smoke more of it it

196
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:04,079
was more like try I was trying it trying

197
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,879
it because I'd heard like okay well it

198
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:08,598
helps with uh you know if if you're on a

199
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:10,319
diet it helps with uh appetite

200
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:11,959
suppression and it helps with all these

201
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,639
things and focus I've heard a lot of

202
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:16,079
things oh yeah and for me that wasn't

203
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,280
the case and I think I get a lot of that

204
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:20,719
from just playing THC you know if I'm

205
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:23,079
looking for appetite suppression I need

206
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,360
a sativa or something that's more of

207
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:27,719
that equitorial that basically is that

208
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,319
stimulant side and then I'm not hungry

209
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,160
and I get that just from stuff that's

210
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,120
like a super silver haze I don't feel

211
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:38,360
like eating necessarily but if I smoke

212
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,879
the narcotic stuff that's very like uh

213
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,840
strong the first thing I want to do is

214
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:43,720
eat some food or some Granddaddy Purple

215
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:44,918
but see we asked too much of cannabis

216
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,400
right like we're trying to alter all

217
00:07:44,918 --> 00:07:48,079
these cannaboids to get these different

218
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:49,478
effects but there's already an herb out

219
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:51,878
there that suppresses your appetite and

220
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:53,719
your your sugar Cravings which is gestra

221
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:56,319
sylvestra yeah and I might be saying

222
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,440
that wrong um but that will do exactly

223
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,919
what we're trying to get thcv to do so

224
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:03,038
it's so funny to me we're going so hard

225
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:05,240
on breeding thcv up for this thing when

226
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:07,639
it already exists pink boost goddess is

227
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,038
really cool I think that was cool that's

228
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:12,478
there's a great section in the book on

229
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:14,439
pink uh Pink boo goddess and I feel like

230
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,000
uh you know Dale Hunt is an amazing you

231
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:18,360
know he wrote a whole chapter for the

232
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,800
book uh you know there's a couple people

233
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,360
Matt Schneider from apical biotech wrote

234
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,439
the tissue culture chapter and as we

235
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,080
were working together this book became

236
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:30,680
so much bigger than just the James loud

237
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:32,799
book of reading it's like okay well

238
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,759
James loud my name is on the cover but

239
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:37,838
it's the contribution of over 20 people

240
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,799
uh and their hard work and you know a

241
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,440
complete chapter from Dale Hunt a

242
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:44,319
complete chapter on tissue culture from

243
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,519
Matt and then Mojave did contribution

244
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,320
Reggie Gino he was like one of the most

245
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,080
valuable people contributing to the book

246
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,519
because he was questioning me on like do

247
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,480
you mean this or do you mean this

248
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,799
because the way you're writing it it

249
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,839
says this but I think you're meaning

250
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:02,479
this um or maybe you're meaning this and

251
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:05,160
I want to know and so then he made me do

252
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,079
a lot of thinking which is good I was so

253
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:08,278
surprised by Reggie because we thought

254
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:10,159
Reggie was just going to come in and

255
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:13,439
kind of do an accuracy check but he did

256
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:15,319
a line edit uh like he really read the

257
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,640
book and picked out pieces and I think

258
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:20,480
it's better for Reggie's line edit and I

259
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:23,000
also just I always admired Reggie before

260
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,039
this experience but I admire him tenfold

261
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,799
now after working with him on this book

262
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:29,519
yeah so Reggie he's just amazing I mean

263
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:31,199
yeah I thought that he was just going to

264
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,560
in and read it and give me his opinion

265
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,680
on whether it was like even worth

266
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:39,359
publishing and then he went in and just

267
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:43,159
really read it in detail gave us honest

268
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,720
feedback and you know you yeah it's just

269
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:46,879
amazing having people like that

270
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,800
contributing so and someone of his

271
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:51,559
caliber I mean he basically wrote the

272
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:53,879
forward in the book and the forward is

273
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:56,399
just it's the best forward I've ever

274
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:58,078
read in a book and it happens to be in

275
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,720
my book so I'm really proud to have him

276
00:09:58,078 --> 00:10:02,759
as part of the contributing team that

277
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,839
made this book so special I had fun

278
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:06,679
working on that forward with him because

279
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:08,279
I I gave him a prompt and he wrote it

280
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:10,319
and I came back in and what I was really

281
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:12,120
trying to do is getting him to kind of

282
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,920
pull some of his unique experience that

283
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,278
people have not heard about or don't

284
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:18,439
understand in cannabis and using that to

285
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:20,240
contextualize what he was doing and I

286
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,880
think he ended up liking the end product

287
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,680
a little bit more because of it because

288
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:26,078
I kind of pushed him to talk about some

289
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:27,679
things he wasn't going to talk about and

290
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:29,439
you can't hear about it unless you read

291
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:32,239
the book well it's funny cuz I made made

292
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:35,240
a list of all the people that I would

293
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,120
want to write the forward for the book

294
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,799
and he didn't even seem like someone

295
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,320
that would be attainable to have on and

296
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:43,000
he wasn't on the list because he was

297
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,800
like that there's a couple people that I

298
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,639
really look up to and and he's one of

299
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:52,078
them I met him a long time ago uh in the

300
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:55,039
early days of uh Halen labs and back

301
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:58,319
back when uh they were Halen had just

302
00:10:55,039 --> 00:11:00,519
merged over in Berkeley and so Reggie

303
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,278
was there and he was younger no gray

304
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:04,639
hair but really just an amazing guy and

305
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:06,559
I really looked up to him and I'm like

306
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,240
that guy is super smart and super

307
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:11,039
amazing and just super friendly he was

308
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,120
always really nice um I feel like I was

309
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:16,838
just starting to understand what

310
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:19,639
breeding was back 10 years ago you know

311
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:20,959
and so just I'm I'm extremely blessed to

312
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:22,919
have so many great people in the book

313
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:26,119
and then Hara who did the

314
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:27,759
layout she's amazing love har she uh

315
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,519
there was a lot of changes that we threw

316
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:31,078
at her at the end and she just went

317
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,919
through and just did such a good job I

318
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:35,679
mean um everything is so special about

319
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:37,599
the book and then the cover there's

320
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:39,879
actually hidden designs in the cover

321
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,120
that we we put in there and Ben who's

322
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:43,600
the photographer did that shot and did

323
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,399
did a little photo editing and I feel

324
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,480
like it's a super unique cover has

325
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:49,078
anyone ever actually found the hidden

326
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,000
symbols in the cover and pointed it out

327
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:53,278
to you without you saying something no

328
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,480
but if anybody can uh guess what they

329
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:58,240
are they get a free pack of seeds oh

330
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,720
fine so yeah randomly so yeah we'll do

331
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,839
that on the podcast if you guys have the

332
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,800
book because a lot of people that watch

333
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:05,200
our show have purchased the book and

334
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:07,278
there's other there's other symbols in

335
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,839
the book there's all kinds of stuff so

336
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:11,600
it was a fun project um if you would

337
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,240
have told me how crazy it was going to

338
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,240
be before I wrote it I probably would

339
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:18,839
never have done it um you know five

340
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,198
years ago when I first had thought about

341
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:24,199
doing it I didn't realize what writing a

342
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:25,919
book meant and now I have so much more

343
00:12:24,198 --> 00:12:28,679
respect for these other authors that

344
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:30,759
have written these great books uh you

345
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:32,958
know it's there's just so much to go in

346
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:34,519
even smaller books it's just so much

347
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,719
energy and so much time if you want to

348
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:38,278
write something good and then all you

349
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,079
can do is write the best book that you

350
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:42,320
can do and then you put it out there for

351
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:44,198
the world and the world interprets it

352
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,480
however the world interprets it so and

353
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:47,799
they've been interpreting it pretty

354
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,920
positively right I think so I think it's

355
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:50,599
been really good we're still getting

356
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:53,599
sales so I mean I think that's a good

357
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,759
sign and uh yeah I I just I think the

358
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,759
book is really

359
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:58,159
well-rounded uh and this is just the

360
00:12:56,759 --> 00:13:00,078
beginning we're going to do more

361
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:02,360
versions down the road I don't know when

362
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:03,719
but you know I'm sure we both need

363
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,959
breaks for a little bit before we do

364
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,600
another version I will say I have read

365
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:09,319
almost every grow book that has ever

366
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,720
been published everything that even kind

367
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:14,600
of touches on cannabis breeding there is

368
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:17,240
nothing like this book right now um the

369
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:19,000
way it's organized the story it tells

370
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,000
but also the information it gives like I

371
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,440
walked away understanding breeding and I

372
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,720
always thought that that was the most

373
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,399
complicated thing in cannabis yeah and I

374
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,240
don't anymore because it's not that

375
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,919
complicated but nobody has sat down and

376
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,440
actually put it to work words in the

377
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:33,799
same way so I think it's just so cool

378
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,000
that this book

379
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:38,000
exists yeah me too and it's something

380
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,480
you know it's like I I've always wanted

381
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,440
I think part of growing up for me has

382
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,879
been like how do I contribute to this

383
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,320
bigger thing that we're all part of and

384
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:48,360
I feel like I found where my

385
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,560
contribution lies within the genetics

386
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:53,519
and within the breeding and to be able

387
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:54,758
to write a book um yeah it's just as as

388
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,120
you get older it's like what's your

389
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:58,560
legacy what are you leaving behind and

390
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,039
you have your legacy with all these

391
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:02,758
books that you edited and you know with

392
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,278
the stuff with Oaker Dam and I feel like

393
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:08,000
you've contributed heavily to so many

394
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:09,639
people um and I feel like I want to be

395
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,759
the gortex for all these big brands with

396
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:13,680
my genetics and you're kind of like the

397
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:16,399
gortex for all these authors and it's

398
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:19,559
just amazing you know and I think that

399
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,879
uh it's we're an extremely special time

400
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:24,000
in the Cannabis space because it's not

401
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:25,799
stable yet we're not quite sure where

402
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,278
it's going there's still a lot of

403
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:28,599
information to be discovered that's why

404
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:30,679
there's going to be more breeding books

405
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:33,000
we haven't got it all down there's no

406
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:35,000
but yours was the first that's going to

407
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,559
unleash the rest I think yeah and I'm

408
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,879
looking forward to other people writing

409
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:39,758
cannabis breeding books I think there's

410
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:41,039
a need for it everyone has their own

411
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:43,360
opinion on it there's different

412
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:45,319
directions we can go my book kind of has

413
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,839
everything and I feel like if people

414
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,560
want to dive into some of those

415
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:50,480
specifics there could be a whole book on

416
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:52,479
tissue culture for cannabis you could

417
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,000
write 400 pages on that so this is what

418
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,959
excites me about this book and what

419
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,480
excites me about cannabis in general

420
00:14:55,958 --> 00:15:00,399
right I don't think in any other field

421
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,480
of plants science people have gotten

422
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,879
this excited about breeding as they do

423
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,000
about cannabis right but there's a whole

424
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:08,519
world of plants out there to breed and I

425
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,360
think this might open the door for

426
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:12,120
people to start talking about that like

427
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,278
I was saying with appetite suppression

428
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,639
we're all obsessed with breeding thcv

429
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:18,480
and creating it from yeast and creating

430
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,240
patent medicines from it there's a whole

431
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,480
world of plants that already do these

432
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,639
same things

433
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,639
OIC there's a there's a plant that does

434
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,159
the same thing that suppresses the glp1

435
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,680
receptor right I think it's called

436
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:31,318
berbery but

437
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:33,599
don't quote me on that right but there

438
00:15:31,318 --> 00:15:35,360
are plants out there my big hope with

439
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,519
cannabis after all of these years

440
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:41,079
especially as a patient has always been

441
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:43,919
that cannabis busts the door open on on

442
00:15:41,078 --> 00:15:45,758
plants in general but also on healthcare

443
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:48,318
because we've had this inordinate focus

444
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:50,639
on single cell molecules as being able

445
00:15:48,318 --> 00:15:52,719
to cure and treat things they do not

446
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,440
cure and treat things neither do plants

447
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,040
but when you start understanding the

448
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,720
components of plants and we've never

449
00:15:56,039 --> 00:16:00,000
studied anything more than we've studied

450
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,879
cannabis at this point right then you

451
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,879
start kind of like rethinking how you

452
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:05,399
look at Healthcare and it's kind of an

453
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:07,318
incredible thing that cannabis is able

454
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:09,039
to do for us totally I mean we used

455
00:16:07,318 --> 00:16:11,958
plant medicine for thousands of years

456
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:15,399
and we've only gone away from it with

457
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:16,838
modern medicine in the last 200 years

458
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:18,799
well and even with modern medicine we

459
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:20,519
have this thing where we say oh we know

460
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:22,439
this plant is medicinal we're going to

461
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:24,159
isolate one compound from it because

462
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,560
that's the thing that does this it's

463
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:27,198
never the thing that does this and

464
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:29,198
that's also what cannabis is teaching us

465
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:31,799
that there's a whole host of molecules

466
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:33,519
flavonoids tpin they exist in other

467
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:35,439
plants oh yeah the endocannabinoid

468
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,399
system does not exist to interact with

469
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,000
cannabis it exists to interact with all

470
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:42,198
of the foods that we eat that come from

471
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,759
the earth as well as herbs right yeah I

472
00:16:42,198 --> 00:16:45,519
mean it's this stuff is all over the

473
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,360
place I mean cannaboids are in breast

474
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,240
milk so we have these receptors in our

475
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,120
body thank God it puts the babies to

476
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,480
sleep right totally and I mean we have

477
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,919
these receptors in our body there's a

478
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,319
reason for it and I think we really need

479
00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:01,479
to explore it and now you know laws are

480
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:03,599
changing the landscape is changing to

481
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,599
where we can do a lot more research and

482
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,759
there's so many people interested and it

483
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:10,438
also is normalizing cannabis you know we

484
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:13,959
have guys like Luke scarmazzo that did

485
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:16,000
14 years in prison and for a plant you

486
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:18,038
know and I think it's pretty wild I'll

487
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,599
correct that I don't think Luke did 14

488
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:22,400
years in prison for a plan I think Luke

489
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:24,519
did 14 years in prison for telling the

490
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,798
feds to [ __ ] themselves yeah I think

491
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:29,558
that's 100% why he did that prison time

492
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:31,319
his free speech

493
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:35,639
yeah and unfortunately that's the world

494
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:37,918
we live in you know so like how free are

495
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,960
we you know I guess it's all just a

496
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,160
difference of opinion but well when even

497
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,720
half the Cannabis industry says to you

498
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,919
when you talk about Luke's case and they

499
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:48,480
go well you know he made that music

500
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,759
video where he said [ __ ] the feds as if

501
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,279
he deserved it right when like freedom

502
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:55,440
of speech is Central to who we are as

503
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:57,158
Americans you even have people in the

504
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,279
Cannabis industry defending that as a

505
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:03,280
reason to put him behind bars that's

506
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:04,759
really sad you know and yeah it's just

507
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:06,960
there's there and there's so many

508
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:10,279
instances of this that have happened

509
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,679
time and time and time again uh but then

510
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:15,079
cannabis is still we Circle back to

511
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:19,000
cannabis is like the bad guy right and

512
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:20,678
slowly but surely we are normalizing it

513
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,119
uh people like yourself putting this in

514
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:25,519
books uh podcasts where we're talking

515
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:27,759
about it where you get the normal person

516
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:29,119
that ends up finding this podcast they

517
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:30,400
watch it and they can relate something

518
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:32,399
that you're saying or I'm saying and

519
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,840
then all of a sudden wow or they know

520
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,759
somebody that had cancer and then all of

521
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:38,038
a sudden they're like oh well maybe it's

522
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:39,798
not so bad because they had cancer and

523
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:40,679
it helped them eat when they had cancer

524
00:18:39,798 --> 00:18:43,319
and they

525
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:45,120
survived uh these Miracles we had Maya

526
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:47,038
from Oman and she gave us a different

527
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:49,319
perspective on it she's really amazing

528
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:52,319
what was her different perspective well

529
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:54,639
it was just basically these Miracles

530
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:56,439
that people experience you know and she

531
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,200
pointed that out and I think my mom and

532
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:01,320
dad saw Sanjay gupa in 60 minutes saw

533
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,159
that these kids were like not having

534
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:04,918
epilepsy or not epilepsy but they

535
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:07,120
weren't having seizures right so it

536
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:08,880
changed the seizure they're having all

537
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:10,918
these seizures they started taking CBD

538
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,200
and then the seizures went away and so I

539
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:14,480
think that was the big changing point

540
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,519
for my parents but like a lot of people

541
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,440
they see these Miracles and so these

542
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:20,000
Miracles once once you have a miracle

543
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,279
happen to one of your friends or your

544
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,880
family then you realize maybe this isn't

545
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:26,119
so bad and maybe we we were looking at

546
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,280
it the wrong way okay so can I talk to

547
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:30,519
you about Utah just a little bit sure

548
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:34,158
okay so so when I first I I was living

549
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:35,960
in the Bay Area for 10 years um and then

550
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:37,640
I had my my husband my boyfriend at the

551
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:40,600
time who's now my husband was living in

552
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,919
Salt Lake City we both have family there

553
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:44,678
and the rents were flying in Oakland and

554
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:47,120
he's like you know if you live with me

555
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:49,038
your rent will be 300 a month so I moved

556
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,798
to Salt Lake City and decided to travel

557
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:52,079
back to the Bay Area once a month so I

558
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:54,359
can still work cuz I was the editor of

559
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:56,119
cannabis now at the time right um so I

560
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,678
was coming back doing my cannabis thing

561
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:59,839
every six weeks or so and then going

562
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:02,480
back to Utah our apartment was at the

563
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:04,399
base of um Capitol Hill in Salt Lake

564
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,919
City right where the capital is and I

565
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,880
moved there months before Utah became

566
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:11,360
the first state to pass a CBD only law I

567
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:14,039
immediately made a friend with someone

568
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:16,639
who was lobbying up there for CBD and so

569
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:18,079
I I immediately fell head first into the

570
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,799
situation where I was trying to explain

571
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:23,798
cannabis to Mormons right wow and for

572
00:20:21,798 --> 00:20:26,558
them it was very much like they love

573
00:20:23,798 --> 00:20:29,079
hearing Miracle stories M and that was

574
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:30,918
also what pushed cannabis into the leg

575
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:32,359
instead in the Utah legislature was

576
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:35,679
these stories of these children with

577
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:38,240
epilepsy MH um what was interesting is I

578
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,720
started kind of being I got sidelined

579
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,279
right away um I I was introduced to one

580
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,960
of the Mormon moms who was running the

581
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:46,359
bill and she had looked me up on the

582
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,279
internet and she said right away I saw

583
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:49,879
you you're from the Bay Area you're

584
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:52,918
friends with gays and

585
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:55,039
legalizers right wow she's like nobody

586
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:57,240
wants to hear what you have to say so I

587
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:59,359
immediately got behind the scenes and

588
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,640
started kind of whispering in the ear of

589
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:03,798
people about what to say to these

590
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:07,320
legislators legislators so by 2014 the

591
00:21:03,798 --> 00:21:09,798
CBD bill is happening on 2015 I'm hiding

592
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:12,798
in the office of Senator Mark Madson who

593
00:21:09,798 --> 00:21:15,240
is the grandson of the Mormon prophet um

594
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:17,759
and also the first person to run a full

595
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,599
medical cannabis bill in Utah and he was

596
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:21,240
sitting there saying I need someone to

597
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:23,000
talk about this I'll call up a friend

598
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,159
who's a researcher on this one second

599
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,319
right so I'm connecting him to everybody

600
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:29,039
and so it was this whole like Miracle

601
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:31,558
situation in Utah that had they like

602
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:33,278
their belief in magical thinking um that

603
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:35,918
really turned them on to cannabis you go

604
00:21:33,278 --> 00:21:38,200
to Utah now you will not hear a

605
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,799
conservative Senator say a bad thing

606
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:43,319
about cannabis right because we turned

607
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:46,079
the tide on these medical stories and I

608
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:49,119
still like can't get over like how the

609
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:50,960
culture changed because of these stories

610
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:53,278
and it really is because of the patience

611
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,679
again like we really passed legalization

612
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:57,640
in so many states because of money

613
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,559
people wanted tax money people wanted to

614
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,320
make money but what really got the

615
00:21:59,558 --> 00:22:03,558
conversation going were these stories of

616
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:07,399
patience and I definitely taught Mormons

617
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:09,319
how to dab oh wow I taught Mormons about

618
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,679
cannabis and I feel like that was really

619
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:14,839
like my time to do God's work if you

620
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:17,360
will because I I helped spread it in a

621
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:19,639
place where it was never going to spread

622
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:22,479
yeah I sent a whole bunch of I sold a

623
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:25,320
bunch of seeds over in Utah and uh you

624
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,798
know for medical and it was pretty

625
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:28,879
amazing I mean I think they have a

626
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:32,079
really good climate for growing oh

627
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:34,360
really um yeah it's hot dry high

628
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:36,079
altitude so they did really good with my

629
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:39,079
seeds okay they did really good in fact

630
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:41,199
I was really impressed um they they did

631
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:43,319
some indoor and you know it was also

632
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:47,880
really amazing but also the cultivator

633
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:49,439
really good guy uh but yeah Utah I think

634
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,640
you I was super surprised with that when

635
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,558
I heard that someone from Utah wanted my

636
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:56,278
seeds I was like really and then I had

637
00:22:53,558 --> 00:22:57,359
to look if are they even legal this guy

638
00:22:56,278 --> 00:22:59,759
going to go you know he wanted a lot of

639
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:01,639
seeds and I'm like okay well really

640
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:03,119
interesting the patients who had tried

641
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,159
to pass that that bill in the

642
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:08,599
legislature the year I was working there

643
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:10,000
so that was 2015 y it lost my husband

644
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:12,038
graduated grad school and we're like

645
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,240
let's get the [ __ ] out so we moved to

646
00:23:12,038 --> 00:23:16,079
Portland Oregon almost immediately but

647
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,919
the patients who left behind they didn't

648
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:19,798
stop the ones who were working on that

649
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,640
bill became the chief petitioners of

650
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:25,079
prop 2 wow which passed in 2018 and now

651
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,960
Utah is a medical cannabis State totally

652
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:28,199
right totally weird producing in the

653
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,919
state there's a lot of people producing

654
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,240
in the yeah you know it's funny though

655
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:34,080
they're producing a lot of bad weed in

656
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,720
Utah I wouldn't be surprised although I

657
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,599
have seen I mean that I have pictures of

658
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,319
some amazing stuff that was produced in

659
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:42,199
Utah so there's only eight Growers oh

660
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:44,000
wow only eight legal Growers right and

661
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,038
so there's 880,000 registered patients

662
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,839
in the state of Utah less than 20,000 or

663
00:23:46,038 --> 00:23:49,679
so

664
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:51,678
actually but most of it's bad yeah well

665
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,360
and here's the thing about Utah Right

666
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,519
Colorado is a day drive away Nevada is a

667
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:59,119
day drive array some parts of Oregon are

668
00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:01,158
a day drive away right so

669
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:04,439
they're not really buying Utah weed oh

670
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:05,640
wow that makes sense it makes sense and

671
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,200
I just can't wait for the day for

672
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,919
interstate commerce it's so silly that

673
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:14,080
we're still having this conversation

674
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:17,120
that we can't legally cross state lines

675
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:19,319
with cannabis like you can do whatever

676
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:21,439
you want but as far as federally illegal

677
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:24,119
it's still federally illegal there's no

678
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,679
interstate commerce so we can't produce

679
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:30,158
a [ __ ] ton in California and then go

680
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:33,080
sell to Utah or North Dakota or South

681
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:35,200
Dakota or Utah wants our weed yeah I'm

682
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:36,519
sure and that's something I was feeling

683
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,399
especially talking to some old friends

684
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:39,839
at the emerald cup and getting to talk

685
00:24:38,398 --> 00:24:42,278
to other people in the California

686
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:45,240
industry because California is my home

687
00:24:42,278 --> 00:24:47,079
um California Cannabis is hurting

688
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,359
they're really hurting and until they

689
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:51,319
can legally ship things out that they

690
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:52,719
were already sending anyway before

691
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:55,158
legalization happened they're going to

692
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,640
continue to hurt well and they're going

693
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:59,760
to continue to do stuff uh the

694
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:03,440
traditional way

695
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:06,119
and I think that the the best solution

696
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,919
is for them to at the very least even if

697
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:10,359
they don't want to go federally legal

698
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:13,480
allow interstate commerce from legal

699
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:15,839
state to Legal State wreck to wreck

700
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,440
medical to let the world experien

701
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:19,839
California Cannabis there's already a

702
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,159
demand for it when I was in Spain in

703
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:24,319
2022 apparently in the in the clubs in

704
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,799
Barcelona they brag about it being C

705
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:29,000
weed right of course nobody from

706
00:25:25,798 --> 00:25:30,839
California says C sure but that's still

707
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,079
the thing they all want Ki weed just the

708
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:35,480
way people want Nappa wine well it's

709
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:36,960
mostly California genetics and I think

710
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,159
we're the epicenter right here in

711
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,679
California the Bay Area Los

712
00:25:39,159 --> 00:25:43,399
Angeles uh I would say West Coast but

713
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:46,200
like really California is I was you know

714
00:25:43,398 --> 00:25:47,599
o oaksterdam Oakland has been there's a

715
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,080
reason it's called Oaker Dam because we

716
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:54,558
were the epicenter for the longest time

717
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:57,558
especially uh 215 215 days it was like

718
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:59,759
booming genetics wise too so they want

719
00:25:57,558 --> 00:26:02,079
the best in and I've seen a lot of stuff

720
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:04,720
in Europe that says Cali it's definitely

721
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:06,918
not Cali it could be Canadian but it's

722
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,399
you know not necessarily californ right

723
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:10,720
they're putting California on people

724
00:26:08,398 --> 00:26:14,519
like oo California in in the Netherlands

725
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:16,720
in Spain all over but slowly it's

726
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:18,879
becoming normalized uh we got Germany

727
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,038
going online big countries that are

728
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:24,320
going recreational as a country and I

729
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:26,240
love that you know we got Jamaica is you

730
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:27,918
know we got some islands and we have you

731
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,720
know I think Colombia still has a long

732
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,399
way go but they have potential Mexico

733
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,159
they're going to go fully wrecked I

734
00:26:32,398 --> 00:26:36,599
can't wait till Mexico goes yeah I mean

735
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:39,120
once these things start to unfold and

736
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:41,439
then we got it Canada and Mexico and

737
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:43,079
they're fully wrecked we have to do it I

738
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,798
just think it's silly I mean I I think

739
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:47,439
it's silly now it's totally silly now

740
00:26:45,798 --> 00:26:49,319
but also like for the sake of all the

741
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,558
people we know and love like we need to

742
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:53,000
be able to send cannabis out of

743
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:54,678
California yeah absolutely and really

744
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,359
most of the market demands California

745
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:58,798
and weed yeah I mean and the thing is I

746
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:00,359
think other States produce prod amazing

747
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:02,759
Oregon produces amazing flow they

748
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:04,038
produce or just far north California

749
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:05,960
let's get real they'll hate me for

750
00:27:04,038 --> 00:27:08,278
saying that but it's the truth I would

751
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,840
say the best growing climate in the

752
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:12,960
whole United States is actually like

753
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:14,519
Southern Oregon oh of course yeah so but

754
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,640
it's that region right the far north of

755
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:18,079
California the far south of Oregon like

756
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,000
that is where some of the best weed

757
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:21,558
comes from yeah especially I mean the

758
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,519
outdoor weed you know indoor can be

759
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:26,079
grown good anywhere right anybody who

760
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:28,359
knows environment and can control your

761
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:31,480
environment fully you can and cure

762
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:35,678
correctly you can grow good flour

763
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:37,200
anywhere pretty much anywhere um but

764
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,399
outdoor I feel like there's only a

765
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,519
limited amount of places that that you

766
00:27:39,398 --> 00:27:44,079
can really you know that really perform

767
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:45,720
well as a whole you know you can grow

768
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,720
autof flowers in certain places that you

769
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,919
wouldn't normally be able to do Alaska's

770
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,038
kind of special they have a really short

771
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:52,960
growing season really long light I think

772
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:54,398
otof flowers go really well there that's

773
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,798
where all the flowers came from is up at

774
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:58,839
the top of the poles right right mhm for

775
00:27:56,798 --> 00:28:01,158
sure so

776
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:04,359
it's it's really interesting moving

777
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:06,278
forward you know genetic wise also

778
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:07,798
Regional and being able to you know we

779
00:28:06,278 --> 00:28:09,599
talk about in the book a little bit

780
00:28:07,798 --> 00:28:11,000
about breeding for specific regions and

781
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:12,639
I think people are starting to get back

782
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,519
to that I mean obviously the big

783
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,200
companies are looking at that but I

784
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:17,759
think a lot of breeders it's on their

785
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,080
mind is like especially if they're

786
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:21,079
breeding for outdoor where they want to

787
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:23,038
produce seeds that go on an acre it's

788
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:26,278
like well are those the optimal seeds

789
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:28,200
for that location as far as climate as

790
00:28:26,278 --> 00:28:30,240
far as elevation and all these other

791
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:33,200
things is like is that the optimal

792
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,558
variety for that and so I think that's

793
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,399
the problem with a lot of these other

794
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:38,879
states like Utah too is they're trying

795
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:40,959
to grow pop popular varieties that were

796
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,559
bred in California well that's happening

797
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,919
all over the world it's like I got guys

798
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:45,798
in the Caribbean they want to grow OG

799
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:47,360
Kush and it's like that's not

800
00:28:45,798 --> 00:28:49,839
necessarily you know and the thing is is

801
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:52,158
maybe you want to grow an OG hybrid but

802
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:53,839
you don't want to just grow OG Kush and

803
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,519
it s or you just you know it's like I

804
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:57,079
want to grow gelato and I want to grow

805
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:58,880
in the Caribbean but I can't wait for

806
00:28:57,079 --> 00:29:00,918
the day that they try to breed strains

807
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,559
that are for where they are and they

808
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:04,278
have that uniqueness to them because any

809
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:05,759
foodie will tell you too like that's

810
00:29:04,278 --> 00:29:07,798
part of why I like going different

811
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:09,558
places to try different things not to

812
00:29:07,798 --> 00:29:11,319
get the same thing grown in a different

813
00:29:09,558 --> 00:29:13,798
climate right and all this will happen

814
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:15,678
over time we're going to like uh

815
00:29:13,798 --> 00:29:17,759
repopulate the world with land race

816
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:20,000
genetics over the next hundred years and

817
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:21,519
so you know I mean through taking

818
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,759
genetics everywhere finding out what

819
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:25,679
works the best it's going to 100 years

820
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:27,240
from now it's going to be pretty wild if

821
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,798
we're all you know obviously we won't be

822
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,399
around 100 years from now but the plant

823
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:31,839
will still be alive okay this is a

824
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:35,599
question I have coming from working on

825
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:37,678
your book yeah what is a land Race So a

826
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:39,918
land race is not a lot of people get

827
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,278
confused they think land race is feral

828
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:44,240
but land race is not that's feral if

829
00:29:42,278 --> 00:29:46,159
we're talking about feral the stuff that

830
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,679
that's indigenous or feral to that

831
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,120
region that's grown on its own and it's

832
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,960
populated and through natural selection

833
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:55,119
that is not what land race is land race

834
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:57,278
is something that's grown for several

835
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:59,959
generations and selected by the people

836
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:01,640
for a spefic specific use or purpose and

837
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:04,240
that's what most people don't know that

838
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:06,440
right but yeah but land race genetics is

839
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,599
Mojave said it best once it leaves the

840
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,399
land the race is over right right and so

841
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:13,398
I have this huge collection of land race

842
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:16,319
genetics where we're using it for

843
00:30:13,398 --> 00:30:18,119
breeding potential um and so where we

844
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:19,839
can test it out in different regions and

845
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:22,798
then hybridize it and see how those

846
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:25,240
hybrids work uh I have my friend fritzy

847
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:27,720
he's going around uh next month he'll be

848
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,599
over in Asia looking for more seeds for

849
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,000
us

850
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:31,798
and we're constantly looking for new

851
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,480
things for the gene pool so that we can

852
00:30:31,798 --> 00:30:38,720
test it and see how it performs and how

853
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:40,798
it can benefit us but I think as a whole

854
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,240
you know even in 10 or 15 years the

855
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:44,200
landscape is going to change completely

856
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:47,159
breeding I mean there's a lot of science

857
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:48,558
going into it but uh you know geoc

858
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:50,278
climatized we use the word geoc

859
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:52,278
climatized in the book and Reggie told

860
00:30:50,278 --> 00:30:54,200
me that was a good good idea by the way

861
00:30:52,278 --> 00:30:56,159
to use geoc climatized I've been

862
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:58,319
criticized by people for using the word

863
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:01,320
geoc climatized because it's almost like

864
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:03,759
you're putting new land race genetics in

865
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:06,439
places and optimizing those for the

866
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:07,879
specific conditions that but you are

867
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:10,080
yeah that's the idea right that's the

868
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:12,320
point is trying to optimize genetics for

869
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:14,000
specific locations and you know that's

870
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:16,839
the future that's the future of genetics

871
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,720
and I think to say that everybody's just

872
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:21,119
going to grow indoors that's silly I

873
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,919
think we have this amazing light called

874
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:27,719
the Sun and if we can we can utilize

875
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:29,360
that uh either wholly or partially I do

876
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,880
love love mixed light because I feel

877
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:33,439
like it gives you a mix of an amazing

878
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,880
product that gets the benefit of the sun

879
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,519
and the light and the control of the

880
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,639
environment well and we know that THC

881
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,839
production is a response to UV light

882
00:31:39,638 --> 00:31:42,319
right and so that's what's exciting

883
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:43,879
about people actually starting to breed

884
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:45,879
in different parts of the world Beyond

885
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:48,000
California is that there's a different

886
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,880
spectrum of light in different places

887
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,319
that's what's going to bring out

888
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,480
different canabo right different Tarpin

889
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:54,439
different flavonoids different

890
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,159
everything yeah and you can take well

891
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:58,798
the the beauty of this plant is you can

892
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:01,679
take OG kush or any other cultivar that

893
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:04,480
you know and you can grow it here

894
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:06,600
Outdoors you can grow it in Washington

895
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:10,000
you can grow it in Texas in some parts

896
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:12,719
of Texas some parts of Arizona Mexico or

897
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,440
Costa Rica or the Caribbean and if you

898
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,120
were to take that flower and put it side

899
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,840
by side it would all look like a

900
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:22,638
different expression because phenotype

901
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:24,398
is basically uh affected by nutrition

902
00:32:22,638 --> 00:32:25,918
and environment so the second you change

903
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:27,959
the environment you can have a

904
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,200
completely different looking plant with

905
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:32,480
different tpine expressions or

906
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:35,319
flavorants as we call them in the book

907
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:37,599
thanks to the white papers from abstract

908
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:39,000
Tech um that was an interesting thing

909
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:40,678
that happened while we were working on

910
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
the book right like everyone was very

911
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:44,919
focused on tpin as far as flavor and

912
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,638
smell and that's that study came out

913
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:49,000
while we were working on the book and we

914
00:32:46,638 --> 00:32:51,519
had to reorient how we thought about

915
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,638
these things while we were writing it

916
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,079
well and I think we talked a little bit

917
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:57,918
about THS and then once they came out

918
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:59,839
with those white papers it was like okay

919
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:02,559
it's on we need to change the book and

920
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:04,918
that was actually really cool I love uh

921
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:07,638
watching science unfold in real time

922
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:09,759
it's like you know them discover and

923
00:33:07,638 --> 00:33:12,000
these are sulfur based compounds and

924
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:13,638
talking about sulfur-based compounds and

925
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,679
fils on another because we just talked

926
00:33:13,638 --> 00:33:19,119
about fils being like you know the gas

927
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:22,038
the skunk the ammonia that you smelling

928
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:24,518
stuff and they started really you know I

929
00:33:22,038 --> 00:33:26,558
think they changed history on a level

930
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:27,440
that people haven't done in a long time

931
00:33:26,558 --> 00:33:28,918
especially when we're having this

932
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,080
convers about just tping because

933
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:35,159
everyone's so focused on

934
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:37,119
saying this tpine and it's like you know

935
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:39,600
it's just limey and it's so much more

936
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:41,119
than that a lot of times it's hard for

937
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:43,158
us to get out of this mindset of a

938
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:45,599
single molecule yeah right like we're

939
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:47,240
all so focused on this one thing doing

940
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:49,319
this one thing and that's just not

941
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,638
nature right that's not how nature works

942
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:51,678
well and if it gets me really high it

943
00:33:50,638 --> 00:33:54,359
must be

944
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:56,120
THC right and I can't wait for the

945
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:58,000
moment when we don't care about THC in

946
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:59,879
the same way people don't buy wine by

947
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,359
looking at the alcohol content and going

948
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:04,480
well this is the highest alcohol it must

949
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:07,519
be the best wine some bums do but most

950
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:10,240
people do not right so what was your

951
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:12,599
favorite part about editing the book

952
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:15,759
okay my favorite part about editing your

953
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:17,879
book right was I had known you but I

954
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:20,919
didn't know you that well yet and you

955
00:34:17,878 --> 00:34:23,519
have a background in in the chef's world

956
00:34:20,918 --> 00:34:25,078
right like a colonary experience and so

957
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:27,719
when we got to a part where you were

958
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:30,320
talking about breeding based on FL

959
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:33,279
flavors and flavor pairings that kind of

960
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:35,399
spoke to me as an amateur Chef a lot and

961
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,919
so I kind of got really into that

962
00:34:35,398 --> 00:34:38,679
especially because I know when people

963
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:40,158
pick out varieties they're always

964
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:42,398
looking at how different flavors and

965
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:44,599
scents make you feel and how you seem to

966
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:47,279
be naturally attracted to things that

967
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:48,879
will make an effect that you like um

968
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,679
talking to you made me buy the flavor

969
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:52,519
Bible yeah that's one of the best books

970
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:54,838
out there oh I took it home and it's

971
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:56,838
like I cook all my own food from scratch

972
00:34:54,838 --> 00:34:59,719
raw ingredients because of my Crohn's

973
00:34:56,838 --> 00:35:01,440
disease right and so that chapter like

974
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:03,519
spoke to me in a way that I like went

975
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,519
home and started like studying flavor

976
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:09,159
pairings in a way and so that was really

977
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:11,239
a cool experience to me of like don't

978
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:13,799
just enjoy cannabis don't just sniff

979
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:15,759
stuff and smoke that you like but like

980
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,640
really make this thing exactly what you

981
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,280
want it to be and like that's kind of

982
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:20,838
what I pulled from your book which was

983
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,960
cool and you could only get that from a

984
00:35:20,838 --> 00:35:23,960
chef's

985
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,400
perspective yeah and you know the thing

986
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,000
is is with breeding there's so many

987
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:29,039
different directions you can go and

988
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,480
there's no one right way to do it and

989
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:32,000
everybody has their own way and

990
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,800
especially with the selection process

991
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,199
because it's so subjective to the

992
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:40,480
individual and I think uh you know as a

993
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:41,879
chef there's some breeders that breed

994
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,320
they just breed what they want and what

995
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,920
they would smoke and I think that's a

996
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:47,800
great way to do it too cool bro yeah

997
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,480
right yeah yeah yeah but like oh this is

998
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,720
what I love and I'm G to breed this

999
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,480
because I love this and that's a

1000
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:57,000
beautiful approach too but my Approach

1001
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:58,960
is as a chef is I know what people like

1002
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,519
right as a chef you have to learn what

1003
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,720
people like even though I like weird

1004
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:05,880
stuff I like weird food I love love it

1005
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:08,358
yeah and so I like exotic stuff and I

1006
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:10,358
like octopus with olive oil and crunchy

1007
00:36:08,358 --> 00:36:12,358
salt cool want to try it now that you

1008
00:36:10,358 --> 00:36:14,920
said it yeah it's it's so good you know

1009
00:36:12,358 --> 00:36:17,318
especially mediterranian octopus is just

1010
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:18,760
amazing and then it has especially if

1011
00:36:17,318 --> 00:36:20,920
you do it right with the potatoes you

1012
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:23,079
have soft potatoes and then a little

1013
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:25,720
paprika on there and it's like this this

1014
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:28,318
flavor combination it's amazing but I I

1015
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:29,799
dissect cannabis just as wood food and I

1016
00:36:28,318 --> 00:36:32,039
reverse engineer everything that I do

1017
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:34,599
I'm constantly like okay how can we pull

1018
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:36,838
this apart and look at it from each

1019
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:39,519
component and try to optimize it

1020
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:41,000
whatever it is uh and then it goes that

1021
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:42,440
you know with cannabis it's like there's

1022
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,239
so many different things too like it

1023
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:47,880
also this day and age we want stuff that

1024
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:50,439
is that will function in a large scale

1025
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:52,200
facility uh it's not just something that

1026
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:54,480
like even though I love breeding for

1027
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:56,480
flavor you know and we might save

1028
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,039
something that's really amazing we won't

1029
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,679
necessarily release a cut of it or

1030
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:00,920
anything like that but we have that we

1031
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:02,239
we have that on the back burner we can

1032
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:04,000
use it for breeding because it's so

1033
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:06,239
special most of it has to be

1034
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,800
commercially viable of course right and

1035
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:10,719
so

1036
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,720
unfortunately I guess unfortunately

1037
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:13,118
unfortunately these are all just

1038
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:14,399
breeding goals that you have like if

1039
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,680
you're going to sell seeds people want

1040
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,480
to get a certain yield off them and so

1041
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:20,639
that's just a reality sure and so that

1042
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,480
needs to be one of the check boxes like

1043
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:24,118
does it yield or what does it yield so

1044
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,000
you can inform people so but what is

1045
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:28,318
lost when we focus on yield or THC right

1046
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,358
and I think that that is like the

1047
00:37:28,318 --> 00:37:32,239
education that the the consumer Market

1048
00:37:30,358 --> 00:37:34,078
is missing right it's same with food if

1049
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:35,479
we focused on the apples that produced

1050
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,920
the most we want to get the apples with

1051
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:39,400
flavor yeah and we we don't understand

1052
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,200
that and I can't wait till cannabis kind

1053
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:44,639
of comes around to these understandings

1054
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:46,199
we already have from eating right well

1055
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:47,559
and there is a balance right so like

1056
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:49,279
there's there's a balance and a

1057
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:50,759
threshold and there there's a point

1058
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,640
where it's like if it yields so much

1059
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:55,720
it's probably not going to taste amazing

1060
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:57,879
never there's commercial agriculture is

1061
00:37:55,719 --> 00:38:00,358
high yield translate to Great Flav

1062
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:02,240
totally you look at wine you look at

1063
00:38:00,358 --> 00:38:04,039
produce you you look at pretty much

1064
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:06,118
everything and a lot of times they're

1065
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:07,759
having to pump synthetics into it to get

1066
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:10,358
it to produce like that what are the

1067
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,880
best tomatoes heirloom tomatoes the ones

1068
00:38:10,358 --> 00:38:15,358
some grew at home yeah grown grown by

1069
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,760
grandma or grown by me or whoever it is

1070
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:19,799
it's like those absolutely and I'm an

1071
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,960
Italian I make a lot of delicious tomato

1072
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,200
sauce and I will not make a tomato sauce

1073
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,519
with store-bought

1074
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:28,519
Tomatoes yeah you well you got to go to

1075
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:30,719
brookley bowl and even a good store and

1076
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:33,079
get the fancy Tomatoes but even the

1077
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:34,559
fanciest Tomatoes at the best stores

1078
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:37,720
aren't as good as the stuff that comes

1079
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:39,000
off of my bindes at my house MH um the

1080
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:41,879
ones that make your fingers smell like

1081
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,239
tomatoes cuz of the tpin exactly MH I do

1082
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:47,640
the stem rub and I get that I love that

1083
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:50,318
green yeah totally M so yeah and it's

1084
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:52,118
like uh I just I love tomatoes too and I

1085
00:38:50,318 --> 00:38:53,719
I have Crohns as well and so I really

1086
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:55,240
don't eat a lot of tomatoes because

1087
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:57,879
they're night shades everybody has

1088
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:59,719
Crohn's now yeah everybody body's got a

1089
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,200
digestive disorder now to totally

1090
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:03,318
autoimmune diseases are just at an

1091
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:05,480
all-time high for sure I have some

1092
00:39:03,318 --> 00:39:07,679
theories about it yeah right A lot of it

1093
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,119
is immune stuff in general right is like

1094
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:11,480
there's a study that was done on the

1095
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:14,039
border of Poland and Russia yeah Poland

1096
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:17,159
is part of the EU Russia is not and in

1097
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:18,880
Poland it's like super sterile like in

1098
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:20,598
their train stations they keep that [ __ ]

1099
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,358
sterile yeah don't do the same thing in

1100
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:25,359
Russia right you can also map out

1101
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:27,719
incidences of autoimmune disease on that

1102
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:29,598
border and find that they are like 10

1103
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:31,439
higher on the Poland side than they are

1104
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:34,880
on the Russia side despite people having

1105
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,880
similar genetics yeah sterility is on

1106
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,480
the side where everybody has it totally

1107
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:41,400
but I also think it's um western

1108
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:44,000
civilization and the diets that we live

1109
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:45,480
on here too and I think there's all

1110
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,400
there's so many contributing factors

1111
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:51,679
it's not just one thing I think uh

1112
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:53,480
glyat yeah is a huge one you know and

1113
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:56,399
then just our our diets we're not eating

1114
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:58,639
as nutritious of produce and as you know

1115
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,200
I think I think the protein has changed

1116
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:02,000
we used to have more diversity in our

1117
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:04,598
diets uh and then you look at the

1118
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,920
lettuce and and things like that and

1119
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:09,559
it's it's completely different than it

1120
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:12,800
was in the 50s and before and so I think

1121
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:15,599
uh pesticides changed after World War II

1122
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:17,560
and that has an effect on it possibly I

1123
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:20,039
mean I'm not an expert on all this and

1124
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:21,679
I'm always trying to think about like

1125
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:25,440
why I am the way I am because I have a

1126
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:28,000
lot of food allergies a lot and also

1127
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:30,838
cannabis helps uh even though I have a

1128
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,960
slight cannabis allergy with it gives me

1129
00:40:30,838 --> 00:40:36,039
a little rash which it does to a lot of

1130
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:38,240
people we get rashes but uh the the

1131
00:40:36,039 --> 00:40:40,559
actually ingesting it helps me if I

1132
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:42,358
smoke it more than if I eat it I don't

1133
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:44,000
really feel great when I eat it as as

1134
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:45,799
great as I do when I smoke it I yeah I

1135
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
don't like eating weed I never do I

1136
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:50,240
always prefer to inhale or tinctures at

1137
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,838
best but I prefer inhaling yeah

1138
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:55,559
tinctures are okay I'm I'm okay with

1139
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:58,078
some tinctures um Amber Alchemy ures are

1140
00:40:55,559 --> 00:41:00,440
really good the best tinure I have ever

1141
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:03,359
had I made myself and here was what was

1142
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:05,119
in it it was I was using a volcano Vape

1143
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:07,279
yeah and I was dumping my leftover Vape

1144
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:09,119
into a jar and then I put some fresh

1145
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,240
butt in there and then I put some fresh

1146
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:15,039
decarbox butt in there so this was like

1147
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:16,759
a sausage of like cannabis leftovers and

1148
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:18,639
I made a tincture out of that and I've

1149
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:20,880
never felt better and I handed it out to

1150
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:24,838
other patients than I knew they loved

1151
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:27,079
the sausage leftovers I as well too and

1152
00:41:24,838 --> 00:41:28,719
I think it's because of the diversity

1153
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:30,640
right like the diversity of what ended

1154
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:32,719
up in that jar at the end was something

1155
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:35,118
you can't recreate on a commercial level

1156
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:36,358
but people loved it well from one batch

1157
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,800
to next it's going to be completely

1158
00:41:36,358 --> 00:41:40,279
different I couldn't recreate that

1159
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:41,880
tinure never I could never recreate that

1160
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,720
tinure well and that's you know

1161
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,200
homegrown flowers is a lot like that too

1162
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:46,639
from one batch to the next it comes out

1163
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:48,480
slightly different and sometimes it's

1164
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:52,318
absolutely amazing and anybody who says

1165
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:53,838
they grow A+ plus plus wheed every time

1166
00:41:52,318 --> 00:41:55,318
they're kidding themselves because I

1167
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:58,239
feel like the best Growers it's always

1168
00:41:55,318 --> 00:42:00,639
good like certain Growers

1169
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:03,358
um myself included I feel like it's

1170
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:06,400
always good when I grow but there's

1171
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:08,920
times where it's just above and beyond

1172
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:11,160
that was a special round or the genetics

1173
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:13,318
just performed really well that time or

1174
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:15,519
you get to know a certain cultivar and

1175
00:42:13,318 --> 00:42:16,960
then you're like okay well I know that

1176
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:18,920
we could we need to veg it a little bit

1177
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:21,159
longer and then we need to top it a few

1178
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:23,559
times and it really loves when I clean

1179
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:25,480
out the the undercarriage completely and

1180
00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:26,839
thin quite a bit more than other things

1181
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:29,400
and some things they don't like to be

1182
00:42:26,838 --> 00:42:31,480
thin the same so knowing your cul of

1183
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:33,358
ours is like half the battle I wrote

1184
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:36,039
this article about cannabis and Crohn's

1185
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:37,759
in 2013 and it went viral and I've had

1186
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:40,159
people to this day still reaching out to

1187
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,960
me about it and I regret it and I regret

1188
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:44,118
it because I made it sound like cannabis

1189
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:45,679
is what put my Crohns in remission and I

1190
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:48,240
didn't understand at the time that that

1191
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:49,960
was not the case yeah um and I think

1192
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:51,598
it's a really important thing to talk

1193
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:53,480
about because I've had so many people

1194
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:55,920
reach out to me and the main question

1195
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:57,760
they ask is what's the strain I should

1196
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,639
use for my Crohn's disease

1197
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,359
and they hate me because every single

1198
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:04,639
time I give them this long complicated

1199
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:06,759
answer that the tldr is I can't give you

1200
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:08,519
that answer yeah right there is no good

1201
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:10,599
answer for that like cannabis can't cure

1202
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:12,318
your Crohn's disease there's no one

1203
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:14,240
thing that you can buy that's going to

1204
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:16,679
cure your Crohn's disease you need to

1205
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:18,519
get sleep you need to get hydration you

1206
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:20,960
need to eat a whole food diet you need

1207
00:43:18,519 --> 00:43:23,599
to cut out sugar and processed foods all

1208
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:25,519
of these things feed toally fried food

1209
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:29,440
yeah I I think for me fried foods was

1210
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:31,280
the the worst but also I got Crohn's

1211
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,880
worse it came out of remission fully

1212
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:36,920
when I quit smoking oh yeah cigarettes

1213
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:38,559
are terrible for it uhhuh y well

1214
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:42,119
cannabis when I when I quit smoking

1215
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:44,480
cannabis uhhuh and you forced to quit

1216
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:46,880
but I I quit smoking and I was fine for

1217
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,719
like the first six months and then I got

1218
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:51,280
like the worst I'd ever had and I lost

1219
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:53,039
about 25 pounds in a month why were you

1220
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:56,599
forced to quit smoking the federal

1221
00:43:53,039 --> 00:44:00,159
government oh so yeah they they I had to

1222
00:43:56,599 --> 00:44:02,119
pee and it was all it was really bad so

1223
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:03,960
they'll do that I read this study called

1224
00:44:02,119 --> 00:44:07,440
care and feeding of the endoc canabo

1225
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:08,920
system um that is really what changed my

1226
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,679
perspective on a lot of this because it

1227
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:12,639
was a survey study so it's not just a

1228
00:44:10,679 --> 00:44:14,759
study where they look at 15 people and

1229
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:16,799
Report their results it is researchers

1230
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:18,960
looking at the body of research that

1231
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:22,160
exists and summarizing it yeah they

1232
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:24,440
looked at pharmaceutical drugs Alcohol

1233
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:26,558
Tobacco cannabis anything that can

1234
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:29,400
affect your endocannabinoid system what

1235
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:31,519
balances it what upgrades uh upregulates

1236
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,800
it what down regulates it and what they

1237
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:37,920
found was what keeps the balance in your

1238
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:40,599
endoc canabo system was sleep hydration

1239
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:42,880
exercise whole food diet right so these

1240
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:44,680
aren't things I can sell to anybody and

1241
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,280
nobody ever wants me to say this to them

1242
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:48,399
that there's not one thing that'll fix

1243
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:51,559
this but that is what will fix it is a

1244
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:55,318
radical lifestyle change MH and it's not

1245
00:44:51,559 --> 00:44:57,559
the easiest thing to do it's not and I

1246
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:59,358
think a lot of it from for me starts

1247
00:44:57,559 --> 00:45:00,280
with exercise like I've lost a lot of

1248
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:02,719
weight this

1249
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:05,640
year and it started with just going to

1250
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:07,000
the gym and waking up and doing it even

1251
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:08,279
if I had to sit in the car 30 minutes

1252
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,679
and thought about going to the gym if I

1253
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,880
got in there and so you know Lifestyle

1254
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:14,960
Changes aren't

1255
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,358
easy and your mind will tell you the

1256
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,119
opposite like oh you don't need to do

1257
00:45:16,358 --> 00:45:19,400
this or oh you're getting up a little

1258
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:21,160
later so you don't need to go to the gym

1259
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,720
today or you don't need to do this and a

1260
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:25,039
lot of times you just got to prioritize

1261
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:26,759
yourself that's what I found we also

1262
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:28,159
live these lives that are too busy and

1263
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:30,400
that's kind of what makes our health

1264
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:32,639
degrade right is it's really hard to

1265
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:34,280
schedule in gym time it's really hard to

1266
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:36,279
schedule in time to make your food from

1267
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:38,200
scratch right this is why people eat

1268
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:39,440
processed food is because you can just

1269
00:45:38,199 --> 00:45:41,519
throw it in your mouth while you're

1270
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,720
driving somewhere right but you'll pay

1271
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:46,000
the price for that cheapness

1272
00:45:43,719 --> 00:45:48,199
later yeah you know it's like I love

1273
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,440
cooking as a chef I love taking the

1274
00:45:48,199 --> 00:45:52,118
whole day to prepare a meal you know you

1275
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:53,880
go shopping and then you spend a few

1276
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:55,480
hours cooking minimum a few hours

1277
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:57,640
sometimes five hours cooking and I love

1278
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:59,599
doing that there's like this whole

1279
00:45:57,639 --> 00:46:02,039
meditation side to that that I love like

1280
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:04,400
getting going back to like a culinary

1281
00:46:02,039 --> 00:46:06,279
school where I learn knife skills you

1282
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:09,000
know and I love cutting my vegetables

1283
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:11,359
all exactly the same size and perfect

1284
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,440
dices tiny little vegetables is what

1285
00:46:11,358 --> 00:46:15,480
makes food so good yeah and all these

1286
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:19,200
things but I don't have time for that

1287
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:21,000
and so I eat pretty basic now but like I

1288
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:22,558
I'm able to cook my meals really fast

1289
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
and I I do a lot of whole food like

1290
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:27,119
steak I do steak and chicken I do steak

1291
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,639
with chicken love steak by itself myself

1292
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:30,160
I love chicken by myself and I love them

1293
00:46:28,639 --> 00:46:33,318
together and I do these burritos now

1294
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:35,558
they like steak and chicken burritos so

1295
00:46:33,318 --> 00:46:38,400
see and I was a vegetarian for 15 years

1296
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:40,079
and I had to like break that seal to be

1297
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,960
able to get healthy because basically I

1298
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:45,318
eat meat and vegetables now and that has

1299
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:47,039
been my life-saving situation I was a

1300
00:46:45,318 --> 00:46:49,239
severe case of Crohn's I've had a third

1301
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:51,440
of my colon surgically removed and

1302
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:53,558
moving to a diet with no processed foods

1303
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,480
where I eat meat fruits vegetables has

1304
00:46:53,559 --> 00:46:57,480
been kind of what has really put me in

1305
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:59,480
remission more than cannabis the goal

1306
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:01,880
has been to not need cannabis unless I

1307
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:04,639
need cannabis and I use cannabis instead

1308
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:06,480
of a Tylenol or something else yeah did

1309
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:08,078
you do an Elimination Diet to figure out

1310
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,199
what worked and what didn't work oh

1311
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:11,920
absolutely and so like the diet that I'm

1312
00:47:10,199 --> 00:47:13,399
on is called the specific carbohydrate

1313
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,519
diet and if it doesn't work for you

1314
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:17,800
there's four things that you remove that

1315
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:20,119
are okay on the diet to see what what

1316
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:24,760
doesn't what's causing the problem it's

1317
00:47:20,119 --> 00:47:26,559
eggs nuts um legal sugars as they call

1318
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:29,720
it which is from fruit and honey and the

1319
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:31,800
other Dairy and I found out depressingly

1320
00:47:29,719 --> 00:47:33,919
that it's eggs for me like I I just

1321
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,640
cannot eat eggs I can't do it I love

1322
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,079
eggs I do 10 egg whites before I go to

1323
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:39,199
bed every night love them they don't

1324
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:42,039
love me right so as soon as I cut eggs

1325
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:45,239
out of my diet my life changed

1326
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:47,440
wow so then were you tried before you

1327
00:47:45,239 --> 00:47:50,679
had any part of your intestines removed

1328
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:54,318
did you uh or your your

1329
00:47:50,679 --> 00:47:55,919
colon yeah which is yeah I mean that's

1330
00:47:54,318 --> 00:47:57,279
that's a pretty serious operation people

1331
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,838
don't realize how important and your

1332
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:01,800
colon is until there's a problem with it

1333
00:47:59,838 --> 00:48:03,440
right and did you quit you you were

1334
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,680
smoking cannabis and tried that and it

1335
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,400
didn't fully work okay see that's funny

1336
00:48:05,679 --> 00:48:10,480
right because I started smoking cannabis

1337
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:13,280
in high school it turned my life around

1338
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:15,240
I was intentionally failing myself out

1339
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,640
of honors classes in high school I was

1340
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:19,598
in a Catholic High School and I was so

1341
00:48:17,639 --> 00:48:21,159
mad about it right so I was

1342
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:23,400
intentionally failing myself out of

1343
00:48:21,159 --> 00:48:25,759
these classes I get high for the first

1344
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,480
time and I'm just like well [ __ ] if I go

1345
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,880
to college I get a leave this bum [ __ ]

1346
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:31,639
town right so all of a sudden I start

1347
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:33,720
turning in straight A and I start

1348
00:48:31,639 --> 00:48:36,519
smoking cannabis I was getting symptoms

1349
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:38,519
at about the exact same time wow by the

1350
00:48:36,519 --> 00:48:40,800
time I was diagnosed I had just turned

1351
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:43,679
18 I was days away from moving to San

1352
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:46,160
Francisco for college um and I had this

1353
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:48,118
weird mindset which was like well you've

1354
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:52,159
got a serious illness now you can't do

1355
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:54,039
drugs so I stopped smoking weed and my

1356
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:56,798
first 6 months in college at San

1357
00:48:54,039 --> 00:48:59,239
Francisco State I was completely

1358
00:48:56,798 --> 00:49:01,199
miserable cycling through prazone and a

1359
00:48:59,239 --> 00:49:03,118
bunch of other drugs and basically

1360
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:05,199
starving myself to get through the day

1361
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,400
so I wouldn't feel symptoms I had

1362
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:10,078
emergency surgery during my spring break

1363
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:11,960
to remove the first section of my colon

1364
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:13,720
and right after that I started going to

1365
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:15,960
doctor's appointments in San Francisco

1366
00:49:13,719 --> 00:49:18,039
all the time and I'd pick up the free

1367
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:20,039
newspapers while I was on the bus and on

1368
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:22,798
the back of the free newspapers was all

1369
00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:24,679
kinds of cannabis ads right so I go to a

1370
00:49:22,798 --> 00:49:27,039
cannabis doctor for the first time and I

1371
00:49:24,679 --> 00:49:28,759
go got Crohn's disease is that enough to

1372
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:31,239
get a card and they were like oh yeah

1373
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:32,799
definitely tot right and so that was the

1374
00:49:31,239 --> 00:49:35,239
first time I got a card and I didn't

1375
00:49:32,798 --> 00:49:37,039
take it seriously I was buying weed for

1376
00:49:35,239 --> 00:49:39,719
my roommates because I was the one who

1377
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:42,719
could get into a club um but I

1378
00:49:39,719 --> 00:49:44,838
definitely started moving towards being

1379
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:46,639
a more natural organic type of person

1380
00:49:44,838 --> 00:49:48,400
who didn't take pharmaceutical drugs

1381
00:49:46,639 --> 00:49:50,558
because of that because I'd walk into a

1382
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,160
dispensary and at the time like these

1383
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:53,839
are these old dispensaries in San

1384
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:56,759
Francisco where they're giving you a

1385
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:59,078
Ziploc bag with a computer printer label

1386
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:02,480
on the variety and people are smoking in

1387
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:04,160
the sales floor um but I met people in

1388
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,719
there who were patients and they were

1389
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:08,759
talking about peing patience and I

1390
00:50:05,719 --> 00:50:10,318
started like thinking about my own use

1391
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,920
in a different way and that's kind of

1392
00:50:10,318 --> 00:50:14,318
what pushed me on the path that I ended

1393
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:17,400
up on there were some really cool clubs

1394
00:50:14,318 --> 00:50:19,519
in San Francisco 14th was the big one

1395
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:22,720
for me 14th in Mission I used to go

1396
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:25,559
there quite a bit um and there was one

1397
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:28,039
on Ocean I used to I used to vent to all

1398
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:30,680
these places too and spark smoke your

1399
00:50:28,039 --> 00:50:32,759
weed you never know right yeah mine are

1400
00:50:30,679 --> 00:50:35,118
my friends or you know spark was a big

1401
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:38,240
deal for me back uh a long time ago they

1402
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:40,160
used you they were amazing great company

1403
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:42,118
um you know they they bought CO2 when it

1404
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:43,920
was crude and were using it for Edibles

1405
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:46,838
and doing all kinds of stuff my friends

1406
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:49,039
got the first like Eden Labs extractor

1407
00:50:46,838 --> 00:50:50,440
when it was for for CO2 when it would

1408
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:52,358
just pump out peanut butter looking

1409
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:53,760
crude it's disgusting you couldn't

1410
00:50:52,358 --> 00:50:55,078
really smoke it they were trying to

1411
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,920
convince everybody that yeah you just

1412
00:50:55,079 --> 00:50:58,720
smoke it and it's way healthier but it

1413
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:02,480
was like it was the crude of crude it

1414
00:50:58,719 --> 00:51:05,639
was like crude oil and so but SM spark

1415
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:07,280
ended up interested in purchasing it so

1416
00:51:05,639 --> 00:51:10,078
it kind of helped pay for their machine

1417
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:11,960
which was great at 20 bucks a gram back

1418
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:13,359
then which I think it's probably for

1419
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:16,599
that kind of stuff would be a dollar a

1420
00:51:13,358 --> 00:51:18,279
gram now or a couple dollars a gram but

1421
00:51:16,599 --> 00:51:20,400
yeah and then you know there was Steve

1422
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:22,680
d'angel and Andrew over at Harborside

1423
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:25,400
they were doing it for a long time and

1424
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:27,159
uh the third floor I knew Sean and Mary

1425
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,880
well yeah they were work with them a

1426
00:51:27,159 --> 00:51:31,159
little bit that's where my wife and I

1427
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:33,480
both got our cards I Frank lcio was my

1428
00:51:31,159 --> 00:51:34,759
first doctor that gave me my card Frank

1429
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:37,960
yeah he was amazing

1430
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:40,280
Frank he should have written a book so

1431
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:42,079
he he still could he can still write he

1432
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:44,559
just retired know writing a book is not

1433
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:46,798
like a casual thing right like it's a

1434
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:49,798
big [ __ ] project it's an undertaking

1435
00:51:46,798 --> 00:51:52,280
and then I mean people don't know most

1436
00:51:49,798 --> 00:51:54,719
people don't know how much goes into a

1437
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:56,200
book as far as like I didn't understand

1438
00:51:54,719 --> 00:51:58,239
I thought I could maybe do the layout

1439
00:51:56,199 --> 00:51:59,960
right do the graphics or all that stuff

1440
00:51:58,239 --> 00:52:02,318
we had to get a graph we had multiple

1441
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:04,960
graphic designers multiple

1442
00:52:02,318 --> 00:52:06,759
photographers an editor we had Reggie

1443
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,838
who helped and there you know there

1444
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:11,280
there was just so many people that

1445
00:52:08,838 --> 00:52:13,279
contributed this or that or a handful of

1446
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:15,559
photos like okay we need photos of land

1447
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:18,440
race stuff well I don't grow a ton of

1448
00:52:15,559 --> 00:52:21,079
land race genetics I mean I plan on but

1449
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:22,400
as far as like we went to several people

1450
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:23,599
and you know and then people said oh

1451
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,880
yeah I got this and then they don't

1452
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:28,798
respond and and if you get them they may

1453
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:31,079
not be high quality we went through that

1454
00:52:28,798 --> 00:52:32,480
for sure but yeah and I was able to

1455
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:34,280
feature a lot of case studies in the

1456
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:36,880
book and I thought that was a lot of fun

1457
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:38,400
I I love doing textbox case studies and

1458
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,880
books especially like your book because

1459
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:42,480
your book is a textbook right so there's

1460
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,760
there's an information load but then

1461
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,079
there's also giving life to the

1462
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,599
information and the text box give life

1463
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:49,359
to the information and being able to

1464
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:52,160
talk about specific strains that people

1465
00:52:49,358 --> 00:52:53,798
know I think gives life to the content

1466
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:55,679
that was fully your idea by the way and

1467
00:52:53,798 --> 00:52:57,559
so that just you know and then I then

1468
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:58,759
you gave me the idea and then it's like

1469
00:52:57,559 --> 00:53:00,640
okay let's run with this and we're going

1470
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:02,680
to talk about Sour Diesel we'll do case

1471
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:03,960
studies on this and case studies on that

1472
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:06,000
I think I wrote more case studies than

1473
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:07,838
we included in the book A A lot of that

1474
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,358
came from the first grow book I ever

1475
00:53:07,838 --> 00:53:13,519
worked on between 2008 and 2010 I was a

1476
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:15,558
student at Mills College at the time and

1477
00:53:13,519 --> 00:53:17,119
I had brought my own textbooks knowing

1478
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:18,519
that we were making this one as an Oaker

1479
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:20,318
Dam textbook and I was looking through

1480
00:53:18,519 --> 00:53:22,159
it and I remember that was the thing

1481
00:53:20,318 --> 00:53:24,039
that stood out to me as case studies

1482
00:53:22,159 --> 00:53:25,558
about different businesses to explain

1483
00:53:24,039 --> 00:53:27,318
the business Concepts we're talking

1484
00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:29,920
about so I pulled that into that first

1485
00:53:27,318 --> 00:53:31,239
grow book that I did in a big way and

1486
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:33,039
it's just something that's carried over

1487
00:53:31,239 --> 00:53:34,959
in a lot of the Cannabis textbooks that

1488
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:36,639
I've done because there's giving

1489
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:39,000
information and there's giving life to

1490
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:41,519
information and those text box that just

1491
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,679
does it in a different way yeah

1492
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:45,599
totally yeah so let's talk about high

1493
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:47,239
price because I think that is an amazing

1494
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:49,680
book you're the one who introduced me to

1495
00:53:47,239 --> 00:53:52,000
Luke scarmazzo I've had him on the show

1496
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:53,639
a couple times we filmed some really

1497
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,559
cool stuff together he's just an amazing

1498
00:53:53,639 --> 00:53:57,679
person and you met him when he was in

1499
00:53:55,559 --> 00:53:59,640
prison right you know it's interesting

1500
00:53:57,679 --> 00:54:01,719
cuz I heard about Luke a lot before I

1501
00:53:59,639 --> 00:54:04,078
actually met him because he was the guy

1502
00:54:01,719 --> 00:54:06,358
who made the music video where he goes

1503
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:08,039
[ __ ] the feds and the FEDS said [ __ ] you

1504
00:54:06,358 --> 00:54:10,960
and they put him into a federal prison

1505
00:54:08,039 --> 00:54:12,679
with a 21-year sentence right and so

1506
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:14,519
right around the time that Obama was

1507
00:54:12,679 --> 00:54:17,358
about to transition out and Trump was

1508
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:19,119
about to transition in both Luke gazo's

1509
00:54:17,358 --> 00:54:20,519
daughter and his partner Ricardo

1510
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:23,160
montes's daughter were doing a

1511
00:54:20,519 --> 00:54:26,039
change.org petition trying to get Obama

1512
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:28,199
to Pardon their dad's right um and so I

1513
00:54:26,039 --> 00:54:30,798
I talk to Ricardo in prison I talked to

1514
00:54:28,199 --> 00:54:33,159
Luke in prison it ended with Ricardo

1515
00:54:30,798 --> 00:54:36,480
getting that clemency but Luke didn't

1516
00:54:33,159 --> 00:54:38,558
get the clemency but I really enjoyed

1517
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,920
talking to Luke so it turned into the

1518
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:43,000
situation where Luke and I kind of

1519
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:44,798
became pen pals for many years um and

1520
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,679
right before the pandemic Luke ended up

1521
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:50,639
in solitary confinement for a long time

1522
00:54:47,679 --> 00:54:53,558
a long time he traded a lot of his meals

1523
00:54:50,639 --> 00:54:55,440
for paper and pen and he wrote a book

1524
00:54:53,559 --> 00:54:57,280
and he knew what I did for work so he

1525
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:59,519
was like Angela can I send you my book

1526
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:01,079
to check out and I'm like sure okay a

1527
00:54:59,519 --> 00:55:02,440
lot of people have sent me books that

1528
00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:04,359
they wanted to publish over the years

1529
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:06,200
and I skim through them and I'm like oh

1530
00:55:04,358 --> 00:55:10,239
this is too much this is a mess this

1531
00:55:06,199 --> 00:55:12,598
will never happen Luke's book I sat down

1532
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:14,919
I start reading the next three or four

1533
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:17,400
days after I woke myself up early and

1534
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:20,079
you know I wake up early I woke up even

1535
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:22,240
earlier turned the coffee pot on so that

1536
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:25,400
I could plow through more of Luke's book

1537
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:28,078
because it was so well written and so

1538
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:29,680
engaging um and so when he did come out

1539
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:32,280
of prison he was like let's publish this

1540
00:55:29,679 --> 00:55:34,919
book I want you to do it um and what was

1541
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:37,039
interesting is the original version of

1542
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:38,920
the book ended with him in solitary

1543
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:41,440
confinement and when you read the book

1544
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:43,480
at the the way it was at the time it was

1545
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:45,400
it was a tear jerker like I broke down

1546
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:48,119
crying at like 5:00 in the morning

1547
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:51,119
reading the ending of this book wow then

1548
00:55:48,119 --> 00:55:53,160
he gets out of prison some time goes by

1549
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:55,480
we're working on the book and it's like

1550
00:55:53,159 --> 00:55:57,519
Luke let's talk about prison a little

1551
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:59,318
bit right CU like the book doesn't talk

1552
00:55:57,519 --> 00:56:00,838
about being in prison right now it just

1553
00:55:59,318 --> 00:56:03,079
talks about what happened leading into

1554
00:56:00,838 --> 00:56:05,400
prison so him and I went into this back

1555
00:56:03,079 --> 00:56:07,000
and forth where we were talking about

1556
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,838
his prison experience where we could

1557
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,838
really actually the book is called high

1558
00:56:08,838 --> 00:56:14,239
price to actually talk about the cost

1559
00:56:11,838 --> 00:56:16,480
like what life was like for 14 years in

1560
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:19,038
prison for Luke gorzo and I think what

1561
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:22,880
we pulled out of it just brought the

1562
00:56:19,039 --> 00:56:24,400
book so full circle but also made a

1563
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,920
stronger Point than we could have made

1564
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,559
while he was still there because now he

1565
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,280
can speak more freely about his

1566
00:56:27,559 --> 00:56:31,039
experience yeah it's a really good book

1567
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:33,319
I think it's really well written and

1568
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:34,880
I've really enjoyed him coming out to

1569
00:56:33,318 --> 00:56:37,798
the facility and we're talking about

1570
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:41,880
doing some seed drops together and some

1571
00:56:37,798 --> 00:56:44,440
other stuff I I love seeing him travel

1572
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:46,119
and you know his Instagram he's he's a

1573
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:48,599
you know he's a traveler he's been going

1574
00:56:46,119 --> 00:56:50,400
all over everywhere to event whether

1575
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:52,680
it's the California State Fair going

1576
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:55,358
over to the east coast doing stuff he

1577
00:56:52,679 --> 00:56:57,719
was in Miami and you know in Florida and

1578
00:56:55,358 --> 00:57:00,078
he's he's been travel traving all over

1579
00:56:57,719 --> 00:57:02,038
you know his his brand profit is doing

1580
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:03,880
really well and I think they're just

1581
00:57:02,039 --> 00:57:07,280
growing exponentially and it's great

1582
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:09,798
seeing someone like him who really

1583
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:12,798
deserves the success of recreational

1584
00:57:09,798 --> 00:57:15,679
Cannabis you know uh growing along with

1585
00:57:12,798 --> 00:57:17,440
this with the system so first profit

1586
00:57:15,679 --> 00:57:18,719
actually has good weed yeah there's not

1587
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:20,639
a lot of good weed in the California

1588
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:23,279
Market that's legal these days right

1589
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:26,719
that's the first thing two Luke has an

1590
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:29,200
enthusiasm for this this industry and

1591
00:57:26,719 --> 00:57:31,399
this world in a way that other people in

1592
00:57:29,199 --> 00:57:33,199
the industry definitely do not have

1593
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:36,039
right now right and I was born of

1594

00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:06,839
think the Cannabis the cancer connection

1609
00:58:05,079 --> 00:58:08,798
is really important okay the Cannabis

1610
00:58:06,838 --> 00:58:10,920
cancer connection is a really cool book

1611
00:58:08,798 --> 00:58:14,119
it's written by a guy named Joe

1612
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:16,318
goldstrich he's an MD and fac and what's

1613
00:58:14,119 --> 00:58:19,798
interesting about Dr Joe is he started

1614
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:21,920
his career as a fellow um in a hospital

1615
00:58:19,798 --> 00:58:24,159
in Dallas and he was one of the seven

1616
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:25,720
people who was in the room when JFK came

1617
00:58:24,159 --> 00:58:28,358
in with the head wound that took his

1618
00:58:25,719 --> 00:58:31,159
life right wow and that really shaped Dr

1619
00:58:28,358 --> 00:58:33,318
Joe's experience he became a pretty

1620
00:58:31,159 --> 00:58:35,798
well-renowned cardiologist over his

1621
00:58:33,318 --> 00:58:37,318
experience he always smoked cannabis he

1622
00:58:35,798 --> 00:58:39,318
was always kind of healthc conscious I

1623
00:58:37,318 --> 00:58:41,798
mean this was the 60s when he was coming

1624
00:58:39,318 --> 00:58:43,440
up um and when after he retired he found

1625
00:58:41,798 --> 00:58:45,480
that he was like kind of depressed

1626
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:47,400
because he had nothing to do so he had

1627
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:49,119
already been um a California certified

1628
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:51,960
physician he came out and started write

1629
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:53,480
writing recommendations in California um

1630
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:56,280
and he just started learning from his

1631
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:57,798
patients and as a patient I appreciate

1632
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:59,920
about a doctors that he learned from his

1633
00:58:57,798 --> 00:59:02,639
patients but one thing that really hit

1634
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:04,200
Dr Joe was patients with cancer because

1635
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:05,598
he was finding that some people were

1636
00:59:04,199 --> 00:59:07,759
saying they were experiencing these

1637
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:09,079
Miracle recoveries and then he'd also

1638
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:11,039
have patients who did the same thing

1639
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:13,359
they read about online and they didn't

1640
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:15,440
have the miracle recovery right and

1641
00:59:13,358 --> 00:59:17,199
because his background was in research

1642
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:20,400
and researching Materia Meda which he

1643
00:59:17,199 --> 00:59:22,879
used to get big paper stacks of research

1644
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:24,760
and go through them to understand he

1645
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:28,119
made cannabis and cancer something that

1646
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:30,920
he just dove first so this book is a

1647
00:59:28,119 --> 00:59:33,039
summary of basically every piece of

1648
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:35,760
cannabis cannabinoid research that's

1649
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:37,640
ever been done in the world summarized

1650
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:40,079
but contextualized with the patient

1651
00:59:37,639 --> 00:59:41,358
experience right W and so there's some P

1652
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:43,240
like there's some pieces in there that

1653
00:59:41,358 --> 00:59:44,960
explain and he'll go into what I was

1654
00:59:43,239 --> 00:59:47,199
saying earlier about the endoc canabo

1655
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:49,240
system and diet and lifestyle and how

1656
00:59:47,199 --> 00:59:51,519
all of that actually affects cancer

1657
00:59:49,239 --> 00:59:53,838
cancer care more than just the Cannabis

1658
00:59:51,519 --> 00:59:56,038
himself he points out when you shouldn't

1659
00:59:53,838 --> 00:59:58,078
use cannabis when there are actually any

1660
00:59:56,039 --> 01:00:01,319
HPV related cancer he points out in the

1661
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:02,839
book does not respond well to THC more

1662
01:00:01,318 --> 01:00:05,599
importantly there's a chapter in there

1663
01:00:02,838 --> 01:00:07,759
about immunotherapy and immunotherapy

1664
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:09,400
has become a really popular cancer

1665
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:12,280
treatment because for the people who

1666
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:15,000
have cancer that it affects it really

1667
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:18,440
helps it will just knock out your cancer

1668
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,798
right A lot of people are using cannabis

1669
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:22,720
for the symptoms of things like

1670
01:00:19,798 --> 01:00:24,440
immunotherapy and chemotherapy if you

1671
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:26,679
use cannabis while you're getting

1672
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:28,838
immunotherapy it makes the IM Therapy

1673
01:00:26,679 --> 01:00:30,639
Network um this was something he had

1674
01:00:28,838 --> 01:00:33,239
pulled from the research but now he's

1675
01:00:30,639 --> 01:00:35,318
experiencing in real life because he was

1676
01:00:33,239 --> 01:00:37,798
recently diagnosed with a cancer that

1677
01:00:35,318 --> 01:00:39,679
responds well to immunotherapy so he

1678
01:00:37,798 --> 01:00:41,838
followed his own advice and the cancer

1679
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:43,519
is going into remission wow um so

1680
01:00:41,838 --> 01:00:45,599
there's an update of this book coming

1681
01:00:43,519 --> 01:00:48,519
soon but I just really appreciate what

1682
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:50,559
he did with this book it's really like

1683
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:53,719
his life's work it's really cool that's

1684
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:58,200
awesome mhm so the origins of cannabis

1685
01:00:53,719 --> 01:01:00,519
prohibition okay Dale aringer PhD he is

1686
01:00:58,199 --> 01:01:03,480
like the longtime head of California

1687
01:01:00,519 --> 01:01:05,798
normal right he's written this this book

1688
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:08,480
which is um originally published in I

1689
01:01:05,798 --> 01:01:12,159
think 1998 I might need to check that

1690
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:13,838
later on right he pulled out some pieces

1691
01:01:12,159 --> 01:01:15,480
about how California became one of the

1692
01:01:13,838 --> 01:01:18,318
first states in the United States to

1693
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:20,039
prohibit cannabis um which is so

1694
01:01:18,318 --> 01:01:22,719
hilarious considering we were the ones

1695
01:01:20,039 --> 01:01:24,960
who bust this open for the world right

1696
01:01:22,719 --> 01:01:27,118
um and a lot of it was based on racism

1697
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:28,960
which are the stories that that we knew

1698
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:30,880
um and so this is just like a really

1699
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:34,000
interesting story that looks at the

1700
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:36,720
politics between like 1910 and 1913 that

1701
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:40,559
led to can California like leading the

1702
01:01:36,719 --> 01:01:42,558
way in cannabis prohibition right nice

1703
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:44,359
and then cannabis in clinical practice

1704
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:46,039
okay cannabis in clinical practice was

1705
01:01:44,358 --> 01:01:48,960
originally written by my really good

1706
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:51,400
friend Dr David bman anybody who knows

1707
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:53,838
do Dr David bman loves him he's based in

1708
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:56,559
Santa Barbara which is near my hometown

1709
01:01:53,838 --> 01:02:00,159
um he worked for uh Governor Ronald

1710
01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:01,880
Reagan's drug task force um he he has

1711
01:02:00,159 --> 01:02:05,519
some pretty interesting credentials

1712
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:08,160
right um I first met him at Hempfest in

1713
01:02:05,519 --> 01:02:10,759
2010 or 12 and I've worked on a handful

1714
01:02:08,159 --> 01:02:13,598
of books with him up in Seattle oh in

1715
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:16,039
Seattle yeah definitely it blew my mind

1716
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:17,960
that this like doctor that I had just

1717
01:02:16,039 --> 01:02:20,278
met was like hey you want to smoke a

1718
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:22,199
joint on the Rocks nice which is what

1719
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:23,440
everybody does at H Fest right but so I

1720
01:02:22,199 --> 01:02:25,639
ended up sitting there and talking to

1721
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:27,240
him for a while finding out that he was

1722
01:02:25,639 --> 01:02:28,719
from Santa Barbara which is near my

1723
01:02:27,239 --> 01:02:31,639
hometown which is in Santa Barbara

1724
01:02:28,719 --> 01:02:34,118
County so we became friends through that

1725
01:02:31,639 --> 01:02:36,558
um cannabis in clinical practice was him

1726
01:02:34,119 --> 01:02:39,119
trying to put into words all of the

1727
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:40,400
information the doctors typically get

1728
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:42,358
about a drug that they're going to

1729
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:44,440
prescribe their patients but they will

1730
01:02:42,358 --> 01:02:46,719
never get for an herb and especially not

1731
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:49,480
cannabis so he put that all into that

1732
01:02:46,719 --> 01:02:52,159
into this book then there's four authors

1733
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:54,960
on this book right wow the second author

1734
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:56,519
Maria panado is teaching a cannabis

1735
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:58,720
class that wasand brand new at the

1736
01:02:56,519 --> 01:03:01,278
College of Nursing at Seattle so she

1737
01:02:58,719 --> 01:03:05,000
adapted the content for her class the

1738
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:08,119
next MD who jumps in is do Carina netti

1739
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:10,318
who is from Brazil and so she has like

1740
01:03:08,119 --> 01:03:11,519
actually LED medical cannabis in Brazil

1741
01:03:10,318 --> 01:03:13,759
she's testified in front of the

1742
01:03:11,519 --> 01:03:15,480
Brazilian Congress for medical cannabis

1743
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:18,278
but her and her team did deep studies

1744
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:20,400
into autoimmune diseases and a few other

1745
01:03:18,278 --> 01:03:22,599
conditions and how cannabis affects that

1746
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:25,318
at the cellular level so she amended the

1747
01:03:22,599 --> 01:03:27,200
book finally I took a final pass of this

1748
01:03:25,318 --> 01:03:28,798
book from a patients perspective and

1749
01:03:27,199 --> 01:03:31,038
from a very educated patients

1750
01:03:28,798 --> 01:03:32,559
perspective and that is what became this

1751
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:34,400
book which is cannabis and clinical

1752
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:36,200
practice and it's basically everything a

1753
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:38,240
doctor needs to know before they start

1754
01:03:36,199 --> 01:03:39,639
recommending cannabis to a patient

1755
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:42,118
that's

1756
01:03:39,639 --> 01:03:44,440
awesome yeah we need more books like

1757
01:03:42,119 --> 01:03:47,400
that oh my God more more books yeah I

1758
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:49,480
hope people read books well I think

1759
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:50,920
digital books are a thing and so people

1760
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:52,960
like a lot of people like digital books

1761
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:56,400
but I still like books and that's why I

1762
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:58,440
wanted to write a book and you know it's

1763
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:00,880
Luke's book is great and I don't really

1764
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:03,760
read books normally but I I like Luke's

1765
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:05,720
book was an exception um you got it to

1766
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:08,440
me early on right when it was coming out

1767
01:04:05,719 --> 01:04:10,679
and I it was a really really good book

1768
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:12,000
um books yeah where do you think books

1769
01:04:10,679 --> 01:04:14,278
are going you know it's interesting

1770
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,639
though cuz like I read a lot of books um

1771
01:04:14,278 --> 01:04:17,639
and there's a lot of books I read that I

1772
01:04:15,639 --> 01:04:19,278
don't necessarily want on my shelf and I

1773
01:04:17,639 --> 01:04:21,078
don't want other people around me to see

1774
01:04:19,278 --> 01:04:23,920
that I'm reading right just like trashy

1775
01:04:21,079 --> 01:04:25,960
novels um books like your book are the

1776
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:27,760
kind of book that I want on my bookshelf

1777
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:30,159
yeah I want it as a reference that I can

1778
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:31,520
pull down and so like I think that

1779
01:04:30,159 --> 01:04:32,639
that's kind of where books are going

1780
01:04:31,519 --> 01:04:34,079
there's the books that you want on your

1781
01:04:32,639 --> 01:04:35,920
sh the books you don't want on your

1782
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:37,480
shelf your book is a book that I want on

1783
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:39,519
my shelf because it's the kind of thing

1784
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:41,318
where I need a quick fact I know where

1785
01:04:39,519 --> 01:04:43,079
to look for it and I know your book like

1786
01:04:41,318 --> 01:04:45,480
the back in my hands so I know where to

1787
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:46,640
find what I'm looking for in there right

1788
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:49,480
well you have the file you can type

1789
01:04:46,639 --> 01:04:51,598
search that's true but so could anybody

1790
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:52,838
who gets the ebook right yeah it's it's

1791
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:54,680
really interesting and then you also

1792
01:04:52,838 --> 01:04:57,838
work with Oaker Dam doing a lot of stuff

1793
01:04:54,679 --> 01:04:59,719
with Dale over there and Oaker Dam isn't

1794
01:04:57,838 --> 01:05:02,078
just in Oakland anymore Oak you guys

1795
01:04:59,719 --> 01:05:05,719
have spread out all over you guys are

1796
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:06,920
working you know in several countries um

1797
01:05:05,719 --> 01:05:08,919
and you want to talk about that a little

1798
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:10,519
bit yeah I started working with Dale at

1799
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:12,318
Oaker Dam to produce a book the bud

1800
01:05:10,519 --> 01:05:14,960
tenders guide um which was based on a

1801
01:05:12,318 --> 01:05:16,798
lot of their curricula and the curricula

1802
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:18,278
is excellent people don't realize this

1803
01:05:16,798 --> 01:05:20,838
Dale brought me in as the Director of

1804
01:05:18,278 --> 01:05:23,960
academics so now I produce all of the

1805
01:05:20,838 --> 01:05:26,119
curricula at Oaker Dam University um and

1806
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:28,079
that has been such a crazy experience

1807
01:05:26,119 --> 01:05:30,640
for me because it's definitely pulled on

1808
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:33,720
all of my skills strengths and knowledge

1809
01:05:30,639 --> 01:05:36,598
in a way that no other job possibly

1810
01:05:33,719 --> 01:05:38,118
could um so I really appreciate working

1811
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:39,960
with oaksterdam because we're working

1812
01:05:38,119 --> 01:05:42,559
with people who actually are going to

1813
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:43,960
have a Major Impact where they are right

1814
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:45,680
I'm from California you're from

1815
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:47,559
California we're all very saturated in

1816
01:05:45,679 --> 01:05:49,798
the Cannabis World we're working with

1817
01:05:47,559 --> 01:05:52,519
students who are opening businesses and

1818
01:05:49,798 --> 01:05:54,759
places like Connecticut and New Jersey

1819
01:05:52,519 --> 01:05:57,880
and they have no background in the

1820
01:05:54,760 --> 01:06:00,960
history of what is here or all of the

1821
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:04,480
weird deep context that you and I might

1822
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:06,358
have on some of these topics um so it's

1823
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:08,000
really exciting for us to be able to

1824
01:06:06,358 --> 01:06:10,960
provide it but it's really excited for

1825
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,880
them to be able to get that information

1826
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:15,880
from somewhere like Oaker Dam where we

1827
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:17,480
have the most unique perspective the

1828
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:20,200
other thing I think is really cool for

1829
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:23,440
me about working with oaksterdam is I've

1830
01:06:20,199 --> 01:06:26,960
known Jeff and Dale Jones for over 15

1831
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:29,358
years but I've always been adjacent like

1832
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:32,838
I never worked exactly with them but I

1833
01:06:29,358 --> 01:06:35,119
was around during Prop 19 I was around

1834
01:06:32,838 --> 01:06:36,838
while they were doing their thing and so

1835
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:39,440
I've always

1836
01:06:36,838 --> 01:06:41,679
understood the the historical context of

1837
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:43,798
oaksterdam and and where they fall and

1838
01:06:41,679 --> 01:06:45,960
this legalization movement and I don't

1839
01:06:43,798 --> 01:06:48,759
know that many people in the world

1840
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:51,559
really understand what Oaker Dam in

1841
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:54,119
particular did to make cannabis legal

1842
01:06:51,559 --> 01:06:55,599
everywhere and for everyone they may

1843
01:06:54,119 --> 01:06:58,519
never know unless we keep talking

1844
01:06:55,599 --> 01:07:03,200
talking about it but oakam had the most

1845
01:06:58,519 --> 01:07:06,318
Central role in what is today MH I would

1846
01:07:03,199 --> 01:07:08,318
agree and I think you know they were at

1847
01:07:06,318 --> 01:07:10,480
the epicenter you know we we called

1848
01:07:08,318 --> 01:07:14,239
Oakland oaksterdam and then they started

1849
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:16,480
a school and pretty amazing how many

1850
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:18,959
students have gone through Oaker Dam so

1851
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:21,599
many of my friends and colleagues have

1852
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:23,599
either 10,000 yeah and some people went

1853
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:26,039
for weekend and some you know weekend

1854
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:28,798
courses and other people have gone for

1855
01:07:26,039 --> 01:07:32,839
longer classes and I they've done so

1856
01:07:28,798 --> 01:07:35,920
much um coming from culinary school I'm

1857
01:07:32,838 --> 01:07:39,400
not the hugest fan

1858
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:41,720
of uh culinary school for for education

1859
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:43,798
but I feel like with oaksterdam it's a

1860
01:07:41,719 --> 01:07:45,759
little bit different I feel like it's a

1861
01:07:43,798 --> 01:07:48,079
lot less expensive than culinary school

1862
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:50,319
for one thing and you can do it on

1863
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:52,400
demand now but also you can pair it with

1864
01:07:50,318 --> 01:07:54,920
grow like just like you can cook at your

1865
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:57,278
house you can grow plants at your house

1866
01:07:54,920 --> 01:08:00,559
but uh it can Empower you to get a job

1867
01:07:57,278 --> 01:08:03,119
in the industry so 110,000 people from

1868
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:05,400
116 countries have gone through Oaker

1869
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:07,440
Dam so a lot of people were seeing oakam

1870
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:08,798
on the news coming to Oakland learning

1871
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:10,358
about the Cannabis industry and taking

1872
01:08:08,798 --> 01:08:12,358
it home and that's why they have a big

1873
01:08:10,358 --> 01:08:14,239
impact to your point about culinary

1874
01:08:12,358 --> 01:08:17,079
school that's interesting though is

1875
01:08:14,239 --> 01:08:18,798
being a chef is a it's a creative job

1876
01:08:17,079 --> 01:08:21,079
right there's technical skills you can

1877
01:08:18,798 --> 01:08:23,238
learn like a photographer or a writer or

1878
01:08:21,079 --> 01:08:26,158
an artist but there's also like that

1879
01:08:23,238 --> 01:08:28,919
innate piece of you that understands

1880
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:30,559
this thing that can't be taught well

1881
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:32,798
there's like the whole mentorship side

1882
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:34,480
of the culinary industry where it's I

1883
01:08:32,798 --> 01:08:36,439
talk about this on my show a lot but

1884
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:39,039
it's like uh you know it's passed down

1885
01:08:36,439 --> 01:08:40,559
from generations of chefs right so like

1886
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:42,319
you you work under somebody as an

1887
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:44,560
apprentice and you learn all the skills

1888
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:46,359
from them and then you make it your own

1889
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:50,039
and then you pass those down to somebody

1890
01:08:46,359 --> 01:08:51,920
else and I believe that the Canabis

1891
01:08:50,039 --> 01:08:55,479
world is a lot like that

1892
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:57,279
too and you know I think there was a

1893
01:08:55,479 --> 01:08:59,759
lack of information out there and there

1894
01:08:57,279 --> 01:09:01,920
was a lot of people if you didn't know

1895
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:03,399
the right person it was hard to get in

1896
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:05,759
now slowly but surely you can go be a

1897
01:09:03,399 --> 01:09:08,238
water boy for somebody and water plants

1898
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:11,479
or go trim a lot of people got started

1899
01:09:08,238 --> 01:09:13,639
trimming at a very young age yeah and so

1900
01:09:11,479 --> 01:09:15,559
many people and there's nothing wrong

1901
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:18,079
with that and it's working your way up

1902
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:19,279
in any industry is a great way to do it

1903
01:09:18,079 --> 01:09:20,600
if you want to be in the restaurant

1904
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:23,520
industry and you can't get a job in the

1905
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:25,759
kitchen you can be a buser you can go

1906
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:28,520
it's the only way to do it is understand

1907
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:31,238
the whole business go wash dishes yeah Y

1908
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:34,000
and same thing go uh go clean pots go

1909
01:09:31,238 --> 01:09:35,759
clean pots for whatever grow if you can

1910
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,039
get in you can get in and hopefully

1911
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:39,399
someone likes you and they see that you

1912
01:09:37,039 --> 01:09:41,640
have good work ethic and then you can

1913
01:09:39,399 --> 01:09:43,679
you can grow with the company or you can

1914
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:45,838
grow out of the company and then you

1915
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:48,319
know evolve into something else you

1916
01:09:45,838 --> 01:09:49,759
can't teach that innate part of you that

1917
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:51,560
understands how to pair flavors or come

1918
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:53,039
up with creative things to cook and it's

1919
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:55,000
the same thing with breeding right like

1920
01:09:53,039 --> 01:09:57,238
you can't you can't teach a photographer

1921
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,760
to an eye yeah you can teach them all

1922
01:09:57,238 --> 01:10:00,759
the skills to use a camera but you can't

1923
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:03,159
teach them how to see and I think it's

1924
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:07,440
the same thing with chefs and breeders

1925
01:10:03,158 --> 01:10:09,279
yeah but I think a lot of stuff through

1926
01:10:07,439 --> 01:10:11,039
repetition you know you got to start

1927
01:10:09,279 --> 01:10:12,800
with the repetition part because a lot

1928
01:10:11,039 --> 01:10:14,519
of people yeah they have a natural gift

1929
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:17,000
for some stuff but unless you put it at

1930
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:18,440
the hours you'll never get good well

1931
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,880
that's exactly it right you can have

1932
01:10:18,439 --> 01:10:21,519
that innate sense in you but if you

1933
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:24,000
don't understand the technical skills

1934
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:26,360
you can't perform yeah say with writing

1935
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:29,279
and it takes Lots yeah I I know

1936
01:10:26,359 --> 01:10:31,479
firsthand I am such a better writer

1937
01:10:29,279 --> 01:10:34,039
after working with you it's incredible I

1938
01:10:31,479 --> 01:10:37,198
feel like if you look at how the first

1939
01:10:34,039 --> 01:10:38,920
draft came out and then as you got me to

1940
01:10:37,198 --> 01:10:41,000
rewrite stuff and think about what I'm

1941
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:42,880
writing and how I'm constructing

1942
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,439
sentences and paragraphs and trying to

1943
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:46,119
tie it all in together because you had a

1944
01:10:44,439 --> 01:10:47,559
specific way of doing that which was

1945
01:10:46,119 --> 01:10:48,920
very different than my way was like

1946
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:51,120
let's just throw it out there and it's

1947
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:53,119
like no you need to have a introduction

1948
01:10:51,119 --> 01:10:55,880
that kind of says it all and then you

1949
01:10:53,119 --> 01:10:57,519
you write abouted pyramid yes huh you

1950
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:59,679
put everything at the top and then you

1951
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:01,320
expand on it well that's the thing right

1952
01:10:59,679 --> 01:11:03,158
I've always considered myself a writer

1953
01:11:01,319 --> 01:11:05,319
I've always loved writing I did not

1954
01:11:03,158 --> 01:11:08,719
become a good writer until I became a

1955
01:11:05,319 --> 01:11:10,039
good editor yeah I believe it well

1956
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:12,000
sometimes it takes stepping outside the

1957
01:11:10,039 --> 01:11:14,560
box a little bit so you can see what's

1958
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,800
going on and I fell into this niche of

1959
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:18,640
cannabis because I did one cannabis book

1960
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:20,239
I did another cannabis book and [ __ ] now

1961
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:22,679
I know more about cannabis than anyone

1962
01:11:20,238 --> 01:11:24,799
who's never grown cannabis bred cannabis

1963
01:11:22,679 --> 01:11:26,359
been a cannabis doctor yeah well and you

1964
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:28,400
know it from so many different

1965
01:11:26,359 --> 01:11:29,839
perspectives right and i' I've known

1966
01:11:28,399 --> 01:11:31,079
from the authors that I've worked with

1967
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:33,039
that that's something that they've liked

1968
01:11:31,079 --> 01:11:35,039
working with me is that I can kind of

1969
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:37,439
extract things out of what they wrote

1970
01:11:35,039 --> 01:11:38,719
and beat it up and question it in a way

1971
01:11:37,439 --> 01:11:40,759
that someone who's not a medical

1972
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:41,840
professional or a grower or a breeder

1973
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:44,280
could never

1974
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:46,039
do yeah and you were able to get me on

1975
01:11:44,279 --> 01:11:49,439
task every day which is something that's

1976
01:11:46,039 --> 01:11:52,158
a a challenge for uh you know the best

1977
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:53,678
of the people that I've worked with and

1978
01:11:52,158 --> 01:11:56,359
I guess sometimes you just have a good

1979
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:59,520
relationship with people and and there's

1980
01:11:56,359 --> 01:12:01,559
um something where you can sync up like

1981
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:03,920
and and I work better with some people

1982
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:06,159
than other people and I have a specific

1983
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:08,239
style and but I'm also a Workhorse I

1984
01:12:06,158 --> 01:12:10,559
don't mind being the Workhorse I just

1985
01:12:08,238 --> 01:12:13,158
need to have a path and then I need to

1986
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:14,159
dedicate each morning to doing that

1987
01:12:13,158 --> 01:12:16,198
that's what I was going to say I'm a

1988
01:12:14,158 --> 01:12:18,000
great organizer I'm a great editor a

1989
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:19,719
great manager but I'm only as good as

1990
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:22,439
the person I'm working with and like

1991
01:12:19,719 --> 01:12:24,800
that was all you for staying on task and

1992
01:12:22,439 --> 01:12:27,319
actually taking it and running with it

1993
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:28,480
yeah and think uh just just waking up

1994
01:12:27,319 --> 01:12:30,479
knowing that this is what I'm going to

1995
01:12:28,479 --> 01:12:32,119
do for the day and and I need to knock

1996
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:33,759
this list out and sometimes it wouldn't

1997
01:12:32,119 --> 01:12:36,158
be that day it would be the next day or

1998
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:39,039
the day after that but I would wake up

1999
01:12:36,158 --> 01:12:40,960
and put energy into it every day and

2000
01:12:39,039 --> 01:12:42,679
prioritize it I think a lot of times in

2001
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:45,158
life we just got to prioritize stuff I

2002
01:12:42,679 --> 01:12:46,679
think maybe you had an innate

2003
01:12:45,158 --> 01:12:49,279
understanding of the fact that a book

2004
01:12:46,679 --> 01:12:51,039
like this did not exist yet um and that

2005
01:12:49,279 --> 01:12:52,840
you were creating the base that a lot of

2006
01:12:51,039 --> 01:12:54,960
people were going to work from and there

2007
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:56,960
was like a responsibility that comes

2008
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:58,920
with being able to build something like

2009
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:01,079
that and I wonder a little bit if that's

2010
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:02,520
kind of what motivated you to finish the

2011
01:13:01,079 --> 01:13:04,158
book was the fact that you knew that

2012
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:06,239
that's what you were doing I was told by

2013
01:13:04,158 --> 01:13:08,799
somebody that I couldn't do it and I

2014
01:13:06,238 --> 01:13:10,638
wouldn't have a book by Christmas or the

2015
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:14,159
year after that it would take a lot

2016
01:13:10,639 --> 01:13:15,760
longer and also I was 46 years old at

2017
01:13:14,158 --> 01:13:17,359
the time and IID told people that I was

2018
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:18,880
going to have a book out and that was

2019
01:13:17,359 --> 01:13:21,559
like four years

2020
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:24,159
before and I realized that this was my

2021
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:25,440
last shot at doing it and if I didn't do

2022
01:13:24,158 --> 01:13:27,359
it it wasn't going to happen happen and

2023
01:13:25,439 --> 01:13:30,638
I was going to give up and I didn't want

2024
01:13:27,359 --> 01:13:31,839
to give up I didn't want to tell people

2025
01:13:30,639 --> 01:13:33,480
that I was going to do something that I

2026
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:36,679
didn't do so there was all these

2027
01:13:33,479 --> 01:13:38,519
different pressures pushing me forward

2028
01:13:36,679 --> 01:13:40,480
wanting me to be successful and I was

2029
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:42,159
also I would remind myself of those

2030
01:13:40,479 --> 01:13:45,158
things when I was feeling

2031
01:13:42,158 --> 01:13:47,799
lazy so you know and I'm kind of like

2032
01:13:45,158 --> 01:13:50,079
I'm just wired like that too like I can

2033
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:52,560
create my own type of

2034
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:54,679
stress so I you know and I like I'm a

2035
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:57,520
high functioning per I I function really

2036
01:13:54,679 --> 01:13:59,279
well in stress but I you know not a high

2037
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:01,520
functioning alcoholic but I'm a high

2038
01:13:59,279 --> 01:14:02,639
functioning person under stressful

2039
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,920
situations and that comes from the

2040
01:14:02,639 --> 01:14:06,760
kitchen too and where you have this long

2041
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:09,719
line of tickets and orders that have to

2042
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:11,480
go out and you know it's like no one's

2043
01:14:09,719 --> 01:14:13,639
going to come save you you got to pull

2044
01:14:11,479 --> 01:14:15,559
your pants up look at those tickets and

2045
01:14:13,639 --> 01:14:17,239
just do it as fast as you can and I

2046
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:18,560
think a lot of times people are just so

2047
01:14:17,238 --> 01:14:21,198
they're waiting for someone to come save

2048
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:23,039
them that person's never coming I was a

2049
01:14:21,198 --> 01:14:24,799
bartender and waitress in downtown San

2050
01:14:23,039 --> 01:14:26,800
Francisco before I got into cannabis and

2051
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:28,360
I still have anxiety dreams about the

2052
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:30,760
tickets stacking up and getting the

2053
01:14:28,359 --> 01:14:32,319
plates out on I have I have nightmares

2054
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:34,520
yeah it's been a while since I had a

2055
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:36,519
nightmare about the ticket counter uh

2056
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:38,719
but like the the ticket machine just

2057
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:40,280
running or the ticket machine breaking

2058
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:42,439
those are the two where it's you got

2059
01:14:40,279 --> 01:14:44,079
tickets on the floor or the ticket

2060
01:14:42,439 --> 01:14:47,198
machine is broken and the the

2061
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:48,920
restaurant's packed and that's happened

2062
01:14:47,198 --> 01:14:51,039
several times and you know I guess

2063
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:52,679
that's why I still have that reoccurring

2064
01:14:51,039 --> 01:14:54,600
nightmare but oh mine is the restaurant

2065
01:14:52,679 --> 01:14:56,079
is packed I'm the only bartender and

2066
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:58,440
waitress

2067
01:14:56,079 --> 01:14:59,960
yeah I still have that dream to this day

2068
01:14:58,439 --> 01:15:04,599
and I haven't worked there in like 20

2069
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:06,760
years yeah wow mhm really amazing so if

2070
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:09,639
there was one piece of advice that you

2071
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:12,199
could give your younger self uh coming

2072
01:15:09,639 --> 01:15:13,920
into the Cannabis space since we have a

2073
01:15:12,198 --> 01:15:16,039
lot of people in cannabis watching this

2074
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:17,679
show what would that one piece of advice

2075
01:15:16,039 --> 01:15:19,279
be oh see that's interesting because I

2076
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:21,480
was never trying to get into the

2077
01:15:19,279 --> 01:15:24,119
Cannabis space right like that was never

2078
01:15:21,479 --> 01:15:25,479
a goal of mine was to work into cannabis

2079
01:15:24,119 --> 01:15:27,800
so don't do it

2080
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:29,799
right right there's you know and it's

2081
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:31,760
okay that's a hard question also because

2082
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:33,560
the Cannabis Space is really hard right

2083
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:36,079
now um there aren't a lot of

2084
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:38,159
opportunities the way there used to be I

2085
01:15:36,079 --> 01:15:40,760
think that's a temporary situation until

2086
01:15:38,158 --> 01:15:43,399
Federal Law changes

2087
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:44,840
um but I would say so here's what I

2088
01:15:43,399 --> 01:15:47,359
would say right as someone who's a

2089
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:50,239
professional writer and editor I wrote

2090
01:15:47,359 --> 01:15:52,960
for five years for free anybody who

2091
01:15:50,238 --> 01:15:55,039
would publish me I wrote for them I did

2092
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:56,920
not care if I was getting paid or not

2093
01:15:55,039 --> 01:15:58,600
because I believed in myself enough to

2094
01:15:56,920 --> 01:16:00,800
know that if I got my writing out there

2095
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:04,280
that someone would eventually pay for me

2096
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:06,639
yeah um took 5 years but then I had a

2097
01:16:04,279 --> 01:16:08,119
very solid career built on people paying

2098
01:16:06,639 --> 01:16:10,359
for what I could write and what I could

2099
01:16:08,119 --> 01:16:12,000
do so if this is something you actually

2100
01:16:10,359 --> 01:16:14,679
really believe in and you want to do

2101
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:18,319
especially creative work Chef's work

2102
01:16:14,679 --> 01:16:21,000
writing work artistic work right just do

2103
01:16:18,319 --> 01:16:23,880
it just keep creating just keep building

2104
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:26,399
eventually if you stay the course and

2105
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:28,199
you work that side HW hustle yeah you

2106
01:16:26,399 --> 01:16:29,960
will get it well so that was going to be

2107
01:16:28,198 --> 01:16:31,919
my next question is if somebody wants to

2108
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:33,119
get into writing about cannabis that

2109
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:35,760
they they're passionate about it what

2110
01:16:33,119 --> 01:16:38,439
would the best route be and just do it I

2111
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:40,440
would tell them not to focus on cannabis

2112
01:16:38,439 --> 01:16:42,000
100% right like don't pigeon hole

2113
01:16:40,439 --> 01:16:44,238
yourself to cannabis that's been like

2114
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:46,119
one regret I felt in many ways is that I

2115
01:16:44,238 --> 01:16:48,039
felt I got pigeon hold into cannabis

2116
01:16:46,119 --> 01:16:51,960
because it's a niche that I felt a niche

2117
01:16:48,039 --> 01:16:54,039
that I fell into right um again I have

2118
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:55,679
still today I'm going out of my way to

2119
01:16:54,039 --> 01:16:57,880
work on product projects that aren't

2120
01:16:55,679 --> 01:17:00,359
cannabis based yeah there's more to this

2121
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:02,639
world than cannabis I know so much about

2122
01:17:00,359 --> 01:17:04,960
cannabis it's so easy for me to continue

2123
01:17:02,639 --> 01:17:06,199
to produce content about cannabis yeah

2124
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:07,920
but there's so many other things that

2125
01:17:06,198 --> 01:17:09,719
matter and to me there's mushrooms

2126
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:11,279
there's all kinds of other things oh the

2127
01:17:09,719 --> 01:17:13,079
mushroom industry is like a whole other

2128
01:17:11,279 --> 01:17:15,279
thing but the more I've learned like

2129
01:17:13,079 --> 01:17:17,399
about Healthcare and cannabis like

2130
01:17:15,279 --> 01:17:19,158
cannabis has opened my mind to so many

2131
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:21,519
other things the more I felt compelled

2132
01:17:19,158 --> 01:17:23,399
to write about other Healthcare topics

2133
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:25,719
and I hope that we can start looking at

2134
01:17:23,399 --> 01:17:27,679
cannabis outside of the box of cannabis

2135
01:17:25,719 --> 01:17:30,920
and into how cannabis is going to change

2136
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:35,000
how we do other things yeah I like it

2137
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:36,560
breeding medicine lifestyle drug

2138
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,319
Discovery and all these things yeah and

2139
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:39,480
I think a lot of it comes down to

2140
01:17:38,319 --> 01:17:42,198
Healthy Living we were talking about

2141
01:17:39,479 --> 01:17:44,559
earlier drug Discovery like that topic

2142
01:17:42,198 --> 01:17:45,678
itself like still kind of irks me a

2143
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:47,440
little bit right because it's still

2144
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:49,520
based on this premise that we're going

2145
01:17:47,439 --> 01:17:51,319
to find this one thing that's going to

2146
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:52,840
cure or treat your problem and you'll

2147
01:17:51,319 --> 01:17:54,559
never find this one thing that's going

2148
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:57,239
to cure or treat your problem only you

2149
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:59,600
can treat drug Discovery is like that

2150
01:17:57,238 --> 01:18:01,319
one thing that we can patent right so

2151
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,679
that's that's kind of what it is it's

2152
01:18:01,319 --> 01:18:05,158
like that one thing that we can patent

2153
01:18:02,679 --> 01:18:07,319
that does this for this or that it took

2154
01:18:05,158 --> 01:18:09,759
us these steps and we had to do this

2155
01:18:07,319 --> 01:18:11,399
type of extraction and you know I mean

2156
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:14,000
there drug Discovery and but the thing

2157
01:18:11,399 --> 01:18:16,158
is is like from a I see drug Discovery

2158
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,920
as an amazing thing because it's like

2159
01:18:16,158 --> 01:18:19,879
Okay so we've done all these tests like

2160
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:21,279
they do in Israel where we have these

2161
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:23,840
double blinded

2162
01:18:21,279 --> 01:18:26,519
tests and we're looking at large

2163
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:28,840
populations of groups and we're giving

2164
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:30,679
you know trying to solve problems I'm a

2165
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:32,960
Problem Solver as it is I look

2166
01:18:30,679 --> 01:18:34,600
everything I do is to solve a problem

2167
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:36,639
and so I like the whole drug Discovery

2168
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:39,560
from that perspective it's like can we

2169
01:18:36,639 --> 01:18:41,239
solve a problem with this and the more

2170
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:43,800
we know about it the more problems we

2171
01:18:41,238 --> 01:18:45,599
can solve and maybe we can get rid of

2172
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:47,360
ulcerative colitis and autoimmune

2173
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:49,000
disease someday and maybe it won't just

2174
01:18:47,359 --> 01:18:51,119
be cannabis but maybe it will be this

2175
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:53,279
combination of stuff but that is the

2176
01:18:51,119 --> 01:18:55,079
drug Discovery Canabis but I think

2177
01:18:53,279 --> 01:18:58,279
that's the beauty of drug discovery it's

2178
01:18:55,079 --> 01:18:59,600
like the more we know the more informed

2179
01:18:58,279 --> 01:19:01,359
we are the more we can make better

2180
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:03,159
decisions and maybe we will find

2181
01:19:01,359 --> 01:19:04,960
something that makes a difference maybe

2182
01:19:03,158 --> 01:19:06,599
it won't be the only thing but maybe

2183
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:07,920
it's something special and unique well

2184
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:09,560
what's important about this drug

2185
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:11,520
Discovery threat is that through trying

2186
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:12,920
to understand these single molecules we

2187
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:14,360
understand the mechanisms of action and

2188
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:16,480
how they work in the body right it's

2189
01:19:14,359 --> 01:19:18,759
like how we found OIC is understanding

2190
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:21,039
the glp1 and how that affects your

2191
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:22,840
appetite right so these things are

2192
01:19:21,039 --> 01:19:24,158
important like I I have this like

2193
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:25,520
conflict when it came to learning about

2194
01:19:24,158 --> 01:19:27,319
medical can abis and going to these

2195
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:30,320
medical cannabis conferences and hearing

2196
01:19:27,319 --> 01:19:31,840
them talk about these new canono they

2197
01:19:30,319 --> 01:19:34,639
discovered and the pathways they work on

2198
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:36,560
is like wow this knowledge we have about

2199
01:19:34,639 --> 01:19:39,560
how these canaps interact with our body

2200
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:40,800
is so important the conclusion is always

2201
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:42,920
so we're going to make a product that

2202
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:45,639
you can buy based on it right and like

2203
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:48,359
that is the wrong conclusion of course

2204
01:19:45,639 --> 01:19:50,079
that conclusion is what drives the study

2205
01:19:48,359 --> 01:19:52,960
um so there's like this weird balance

2206
01:19:50,079 --> 01:19:54,719
with it but patients in particular need

2207
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:57,039
to take some more control of Their Own

2208
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:58,319
healthare more autonomy of what's going

2209
01:19:57,039 --> 01:20:00,760
on and that's how they're really going

2210
01:19:58,319 --> 01:20:03,519
to find their answers for

2211
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:05,480
sure yeah I mean cuz it's all subject to

2212
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:06,760
the individual so much of it and we all

2213
01:20:05,479 --> 01:20:08,879
need different things and we all have

2214
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:10,840
such different body chemistry well with

2215
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:12,960
autoimmune diseases especially something

2216
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:14,520
like Crohn's disease in particular a lot

2217
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:16,198
of this comes down to the balance of

2218
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:18,239
bacteria in your gut right that

2219
01:20:16,198 --> 01:20:20,039
interacts with your immune system and

2220
01:20:18,238 --> 01:20:21,678
like what's going on in my gut is not

2221
01:20:20,039 --> 01:20:23,319
identical to what's going on in the gut

2222
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:25,158
of somebody else with crohn's disease

2223
01:20:23,319 --> 01:20:27,119
right what's going on in my gut

2224
01:20:25,158 --> 01:20:28,839
in the morning is not the same thing as

2225
01:20:27,119 --> 01:20:30,920
what's happening to it in the evening or

2226
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:33,279
after eating this food or that food like

2227
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:35,719
when we actually start studying nature

2228
01:20:33,279 --> 01:20:37,759
we start understanding diversity and the

2229
01:20:35,719 --> 01:20:40,560
problem with diversity is there's never

2230
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:42,360
one like single solution to anything

2231
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:43,960
it's it's always more complex and

2232
01:20:42,359 --> 01:20:46,439
complicated well and for thousands of

2233
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:48,158
years we ate so seasonally you know and

2234
01:20:46,439 --> 01:20:50,119
it's thousands and thousands and

2235
01:20:48,158 --> 01:20:52,198
thousands of years you know as long as

2236
01:20:50,119 --> 01:20:54,760
we've been on this Earth and now we have

2237
01:20:52,198 --> 01:20:57,559
tomatoes year round well but people like

2238
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:59,360
me I eat seasonally right I base most of

2239
01:20:57,560 --> 01:21:01,120
my food off of a vegetable box that

2240
01:20:59,359 --> 01:21:03,519
comes from local organic Growers who are

2241
01:21:01,119 --> 01:21:05,079
growing seasonal produce once a week and

2242
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:06,360
that's how I plan my meals is based on

2243
01:21:05,079 --> 01:21:08,559
what the fruits and vegetables that are

2244
01:21:06,359 --> 01:21:10,279
going to come to me and that's difficult

2245
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:11,400
like not everyone can do that I

2246
01:21:10,279 --> 01:21:13,158

2247
01:21:11,399 --> 01:21:17,960
time to cook their own meals but I feel

2248
01:21:13,158 --> 01:21:20,198
better for it right really cool MH so if

2249

2262
01:21:51,359 --> 01:21:56,719
press um and what's funny about this is

2263
01:21:54,079 --> 01:21:59,960
my public F in company um Flower Valley

2264
01:21:56,719 --> 01:22:01,480
Press is not a cannabis name even if

2265
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:04,198
people seem to think it is it's based on

2266
01:22:01,479 --> 01:22:06,039
my hometown Loke um which is the flower

2267
01:22:04,198 --> 01:22:07,839
seed capital of the world and we call it

2268
01:22:06,039 --> 01:22:10,119
the flower Valley so that's where that

2269
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:12,199
name comes from it also happened to

2270
01:22:10,119 --> 01:22:14,119
become like a huge cannabis capital in

2271
01:22:12,198 --> 01:22:17,238
California very recently which is part

2272
01:22:14,119 --> 01:22:20,359
of why I moved home it's pretty wild how

2273
01:22:17,238 --> 01:22:23,519
it just overnight became this huge thing

2274
01:22:20,359 --> 01:22:25,880
in Santa Barbara County right yes and so

2275
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:28,080
because the county accept it so you know

2276
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:30,039
and large scale it was the one place in

2277
01:22:28,079 --> 01:22:31,439
California you could really scale Santa

2278
01:22:30,039 --> 01:22:33,479
Barbara County was always going to

2279
01:22:31,439 --> 01:22:35,399
become epicenter of cannabis cultivation

2280
01:22:33,479 --> 01:22:37,198
in California whether people up north

2281
01:22:35,399 --> 01:22:39,319
liked it or not and part of the reason

2282
01:22:37,198 --> 01:22:41,000
is because it's 75 and Sunny year round

2283
01:22:39,319 --> 01:22:42,920
and we have green houses every Cut

2284
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,600
Flower green houses everywhere there

2285
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:46,560
were cut flower green houses everywhere

2286
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:48,920
there was a a Federal Trade pact with

2287
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:51,039
Ecuador and Colombia in the early 2000s

2288
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:53,000
that we agreed to buy cut flowers from

2289
01:22:51,039 --> 01:22:54,760
Ecuador and Colombia in exchange for

2290
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:56,920
trying to cut off the flow of cocaine to

2291
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:59,520
the United States and what that did was

2292
01:22:56,920 --> 01:23:01,279
put out all of the local flower growers

2293
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:02,800
in my hometown and Southern Santa

2294
01:23:01,279 --> 01:23:05,519
Barbara County Northern Santa Barber

2295
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:07,800
County um so when prop 64 was on the

2296
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:10,080
ballot a lot of those greenh houses went

2297
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:12,119
up for sale and they got snapped up real

2298
01:23:10,079 --> 01:23:15,399
fast so now we're producing a third of

2299
01:23:12,119 --> 01:23:17,880
the legal cannabis in California my

2300
01:23:15,399 --> 01:23:20,719
hometown Loke which has been described

2301
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:23,279
by our Congressman Salud caral as the

2302
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:24,960
armpit of his district right it's a

2303
01:23:23,279 --> 01:23:26,840
beautiful place on the coast

2304
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:30,639
has the most poverty in Santa Barbara

2305
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:33,360
County wow we passed a law after prop 64

2306
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:36,039
passed in California where we're like no

2307
01:23:33,359 --> 01:23:39,439
rules over the state no taxes over the

2308
01:23:36,039 --> 01:23:42,279
