lot different back then for sure but

87
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:09,959
yeah San Francisco smoking weed you

88
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:11,280
always used to be able to smoke in San

89
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:13,319
Francisco on the street it was never an

90
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,719
issue San Francisco I feel like you know

91
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:18,280
I lived in San Francisco in my early 20s

92
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:20,239
and I feel like as far as like embracing

93
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,919
cannabis no City embraced cannabis as

94
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,200
early and as much as San Francisco you

95
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:25,518
know what I mean it was one of the first

96
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:26,759
places where it was accepted to walk

97
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,719
down the street smoking weed I feel like

98
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:30,798
a lot of other places you know people

99
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:33,400
were worried about going to jail for

100
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,120
smoking weed in San Francisco walking

101
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,239
past cop smoking no problem no problem

102
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,360
so I feel like San Francisco has been

103
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,560
brace cannabis for such a long time yeah

104
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,439
for such a long time yeah I remember

105
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,560

106
00:03:44,438 --> 00:03:49,519

122
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:23,160
far as like my friend Circle my peer

123

weed guy for a long time yeah and that

127
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,680
was a different era you know what I mean

128
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,600
yeah that dude went to prison for 6

129
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,680
ounces like that uh that was a different

130
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,360
era completely different world back

131
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,439
right I feel like you know these new age

132
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,879
Trappers got a little soft like it was

133
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:43,079
it was big penalty of going to jail

134
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:45,120
before when we were doing it it was a

135
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:45,959
lot riskier it was a lot RIS scary times

136
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,240
for

137
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:50,079
sure we had pagers we didn't have all

138
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,519
the access that's hella funny someone

139
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,399
was just talking about pagers I'm like I

140
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:55,079
don't think I ever trapped off a pagro

141
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:57,239
I'm like I'm old but not that old I I

142
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:59,198
never trapped off the pagers yeah I'm 47

143
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,639
so I mean there was codes you didn't

144
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,400
even you know it it was a wild wild for

145
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:05,918
sure so you grew up in the Bay Area then

146
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,038
I did I grew up uh I grew up in

147
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:11,359

149
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,680
the legendary ciss for sure it's a big

150
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:17,439
topic on this show really it's my

151
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,639
favorite super dense it was like that

152
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:23,199
super dense yeah had a like almost a

153
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,199
yellowish tone to it definitely wreaked

154
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,720
like ammonia yeah ammonia you know and I

155
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:30,038
think there's multiple cat pisses we

156
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,800
talk about it all the time but right I

157
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:35,360

00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,560
was ciss the Bay Area ciss was like I

159

161

00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,439
to the town and Oakland everybody had

165
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,840

166
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:52,560
real zah you know I mean that was exotic

167
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:55,758

like that was that yeah that was that

170
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,360
old school Z well and that's the one

171
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:01,800
that

172
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,240
really made me fall in love with weed

173
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,478
was the cap his because you could smoke

174
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,759
it down to the roach you could fire it

175
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:09,719
up the next day $60 an e back then was a

176
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,360
lot of money that'd be like over 100 a

177
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,880
day for sure right but uh it was totally

178
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,240
it was that Stony indicia it was that

179
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:17,839
stare at your shoe Aces type Indica

180
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,680
Strong high and it could get you high if

181
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,159
you smoked it any time of the day and

182
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,439
night didn't matter didn't matter what

183
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,360
your tolerance was it was strong strong

184
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:28,879
strong what do you think the lineage on

185
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:31,720
that was uh Northern Lights times Super

186
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:34,478
Silver times skunk interesting but it's

187
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,520
it's long gone so remaking it you know

188
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,240
that's gonna be we're doing a

189
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,719
documentary this year on it and uh we're

190
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,598
working on versions of cat piss and

191
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,360
stuff like that right a lot of those

192
00:06:41,598 --> 00:06:44,519
versions are lost they're lost you're

193
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,038
not getting those back you're not

194
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:48,439
getting those back but along the way you

195
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:49,719
might find something better and that's

196
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:50,839
kind of what we're trying to explain I

197
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,520
would say you might find something

198
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:54,239
better for sure yeah or different or

199
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:55,519
different it's hard to say something's

200
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,759
better than something it's hard to say

201
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:58,478
something's better CU at the end of the

202
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:00,360
day it's a matter of opinion it's like a

203
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:02,439
zetopia better than Skittles or Skittles

204
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,680
better than zetopia depends who Mark

205
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:07,199
markets it better who grew it depends

206
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,840
who grew it who grew it has a large

207
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,360
portion of the conversation I think some

208
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:12,839
some really legendary strains have uh

209
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,759
lost their Allure because they've been

210
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:17,119
grown by poor Growers well Skittles is

211
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:19,240
one of those ones that people struggle

212
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,918
to grow good Skittles there's a handful

213
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,800
of people that can grow good Skittles

214
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:24,598
and that's

215
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,478
it it's not even the one% of it I

216
00:07:24,598 --> 00:07:28,519
wouldn't even say yeah it's such a it's

217
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:29,878
such a Fickle plant and the Skittles

218
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:32,799
Market is such a Fickle Market Market

219
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:34,720
it's such a unique such a unique odity

220
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,560
you know so I think that it still sells

221
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,319
in its green I mean it's not gelato it's

222
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:43,639
not the bud structure is not there it

223
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,639
doesn't have color it's it doesn't uh

224
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:47,918
it's not along the lines of any other

225
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:49,598
contemporary strains it's it's totally

226
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:53,639
unique it's totally unique and I was

227
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:54,719
like I was blessed to have Skittles 2017

228
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,918
I think is when I started getting

229
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,520
skittles from a a grower from humbold

230
00:07:56,918 --> 00:08:02,560
who had the who had the real yeah the

231
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:07,279
real Candy tardy Skittles cut so yeah I

232
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:09,478
tried it around June 10th of I I don't

233
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:11,519
remember exactly of 2014 was the first

234
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:13,279
time I tried it to the cup it's super

235
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,560
distinct super distinct you know

236
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:18,519
obviously like you know it's crazy I

237
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:21,079
remember I see the the grower was really

238
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:22,839
proud of the weed I was like I don't

239
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:26,038
know I looked at it it smelled great I

240
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:26,839
was like maybe a B+ and the grower was

241
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:29,240
very

242
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:31,319
offended and I was like he's like you

243
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:34,278
got smoke it and I'm

244
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:37,038
like well we's smoke it right and I will

245
00:08:34,278 --> 00:08:39,679
say this I hit the joint and it had

246
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:42,158
intense flavor it was super unique and I

247
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:45,159
was like wow this is really unique the

248
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:47,919
flavor on this is really really special

249
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:50,958
really special and the high was intense

250
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:52,599
and I was like okay this might be

251
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,599
something the bag appeal was definitely

252
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,080
not there though bag no it doesn't have

253
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,120
the bag ofel does not have the bag ofel

254
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,079
a lot of everybody you know you guys

255
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,360
have Skittles is sticky a lot of people

256
00:09:01,078 --> 00:09:05,439
don't have SK Skittles is sticky it's

257
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,240
dry it has like a dry talking about the

258
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,079
SF can group we do a lot of things not

259
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,240
other people are able to do yeah for

260
00:09:09,078 --> 00:09:14,239
sure I will say those dudes the SF Cana

261
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,320
cultivation team is a really talented

262
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,959
team that uh has a lot of diverse skills

263
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,560
yes they can grow Skittles they can grow

264
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,359
candies they can grow cookies I feel

265
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:23,838
like and they can grow in different

266
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,240
mediums they can grow in different

267
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,800
lighting I feel like those dudes are are

268
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,919
are really great at their craft really

269
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:31,278
great at their craft they do a lot of

270
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:32,679
things that most people can't do and the

271
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:35,879
yield on they're getting on the Skittles

272
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:38,239
is crazy the yield it's crazy crazy the

273
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:39,519
yield the quality like that's a [ __ ]

274
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,519
people don't believe I'm like I don't

275
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,720
know I seen it yeah you know so getting

276
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:46,399
three pounds plus a liers on Skittles is

277
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,278
is unheard of but it's like and doing it

278
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,919
at scale and doing it at scale it's rare

279
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:53,759
we don't do it little we don't do a

280
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:56,439
little no and it's like the quality most

281
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:58,480
people when they grow a small scale they

282
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,079
can get quality like that but once you

283
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,320
scale up past 100 lights or press 500 or

284
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:04,879
a, lights it's really it's level to the

285
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,440
[ __ ] man it's definitely it definitely

286
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:09,159
level to the [ __ ] and I feel like that's

287
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,440
why I was on a past thing I was talking

288
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:12,278
about you know there's small Growers

289
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,040
with with big egos there's small Growers

290
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:17,480
who have under you know smaller canopies

291
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:19,240
and they have it dialed in and then they

292
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,278
feel like they're great at their craft

293
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,959
but then there's other teams that are

294
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:25,838
doing it over a large scale which makes

295
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:27,479
it a totally uh it's a different level

296
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,920
it's a different level and to be able to

297
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,720
be able to uh get quality at larger

298
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:34,958
scales is is is you know a skill not

299
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,639
many many groups are capable of right so

300
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,759
what's your favorite uh thing to smoke

301
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:39,879
right now what are we smoking we're

302
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:42,159
smoking 11 coffins right now nice that's

303
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:44,120
good um this was a 400 seed hunt um

304
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:45,759
planted cannabis company La based

305
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,560
cannabis company that I'm uh partnered

306
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:50,000
with uh I think the cultivator is

307
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:51,599
amazing and I think that uh he's

308
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,039
dedicated a lot of space to finding new

309
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,680
flavors and new fenos um we've been

310
00:10:54,039 --> 00:11:00,559
popping around 200 seeds a month this SE

311
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:03,719
this was a 500 seed SE hunt 400 of which

312
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:05,719
was this uh rs11 Cross of coffin County

313
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,240
um it was bred by Duke of verb Duke of

314
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,959
DOA um really close friend of mine Rusty

315
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,600
uh so it was a large seat hunt and you

316
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:13,239
know it's hard to feno hunt you know I'm

317
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,480
the pallet and I get to you know help

318
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,120
select so it's hard to select that many

319
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,680
I I can't remember what the total was

320
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,759
but I know it

321
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:23,759
was man it might have been 70 70 to to

322
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:26,240
assess you know I feel like the

323
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:28,319
cultivator grows out 400 seeds x amount

324
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,680
are going to be male x amount of plants

325
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,040
aren't like are going to get crossed out

326
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:35,719
and then you get uh a sample of the ones

327
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:37,759
that are viable viable you know Keepers

328
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,720
right so I don't remember how many it

329
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:41,200
was but it was a lot it's a lot and I

330
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,079
feel like you have to do it in a time we

331
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,160
pass fashion because you know the

332
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:47,039
cultivator is is devoting space to

333
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:49,360
keeping all these plants alive so you

334
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,958
know the 70 or whatever fenos you have

335
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,278
so you have to get through them in a

336
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:55,439
timely manner I feel like you can only

337
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,399
smoke and fairly assess so many before

338
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,279
your pallet gets burnt out you know so

339
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:01,799
it was uh pallet fatigue say like I

340
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:03,879
would like to say it's a rough job but

341
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:05,759
like smoking like a ton of new flavors

342
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:08,078
all week long isn't isn't the worst job

343
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,879
ever you know what I mean so but and and

344
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:11,439
this was actually number 178 you know

345
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:14,000
you see a lot of uh strains are like

346
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,320
number four or number seven so this is

347
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,159
uh this is we call it 11 coffins and

348
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,720
this is number 178 out of 400 wow and

349
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:23,719
this one right here it's really dope

350
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,079
when you see all the fenos cuz you see

351
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,399
different representations you see

352
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:30,078
different characteristics get to come

353
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:32,159
out this one right here had the the rs11

354
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:34,239
that ozk gas it had an even balance of

355
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:35,879
the gas and the candy from the coffin

356
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,519
candy because coffin candy is another

357
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:40,639
strain that's unique to us but it's like

358
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,159
a complex candy um the 11 coffins yet

359
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,799
had an even balance of the you could

360
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:46,600
taste the rs11 type gas you could taste

361
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:49,278
the candy and I think that like strains

362
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,278
that do well blend things people are

363
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:53,000
familiar with you know so and I think

364
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:55,439
people want candy gas and I think this

365
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,198
is really a true candy gas it's sweet

366
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,399
it's gassy it's uh it's really complex

367
00:12:58,198 --> 00:13:01,958
it's got some different texture and

368
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:03,720
layers um so I like this one a lot I

369
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:06,399
like this one a lot we also have a uh

370
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,720
Skittles back cross but it's it's

371
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,759
Skittles backcross the Skittles back

372
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,440
cross to a strain called strawberry

373
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:15,639
scholato which is a Skol which is

374
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,160
Skittles by gelato by a strawberry

375
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:19,639
diesel coffin cut I don't know if you're

376
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:21,240
familiar with coffin cut but uh tast so

377
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:24,159
it's like a triple layer Z it's like a

378
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:26,360
triple Z that we've uh that's probably

379
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:28,198
the new strain that I'm most excited

380
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,680
about we also did an afternoon pineapple

381
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:33,000
which is a a sativa dominant that had

382
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:35,638
actual pineapple flavor cross that to

383
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,399
run so it's a candy gas but it's like a

384
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:40,639
hazy like it's like a hazy gas I would

385
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,000
like to say a more sativa I would to say

386
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,919
it tastes like pineapple but it has a

387
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,958
hazy sativa gas mixed with candy I think

388
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:50,799
I'm really excited for that one as well

389
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:50,799
nice what do you think about

390
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:56,599
sativas wouldn't be my first choice I

391
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:59,519
wouldn't say it be my first choice I

392
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,920
think that uh and I don't think that

393
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,480
it's really hard to see a true

394
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:04,958
representation of any of the you know

395
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,399
the sativa Indica labels it's hard to

396
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:09,078
see like real true definitions that

397
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:11,039
aren't hybrids so I would say that

398
00:14:09,078 --> 00:14:12,278
there's like sativa leaning plants that

399
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:14,879
I would

400
00:14:12,278 --> 00:14:16,639
say probably not my favorite probably

401
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:19,320
not my favorite but I haven't seen like

402
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:22,159
a really true ah maybe a little bit I've

403
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,959
seen some Nim snacks is a new strain

404
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:25,198
that's like that's like has a hazy type

405
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:27,799
Vibe I think

406
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:30,039
that that is definitely sativa leaning

407
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:32,519
that I that I really enjoyed it was

408
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:34,480
grown by Humble harvest in Sacramento um

409
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:36,240
they uh yeah they were growing this

410
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,800
nimma snacks and it had like a hazy

411
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,399
sativ gas but it was burning super clean

412
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:42,479
Super flavorful that I mean but I don't

413
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:44,839
think it would it would be my first

414
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,759
choice yeah you remember the super

415
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:49,040
silver back in the back in the day in

416
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:51,000
San Francisco I'm very familiar with

417
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:52,399
super silver I was working with a group

418
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,320
I was getting a bunch of super Silvers

419
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,839
from from a group that's like a 13

420
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,720
weeker or something huh that's like a

421
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:00,399
really really a longer flower it's a

422
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,519
longer flowering there shorter flowering

423
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:05,679
versions of it but the yeah the one that

424
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:07,959
was going around uh I think the dudes I

425
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:09,479
was working with a group out of Pacifica

426
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:12,119
a long time ago and they were growing

427
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,639
Super Silver and I think it was 13 weeks

428
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,720
yeah that [ __ ] takes forever when you're

429
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:17,120
waiting for it so that's like 15 weeks

430
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,199
before batch to batch you know what I

431
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,519
mean 16 weeks back batch to batch out of

432
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:23,078
like a house grow that [ __ ] yeah I did

433
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,759
work with a group that had the super

434
00:15:23,078 --> 00:15:27,399
silver I I I I like that strain I like

435
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:29,480
that strain would it be but I don't

436
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:31,919
think it would like be

437
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,800
tops as far as what my pette prefers

438
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:35,159
yeah and customers these days I mean I

439
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:37,318
guess if you had good super silver

440
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:39,919
anything will sell you know if it's good

441
00:15:37,318 --> 00:15:42,759
if it's premum I feel like anything that

442
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:45,559
is grown to really good quality will

443
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:46,600
sell except for Jacka rare right now so

444
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:48,799
I feel

445
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,920
like I feel like some of the he kids

446
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:53,198
showed me the new cool [ __ ] and I'm like

447
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:56,479
this is Jack and I feel like some groups

448
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:58,479
I think uh lumpies has an apple strain

449
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,639
but it it it's Jack Vibes to me and I

450
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,079
see and will say that like yeah a couple

451
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:05,039
people was like this is the new hot [ __ ]

452
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:07,120
and I'm like this is Jack bro this is

453
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:09,278
Jack so it's interesting to see because

454
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,560
I feel like a lot you know I feel like

455
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:12,799
the truth of the matter that that

456
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:14,399
strains that are marketed well do well

457
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:17,919
strains that are marketed really well do

458
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,240
well so so uh some of those strains and

459
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:20,559
I feel like some some really good

460
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,799
strains that aren't marketed well don't

461
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:25,359
do well you know so I think that uh

462
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:28,278
marketing has a lot to do with the with

463
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,600
the success of uh a lot of products yeah

464
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,958
especially like

465
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,879
if you're comparing on an even playing

466
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:36,879
field if we have like you know 1010

467
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:38,078
flour compared to 1010 flour whichever

468
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:40,039
one has marketed better is going to do

469
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:41,439
the best I mean the grass is greener

470
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:42,759
where you water it so you know I think

471
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,360
when you put the marketing attention on

472
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:47,879
top of it um it gets a lot of presents

473
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,680
it gets a lot of presents I think that

474
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:51,679
just kind of is what it is for sure

475
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:52,919
right I mean McDonald's and Nike they're

476
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:54,758
not making better product they're

477
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:56,838
they're doing more Innovative marketing

478
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:59,560
yeah how big of a role do you feel

479
00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:01,680
social media plays

480
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:03,239
how big of a role I feel like social

481
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:05,759
media plays a large

482
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,400
part I feel like that the social media

483
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:11,558
platforms have made it hard to Market

484
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:13,319
cannabis but um they're so normally used

485
00:17:11,558 --> 00:17:15,279
regularly used and I feel like that it's

486
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:17,838
a large tool to Market on I feel like

487
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:20,558
it's the very uh difficult tool to

488
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:22,879
Market on um I feel like I've been able

489
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:24,480
to navigate it relatively well but it's

490
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,839
definitely a Nuance space you have to

491
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,279
know how to tiptoe around Instagram

492
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:30,798
without getting deleted and I feel like

493
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:32,839
we've been deleted enough times to kind

494
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:36,079
of figure out what works and what

495
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:38,359
doesn't so I think that uh social media

496
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:40,399
does play a large part but I don't think

497
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:43,599
that that's going to be the future of

498
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:46,080
cannabis marketing no and I think

499
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:48,119
um the relationship with the customer is

500
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:49,918
the biggest thing and customer you know

501
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:52,239
having their trust to where they come

502
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,480
back and they shop and they want SF can

503
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,159
every time or they that's that's the

504
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,839
definition of a brand really that's the

505
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:59,200
definition of a brand your brand is your

506
00:17:56,839 --> 00:18:00,558
promise you know like if if I have like

507
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,880
initially the definition of a brand is

508
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:04,879
your brand is your promise like SF can

509
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,840
you know we only I mean I get to QC it

510
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,360
we only put our name on on x amount of

511
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:10,038
quality so that that's our promise that

512
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:11,879
every time you smoke our weed you're

513
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:16,519
going to get something that's beautiful

514
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:18,440
potent and burning clean so yes for sure

515
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:21,279
yeah we got a bunch of SF can of photos

516
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,798
in my book so that's dope yeah we went

517
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:23,960
toward and we've done we've been done a

518
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:25,720
bunch work together so with the

519
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,480
collaboration stuff and yeah you went

520
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:30,319
through some of the canal Loops fenos

521
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,919
there was like 90 some odd fetas it was

522
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:33,119
kind of all over the place with that one

523
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,679
so I feel

524
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:38,519
like they do an amazing job as far as

525
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,159
cultivation is concerned yeah as far as

526
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:42,359
labeling the cuts and knowing which

527
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:44,039
flavor is which that's I'm not going to

528
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:45,879
say they mastered that yet so I

529
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:48,000
definitely and I am blessed to test all

530
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:52,039
these and a lot of times I'm like what

531
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,200
is this yeah they're like number 647 I'm

532
00:18:52,038 --> 00:18:55,720
like what are the genetics I you know I

533
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,840
want to know all the stuff and I feel

534
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,640
like people want to know they want the

535
00:18:56,839 --> 00:19:00,959
story you know people want the story so

536
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,240
so a lot of times I feel like the

537
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,759
cultivat cultivation team that's not

538
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,240
really on the radar you know they're

539
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:09,759
looking for how how the weed grows how

540
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,038
the plant you know structure how to make

541
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:12,079
it taste better how to make it burn how

542
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:13,319
to make it taste better so sometimes

543
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:15,599
they don't know the genetics and I'm

544
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:17,119
like we got to know the genetics guys

545
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:18,839
guys we got to know the genetics you're

546
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,879
like I don't know James gave it to me

547
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:21,879
I'm like yeah but that's not the

548
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,600
genetics brother we can't Market this as

549
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:26,240
got this from James you know what I mean

550
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:29,158
right it's it's funny because uh I feel

551
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,440
like the the line keeps moving and the

552
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:34,000
bar keeps moving up oh the the

553
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,320
cultivation space is evolving at such a

554
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,880
fast pace and I think they're like the

555
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:41,480
Innovations and quality and the yields

556
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,400
and it's just you know it's evolving

557
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,400
super fast it's evolving super fast and

558
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,840
you see

559
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,880
people two years behind and they just

560
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:50,240
get further and further behind as as

561
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,880
everything starts to advance and then

562
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,839
you see like some of the more

563
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,280
technologically advanced growth and and

564
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:58,720
it's amazing what people are doing

565
00:19:56,279 --> 00:20:00,079
people that focus on White Ash getting

566
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,200
you know that's a whole another animal

567
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:04,399
too so it wasn't something that was

568
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:07,400
really in the conversation three or four

569
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,159
years ago so I feel like clean burning

570
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,519
weed has has been a lot part of the

571
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:13,520
conversation for a long time like you

572
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:15,200
didn't want your weed to burn black and

573
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:18,440
you wanted it to smoke well whether you

574
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:21,038
identified that as the white ash by Ash

575
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:23,000
color I don't think the ash color was a

576
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:24,599
box that needed to be checked but for

577
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,400
the for the weed to be flavorful and

578
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:27,879
burning clean was was a box to be

579
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,960
checked and for it not to be burning

580
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:32,640
black has been has been has been a thing

581
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:35,319
for a long time for sure um I don't

582
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,880
think that uh the science of White Ash

583
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:40,079
has uh totally been been mastered I feel

584
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:43,679
like there's definitely some other uh

585
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:45,960
nuances that uh that affect the color of

586
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,640
the Ash and I won't say that uh and I

587
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,679
feel like you know but as Baseline

588
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,919
typically if it's burning white it's

589
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,080
it's clean whether you know it's

590
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,038
interesting to see because I've seen

591
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:58,918
some of these more uh potent strains

592
00:20:56,038 --> 00:21:00,400
that don't burn as clean and I wonder if

593
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:02,720
that has anything to do with it because

594
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,320
I will say some a lot of these some of

595
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,960
these strains that are burning super

596
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:09,000
white necess not aren't necessarily the

597
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,440
most potent FL flavorful strains they're

598
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,119
just burning white and people like them

599
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,840
because they're burning white and I've

600
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:15,519
got flour that people were really proud

601
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:18,720
of and I'm like this is burning really

602
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:20,440
clean mhm I don't think it got me high I

603
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,480
didn't I'm not really tasting a lot of

604
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,679
flavor out it so the overall

605
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,480
experience I would rate it lower you

606
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:28,240
know I would rate it lower even though

607
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,519
it does have the white Dash yeah I feel

608
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,079
you it's really interesting and then the

609
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:33,558
struggle to get it white all the time

610
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:35,038
and I mean there's recipes that guys

611
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:38,639
have come up with where I feel like it's

612
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:41,200
pretty consistent but not everything is

613
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,278
the same so you have Skittles versus and

614
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,759
you know I'll say that I like to say

615
00:21:43,278 --> 00:21:48,480
maybe I'll take an unpopular stance

616
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:50,000
there's guys that have mastered curating

617
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,079
white ash but I still don't think that

618
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,759
their flower is at the top of the top of

619
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:57,599
the Heap you know there it always Burns

620
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:59,759
clean but in my opinion it's not the

621
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:02,038
best flower yeah well at the end of the

622
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:03,640
day I'm all about flavor and I'm all

623
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:05,240
about effect those are the two most

624
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,960
flavor and potency are really important

625
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,919
flavor and potency are real important

626
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,880
for sure we used to get C piss back in

627
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:12,400
the day it was the ugliest of ugly like

628
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,880
we get shreds in the bag sometimes and

629
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,960
it was s $60 for an eth and so that made

630
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,480
me realize how important the other

631
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,798
things are bag appeel wasn't as

632
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,400
important but you know the brick weed

633
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:26,480
was nasty back in the day so I didn't

634
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:28,159
get good brick weed oh yeah I didn't do

635
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,919
a lot of brick weed bless than I really

636
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:33,400
do a lot headaches no headaches for me

637
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:35,640
smoking out of cans with seeds

638
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,038
popping definitely hit out of a few cans

639
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,640
here and there definitely smoked in some

640
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:40,640
survival situations totally so yeah

641
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:44,320
where do you think the future of the

642
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,000
industry is going global yep that's why

643
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:48,278
I was in Spain I think that the Market's

644
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,679
going to improve globally I think

645
00:22:48,278 --> 00:22:52,319
Germany just did some type of

646
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:54,759
decriminalization

647
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:56,480
legalization I think that uh you know so

648
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:59,240
now you got Thailand Germany and a host

649
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,960
of other countries that are starting to

650
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:04,159
become legal and I think that uh are

651
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,360
able to trade with each other yeah so I

652
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,278
think that uh Global's the future I

653
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:11,199
think that having a global footprint is

654
00:23:08,278 --> 00:23:12,400
like essential and that's why I was uh

655
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,120
that's why I was in Spain because I

656
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,840
would like wanted to Market my Brands

657
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:18,038
globally have you been out to Thailand

658
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:20,879

659

665
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:33,880
stories of the market but I think it's

666
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:35,599
really interesting and and and

667
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,159

dropped a bag on weed in Barcelona you

693
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:27,159

694
00:24:23,558 --> 00:24:29,359

695

698
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,080
is booming out in Barcelona and I mean

699
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:40,559
still in my opinion it had amazing Vibes

700
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:42,678
man it had amazing Vibes and I I did

701
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:44,639
feel very welcomed and I did like the

702
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:46,600
culture of how they chilled at the shops

703
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,320
and smoked and you chilled there they'll

704
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:50,038
bring you you know smoking accessories

705
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:51,839
they got papers and bongs that's how it

706
00:24:50,038 --> 00:24:52,919
should be whatever you need man I love

707
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:54,319
it and some of them you know you can

708
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:58,440
order a latte some of them you can order

709
00:24:54,319 --> 00:25:00,240
a beer like uh food snacks

710
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,120
I yeah I definitely I definitely like

711
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,200
that

712
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:04,879
Vibe yeah I think it's great where you

713
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,519
can smoke and you can hang out and chill

714
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,760
in a public place where you know there's

715
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:11,759
other people I would take cannabis over

716
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:13,000
alcohol every single time so like I feel

717
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:14,919
like sometimes you know you get pulled

718
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,200
into the bar because that's a social

719
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:18,480
Norm in America so but I think there

720
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,679
there was establishments where we could

721
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,919
chill and smoke and have music and the

722
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:24,798
same type Vibes I would take that 10

723
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:26,799
times out of 10 you know over alcohol

724
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:28,839
and that's what I did like some of the

725
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:31,119
cafes in in in Span are open till

726
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:33,278
midnight 1:00 and you can you know catch

727
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:34,959
a Vibe chill smoke yeah it was pretty

728
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:36,119
dope and I like the flavors so I wanted

729
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,440
to see the menus I was hitting different

730
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:42,479
shops seeing different menus smoking the

731
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:44,480
SP the the CI genetic Spanish grown weed

732
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:48,200
yeah that's a lot of it a lot of the

733
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:50,798
good stuff for sure uh you tried any of

734
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:53,720
the Spanish stuff yeah I tried a lot of

735
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:57,158
gokal weed and I feel like I I feel very

736
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:59,079
blessed like uh yeah the power of social

737
00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:01,840
media one I touch down some local

738
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:03,839
Growers yeah knew um hit me up and I was

739
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:06,639
able and I was gifted a bunch of weed so

740
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:09,319
how about Spanish genetics uh it's

741
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,919
mostly Cali Amnesia ha I feel like well

742
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:13,319
that's the broad that's like what's

743
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:15,159
broadly grown there's lots of Amnesia

744
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:16,359
and then it's a lot of California

745
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:18,080
strains but they definitely want

746
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:19,599
genetics and they're like I love that

747
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:22,639
they're interested in popping seeds I

748
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:24,319
feel like yeah yeah cuz you know popping

749
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,038
seeds is for everyone it's not like the

750
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:27,879
most profitable way to go if you're like

751
00:26:26,038 --> 00:26:29,679
trying to make money popping seeds is

752
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,640
not the way to make the most money but

753
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:34,038
like but it's essential for like the

754
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:35,720
future and and I think it has its own

755
00:26:34,038 --> 00:26:37,679
value it's inherent value not everybody

756
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,480
can cash in on that value but it has

757
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,798
definitely has a lot of value well and

758
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,079
guys over there are now growing better

759
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:43,398
to where they can actually do good

760
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:44,960
selections because you have to grow a

761
00:26:43,398 --> 00:26:47,519
certain level to do sele to really

762
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,960
assess you got to yeah to really have a

763
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:50,158
good representation of the plan if it's

764
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,679
not grown well you get a poor

765
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,360
representation of the plan you don't

766
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:56,759
know how about hash holes what's your

767
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:59,519
opinion on that I love hash holes I'm

768
00:26:56,759 --> 00:27:00,640
not a I'm not a hash hole all day guy

769
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:03,000
right and it's

770
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,038
interesting I'm not really the guy I I

771
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,919
feel like I enjoy smoking really good

772
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:10,119
rosin really you know I don't mind

773
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:11,759
paying for really good rosin but I don't

774
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:13,678
know if it's worth it to throw that $100

775
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:16,319
a gram rosin into the hash all I don't

776
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:18,919
know that I get I feel I get that that

777
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:20,359
uh pleasure out of it but some people do

778
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:21,960
some people do I would rather take a

779
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:24,079
second wash I I feel like I'd rather

780
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,399
roll a hash hole in a second wash then

781
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:31,000
like some people are busting open these

782

you know these jars that are 200 bucks a

783
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,200
jar and throwing them in a hash hole I'm

784
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:37,000
like that's crazy I feel like it's like

785

806
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,519
malul liquor just man these people were

807
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:34,159
crazy M Liquor is crazy it's crazy that

808
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:36,079
like s Ides is the huge uh cannabis

809
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,320
infused drink like and I feel like the

810
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:41,240
younger generation isn't aware of like

811
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:42,319
the sa he Snoop Dog M licker 40

812
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,960
generation because that's what I

813
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:46,359
identify St Ides as you know what I mean

814
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:48,640
the Crooked Eye type type drink so it's

815
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:50,359
interesting to see that uh there's say

816
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,960
eyes infused cannabis drinks that that

817
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:55,319
are really popular right now totally

818
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,880
good for S eyeses though for sure they

819
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:58,599
definitely cleaned up their image yeah

820
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,679
it's interesting all these compan

821
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:02,439
that are going to be jumping towards

822
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,080
cannabis though too in the future to

823
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,320
yeah the big companies are are coming

824
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:07,000
you know that's like that's just an

825
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:09,079
indication like St I they're a large

826
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,359
model liquor company now they're huge in

827
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:12,678
the Cannabis space there's going to be

828
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:14,678
more of that for sure especially as like

829
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:17,240
federalization clears up things become

830
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:18,440
legal things become clearer then yeah

831
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,839
the large money is definitely going to

832
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:23,200
come in yeah it's already coming in

833
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:25,319
sneaking in it's already dripping in

834
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,399
yeah for sure but like just trickling in

835
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:29,240
not like you know well I mean there's

836
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:30,639
there's it's a big industry and there's

837
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,798
several sides of the industry there's

838
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,000
the boutique highend side of the

839
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:36,798
industry and then there's large IND and

840
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,798
there's everything else yeah know for

841
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:43,079
sure for sure I'm on the top I

842
00:29:39,798 --> 00:29:46,119
mean for sure and the boutique yeah I

843
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:47,798
mean the highend you know it's so small

844
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:49,918
everybody knows every very small segment

845
00:29:47,798 --> 00:29:52,398
of the market everybody knows everybody

846
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,240
and that's like it's not for everybody

847
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:55,639
like it's not it's not for everybody and

848
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,558
that's not that's not there's nothing

849
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,640
wrong with that most people aren't going

850
00:29:57,558 --> 00:30:01,038
to enjoy you know the best of the best

851
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:03,120
when you look at alcohol most people

852
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:05,240
aren't enjoying the finest wines you

853
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:06,719
know they're getting somewhere middle to

854
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,278
bottom and that's what most most

855
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,880
cannabis consumers are consuming you

856
00:30:08,278 --> 00:30:13,798
know like so but there are those people

857
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:16,278
that really really you know search for

858
00:30:13,798 --> 00:30:18,480
the search for the best and and seek

859
00:30:16,278 --> 00:30:19,599
that out and enjoy it and it's funny

860
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,278
because it's always you know what's

861
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:24,240
funny in cannabis it's not necessarily

862
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:25,798
like the uh the financial levels like I

863
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,000
don't know how you say it but like I

864
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:30,000
feel like some people with meager means

865
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,839
smoke smoke the best weed smoke the best

866
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,679
weed you know what I mean Sacramento I

867
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:35,398
feel like it's a median income City

868
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,640
Sacramento they're smoking amazing weed

869
00:30:35,398 --> 00:30:39,079
in Sacramento so I feel like and there's

870
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,759
some people I know with a bunch of money

871
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:43,038
and they just smoke the the worst

872
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:45,558
cheaters the wor rich people smoke the

873
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:46,759
worst weed ever for sure so I think I

874
00:30:45,558 --> 00:30:47,918
mean I guess it just shows what some

875
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:49,879
people are passionate about and what's

876
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,840
important to them but yeah totally well

877
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,640
yeah it's great when passion drives it

878
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:55,480
and you know I think the other thing is

879
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,759
is collecting data points over time

880
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,679
really determines how much you like we

881
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:01,440
or don't like weed I think right you

882
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,120
smoke a lot then you realize what's good

883
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,759
and bad if you smoke very rarely then

884
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:07,798
it's kind of all the same and it's hard

885
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:10,558
to really assess it after 20 years or 15

886
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:12,158
years or whatever you really get a good

887
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:14,798
idea if if you tried a bunch of stuff

888
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:17,760
you can really have a more broad broader

889
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:19,038
pette yeah a broader pette for sure well

890
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:20,440
with cannabis you can go in any

891
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:23,558
direction it's like there's so many

892
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:25,120
different flavors out there now uh as

893
00:31:23,558 --> 00:31:28,759
far as like whatever Direction you want

894
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:32,278
to go berries strawberries blueberries

895
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:33,759
raspberries assai berries right there

896
00:31:32,278 --> 00:31:36,599
there's so many variants there's so many

897
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:39,000
variants it's definitely infinite when

898
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:40,398
there's a lot of subtleties the plant

899
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,079
I'm all about the subtleties there's a

900
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:44,918
lot of nuances in the plant there's a

901
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:47,038
lot of reasons yeah why things can't be

902
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:48,799
I feel like people are always like if we

903
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,839
can mix this strain and that strain

904
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:53,158
we're going to get and it's never like

905
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:55,638
that and it's never and it's never like

906
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:58,159
that people like you know we cross this

907
00:31:55,638 --> 00:32:00,638
with that it's almost never like that

908
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,559
it's it's mostly never like that and

909
00:32:00,638 --> 00:32:04,519
every once in a while you get lucky

910
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:06,200
every 400 fenos later you find one that

911
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:07,440
matches what you were looking for

912
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,798
totally but there's a lot of recessive

913
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,240
traits in the genetics so when you're

914
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:13,798
trying to breed for specific stuff

915
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,638
unless you're reinforcing those traits

916
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:18,038
if you're just creating f1s you don't

917
00:32:15,638 --> 00:32:19,119
know what you're going to get um and if

918
00:32:18,038 --> 00:32:20,278
you don't know your lines you don't know

919
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:21,678
what you're going to get right so the

920
00:32:20,278 --> 00:32:23,880
more you breed the more you work with

921
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,440
the plants you kind of know what the

922
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,639
possibilities

923
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,880
are what what what characteristics are

924
00:32:27,638 --> 00:32:30,000
going to come out and how heavily each

925
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,799
one's going to come out is just

926
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
different right yeah I think that's when

927
00:32:31,798 --> 00:32:36,440
you see large when you see a bunch of

928
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,240
different fenos yes there's like common

929
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:40,080
characteristics in all of them and some

930
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,798
are you know I think it's just like kids

931
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:43,119
like you know you have five kids they

932
00:32:41,798 --> 00:32:44,558
all look similar they all got the same

933
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:46,678
eyes but they're all some are tall some

934
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:48,398
are small you know I think it's it's

935
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:50,360
similar with uh when you do AR pheno

936
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:51,959
hunts there's Char certain base

937
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:53,519
characteristics that you can see in in a

938
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,639
large portion of the strains that come

939
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:58,038
out and it's just different how how much

940
00:32:55,638 --> 00:32:59,199
of that comes out is is is a is

941
00:32:58,038 --> 00:33:00,679
different I think that's really that's

942
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,480
really one of the most interesting

943
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:05,120
things from feno hunting that I found is

944
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,000
like is that yes there's base

945
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:08,959
characteristics that you can see in all

946
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,880
these strains that like come out and

947
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,440
then you look for the one that where the

948
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,080
characteristics that you're looking for

949
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:16,519
comes out the most yeah and then there's

950
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:18,158
the unicorns you know that's and then

951
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:20,359
there's the what the [ __ ] is this right

952
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,960
exactly and then yes all these look the

953
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:22,959
same about the same about the same about

954
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,319
the same and then you're like oh what

955
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,480
the [ __ ] is this there's definitely some

956
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:28,558
of those what the [ __ ] are this for sure

957
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,480
those are the fun ones too

958
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:31,798
the funky ones there's like okay you

959
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,919
know and I think that when yeah when

960
00:33:31,798 --> 00:33:35,119
you're selecting Keepers you're like

961
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:36,960
okay I like this one cuz this character

962
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:38,678
stand out I like this one because these

963
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,639
characteristics stand out we're going to

964
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:42,759
rerun this one because it grew so well

965
00:33:40,638 --> 00:33:44,398
you know and like but some of them are

966
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:45,879
like this one's funky this one's

967
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:47,759
different and like it's hard to assess

968
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:50,039
whether that's good or bad you know it's

969
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:52,319
hard to hard to it's hard to forecast

970
00:33:50,038 --> 00:33:54,319
what people are going to like for sure

971
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:56,398
well until you smoke it you don't really

972
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:58,918
know if it's a winner and I think some

973
00:33:56,398 --> 00:34:00,439
people Miss on that that note when

974
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:01,480
they're going through the process really

975
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,558
at the end of the day it's all about

976
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:05,079
smoking and finding out the effect and

977
00:34:03,558 --> 00:34:06,638
The Taste because sometimes it just

978
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:09,078
doesn't translate on the plant it's the

979
00:34:06,638 --> 00:34:11,960
most amazing beautiful smelly thing and

980
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:14,240
then you grow it out and smoke it or you

981
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:16,599
dry it out and smoke it and it's just

982
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:18,878
not totally different experience hard I

983
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:20,519
think that you know I think that's why

984
00:34:18,878 --> 00:34:22,358
it's important to have a team or like

985
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:24,559
people with diverse skill sets I think

986
00:34:22,358 --> 00:34:26,480
that like my planta cultivation partner

987
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:27,878
is an amazing cultivator and he knows a

988
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,358
lot of the characteristics of the the

989
00:34:27,878 --> 00:34:32,000
plant but then yes he dries the flower I

990
00:34:30,358 --> 00:34:35,159
get to smoke the flour and assess it and

991
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,119
see like from a a smoker's perspective

992
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:38,919
like what I feel is about the plan and I

993
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:41,039
think that we come together and find

994
00:34:38,918 --> 00:34:43,799
some really special things so you're in

995
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:44,960
Sacramento Too part time I'm all over

996
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,720
place I don't know where I don't even

997
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,039
know where I'm at that's the new Emerald

998
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:51,719
Triangle beta LA to Sacramento so I just

999
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:54,079
be running the triangle the new triangle

1000
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:55,358
that's the new triangle yeah so since we

1001
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,240
played a game with Chris we're going to

1002
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:58,880
do this little game where I got three

1003
00:34:57,239 --> 00:35:01,118
joints

1004
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,800
two of them are SF Cana and one of them

1005
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:06,440
is not SF Cana and you get to guess

1006
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:08,800
which one I get to guess which one so

1007
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:11,920
you can go ahead and dry hit them all

1008
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:15,920
and then uh we'll fire them up

1009
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:17,559
interesting interesting challenging no

1010
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:22,159
we like to have

1011
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:22,159
fun I'm all four fun I'm all four

1012
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,640
fun I feel like this is most likely

1013
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,640
something that we

1014
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:44,599
feel like this is a maybe this is a

1015
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,240
maybe this is just from the dry H though

1016
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:48,559
we got to fire it up just from the dry

1017
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:48,559
head

1018
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,800
yep no but I feel like okay this one's

1019
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:58,400
not we didn't grow this one I don't know

1020
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,640
you know what it is I I'm GNA say this

1021
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,599
we grow a lot of [ __ ] people don't get

1022
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:04,838
to see and I feel very blessed to see it

1023
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:06,119
all like so this feels this one seems

1024
00:36:04,838 --> 00:36:08,440
like a strain that we're not known for

1025
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:11,760
this feels like like a glitter bomb e

1026
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:13,880
different e yeah that has something

1027
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,560
different in it but I feel like so my

1028
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:19,079
vote would be this one but I will say

1029
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:22,199
this we I feel like we SF Canon we have

1030
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:24,960
access to most of the great contemporary

1031
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:27,759
genetics out there and we've grown them

1032
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,760
whether they worked out for us is is you

1033
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,200
know not

1034
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:33,240
always not always the case but we have

1035
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:35,318
access and grown some things cuz this

1036
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:36,679
tastes like a glitter bomb SF can we're

1037
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:38,079
not grown from glitter bomb but we grew

1038
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:40,598
some glitter bomb you guys did grow some

1039
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:42,800
glitter bomb two F yeah so we grew some

1040
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:44,599
glitter bomb we've grown some so but I

1041
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,640
think that but I would take didn't I

1042
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:47,240
have to smoke them I feel like if I

1043
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:49,879
smoked them I would definitely yeah

1044
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:51,439
definitely definitely know because it's

1045
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:54,358
the thing not everything smokes like SF

1046
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,280
can weed right but I would say this we

1047
00:36:54,358 --> 00:36:57,960
this would fire first this would be my

1048
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:01,119
vote and this would one be the one that

1049
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:02,599
I'd want to smoke the least yeah not

1050
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,519
saying that it's a bad thing I think

1051
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:06,079
that like you know it's just just a

1052
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:08,559
matter of preference it's a matter of

1053
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:10,839
preference so I would smoke the sweet

1054
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:14,679
one first

1055
00:37:10,838 --> 00:37:16,880
nice yeah I would smoke the sweet one

1056
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:19,759
first it's funny CU When you say that

1057
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,720
cand is really popular people get mad

1058
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:26,359
like I feel like I'm just going to say

1059
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:28,000
it candy is the most in demand flavor

1060
00:37:26,358 --> 00:37:30,119
right now and some people will get mad

1061
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,199
when you say that and I'm like I don't

1062
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:34,240
control the market the market controls

1063
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:36,719
the market yeah the Demand controls the

1064
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:39,838
market so if people like dessert

1065
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:42,318
flavored strains then and that's just

1066
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:44,440
what it is that's just what it is I

1067
00:37:42,318 --> 00:37:47,079
enjoy a really good gassy biscotti

1068
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:50,800
carbon fiber type weed as well but I

1069
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:53,760
feel like the market right now they want

1070
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,400
color and then they want a candy candy

1071
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,119
yeah and then something else with it you

1072
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:59,200
could put candy gas you could put you

1073
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:01,160
know just got to be a little different

1074
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:03,559
just got to be a little different that's

1075
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:06,920
a hit

1076
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:08,559
yeah yeah the gelato the we're in the

1077
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:12,318
age of gelato

1078
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:14,358
still we are in the age of gelato c yeah

1079
00:38:12,318 --> 00:38:17,519
I would say some people say runs you

1080
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:19,440
know but yeah I mean gelato still the

1081
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:22,199
from the Gelato I feel like it's you

1082
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:24,159
know the elbows connected to the to the

1083
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:26,399
wrist is connected to the finger type

1084
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:27,838
thing you know like right if you look at

1085
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,318
it that way if you look at it as

1086
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:30,599
everything's gelato crosses and you

1087
00:38:29,318 --> 00:38:32,358
could also say everything's cookie

1088
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:34,880
crosses cuz gelato came from cookies

1089
00:38:32,358 --> 00:38:39,078
which was the biggest wave or impact in

1090
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:41,800
the bay it was yeah I mean 2010 20 to

1091
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:43,039
2012 it was the biggest thing out there

1092
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,800
in the at least coming from the bay

1093
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:48,079
there was still a lot of ogs La just

1094
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:51,000
loved their ogs you know yeah like that

1095
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:52,640
2010 era I think that kushes had a a

1096
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,280
nice little wave in the bay where people

1097
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:55,960
wanted to grow I was growing like a

1098
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:59,240
classic Bubba cush that had like the

1099
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:01,318
really cushy structure at that the

1100
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:05,479
classic OG Kush was really in favor a

1101
00:39:01,318 --> 00:39:07,239
little bit in that 2010 2012 Range but

1102
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,880
then the cookies rained dominant for a

1103
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:12,838
very long time for for a really long

1104
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:14,760
time yeah cookies didn't catch on in

1105
00:39:12,838 --> 00:39:16,599
other places quite like it did the bay

1106
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,960
you know La had cookies you can get

1107
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:20,318
cookies I feel like it was that's what

1108
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,760
kind of made it the exclusivity of it

1109
00:39:20,318 --> 00:39:24,039
like a lot of people were interested in

1110
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,920
it but not everybody could get real

1111
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:27,559
cookies right you had to come to the

1112
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,960
city you got to come to the city for the

1113
00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:30,279
cookies yeah it was the first thing I

1114
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:33,519
smoked that tasted

1115
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:35,720
Brey it's got that that bready character

1116
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:38,079
that this it's also in like wedding cake

1117
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:39,118
and stuff like that yeah that's what I

1118
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,560
was going to say yeah all those

1119
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,720
contemporary strains kind of come back

1120
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:44,960
to some kind of cookie right the

1121
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:46,480
doughiness of it yeah I mean a lot of

1122
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,159
that stuff is out there for sure cookies

1123
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,639
is in a lot of

1124
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:52,559
stuff so I feel like this tastes like SF

00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:58,838
like it's funny I go to these I go to

1153
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:00,800
these City's on some cannabis related

1154
00:40:58,838 --> 00:41:03,358
stuff and I'm not really uh as familiar

1155
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,160
with the city as as I as I would prefer

1156
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:06,440
to be so yeah I got to Houston and I was

1157
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:08,960
like and I didn't realize it was a

1158
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:10,480
really cool City I didn't I didn't uh it

1159
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,838
exceeded my expectations as well I

1160
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,119
didn't know what to expect I didn't know

1161
00:41:11,838 --> 00:41:14,199
what to expect you know what I mean I

1162
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:15,880
had never been out there I thought it

1163
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:18,838
was going to be a little country but n

1164
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:20,760
it's like real modern big city for sure

1165
00:41:18,838 --> 00:41:24,159
crawfish when I think of Houston I think

1166
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:25,720
a good crawfish VI craw crawfish too

1167
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:27,399
yeah it's really good that sounds like a

1168
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:29,199
Vibe it sounds like a Vibe sounds like

1169
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,480
something I'd like I didn't know Houston

1170
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:31,919
was see I didn't know Houston was known

1171
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,039
for that and they had I mean they have

1172
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,720
really good food there really good food

1173
00:41:34,039 --> 00:41:37,519
they had amazing food the cost of living

1174
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:39,519
is a lot less than California for sure

1175
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:40,920
it's amazing the cost of living yeah

1176
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:42,519
it's amazing what you can get out there

1177
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,880
relatively it's crazy how much stuff

1178
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:48,318
costs out here well now with the thca

1179
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:51,599
it's like they have thca all over Texas

1180
00:41:48,318 --> 00:41:53,318
and uh you know it's like they tax that

1181
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:55,720
we we yeah the

1182
00:41:53,318 --> 00:41:58,000
DCC you know and the taxes that we have

1183
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:59,399
to deal with in California way different

1184
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,239
than like what you know they're dealing

1185
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:04,960
with in Texas where they have it in a

1186
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:07,838
CBD shop yeah it's crazy it's crazy the

1187
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:10,079
tax the taxes has has had the largest

1188
00:42:07,838 --> 00:42:11,599
impact on the I mean if we're talking

1189
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:13,599
about the might as well call it the

1190
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:15,000
failure of the recreational Market where

1191
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:17,280
I mean it hasn't been a whole lot of

1192
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,199
winners in the recreational market and

1193
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,000
and a lot of that is just due to due to

1194
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:24,279
taxation due to Taxation and it's really

1195
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,079
hard for a consumer to pay $80 for eth

1196
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,680
that Bobby down the street has for 40

1197
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:30,240
you know it's really difficult and

1198
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:32,118
that's like and and that's from the

1199
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:34,719
taxation I think it's overly taxed it's

1200
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:36,240
not tax like it's not tax similar to

1201
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:37,919
other things that would be similar you

1202
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:39,879
know it's not taxed like alcohol would

1203
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,920
be it's tax at such a high rate that

1204
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:45,079
it's made it almost impossible for a lot

1205
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:47,639
of recreational companies to succeed

1206
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:50,000
almost like it that was the plan

1207
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:51,920
H yeah it's interesting because the

1208
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:56,119
price has gone down

1209
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:59,119
of the flour and then the price price of

1210
00:42:56,119 --> 00:43:00,640
everything else has gone up has so now

1211
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:02,480
there's not as much profit and it's a

1212
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:04,719
big struggle it's a big struggle for a

1213
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,480
lot of companies it's it's a big

1214
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:09,199
struggle for a lot of country companies

1215
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:12,039
I would say the industry as a whole has

1216
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:15,078
had a difficult past you know 36 months

1217
00:43:12,039 --> 00:43:16,639
36 months postco I feel like there's a

1218
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:17,920
lot of nuances as to why that happened

1219
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:20,199
obviously a lot of people made a lot of

1220
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,599
money during during covid and invested

1221
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:24,598
that in infrastructure which made a made

1222
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:26,039
a larger Supply you know the influx in

1223
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:28,000
Supply is going to always defect the

1224
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:29,480
demand yeah I mean a lot of people are

1225
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,880
regretting their investments in

1226
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:34,079
infrastructure I see it over and over

1227
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:35,838
and over again 2021 everybody was going

1228
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,280
bigger everybody was going bigger

1229
00:43:35,838 --> 00:43:40,039
they're like I got 200 lights I'm going

1230
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,800
build out to 900 like all right yeah I

1231
00:43:40,039 --> 00:43:43,838
think a lot of us thought it was never

1232
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:45,720
going to end you know and it was so good

1233
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:47,759
during Co for so many people especially

1234
00:43:45,719 --> 00:43:49,239
in this industry I feel like yeah man

1235
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,720
the price of the price of cannabis went

1236
00:43:49,239 --> 00:43:53,598
up 300% in like three months I mean

1237
00:43:51,719 --> 00:43:56,000
that's unheard of I don't know why

1238
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:57,680
people thought that was gonna last but

1239
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,440
but yeah it was such a

1240
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:01,440
it was such a huge jump in the market it

1241
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,440
affected the market so much and then I

1242
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,838
mean I think that that influx of cash

1243
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,599
affected a lot of the world so and we

1244
00:44:05,838 --> 00:44:09,880
see the effects that it had on cannabis

1245
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:12,280
and a lot of those a lot of those

1246
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:14,400
Ventures sadly enough are failing at a

1247
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:16,599
at a at a high rate yeah it's

1248
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:19,039
interesting and then now I mean we're

1249
00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:21,119
talking about going global and then

1250
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:23,279
we've got all these countries opening up

1251
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:25,680
and eventually there's going to be

1252
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:27,240
Commerce we're going to do not just

1253
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:30,598
domestic but it'll be International

1254
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:31,959
domestic and uh import export it's going

1255
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:33,400
to be amazing we're still in the first

1256
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,880
quarter I feel like we're definitely

1257
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,800
like in the first quarter you know we're

1258
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,200
in the first half of the first quarter

1259
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,880
as far as how the industry is going to

1260
00:44:38,199 --> 00:44:41,358
develop in the next 10 years you know

1261
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,800
yeah just scratching the surface of it

1262
00:44:41,358 --> 00:44:44,279
just scratching the surface and all the

1263
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:47,079
infrastructures that have to be built

1264
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:48,519
out in between no there's definitely uh

1265
00:44:47,079 --> 00:44:50,559
going to be a lot of opportunities in

1266
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:52,119
cannabis in in the in the upcoming

1267
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:53,400
future yeah I'm looking forward to some

1268
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:56,200
of it I'm looking forward to the new

1269
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,639
genetics too it's like uh people are

1270
00:44:56,199 --> 00:44:59,519
there's a lot of people breeding right

1271
00:44:57,639 --> 00:45:01,598
now there's more people growing than

1272
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:04,199
ever before you know I think that and

1273
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:06,160
that's globally everybody's a breeder

1274
00:45:04,199 --> 00:45:07,558
globally if you didn't touch no poen

1275
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:08,480
you're not a breeder right I don't know

1276
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:10,400
what the rules are I don't know what the

1277
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,119
rules are but that's what I you know so

1278
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,800
I've heard I don't know so you yeah

1279
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:15,318
that's that's supposed to be the deal

1280
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,400
you know it's a lot of people coming up

1281
00:45:15,318 --> 00:45:17,838
with new strains but I'm like you're not

1282
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:21,039
a breeder though how you come up with a

1283
00:45:17,838 --> 00:45:23,838
new strain like I rename game is real

1284
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:26,199
it's the rck game yeah there's 75

1285
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:29,199
different uh Lemon Cherry gelados with

1286
00:45:26,199 --> 00:45:31,078
different names that yes Rich off recked

1287
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:34,759
runs that's a new thing recked runs

1288
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:37,318
recked runs yeah that's a new thing

1289
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:38,839
definitely yeah there's a lot of every

1290
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:40,400
week There's a new strain but no breeder

1291
00:45:38,838 --> 00:45:42,199
attached like I don't know how you got

1292
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,119
that one right but most of these Brands

1293
00:45:42,199 --> 00:45:47,679
aren't cultivators so it's like just

1294
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:49,280
marketing just marketing yep so it's

1295
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:52,799
funny because Lemon Cherry gelato is

1296
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:54,839
really still I would say the most

1297
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,160
popular thing on the market I mean

1298
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:58,000
there's there's a lot of other popular

1299
00:45:56,159 --> 00:46:00,838
things

1300
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,119
lemon gelato is just dominant right now

1301
00:46:00,838 --> 00:46:06,199
in the highest demand is in the highest

1302
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:09,240
demand yes and I feel like what it it

1303
00:46:06,199 --> 00:46:11,598
actually is is is Up For Debate it's

1304
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:13,879
really up for debate right yeah no for

1305
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:17,640
sure but it's probably the largest in

1306
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:20,039
demand definit yeah as far as as a whole

1307
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:21,838
as a whole solid lcg that's what the

1308
00:46:20,039 --> 00:46:23,800
wholesale people want yeah it checks the

1309
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:25,519
boxes for most people it checks the

1310
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:28,559
boxes for most people man it looks good

1311
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:30,719
smell good tastes good get you High yeah

1312
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:32,359
that's enough for most people totally

1313
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:34,279
I'm good with that you know Skittles

1314
00:46:32,358 --> 00:46:36,358
doesn't have a big ceiling but it it as

1315
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:38,760
far as effect it doesn't get you that

1316
00:46:36,358 --> 00:46:41,480
high it doesn't get you high blam you

1317
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:44,240
like this one not at all y it's a

1318
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:46,400
daytime smoke more ativa leing yeah that

1319
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:48,199
yeah for sure but it's a it's

1320
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:50,720
approachable to everybody like that's

1321
00:46:48,199 --> 00:46:52,439
one thing with Skittles it's like it t

1322
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:54,118
pretty much it tastes so good and

1323
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:57,400
anybody can ever and everybody can

1324
00:46:54,119 --> 00:47:00,358
appreciate that flavor so distinct yep

1325
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:03,480
for sure we got to get on a joint number

1326
00:47:00,358 --> 00:47:05,119
two I'll take that one when you fire up

1327
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,679
you like it so much you're not sharing

1328
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:09,079
to the bottom no that's good I'll write

1329
00:47:06,679 --> 00:47:09,078
the second

1330
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:16,400
one yeah this one's got a nice ring it's

1331
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:18,519
got some drip to it that one was smoking

1332
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,880
what's funny CU not that one at all

1333
00:47:18,519 --> 00:47:22,639
really good flow I feel like from the

1334
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,559
time you light it up it changes and the

1335
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:27,799
flavor intensifies as it goes down if

1336
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:30,119
it's really good down into the roach for

1337
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:32,559
sure and that's rare you know what that

1338
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:34,960
is if the last 40% of your joint is

1339
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:38,000
enjoyable that's really good rare flower

1340
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:41,440
yep that tastes aming top

1341
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,760
10% feel like you're 30% there's 30% of

1342
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:46,079
the joint left and it's still flavorful

1343
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:48,160
that's top tier flour I mean I would say

1344
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:49,960
on average stuff the first hit might

1345
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:52,358
taste good and then the flavor goes away

1346
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:54,960
right and then there's like typical yeah

1347
00:47:52,358 --> 00:47:57,000
that's typical that's most things you

1348
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,440
know and some stuff that looks so good

1349
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,519
you go to smoke it and it's a

1350
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,920
disappointment some of it smells so good

1351
00:48:00,519 --> 00:48:05,000
and the smell doesn't transfer into the

1352
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:07,760
taste of the smoke no yeah purple punch

1353
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,159
is one that I am not a huge fan of

1354
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:11,240
straight purple punch but I think it's a

1355
00:48:09,159 --> 00:48:14,358
good breeder I think it breeds well into

1356
00:48:11,239 --> 00:48:16,118
stuff uh but it just has kind of bland

1357
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:18,039
turps like you you might get a little

1358
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:20,160
flavor when you light it up and that's

1359
00:48:18,039 --> 00:48:21,719
it all the way down there's nothing else

1360
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:24,318
I like the flavor that it does have

1361
00:48:21,719 --> 00:48:27,480
though yeah that had a nice sweet candy

1362
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:28,960
flavor it's like a predecessor to good I

1363
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:31,960
think the extract on that's really good

1364
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:35,199
but I'm not a huge yeah just not my

1365
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:37,800
thing not most people's thing yeah

1366
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:40,679
doesn't have the potency no has the bag

1367
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:42,720
appe pill though I feel like it's a lot

1368
00:48:40,679 --> 00:48:45,078
of Growers had success growing it as

1369
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:48,000
well yeah for

1370
00:48:45,079 --> 00:48:50,280
sure forbidden fruit was another one

1371
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,079
it's like forbidden fruit had its 15

1372
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:54,760
minutes of fame literally that's one of

1373
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:57,559
those this is unique this is different

1374
00:48:54,760 --> 00:49:00,040
but so I feel like it was unque it was

1375
00:48:57,559 --> 00:49:03,680
different everybody was

1376
00:49:00,039 --> 00:49:05,519
interested the appeal went went bad fast

1377
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:06,798
overnight overnight night people were

1378
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:08,838
like I don't want this people were

1379
00:49:06,798 --> 00:49:11,119
interested and then they decided that

1380
00:49:08,838 --> 00:49:12,558
they didn't like it right I remember the

1381
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:15,200
first bag of forbidden fruit I smelled I

1382
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:17,440
was like this is different this is crazy

1383
00:49:15,199 --> 00:49:18,358
yeah then I smoked it I was like ah not

1384
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,480
my

1385
00:49:18,358 --> 00:49:22,920
favorite yeah it's funny because Tangi

1386
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:25,119
really had its day for a long time Tangi

1387
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:27,760
was you know it was winning all the cups

1388
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:30,760
I think it's one of the most awarded

1389
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:32,440
uh strains in history and you don't see

1390
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:34,440
Tangi anymore really I mean I don't see

1391
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:36,559
Tangi anymore you know what you see

1392
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:38,960
Tangi that's grown to get washed cuz you

1393
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:40,880
see a lot of Tangi rosin you see that

1394
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:43,280
like there's some Tangi strains that are

1395
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,079
grown just to get washed yeah and I like

1396
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,240
orange turps I like I mean I like every

1397
00:49:45,079 --> 00:49:49,960
kind of turp pretty much I'm not a

1398
00:49:47,239 --> 00:49:52,039
citrus turp guy I mean that'd be like my

1399
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:54,199
least favorite probably is like some

1400
00:49:52,039 --> 00:49:56,440
Citrus turps but yeah I won't go by it

1401
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:58,679
or go out of my way I interesting enough

1402
00:49:56,440 --> 00:50:00,679
like some of the yeah some of the hot

1403
00:49:58,679 --> 00:50:02,239
[ __ ] is like some orangey citrusy turps

1404
00:50:00,679 --> 00:50:03,719
that I've seen lately that people were

1405
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:06,318
like hey this is the hot [ __ ] and I was

1406
00:50:03,719 --> 00:50:09,239
like the orange Citrus turps huh dude

1407
00:50:06,318 --> 00:50:09,239
that orange Zer Bird's

1408
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:16,919
good the orange Z's unique like I said

1409
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:18,880
orange wouldn't be my you know yeah I I

1410
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:20,960
feel like that one is not super popular

1411
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,519
on the market as far as for me you know

1412
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,519
never seen a blacked out strain that

1413
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:27,759
tastes sisterly like that and that

1414
00:50:24,519 --> 00:50:32,639
orange zerbert was like full Co

1415

00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:37,280
Sunkissed oranges but yeah you have to

1418
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:39,880
really like that orange it's kind of

1419
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,798
like how Jack is kind of disliked orange

1420
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:42,838
I don't know if you heard of Orange

1421

00:50:42,838 --> 00:50:46,558
orange drink that's what the orange Z

1423
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:49,440
tastes like yeah I never seen a I never

1424
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:51,760

1425
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:54,318
super dark strain like that one but same

1426
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:56,000

Dante's Inferno yeah I've heard of that

1440
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:29,480
as well no I haven't smoked any of that

1441
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:32,599
yeah yeah I haven't touched a lot of the

1442
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:34,199
smaller batch I have and I but like I

1443
00:51:32,599 --> 00:51:37,480
haven't been dug into a lot of the

1444
00:51:34,199 --> 00:51:41,759
smaller bad stuff how about

1445
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:44,079
Z I feel like if lcg is number one Z

1446
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:46,359
might be as might be the two or the

1447
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:47,920
three might be the two or the three it

1448
00:51:46,358 --> 00:51:50,358
might be one of those trains that people

1449
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:52,798
still have interest in might still have

1450
00:51:50,358 --> 00:51:55,318
like similar value and the real zope is

1451
00:51:52,798 --> 00:51:57,280
amazing it's good I I think it's great

1452
00:51:55,318 --> 00:51:59,679
and the real Z is a really amazing

1453
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:02,079
strain SF canana and planta both of my

1454
00:51:59,679 --> 00:52:04,358
cultivation Partners have grown it and

1455
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:06,839
they both came with some really amazing

1456
00:52:04,358 --> 00:52:09,519
representations of soap representations

1457
00:52:06,838 --> 00:52:12,318
of soap so I definitely soap is a

1458
00:52:09,519 --> 00:52:15,280
definitely a pretty dope strain so are

1459
00:52:12,318 --> 00:52:17,639
you going to go with sfk on that one yes

1460
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,960
for sure I would say can you guess what

1461
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:19,960
what it

1462
00:52:20,358 --> 00:52:26,318
is uh no let me see hold this is the

1463
00:52:25,318 --> 00:52:28,400
that's what I was going to say I feel

1464
00:52:26,318 --> 00:52:31,159
like I was like this could lean either

1465
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:34,200
way it is more

1466
00:52:31,159 --> 00:52:37,838
of it's got a nice

1467
00:52:34,199 --> 00:52:37,838
Ash it's burning

1468
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:44,798
clean I don't know I'm like I could tell

1469
00:52:40,358 --> 00:52:44,798
you which ones it's not yeah it's

1470
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:51,880
uh guava gas it's guava gas interesting

1471
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:53,400
number four number four and I have gg4

1472
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:58,039
on the bag so everyone's like Gorilla

1473
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:58,039
Glue number four no it's quava gas

1474
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:04,920
I like the five better no I'm just kid

1475
00:53:02,199 --> 00:53:06,000
yeah out of the uh that was a really I

1476
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:08,119
think

1477
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,880
that I think that we found some really

1478
00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:13,160
dope guava gas fenos yeah same thing I

1479
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,720
don't think it's going to be hit though

1480
00:53:13,159 --> 00:53:17,000
but I think the potency on the [ __ ] is

1481
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:19,000
crazy it's crazy potency on the [ __ ] is

1482
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,519
really crazy but I don't know that it's

1483
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,798
going to be like I don't know that it's

1484
00:53:21,519 --> 00:53:26,838
it's going to be a wave maybe hit yeah

1485
00:53:23,798 --> 00:53:28,920
maybe I it might it might it did for

1486
00:53:26,838 --> 00:53:33,039
Nemo that's a very you know that's a

1487
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:34,798
very unique that's a very unique uh

1488
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:36,798
brand that's a very unique brand that's

1489
00:53:34,798 --> 00:53:38,519
been around for 18 years yeah you know

1490
00:53:36,798 --> 00:53:40,639
that's been around 18 years they they've

1491
00:53:38,519 --> 00:53:43,318
been able to make a lot of [ __ ] jump

1492
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:47,598
that uh most people can't make jump and

1493
00:53:43,318 --> 00:53:50,119
the man the Skittles and the the number

1494
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:52,760
they're getting for their units is

1495
00:53:50,119 --> 00:53:54,920
astronomical it's pretty wild much

1496
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:57,280
respect to them man much respect to them

1497
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:58,440
they're definitely uh

1498
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,920
feel like there's so many yeah there's

1499
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:01,960
so many segments of the market you know

1500
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:03,480
what I mean and they have their segment

1501
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:05,000
of the market that's willing to pay an

1502
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:07,480
astronomical amount of money for their

1503
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,798
product I ain't mad at them like I feel

1504
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:11,318
like a lot of people hate on them a lot

1505
00:54:08,798 --> 00:54:13,559
of people love them but I'm not mad at

1506
00:54:11,318 --> 00:54:15,000
them they've been they've they've done

1507
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:16,319
an amazing job I think they've done an

1508
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,599
amazing job it's good for everybody

1509
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:19,960
that's what people that don't like them

1510
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:21,559
they their own issues but uh it's good

1511
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,880
for everybody you know and there's

1512
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:25,119
levels to all this and there's price

1513
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,798
points for everybody so no matter you

1514
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:29,680
you go to buy a car there's price points

1515
00:54:26,798 --> 00:54:31,280
that go on up forever and ever exactly

1516
00:54:29,679 --> 00:54:33,598
no yeah for sure and whether it's worth

1517
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:35,040
it or not that's like yeah that's a

1518
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:36,880
matter of opinion the people that are

1519
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:39,039
paying it think it's worth that they

1520
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:41,318
must and they're paying it and I know

1521
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:44,719
for actual factual that they're paying

1522
00:54:41,318 --> 00:54:48,480
it it's not like yeah got a friend that

1523
00:54:44,719 --> 00:54:50,239
P yeah I got a more yeah I got a friend

1524
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:52,559
that just got a QP at an astronomical

1525
00:54:50,239 --> 00:54:54,318
rate and I was like oh it's real people

1526
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:56,760
are paying that okay for sure and he's

1527
00:54:54,318 --> 00:54:59,079
saying that yes he could get X out for

1528
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:00,440
it and I was like that's absurd but it's

1529
00:54:59,079 --> 00:55:02,079
wild the Market's there for it the

1530
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:05,960
Market's there you know what I mean I'm

1531
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:09,839
like not mad at it not mad at it yep and

1532
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:12,079
I've had some really good uh

1533
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:15,440
representations of their work so I I

1534
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:17,318
respect their work I mean so yeah it's

1535
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:19,000
good it smokes good I respect what

1536
00:55:17,318 --> 00:55:20,838
they've done as a brand as well they've

1537
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,440
curated Their audience and they've been

1538
00:55:20,838 --> 00:55:25,480
able to get the highest dollar for their

1539
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:27,200
product I'm not mad at them by any means

1540
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:30,000
yeah if if we weed would have gone up as

1541
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:32,159
much uh with inflation that's what we

1542
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,838
all would be paying compared to like the

1543
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:36,798
80s and 90s if you look at the price of

1544
00:55:34,838 --> 00:55:39,318
wead yes it it hasn't gone up with

1545
00:55:36,798 --> 00:55:41,960
inflation but I think that's

1546
00:55:39,318 --> 00:55:43,679
because I mean when it was illegal it

1547
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:46,039
was being produced at a lower rate now

1548
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:47,759
that it's legal you know there's there's

1549
00:55:46,039 --> 00:55:48,960
there's less risk so there's less reward

1550
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,200
you know what I mean there's less risk

1551
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,920
so there's definitely less reward that's

1552
00:55:50,199 --> 00:55:56,798
a big part of why the price is cheaper

1553
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:58,240
right I mean 50 pounds are probably

1554
00:55:56,798 --> 00:55:59,719
you're probably going home you get

1555
00:55:58,239 --> 00:56:01,118
pulled over 50 pounds you're mother in

1556
00:55:59,719 --> 00:56:03,480
California you're probably going home

1557
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:05,880
today smile on a handshake yeah I

1558
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:08,199
remember I remember when 50 grams you're

1559
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:10,200
probably not going home no I think 50

1560
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:11,558
pounds now is they're not even going to

1561
00:56:10,199 --> 00:56:13,279
bring you in they're going to site you

1562
00:56:11,559 --> 00:56:14,519
and release you probably I think you're

1563
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,839
right man I think you're right I don't

1564
00:56:14,519 --> 00:56:18,079
want to test the theory out I'm not

1565
00:56:15,838 --> 00:56:21,239
trying to test the theory out but that's

1566
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:22,960
the rumor rumor has it you know what I

1567
00:56:21,239 --> 00:56:26,399
mean yeah

1568
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:27,880
so so it's a way different age so yeah

1569
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,599
way less risk so it's got to be less

1570
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:31,440
reward even though it's still rewarding

1571
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:34,079
well it's a misdemeanor now so

1572
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:36,079
misdemeanor yeah as it should be as it

1573
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:38,559
should be for the

1574
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:41,760
best so yeah we had Luke scarmazzo on

1575
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:44,039
the show he did 14 years Luke scarmazzo

1576
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:46,200
was the guy I feel like he's uh when he

1577
00:56:44,039 --> 00:56:48,799
went down he was he was the dude he was

1578
00:56:46,199 --> 00:56:50,480
the dude he was the flex king of his era

1579
00:56:48,798 --> 00:56:54,038
he was definitely the flex king of his

1580
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:56,559
era I think that he has a uh he has a

1581
00:56:54,039 --> 00:56:59,559
great a better image now but L car Mo

1582
00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:01,760
was the guy before he was like yeah I

1583
00:56:59,559 --> 00:57:04,400
know that I know of his legacy he has a

1584
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:06,200
he he's a feel like he has his own he's

1585
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,000
like a living legend to a certain degree

1586
00:57:06,199 --> 00:57:10,038
yeah and he's young still he's young

1587
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,639
still but there that he was like the

1588
00:57:10,039 --> 00:57:14,400
story was he was like Sky balling off

1589
00:57:11,639 --> 00:57:16,038
cannabis like in a long time ago and

1590
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:18,400
then he got busted by the feds and did a

1591
00:57:16,039 --> 00:57:20,319
lot of time behind it but yeah I heard

1592
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:23,240
he was the flex King I dude he wrote a

1593
00:57:20,318 --> 00:57:24,519
good book too he his stories but yeah I

1594
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:26,038
would love to hear his whole story I

1595
00:57:24,519 --> 00:57:28,480

1599
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:36,720
doing his thing getting a lot of bread

1600

1602
00:57:39,639 --> 00:57:44,159
story that I heard yeah that I heard you

1603
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:45,440
know like it was like one of the people

1604
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:47,639
that people were getting behind trying

1605
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:49,960
to help support to get out of cannabis

1606
00:57:47,639 --> 00:57:52,038
or get out of prison and I was like I'm

1607
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:55,240
like I definitely heard a bro like he's

1608
00:57:52,039 --> 00:57:58,440

1609
00:57:55,239 --> 00:58:01,558
streets he's a legend for

1610
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:02,760
sure feel like not everybody knows that

1611
00:58:01,559 --> 00:58:04,839
a lot of people know that he was in jail

1612
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:06,319
for cannabis they don't know the whole

1613
00:58:04,838 --> 00:58:08,159
story they don't know that he was a

1614
00:58:06,318 --> 00:58:10,400
legend in these

1615
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:13,639
streets yeah he was doing big [ __ ] in

1616
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:15,160
the streets yeah pushing boundaries he

1617
00:58:13,639 --> 00:58:17,118
push pushing boundaries he was pushing

1618
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:19,598
boundaries he was pushing them over he

1619
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:21,160
was pushing them over that was a thing

1620
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:23,280
for sure and a different and it was a

1621
00:58:21,159 --> 00:58:24,838
different era it was a different era so

1622
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,880
how long do you think gelato is going to

1623
00:58:24,838 --> 00:58:29,078
be you know that not not even gelato but

1624
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:31,119
that flavor profile is going to be on

1625
00:58:29,079 --> 00:58:33,880
top you think it's going to lo you know

1626
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:36,519
10 12 years you think it's going to go

1627
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:38,519
sooner man if I had the answer to that

1628
00:58:36,519 --> 00:58:40,719
one I'd be rich crystall because I feel

1629
00:58:38,519 --> 00:58:42,358
like everybody wants to know what's next

1630
00:58:40,719 --> 00:58:45,358
yeah and I feel like you know there's

1631
00:58:42,358 --> 00:58:48,119
been large marketing efforts to push

1632
00:58:45,358 --> 00:58:50,239
what's next but I don't think anything's

1633
00:58:48,119 --> 00:58:53,079
really caught the traction caught the

1634
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:56,118
traction of like the broader market yet

1635
00:58:53,079 --> 00:58:58,760
so yeah how long that's going to last I

1636
00:58:56,119 --> 00:59:01,559
I don't know I feel

1637
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:03,640
like I mean I think that as it develops

1638
00:59:01,559 --> 00:59:05,240
there's just going to be there's so many

1639
00:59:03,639 --> 00:59:08,318
there's so much infinite variety of

1640
00:59:05,239 --> 00:59:10,798
flavors that there's going to be Savory

1641
00:59:08,318 --> 00:59:12,400
gassy sweet different categories of

1642
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:14,199
flavors and it just in the Market's

1643
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,599
going to determine what's going to be

1644
00:59:14,199 --> 00:59:18,358
the most popular it's interesting

1645
00:59:16,599 --> 00:59:20,838
because back in the day it was like it

1646
00:59:18,358 --> 00:59:23,798
was very Regional what was popular you

1647
00:59:20,838 --> 00:59:26,318
know La was OG we had cookies in the bay

1648
00:59:23,798 --> 00:59:29,239
they had Sour Diesel in New York right

1649
00:59:26,318 --> 00:59:32,440
down in Florida they had their own thing

1650
00:59:29,239 --> 00:59:34,279
and I feel like because of accessibility

1651
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:35,920
and because of social media everybody

1652
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:37,640
knows who's popular and so it's all all

1653
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:39,400
over the place I feel like we're we're a

1654
00:59:37,639 --> 00:59:41,879
lot more Global world at this point

1655
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:43,200
we're a lot yes with the with the

1656
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:45,280
internet and social media were a lot

1657
00:59:43,199 --> 00:59:48,439
more Global worlded I feel like slang

1658
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:50,920
and fashion used to be like more uh more

1659
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:52,960
Regional but as far as like how the

1660
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:54,760
access to information and access to

1661
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:57,000
people I feel like we're more a global

1662
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:59,599
Society so yeah there the trends seem to

1663
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:03,119
be more Global yeah food slowly become

1664
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:04,920
that extremely Global Food I mean it's a

1665
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:07,720
glob Global Society you know we can talk

1666
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:10,000
to people Nationwide yeah so easily now

1667
01:00:07,719 --> 01:00:14,199
there's so much access to information

1668
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:16,119
now so much so much too much too much

1669
01:00:14,199 --> 01:00:18,919
sometimes for sure well I feel like

1670
01:00:16,119 --> 01:00:21,280
there's a lot of information and there's

1671
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:23,599
like just as much misinformation so it

1672
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:26,039
just depends who you ask yeah so if you

1673
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:27,318
could go back in time to your younger

1674
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:29,480
yourself that had just been in the

1675
01:00:27,318 --> 01:00:31,480
industry for one or two years what would

1676
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:33,960
be your biggest piece of advice trust

1677
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:37,079
your hustle trust your hustle yeah I

1678
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:39,400
feel like that's a thing

1679
01:00:37,079 --> 01:00:41,280
yes uh I don't think I ever looked at

1680
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:43,318
cannabis as a career so maybe if I would

1681
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:45,559
have had thought it was a career and I

1682
01:00:43,318 --> 01:00:48,599
had invested more time in it might have

1683
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:50,440
could have got further but more or less

1684
01:00:48,599 --> 01:00:51,599
I'm happy with how things worked out

1685
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,920
well it's great that you're driven by

1686
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:54,039
Passion I mean I think that's the

1687
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:56,559
biggest thing is that's one of the

1688
01:00:54,039 --> 01:00:58,200
biggest blessings like well and really

1689
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:59,240
to start off smoking it's one thing I I

1690
01:00:58,199 --> 01:01:01,838
have a lot of friends who start off

1691
01:00:59,239 --> 01:01:03,439
growing I was like a Avid smoker I love

1692
01:01:01,838 --> 01:01:05,639
smoking weed right I love everything

1693
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:06,920
about the plant but uh that's that's

1694
01:01:05,639 --> 01:01:08,759
what made me fall in love with it was

1695
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:11,079
the smoking not just the growing or

1696
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:12,640
anything else it's interesting to see

1697
01:01:11,079 --> 01:01:14,318
because there's a lot of Growers that

1698
01:01:12,639 --> 01:01:16,759
are really passionate about the growing

1699
01:01:14,318 --> 01:01:18,798
aspect not so much the smoking aspect

1700
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:22,200
and it's like I'm definitely I'm

1701
01:01:18,798 --> 01:01:24,519
definitely the smoking aspect of it so

1702
01:01:22,199 --> 01:01:26,439
it's interesting to see that like people

1703
01:01:24,519 --> 01:01:28,119
value my palette cuz I never it wasn't

1704
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:30,720
like a skill that I set out to have you

1705
01:01:28,119 --> 01:01:32,400
know what I mean yeah so well you're

1706
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:34,078
blessed by being in the right Circles of

1707
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,639
people to have exposure to the good

1708
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:37,318
stuff and really you know that's once

1709
01:01:35,639 --> 01:01:39,199
you get the good stuff you can never go

1710
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:41,639
back in my opinion it's just it's really

1711
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:44,199
tough man it's real tough to go back

1712
01:01:41,639 --> 01:01:45,679
like I mean you can go back financially

1713
01:01:44,199 --> 01:01:47,879
you can you know that might be the

1714
01:01:45,679 --> 01:01:51,038
circumstances but yeah once you once you

1715
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:53,599
smoked and enjoyed really good good good

1716
01:01:51,039 --> 01:01:55,960
flow it's hard to go back yeah no I

1717
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:57,400
can't smoke no mids NOP it's hard even

1718
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:59,599
go on vacation when you have such good

1719
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:01,240
flower unless you have flower with you

1720
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:02,720
or you know it's like any more we're

1721
01:02:01,239 --> 01:02:03,959
talking about global so there's places

1722
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:06,159
like Spain where you can really get good

1723
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:08,760
flower but that's not

1724
01:02:06,159 --> 01:02:11,519
everywhere that is not everywhere and I

1725
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:12,760
feel like yeah that that that dictates

1726
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:14,400
some of my travel I don't want to go

1727
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:16,319
anywhere where we can't smoke good cuz

1728
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:18,358
how good could it be if we can't smoke

1729
01:02:16,318 --> 01:02:19,759
right that's definitely a thing but in

1730
01:02:18,358 --> 01:02:21,759
the future that would be really cool

1731
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:23,799
like if you had a brand and you could

1732
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:26,278
have insert the same quality globally

1733
01:02:23,798 --> 01:02:28,440
like I could you know pop a ath planta

1734
01:02:26,278 --> 01:02:31,199
open in California and get the same

1735
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:33,358
quality in Spain get the same quality in

1736
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:36,598
the UK that would be that'd be pretty

1737
01:02:33,358 --> 01:02:39,480
dope yeah freshness it's com I feel it's

1738
01:02:36,599 --> 01:02:41,880
coming it is how fast who knows how fast

1739
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:43,679
who knows yeah I feel like a lot of

1740
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:45,599
times we take two steps forward and one

1741
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:48,318
step back as long as we're still going

1742
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:50,480
in the right direction that's okay it's

1743
01:02:48,318 --> 01:02:53,318
coming yeah yeah I feel like I feel the

1744
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:54,920
same I agree I agree it's like the

1745
01:02:53,318 --> 01:02:56,079
progress is slow I feel like progress is

1746
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:58,278
slow but we're heading in the right

1747
01:02:56,079 --> 01:03:00,318
direction making huge strides yeah I

1748
01:02:58,278 --> 01:03:01,880
don't think any of us Enis envisioned

1749
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:05,599
legalization being like this when we

1750
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:08,240
were younger but not at all not at all I

1751
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:09,599
didn't think this no might have invested

1752
01:03:08,239 --> 01:03:11,159
more time into it had I thought it was

1753
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:14,119
going to it was going to develop the way

1754
01:03:11,159 --> 01:03:16,078
it did but yeah yeah same I'm happy how

1755
01:03:14,119 --> 01:03:17,838
it worked out yeah it's a great time to

1756
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:20,318
be alive I mean just in general with

1757
01:03:17,838 --> 01:03:23,358
technology and the the emerging

1758
01:03:20,318 --> 01:03:25,038
technology and now we got the the new

1759
01:03:23,358 --> 01:03:26,598
virtual reality glasses that just came

1760
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:28,039
as wild

1761
01:03:26,599 --> 01:03:30,240
it's a great time to be alive and I

1762
01:03:28,039 --> 01:03:32,319
think that the evolution of cannabis is

1763
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:34,159
is is crazy it's evolved it's evolved

1764
01:03:32,318 --> 01:03:36,679
just as fast and I feel like the culture

1765
01:03:34,159 --> 01:03:39,199
of of cannabis Enthusiast has evolved

1766
01:03:36,679 --> 01:03:41,759
you know just as fast so there's like a

1767
01:03:39,199 --> 01:03:44,318
lot of culture and events that are

1768
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:46,359
starting to develop like super fast that

1769
01:03:44,318 --> 01:03:49,318
we'll see like on a global scale in our

1770
01:03:46,358 --> 01:03:51,920
lifetime probably yeah so you got to try

1771
01:03:49,318 --> 01:03:51,920
that one last

1772
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:56,278
joint the you might want to go back to

1773
01:03:54,119 --> 01:03:58,599
one the mystery joint the mystery joint

1774
01:03:56,278 --> 01:04:01,318
you don't think is SF hopefully it

1775
01:03:58,599 --> 01:04:04,000
smokes well it's not it's different and

1776
01:04:01,318 --> 01:04:05,199
that's what I was going to say that like

1777
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,039
I feel like a lot of these brands are

1778
01:04:05,199 --> 01:04:09,358
known for especially like cultivation

1779
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:11,240
brands that uh are known for certain

1780
01:04:09,358 --> 01:04:13,358
strains but I think they all grow a

1781
01:04:11,239 --> 01:04:15,838
bunch of different strains so I was

1782
01:04:13,358 --> 01:04:17,038
going to say you know I know you're

1783
01:04:15,838 --> 01:04:19,358
friends with the grower you get some of

1784
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:21,640
the ones that not everybody gets me too

1785
01:04:19,358 --> 01:04:22,960
yeah so cuz it tastes like something we

1786
01:04:21,639 --> 01:04:24,358
could have grown but definitely

1787
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:26,760
something that we're not known for be

1788
01:04:24,358 --> 01:04:29,078
growing yeah you you guys stay away from

1789
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:30,720
long who these are well these are very

1790
01:04:29,079 --> 01:04:32,278
well rolled who rolled these

1791
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:34,679
professional joint roller at Instagram

1792
01:04:32,278 --> 01:04:36,199
he's our joint guy I I roll joints too I

1793
01:04:34,679 --> 01:04:37,759
just don't have time he gets the band on

1794
01:04:36,199 --> 01:04:41,239
them he gets it down perfect I mean I

1795
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:43,319
write I roll good joints myself but I

1796
01:04:41,239 --> 01:04:46,199
enjoy I enjoy these a

1797
01:04:43,318 --> 01:04:47,679
lot so these are so these are the

1798
01:04:46,199 --> 01:04:49,239
collaboration with SF Canon we got

1799
01:04:47,679 --> 01:04:50,919
pre-rolls coming out we've been r&amp; ding

1800
01:04:49,239 --> 01:04:53,000
them for a while we still have to r&amp; DM

1801
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:54,599
for longer but this is the pre-roll that

1802
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,599
we're going to be releasing in in

1803
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:58,640
California this is a nice size this is a

1804
01:04:56,599 --> 01:05:00,480
good size joint yeah I like that three

1805
01:04:58,639 --> 01:05:01,879
gram to three and a half gram those are

1806
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,159
I feel like you get the best flavor out

1807
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:05,640
of them especially when it's good and

1808
01:05:04,159 --> 01:05:07,558
you can smoke I like that as a share

1809
01:05:05,639 --> 01:05:08,879
size if I'm smoking it by myself I would

1810
01:05:07,559 --> 01:05:11,039
probably want it a little bit smaller

1811
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:12,880
but for a share size this is perfect

1812
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:15,240
well I feel like with the SF can of weed

1813
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:17,400
for example you can put it back in the

1814
01:05:15,239 --> 01:05:18,879
tube and you can pull it out of the tube

1815
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:21,720
and it still tastes good you can do that

1816
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:23,160
four or five times so for sure I really

1817
01:05:21,719 --> 01:05:25,439
and then same thing with feno hunting

1818
01:05:23,159 --> 01:05:26,798
I'm big on giving people joints for feno

1819
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:28,400
hunting rather than giving them the

1820
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:30,639
flower so it's all kind of on the same

1821
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:32,440
even playing field interesting that's

1822
01:05:30,639 --> 01:05:35,400
dope I think man I wish people did that

1823
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:36,838
for me yeah and just hand me roll

1824
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:38,680
pre-rolled joints of all the all the

1825
01:05:36,838 --> 01:05:40,199
fenos and be like hey just smoke these

1826
01:05:38,679 --> 01:05:41,759
I'm like no I want to see the flower too

1827
01:05:40,199 --> 01:05:43,719
though but I want to like both though

1828
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:45,839
right well someone like you you I would

1829
01:05:43,719 --> 01:05:47,000
share the FL Two Joints yeah I'd share

1830
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:48,838
the flower with you and then I want to

1831
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,159
know the feedback on the joints right

1832
01:05:48,838 --> 01:05:51,558
right but not everybody for the most

1833
01:05:50,159 --> 01:05:54,759
part I know what the good flow looks

1834
01:05:51,559 --> 01:05:56,240
like I know it has bag appeel it's the

1835
01:05:54,760 --> 01:06:00,200
really The Taste in the effect that I

1836
01:05:56,239 --> 01:06:01,639
want to know right feedback from and and

1837
01:06:00,199 --> 01:06:02,960
like how how did it taste to the Joint

1838
01:06:01,639 --> 01:06:05,358
when you smoked it halfway was the

1839
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:06,559
flavor gone was the flavor even better

1840
01:06:05,358 --> 01:06:08,199
down when you fired the road trip the

1841
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:09,839
next day some of the weed the flavor

1842
01:06:08,199 --> 01:06:12,519
changes as you smoke

1843
01:06:09,838 --> 01:06:16,278
it so it doesn't stay consistent it's a

1844
01:06:12,519 --> 01:06:18,759
big thing right they're like this is the

1845
01:06:16,278 --> 01:06:22,000
one that gets put out I don't think that

1846
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:23,839
this was not your cup of tea this didn't

1847
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,358
really taste

1848
01:06:23,838 --> 01:06:30,358
right like this one might have and

1849
01:06:26,358 --> 01:06:31,358
spicy spice it's actually not even THC

1850
01:06:30,358 --> 01:06:34,159
it's

1851
01:06:31,358 --> 01:06:36,199
spice that's interesting it's spicy it

1852
01:06:34,159 --> 01:06:38,639
is spicy that's

1853
01:06:36,199 --> 01:06:40,399
funny I'm like which one do I really

1854
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:42,598
likee tell me a little bit more about

1855
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:45,440
your MMA career MMA is a tough way to

1856
01:06:42,599 --> 01:06:48,079
make a living yeah my MMA career I felt

1857
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:50,000
like I was very blessed to uh be around

1858
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:51,559
some of the best people in the sport so

1859
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,679
I was blessed to be around some of the

1860
01:06:51,559 --> 01:06:56,559
best people in the sport and I think

1861
01:06:53,679 --> 01:06:58,278
that I was blessed to see like

1862
01:06:56,559 --> 01:07:00,480
how people at a high level perform

1863
01:06:58,278 --> 01:07:02,318
because I was I was around some of the

1864
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:04,199
some of the best fighters in the world

1865
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:04,960
so it's interesting to see how like the

1866
01:07:04,199 --> 01:07:07,558
best

1867
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:10,400
people perform and handle things at a

1868
01:07:07,559 --> 01:07:11,760
high level so uh so my fighting career

1869
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,960
was dope I think that it was it was

1870
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:15,839
really dope it was something that I

1871
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:18,720
enjoyed as well

1872
01:07:15,838 --> 01:07:21,318
um uh yeah that I was passionate about

1873
01:07:18,719 --> 01:07:24,519
that I was able to make some money doing

1874
01:07:21,318 --> 01:07:27,159
so it was cool I think that uh it's a I

1875
01:07:24,519 --> 01:07:30,278
really fighter pay is the most [ __ ] up

1876
01:07:27,159 --> 01:07:33,199
[ __ ] in like sports I feel like like uh

1877
01:07:30,278 --> 01:07:34,719
the amount of Revenue that the largest

1878
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:38,118
mmaa promotions are paying their

1879
01:07:34,719 --> 01:07:40,358
Fighters is like very small amount like

1880
01:07:38,119 --> 01:07:43,278
uh most professional sports I think the

1881
01:07:40,358 --> 01:07:46,038
revenue sharing is like closer to 50% to

1882
01:07:43,278 --> 01:07:48,480
where like the league makes 50% the

1883
01:07:46,039 --> 01:07:50,119
players make 50% somewhere in that range

1884
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:52,880
and I think that like professional

1885
01:07:50,119 --> 01:07:55,720
fighting it's like the largest company

1886
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:58,278
gets 85% of the profits and they pay out

1887
01:07:55,719 --> 01:08:00,919
there people 15% so I think that there's

1888
01:07:58,278 --> 01:08:02,440
a lot of uh that the fighter pay is

1889
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:04,039
really [ __ ] up like if we're speaking

1890
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:05,400
all that the fighter pay is [ __ ] up if

1891
01:08:04,039 --> 01:08:07,359
the fight if the fighter pay was better

1892
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:10,639
I might have fought more uh but it

1893
01:08:07,358 --> 01:08:12,719
wasn't like and I feel like the fame in

1894
01:08:10,639 --> 01:08:14,679
clouded is high but the pay is low you

1895
01:08:12,719 --> 01:08:16,399
know what I mean so and I feel like yeah

1896
01:08:14,679 --> 01:08:18,599
the opening pay for some of these larger

1897
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:21,000
promotions isn't that high and I feel

1898
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:22,920
like there is some people making making

1899
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,399
a really good living but it's a very

1900
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:26,039
small amount most people that are

1901
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:28,639
fighting are definitely in it for the

1902
01:08:26,039 --> 01:08:31,600
love of the fight game not not not for

1903
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:34,640
the B yeah if you look at the I think

1904
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:36,640
only like a real real sliver of the

1905
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:38,560
people are making a good living doing it

1906
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:40,520
yeah there's a handful of people

1907
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:42,319
crushing there's a handful of people

1908
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:44,920
getting their bag but not that many they

1909
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:46,880
not that many shout out to Nate Diaz he

1910
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:49,319
did his thing he's he got paid he

1911
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:51,798
showing everyone thing he's been showing

1912
01:08:49,319 --> 01:08:54,120
everybody how it's done for a long time

1913
01:08:51,798 --> 01:08:57,000
yeah so as far as fighting goes I was

1914
01:08:54,119 --> 01:08:59,838
definitely blessed to be around uh some

1915
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:02,439
of the best fight camps uh I was a part

1916
01:08:59,838 --> 01:09:05,519
of euriah favers Team Alpha Mill we were

1917
01:09:02,439 --> 01:09:07,678
MMA team of the of the world three years

1918
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:09,239
in a row and then I did I trained a lot

1919
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:12,000
with Diaz brothers I trained a lot with

1920
01:09:09,238 --> 01:09:13,919
Nate Diaz so I did get to train with the

1921
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,838
some of the best people it was really I

1922
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:17,759
mean I enjoyed the lifestyle for sure if

1923
01:09:15,838 --> 01:09:19,479
I could have made better money probably

1924
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:21,158
still be doing it how's their cardio

1925
01:09:19,479 --> 01:09:24,318
those guys smoke a lot of weed when I

1926
01:09:21,158 --> 01:09:26,079
was training with Nate I I feel like

1927
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:27,520
obviously their cardio phenomenal I feel

1928
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:29,559
like my cardio was on a high level and

1929
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:31,759
we were smoking a lot I'm like we were

1930
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:34,960
smoking a lot and I feel like cardio was

1931
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:37,119
on a on a on a very high level I mean my

1932
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:38,759
last fight for Bellator the dude I

1933
01:09:37,119 --> 01:09:41,679
fought was supposed to have like

1934
01:09:38,759 --> 01:09:43,960
incredible cardio feel like he was more

1935
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:47,560
tired than I was and I was smoking a lot

1936
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:50,039
I'm like yeah so I don't know that how

1937
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:52,039
much of a negative effect smoking has on

1938
01:09:50,039 --> 01:09:55,479
has on athletic performance definitely

1939
01:09:52,039 --> 01:09:57,359
not much but the Diaz brothers is oh man

1940
01:09:55,479 --> 01:10:00,559
dudes can go forever those dudes can go

1941
01:09:57,359 --> 01:10:03,639
forever for sure well then Nick's ban

1942
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:05,719
for cannabis I feel like it was really

1943
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:08,840
unfortunate and that he was definitely

1944
01:10:05,719 --> 01:10:10,760
competed in the wrong era because you

1945
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:13,119
know the bul of the bulk of his career

1946
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:14,320
he was suspended for smoking but uh

1947
01:10:13,119 --> 01:10:17,079
that's a dude who's definitely going to

1948
01:10:14,319 --> 01:10:19,198
do what he wants to do so I think it was

1949
01:10:17,079 --> 01:10:21,198
an injustice to sport that we didn't get

1950
01:10:19,198 --> 01:10:23,238
to see that dude perform more cuz he's

1951
01:10:21,198 --> 01:10:24,759
uh it's a tragedy that was a special

1952
01:10:23,238 --> 01:10:26,678
athlete that was a special Nick Diaz

1953
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:29,360
he's a special athlete I think that he's

1954
01:10:26,679 --> 01:10:31,039
a he's a unique and special martial

1955
01:10:29,359 --> 01:10:34,439
artist and I think that we didn't get to

1956
01:10:31,039 --> 01:10:37,960
see him in his prime because of uh he

1957
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:41,039
was uh sideline because of of cannabis

1958
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:44,039
uh so yeah it is unfortunate so who's

1959
01:10:41,039 --> 01:10:45,319
your favorite MMA fighter of all time

1960
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:47,158
it's funny that you say that because

1961
01:10:45,319 --> 01:10:48,279
Nick Diaz might be my favorite MMA

1962
01:10:47,158 --> 01:10:49,839
fighter of all time I got good

1963
01:10:48,279 --> 01:10:52,359
relationships with some really amazing

1964
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:54,560
Fighters like like Gilbert Melendez one

1965
01:10:52,359 --> 01:10:56,880
of the local ones and uh it's crazy

1966
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:58,640
because as far as like skill set that I

1967
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:01,640
respect of how they do it that's

1968
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:03,840
probably my favorite fighter of all time

1969
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:05,440
me too I got to get him on the show

1970
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:06,920
shout out to Nick Diaz yeah that's a

1971
01:11:05,439 --> 01:11:09,359
tough one man that's a tough that's a

1972
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:12,079
tough one y but he'll do it for sure for

1973
01:11:09,359 --> 01:11:13,279
sure that's probably the that's probably

1974
01:11:12,079 --> 01:11:15,439
I mean he might be the goat in my

1975
01:11:13,279 --> 01:11:17,319
opinion he was a really really talented

1976
01:11:15,439 --> 01:11:19,759
mixed martial artist yeah CJ used to

1977
01:11:17,319 --> 01:11:22,599
train with him as well he was in CJ's

1978
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:24,840
corner back in the day nice that's dope

1979
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:26,640
so yeah you know Northern California I

1980
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:30,600
feel like it's a Titan near fight group

1981
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:32,400
so yep for sure cannabis is the same way

1982
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:34,199
cannabis is the same way and fighting I

1983
01:11:32,399 --> 01:11:37,279
feel like a lot of it's interesting

1984
01:11:34,198 --> 01:11:38,839
there's a lot of uh fighting people who

1985
01:11:37,279 --> 01:11:41,399
have transitioned into cannabis and

1986
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:43,520
there's a lot of uh fighting people who

1987
01:11:41,399 --> 01:11:45,599
make a living on the side in cannabis so

1988
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:47,600
it's it's cannabis is like pretty

1989
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:49,360
prevalent in in fight culture it's

1990
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:50,760
