that was great and it it was a lot of

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,559
fun I feel like the perfect amount of

20
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,079
people it wasn't overcrowded like a lot

21
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,198
of events are m especially with cannabis

22
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,400
you never know it could either be

23
00:01:02,198 --> 00:01:06,399
completely dead or completely packed and

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,759
you were filming your show there yeah

25
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,200
yeah we did uh plant it we got a bunch

26
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:13,599
of people sitting in including you yeah

27
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,118
and we were talking about what 420 meant

28
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:17,759
to us and it was really nice actually I

29
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:19,280
just talked to somebody yesterday who

30
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,078
said that they weren't able to make that

31
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,040
event but it made them feel like they

32
00:01:21,078 --> 00:01:25,239
were there but there were so many great

33
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,560
people especially people who have done

34
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:31,000
so much for the movement in the industry

35
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,519
and I mean to be on that beautiful roof

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
on a beautiful day just being able to

37
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:38,599
share some smokes and and talk to people

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,078
was wonderful the weather was perfect

39
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:44,438
yeah so now that the roles are reversed

40
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:48,000
what does 420 mean to you 420 to me

41
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:50,758
means first of all Community but also

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,478
the patience because I'm old school I've

43
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,718
you know like you I've been doing this

44
00:01:52,478 --> 00:02:00,118
for a while and I started in the 215

45
00:01:55,718 --> 00:02:03,959
days and it was a year out of chemo so I

46
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:06,759
really for me it's all about social

47
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:09,239
justice creating good policy to support

48
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:11,318
the people and a chance for us all to

49
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,080
get together and really enjoy each

50
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:15,719
other's company because we're all so

51
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,000
busy and there's so many things going on

52
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:19,560
and especially with you know the way

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
things have been in California the past

54
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,000
few years there's been a lot to worry

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,840
about yeah but there's also a lot of Joy

56
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,120
because we I for me like I love the work

57
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,959
that we do but one of the biggest things

58
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,239
is the people I always joke that if

59
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,280
you're in

60
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,039
cannabis you're part Carney in a way

61
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,519
we're all kind of we're all a little

62
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:43,158
weird but it's like my kind of weird

63
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:45,959
weed caries some more than others but we

64
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:48,120
all are absolutely part of this well

65
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:49,680
it's part of a movement you know I think

66
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,800
there there's like the community and

67
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,040
then there's the movement and there's

68
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:57,800
the this will and this amazing energy

69
00:02:55,039 --> 00:03:00,919
behind it and yeah it definitely has

70
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,319
some of that yeah yeah so for me that's

71
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:06,318
that's what it's all about I mean I I

72
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:09,039
worked in a dispensary for many years

73
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:11,158
and I loved love the excitement of

74
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:14,120
people coming in and that was when you

75
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:16,039
know we were weighing out deli style so

76
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,920
we would get flowers that we didn't see

77
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:19,679
any other time of the year and just

78
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:21,759
seeing people's excitement and all the

79
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,760
fun things that would happen and you'd

80
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:27,399
always have somebody who would bring in

81
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:29,399
some crazy infused cake for the staff to

82
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,200
have afterwards and it was just kind of

83
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:35,039
like we work hard all day we'd bring so

84
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:37,000
much joy and then we'd get to enjoy

85
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,598
everyone's company afterwards and it's

86
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,759
still even though I no longer work in a

87
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:44,039
dispensary I still feel that way when

88
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:46,798
I'm out with people during 420 because

89
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:48,438
it's you know we just have so many

90
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,438
things to be grateful for and so many

91
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:52,560
good people to enjoy their company yeah

92
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:54,158
there's just I mean every day there's so

93
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,158
many things to be grateful for we can be

94
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:58,479
upset about stuff or we can be grateful

95
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,798
and I think a lot of times uh people

96
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:02,719
have like life dmor and they're like my

97
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,599
life sucks and but they're not really

98
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:06,039
counting their blessings and it's like

99
00:04:04,598 --> 00:04:09,000
there's so many things to be grateful

100
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:11,078
for we're not at War right now I mean

101
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,239
we're not fighting in war right you know

102
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:15,439
I mean that we're all at War about other

103
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:18,918
stuff but but as far as like the the

104
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:22,399
movements at War but we're not fighting

105
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:24,079
for our lives necessarily right um I

106
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,560
mean I feel like I wake up and I fight

107
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:27,800
for my life every day so that's kind of

108
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,240
there was a Jerry Garcia thing it's

109
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,360
funny you were talking about cake but he

110
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,319
had a story story and I just the reals

111
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,360
have been coming in on Instagram about

112
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:37,079
the time where he ate the cake and he he

113
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,840
ate the frosting cuz he's like there's

114
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:40,599
definitely assd in the cake but I'm just

115
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:43,560
going to take some of the frosting and

116
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,800
then there was these Mafia guys and they

117
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,120
they were coming in when he started

118
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,400
tripping and he's like oh these guys are

119
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,038
going to kill me and so I he went on

120
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:52,918
stage and then he was playing for his

121
00:04:50,038 --> 00:04:54,680
life and so that really resonated with

122
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:56,799
me and so like lately I've been thinking

123
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,600
you know I need to get up cuz he said

124
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,600
he's he's been playing for his life ever

125
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:04,080
since M and and so I feel like I need to

126
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,199
get up in the morning and I need to uh

127
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:07,279
fight for my life every day and you know

128
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:09,840
I think that's a different kind of

129
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:11,758
battle but it's it's still like if you

130
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:14,319
can have that mindset like we got to do

131
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,840
the best we can every time we do it yeah

132
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:17,680
uh whether we're doing podcasts or

133
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:20,079
whether you know it's in the room with

134
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,800
plants uh really putting all my energy

135
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:23,800
into the stuff that I'm passionate about

136
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:27,079
and the stuff that is going to help me

137
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:31,038
survive and make me successful I can see

138
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:33,839
that I think for me like every day is a

139
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:37,038
gift and even when things kind of go a

140
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:39,239
little Ary I always look at it as what

141
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:41,360
does that mean like what is that driving

142
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,439
me towards that's going to create

143
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,919
goodness because like I before I got

144
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,519
into cannabis I worked in civil rights

145
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:50,318
yeah and before that I was in corporate

146
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:52,240
and corporate felt really empty for me I

147
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:54,600
always joke that I'm an extremely greedy

148
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,319
person I like every moment to matter

149
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,240
nice um you know so I got into civil

150
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:00,840
rights and I loved it but you know one

151
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,600
of the things things was that I wasn't

152
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:05,879
doing the direct work I was I was an ops

153
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,919
manager so I kept the lights on so that

154
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:09,639
my colleagues could do their good work

155
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:11,240
right and I was always searching for

156
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:13,439
that meaning like well what is it what

157
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,079
is it that I need to do that fulfills me

158
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:20,240
and also does good right and then when I

159
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:22,680
got sick and it was like it was like a a

160
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,560
bad country music song because it seemed

161
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,000
like everything was happening and I used

162
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,639
to think to myself this is going to make

163
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,240
sense someday right and I found my

164
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,598
heart's work through that cuz if I

165
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,400
hadn't gotten sick you and I wouldn't be

166
00:06:32,598 --> 00:06:38,839
sitting here today yeah I mean some of

167
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:41,519
the most painful terrible things are

168
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:43,198
blessings in Disguise and they make us

169
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:45,758
stronger people they make us better

170
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,680
people they make us more you know it's

171
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,000
the the sour and the sweet you don't

172
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,720
appreciate the sweet unless you've had

173
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,439
the sour and I I love that and uh I

174
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,199
think that suffering is a good thing to

175
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:57,879
a degree so that you can appreciate when

176
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:59,720
you have good times yeah because it's

177
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:02,039
got to stop eventually it's got to stop

178
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:05,440
eventually and you know I'm I'm old

179
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:07,759
enough now uh that I realize that it's

180
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:09,160
all going to work out in the end and

181
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,960
even though we go through these things

182
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,400
and they suck there's going to be good

183
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:14,560
days and there's going to be bad days

184
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:15,918
and just grateful that we're having good

185
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,319
days right now and the weather's a

186
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:20,279
little extreme but uh you know that's

187
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,120
that's part of it yeah I know I'm

188
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:24,758
enjoying the sunshine but it is I mean

189
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,560
it's it's about how Nimble can you be

190
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:27,960
and how much can you be like water and

191
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,038
it's not always going to be easy

192
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:33,120
sometimes it's going to suck yeah

193
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:34,800
but man it sure does make the good time

194
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,240
sweet we're gonna have some good stories

195
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,478
at the end you know I think that's part

196
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,199
of it too yeah absolutely absolutely and

197
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:42,878
10 years from now when we look back on

198
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,158
this time I'm wondering what we're going

199
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,800
to be thinking yeah you know what will

200
00:07:45,158 --> 00:07:49,240
have happen between then and now and

201
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,598
what are we what will we have learned

202
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,478
yeah or or not learned yeah well there's

203
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:56,719
that too there's that too yeah there's

204
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:59,000
both both sides of the coin for sure

205
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,080
yeah absolutely I mean I honestly feel

206
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,598
if you were look at 100 years in the

207
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:04,719
future 100 years in the past they kind

208
00:08:02,598 --> 00:08:06,399
of talk about this a lot but I feel like

209
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,159
they'd say we are kind of crazy right

210
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:11,519
now but we're in this in

211
00:08:08,158 --> 00:08:12,839
between Place between technology I mean

212
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,598
who knows what's going to happen in a

213
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:16,839
100 years if we'll be around I hope

214
00:08:14,598 --> 00:08:19,439
we're around I think I think there's

215
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:21,279
drive and there's the will of the people

216
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,478
and you know but people are like well

217
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:24,638
what about you know these these events

218
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:27,120
that could happen

219
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,560
earthquakes uh you know nuclear war I

220
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,000
think that I think that we're going to

221
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,278
survive honestly but I think if they

222
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,479
were to look back at this time people

223
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:37,559
would say man this is crazy stuff that's

224
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:40,000
going on the stuff with politics the

225
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:41,598
stuff where cannabis is illegal

226
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,240
especially the Cannabis being illegal

227
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,839
and we're putting people in jail for a

228
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,759
nonviolent

229
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:50,240
crime I think it's silly and I think a

230
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:51,838
100 years ago maybe not a 100 years ago

231
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,320
150 years ago they'd think it was

232
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,320
extremely silly too oh absolutely I mean

233
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,040
people going to jail for agriculture

234
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,959
yeah that's kind of crazy when you think

235
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,958
about it but I mean change doesn't come

236
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,919
when we're comfortable yeah it gets it

237
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:07,399
has to get to a point where you're fed

238
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:09,039
up with it yeah that's it and I think

239
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:10,278
you know when we are talking about all

240
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:12,399
the things that are going on now it's

241
00:09:10,278 --> 00:09:14,720
like we're in this era of

242
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,200
legalization and people forget that

243
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,079
there are a lot of people that are still

244
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:23,399
in jail I mean for doing you know the

245
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:25,599
work that you and I do every day and we

246
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:27,078
have to get past that it's still it's

247
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,920
still totally

248
00:09:27,078 --> 00:09:31,559
ridiculous yeah absolutely we got I mean

249
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:33,958
I've had Richard delisi on the show and

250
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:36,000
luk scarmazzo that you know together

251
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:39,399
they did over 50 years in prison yeah

252
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,120
for the plant yeah I I was actually just

253
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:45,519
talking to um Robbie bot today his

254
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,759
family you the bigots and the boons were

255
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,959
the cornbread Mafia yeah and talking

256
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:53,120
about how much time that you know people

257
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:57,639
in both families have

258
00:09:53,120 --> 00:10:00,039
done and you know they had his

259
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:02,519
sister was murdered

260
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:04,838
and the man who murdered his sister got

261
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:07,000
25 years with a Chance of

262
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:09,880
parole but his

263
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,639
brother got 25

264
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:14,000
years mandatory sentence for growing a

265
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:17,679
plant

266
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,278
yeah that's messed up it's ridiculous

267
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:21,919
yeah it really is and I mean these laws

268
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:24,320
are slowly

269
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:27,240
changing I mean not soon enough but they

270
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,040
are changing I think uh you know we see

271
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,600
stuff like scheduling and we're afraid

272
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,799
of it I want

273
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,320
descheduling yeah I'm team deschedule

274
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:37,278
too

275
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,079
absolutely but we are progressing

276
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:40,639
forward I think in a lot of ways we're

277
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:42,679
progressing forward I mean I think

278
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:45,000
there's good and bad you know we we saw

279
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:48,000
the influx of really bad cannabis in

280
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,320
California with legalization initially

281
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,240
and now we're seeing it correct and I'm

282
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:56,200
seeing better and better stuff every day

283
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,680
uh in the in the wreck Market yeah so

284
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,040
but unfortunately it's there's still the

285
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:00,679
race to the bottom where if you don't

286
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,958
have the best stuff you might as well

287
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:05,838
not do it is kind of how I feel I agree

288
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:07,119
I mean if you if you don't have the best

289
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,399
stuff and you're not doing with heart

290
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,360
what's the point yeah because you can

291
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:13,278
tell when it's not made with passion and

292
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,759
heart too well and you're not going to

293
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:18,720
compete with the big guys that have huge

294
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:21,120
facilities that can produce deit scale

295
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,759
and pay pennies on the dollar that can

296
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:27,879
beat you on price that's true their exit

297
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:30,039
price is much lower than yours yeah so

298
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:31,439
and then how do you compete well you

299
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:34,278
have to have a better product you have

300
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,959
to have a better brand a better product

301
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:38,360
you know the brand has to back the

302
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:40,879
product now the marketing all this stuff

303
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,639
before it was like uh you know the hype

304
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:44,919
wins and the hype still does win to a

305
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:46,839
degree but if you look at you know these

306
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:48,879
guys backpack boys these guys are

307
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:50,600
putting great products in their back SF

308
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:54,039
can these guys are putting amazing

309
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:58,040
product out to the world the only issue

310
00:11:54,039 --> 00:12:00,000
is the point from Harvest to the

311
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:02,879
consumer getting it to the consumer

312
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,759
fresh yeah and I think it's people are

313
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:06,958
talking about it now more and more and

314
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:08,639
you know Refrigeration getting it there

315
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:10,359
in a short amount of time the sooner you

316
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,039
get a fresh product the better it is

317
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,800
yeah I mean now we have TPL loock bags

318
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:16,198
they help with preservation and other

319
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:19,599
things but still fresh product is going

320
00:12:16,198 --> 00:12:21,958
to win any day I agree but then you're

321
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,959
also looking at a subset of people like

322
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:27,239
people who are more into connoisseurship

323
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:29,799
which I think is what we've directed a

324
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,839
lot of our attention to yeah but what

325
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:33,399
about the normies what about that whole

326
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,079
swath of the market that's looking at

327
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:39,000
cannabis's wellness and they may enjoy a

328
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:41,359
really good flower sure but can they

329
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,799
tell a a really good flower from a mid I

330
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,159
don't know and so what is it that draws

331
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:49,439
them in then sure I mean we have like

332
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:52,240
that um that LA Times article came out

333
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,600
everybody that I know who's can of

334
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,879
curious or kind of On The Fringe Of The

335
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,800
Wellness are all like now they're like

336
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:02,838
oh dear oh my God what's happening is it

337
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:05,919
all bad and it's like well no it's not I

338
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:08,040
mean we we have work to do right we have

339
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:10,759
a lot of things to do for the controls

340
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:13,480
around you know lab testing and stuff

341
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:15,159
like that but it's a nightmare out there

342
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,480
the whole lab testing it's it's a

343
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:17,879
nightmare you know there's no

344
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,839
consistency across the board but that's

345
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:23,399
changing slowly but surely uh you know

346
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:26,040
you're seeing 45%

347
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:27,320
THC that's pretty wild do you think

348
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:29,838
that's true though do you really think

349
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,720
it's 45% because I feel like absolutely

350
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,040
not yeah absolutely not but that's what

351
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,920
I'm saying is you're seeing these super

352
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:39,519
high lab results these coas that are

353
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:42,278
saying 45% but then you could send that

354
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:45,799
same product to another lab that's more

355
00:13:42,278 --> 00:13:49,360
reputable maybe or more consistent and

356
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:53,319
you're going to see 35 yeah maybe 37

357
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,879
maybe yeah maybe but these 40 plus I I

358
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,519
don't know I

359
00:13:54,879 --> 00:14:00,838
I I have a hard time believing I do too

360
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:03,879
and I ALS so you know just the whole

361
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:06,079
thing the whole race to the top with THC

362
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:07,559
I just think personally and and you know

363
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:09,638
they're going to be F disagree with me

364
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:12,559
on this but I think it's BS because it's

365
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:16,198
like I have had stuff that has been like

366
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:18,599
133% THC with a really interesting tan

367
00:14:16,198 --> 00:14:20,838
profile that works wonderfully with my

368
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,639
body and I'm like whoa this feels much

369
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:24,880
stronger than something that I've had

370
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,839
that's been in like the mid to high 20s

371
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:30,799
yeah and I would tend to agree I think

372
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:34,040
that it it's an easy marker and it's an

373
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:35,958
easy way for a dispensary to say okay

374
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:38,120
well we have this this is how strong it

375
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:41,518
is but that's not accurate not by any

376
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:43,240
means I think that tpin dictate a lot

377
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,679
flavorants we're talking about flavorant

378
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:50,360
now THS and flavorants and all these

379
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:54,758
other factors come into play um and the

380
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:57,919
the difference of a strong uh narcotic

381
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:59,879
strain versus a strong stimulant strain

382
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:01,799
you know so it's so individ idual too

383
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:04,559
you could have one thing that like

384
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:07,278
someone who loves the stimulant stuff

385
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:10,119
and then they smoke a strong

386
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:12,679
narcotic uh indicia if you want to call

387
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,759
it indicia but like something strong and

388
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:17,159
heavy and then they they don't feel

389
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:20,560
right right or the opposite somebody

390
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:23,278
who's smoking these candy flavors and

391
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:24,958
then you know the gelato and these and

392
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:26,799
then they go smoke some super silver

393
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:29,479
haze and then they're like my heart's

394
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:31,679
beating out of my chest yeah right yeah

395
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,440
totally and so it's it's all subjective

396
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:34,838
to the individual and we all have such

397
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,000
different body chemistries it's been

398
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:38,639
really hard

399
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,278
to identify how they should I mean

400
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,600
people are talking about like flavors

401
00:15:40,278 --> 00:15:46,120
right so we'll talk about uh different

402
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:48,120
flavor profiles lemon orange Citrus

403
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,399
categorizing those together and then

404
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,879
they can categorize but some of the

405
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:52,679
stuff is just in the middle of

406
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:55,519
everything yeah and so it makes it

407
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:58,479
complicated it does and it's I also find

408
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:01,240
like CU you you know working with

409
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,759
people's bodies in cannabis it's like

410
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,440
like I have over 18,000 hours of working

411
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,480
with human beings in cannabis so I've

412
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,399
seen had the Baseline of how the

413
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,159
majority of human beings respond I've

414
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:14,278
seen people trip out on 30 to1 CBD to

415
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:15,838
THC and I'm like you know instead of

416
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:17,600
being like I can't be right it's like I

417
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,279
lean in I'm like oh that's fascinating

418
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,319
what happened you know I want to know

419
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:24,720
but there's also neurode Divergence that

420
00:16:22,318 --> 00:16:27,240
comes into play yeah because I've I've

421
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,440
worked with people who have like ADD

422
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:33,198
ADHD and they're like

423
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,680
you know Durban Poison or you know

424
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:37,838
Island squeet skunk or you know

425
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:40,318
something that for me would be like dab

426
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:43,560
it yeah and they're like that chills me

427
00:16:40,318 --> 00:16:48,198
out I'm like cool calm and clear and

428
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:49,919
then I go to the gym and I'm like dang

429
00:16:48,198 --> 00:16:52,399
but it's fascinating it's totally

430
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,719
amazing body chemistry being so unique

431
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,919
as it is I have some friends that can

432
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:59,480
eat 500 milligrams of THC and it doesn't

433
00:16:55,919 --> 00:17:01,000
do anything to them like literally they

434
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,240
could eat something that would make

435
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,318
someone feel like they were G to die I

436
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,640
would it doesn't yeah I think most

437
00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:11,000
people 500 milligrams will take you out

438
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:13,160
yeah yeah you know but then uh yeah K

439
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,439
his his wife from triome Technologies

440
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:18,798
his wife she could uh eat an unlimited

441
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:21,439
amount of THC they think that that's

442
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:23,838
about liver function I I think so yeah I

443
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,679
mean I that's I I tell people like when

444
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:28,960
they were looking at doing high amounts

445
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:31,679
and I'm just like well good luck like if

446
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,519
you if that affects you whether you

447
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,440
believe in him or not you're going to be

448
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:38,639
holding on to the toilet talking to

449
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:42,279
Jesus yeah you know but then there are

450
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:45,559
those exceptions and it's like wow so

451
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:48,200
what do what do they need to help them

452
00:17:45,558 --> 00:17:50,798
like inhaling may be good for them

453
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,880
sublinguals might be good for them yeah

454
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:55,359
and it's it's fascinating to see how

455
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,480
people react cuz like I have a

456
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:59,798
relatively high tolerance for inhaling

457
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,319
cannabis a really low tolerance for

458
00:17:59,798 --> 00:18:05,519
eating it same same yeah I'm exactly the

459
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:08,079
same like I I do eat Edibles from time

460
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:10,319
to time me too I prefer lowd dose

461
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:12,119
Edibles now before we never measured

462
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:14,200
dose like before 10 years ago there

463
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:16,119
wasn't like oh this is 10 or 20 or 30

464
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,519
milligrams it's like this is a brownie

465
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:20,558
yeah you know this is a cookie or

466
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:24,079
whatever we had brownies cookies Rice

467
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:25,960
Krispie treats um Irish moss drink do

468
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:29,079
you remember that one no that was a

469
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:31,000
crazy one I got way too high on that was

470
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:32,519
having a call with my oncologist

471
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,359
actually an in-person meeting and I was

472
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:36,000
like I got to go home I can't have this

473
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:38,959
conversation and then I went home and

474
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,038
bought a $300 for S machine don't shop

475
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,120
high on

476
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:46,558
Ed so Irish moss drink is it like bang

477
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:49,279
like with milk or it had um it was like

478
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:51,440
a a non-dairy like some sort I can't

479
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:53,399
remember yeah right it kind of felt like

480
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,600
it but it's I had this herb Irish moss

481
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,519
and it was a I believe what I recall was

482
00:18:56,599 --> 00:19:01,359
that it was a gentleman from Jamaica who

483
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:05,240
made it and it was a creamy drink but it

484
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:07,000
was like some sort of plant milk and I

485
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,720
don't even know how many milligrams it

486
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,440
wasn't then because like you said we

487
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,880
weren't really worried about that I just

488
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,159
chug lug the whole thing CU I was

489
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,159
nervous about having my first

490
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:18,720
conversation about chemo and then after

491
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:21,120
that I realized only half or a quarter

492
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,759
like a quarter if you want to buzz a

493
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:25,158
half if you just really want to be nice

494
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:27,679
and stoned and be home anything more

495
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:31,320
than that is for your body Sarah you

496
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:33,798
just no no you can't do that and I don't

497
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:35,240
do homemade Edibles anymore I if

498
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:37,759
somebody gives them to me I'm always

499
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,120
grateful I'm always gracious but I do

500
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:41,640
not touch anything that I don't know the

501
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:44,279
milligrams for because five milligrams

502
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:46,559
does it for me now which you know back

503
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:49,200
in the day I think I especially during

504
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:50,918
the 215 days it was more than that but

505
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,240
I'm actually happy that it's just a

506
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:53,880
little bit and I use a little bit to

507
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,079
sleep and then I'm not groggy in the

508
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,360
morning and otherwise I smoke right well

509
00:19:56,079 --> 00:20:00,158
so I'm a huge fan of Delta 8 I I'm going

510
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:03,279
to get some hate for that but I really

511
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:06,200
like the effect of Delta 8 it's it's 20%

512
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:08,879
the strength of like Delta 9 THC and for

513
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:11,640
Sleep delta8 Is My Jam like 50

514
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:15,120
milligrams of delta8 gummies or or a

515
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:17,360
tinure whatever uh that has me sleeping

516
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:19,158
perfect I wake up I'm not groggy I feel

517
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:21,359
great I feel super rested I feel like it

518
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:23,880
puts me in a really deep sleep whereas

519
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:26,678
if I do Delta 9 and I was to do 10

520
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:28,400
milligrams of Delta 9 I'd probably not

521
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:30,798
want to sleep or I wouldn't get that

522
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,000
good sleep it's so that one's a little

523
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:35,158
bit more cerebral for you then yeah well

524
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,279
I mean that's I I I get that because

525
00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:39,360
like I know for myself Delta eight gives

526
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:42,079
me like a nice fuzzy Buzzy body feeling

527
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:44,359
and I'm not in my head but then like my

528
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:47,000
husband it actually like Delta eight

529
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:48,479
messes with him with his body chemistry

530
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,558
wow and so it's like you know your

531
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,038
mileage may vary because I was like

532
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:54,918
across the board I was like oh Delta

533
00:20:52,038 --> 00:20:57,240
eight you know it's just it's nice it's

534
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:59,159
not cerebral and for most of us it isn't

535
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:02,000
y but then you get those particular body

536
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:04,840
chemistry is in and all bets are off for

537
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,599
sure I like CBG too CBG is another one

538
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:09,798
and it's like yeah CBG is just so mellow

539
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:12,319
it's like it's a good alternative for

540
00:21:09,798 --> 00:21:14,000
ibuprofen if people are interested in

541
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:15,519
getting off ibuprofen I think it's a

542
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,839
great solution because I feel like it's

543
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:20,000
also anti-inflammatory I feel like it

544
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:21,519
relaxes my muscles feel I feel like it

545
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,159
relaxes me from the inside when I smoke

546
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:26,599
it such a strange thing like U stuff

547
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,960
that's higher in CBG and I I usually

548
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:31,119
don't just do Straight CBG it's a BL

549
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:35,360
because it's a full spectrum smoke of

550
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:38,038
whatever flow Garden he does a hemp and

551
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:41,038
he has some of the heavy Z that he got

552
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:44,240
seeds from me and sent me some flour and

553
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:45,599
it's highend CBG uhuh and it was the

554
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,640
most interesting thing because when you

555
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:51,240
smoke it I feel like you exhale and then

556
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,400
it's one of those instant ones where all

557
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,919
of a sudden you start feeling relaxed

558
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,000
and there's there's depth to that

559
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:58,720
feeling too it doesn't just hit you

560
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,240
right at once it kind of gradually makes

561
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,640
you feel like you're settling into your

562
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,400
couch even though you're not moving you

563
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,440
feel like you're kind not not like

564
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,000
you're melting in like you're high but

565
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,320
like you're just getting relaxed and I

566
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,640
love that I like that I have not smoked

567
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:13,359
CBG but I've had it like in tablets and

568
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:17,520
I have a tincture that I like that has a

569
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:21,079
little bit of THC some CBD CBG and CBD

570
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:22,558
yeah and for me because my I have so

571
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:25,839
much going on in my

572
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:27,918
brain it calms me so that I can focus

573
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:31,359
and I can do things and I was actually

574
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:34,880
working with a family friend who was um

575
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:37,959
who had esophageal cancer and he has

576
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:40,640
been sober for over 40 years and he was

577
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:43,200
having problems with eating and nausea

578
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,919
and also stress and he wanted to see

579
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,400
about non- euphoric ways to be able to

580
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:49,679
use it because one of his greatest

581
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:53,278
wishes was to die a sober man wow and we

582
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:55,880
used that and he was so incredibly happy

583
00:22:53,278 --> 00:22:58,119
he's like it helped me eat it helped

584
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:01,159
calm me down I didn't realize I was

585
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:04,479
stressed helped the nausea and I feel at

586
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:07,080
peace because I've I've stayed with my

587
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,759
wishes with not having any sort of you

588
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:11,918
know just staying sober and that that

589
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:15,278
felt really good and I and I find like

590
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:17,120
with CBD as much as I like that I get

591
00:23:15,278 --> 00:23:18,519
forgetful on that one it makes me a

592
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:22,079
little spacey even though it doesn't get

593
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:24,038
you high huh yeah interesting my brain

594
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:26,480
you know yeah totally it's all

595
00:23:24,038 --> 00:23:28,720
subjective to the individual and uh you

596
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,000
know we're so different because like CBD

597
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,880
doesn't do that to me at all I feel like

598
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,599
CBD relaxes me even if I dab CBD like

599
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:38,400
like my friend had this crazy CBD flower

600
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:40,959
that they turned into extract and it was

601
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:44,840
like this crazy BHO did it taste like

602
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:48,440
cherries uh this one tasted like cherry

603
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:51,359
cough syrup and it was it was medy Mike

604
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:54,798
and this is a while ago uh my buddy from

605
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:57,038
Washington and when I dabbed it I just

606
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:59,319
it it was like taking a heavy dose of

607
00:23:57,038 --> 00:24:00,960
some anti-inflammatories

608
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:03,000
like that was the feeling I got from

609
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,038
that but it did it doesn't mess with my

610
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,200
memory at all huh it just made me really

611
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:09,278
relax and chill kind of like CBG but

612
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,960
different like they're very similar but

613
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:13,759
different as far as how they affect my

614
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,000
body thca is another one where you eat

615
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:19,278
it and it doesn't really do anything but

616
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,400
it's really beneficial I like that for

617
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:26,359
me if if I ever grow I just put it in my

618
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,798
smoothies nice cuz I'm I I don't have a

619
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:29,439
green thumb I'm not growing big

620
00:24:27,798 --> 00:24:30,918
beautiful but so you're just making

621
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,440
plant smoothies I do I make plant

622
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:34,520
smoothies with it and I find that it

623
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,919
like just makes me like very calm

624
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:39,759
throughout the day like having that thca

625
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:42,399
it's so good it'd be interesting to do a

626
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:44,319
comparison with different genetics uh

627
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:47,199
that have different chemical profiles

628
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:49,240
yeah for plant smoothies so I'm big into

629
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,240
a and b testing so we're like okay well

630
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,519
what does this do compared to this and

631
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,399
we do that with everything around here

632
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:57,278
we got the dosatron versus the agretech

633
00:24:54,398 --> 00:25:01,278
irrigation system and we have different

634
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:03,480
lights we have uh under canopy we have

635
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:05,440
light lifts we we just we're testing out

636
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,120
everything and I'm constantly like how

637
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,360
can I make this better how can I make

638
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:10,879
the genetics better yeah um so it's

639
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:13,398
interesting because I never even thought

640
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,919
about until you just talked about it but

641
00:25:13,398 --> 00:25:19,479
really testing somebody who's uh juicing

642
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:21,000
the plants is like if we give you leaves

643
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,038
and you juice it how does this affect

644
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,960
you compared to this because we have

645
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:26,440
like a hundred different varieties that

646
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,319
we're working on right now so we could

647
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,798
easily give you a little bag of Le

648
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:31,038
leaves and you could compare it that

649
00:25:29,798 --> 00:25:33,079
would be cool well you know and then you

650
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:34,558
think about if you're making a smoothie

651
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:35,960
you're adding fruit to it so you're

652
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:39,519
getting other turpion in there and so

653
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:42,240
how is that skewing it too like you know

654
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:43,839
I love getting Nerdy with you yeah it's

655
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,319
it's a lot of fun and the whole thing is

656
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:48,959
fun it's like I feel like uh almost like

657
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:50,678
an Explorer like we're able to be

658
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,558
explorers we're able to be scientists

659
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:54,880
even though I'm not a scientist I I'm

660
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:57,639
able to do a lot of the scientific stuff

661
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:00,080
yeah and now we have these awesome tools

662
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:02,600
so like on computer like logging data

663
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:04,720
recording data we're able to take 50

664
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:06,678
over 50 data points on each cultivar

665
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,880
that we have so when we're popping seeds

666
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:11,240
that one individual plant we we log all

667
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,159
these different points of information

668
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,319
and then as we breed stuff we really get

669
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:17,520
to know the plants and it's fun and

670
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:21,240
interesting and you know the thing is is

671
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:22,480
like you can change one thing in in the

672
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,079
the life of the whole plant and that

673
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:28,640
could change the chemical profile of it

674
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:31,839
so yeah well and also like when looking

675
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,320
at like terroir yeah if you if you're

676
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:36,038
stressing something out that's going to

677
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:37,839
change things too for sure it it's just

678
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:40,158
so fascinating I love that when you're

679
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:41,879
doing your feno hunts are you collecting

680
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,080
all the data there what are you doing

681
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:46,760
with that all the data yeah we just data

682
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:48,798
mine that's so cool we we log massive

683
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:50,398
amounts of data on everything and so

684
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:53,599
we're constantly collecting data whether

685
00:26:50,398 --> 00:26:56,119
it's indoors Greenhouse Outdoors we're

686
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:57,519
kind of separating that but we breed for

687
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:59,959
specific things like if we're breeding

688
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:01,960
for indoor we're we're testing it

689
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:04,200
indoors yeah but we're also testing

690
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,919
stuff Outdoors to see how it performs

691
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,480
Outdoors to see if that's the direction

692
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,960
we should go with something um and kind

693
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,159
of when you grow it out one time you

694
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:15,319
kind of get an idea but we grow from

695
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:17,600
clone not from seed so it's a lot of fun

696
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:19,278
we get rid of that seed start typically

697
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:21,199
uh if we were doing for outdoor for

698
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:23,480
people that are planting Acres we'd want

699
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,519
to test it from seed but a lot of times

700
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:27,480
we're planting and testing to sell

701
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:29,679
clones so if we're going to be selling

702
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,200
clones or genetics in Clone form or

703
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:35,120
tissue culture we want to see how it

704
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,798
performs after the first initial run MH

705
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:38,119
so it keeps uh it keeps things

706
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:40,079
interesting and there's so many

707
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:41,719
different projects that we have going on

708
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:44,558
all at the same time so we really try to

709
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:46,720
stay on top of everything yeah that's

710
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:49,678
that's got to be so much fun I I mean I

711
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,120
always enjoy like testing out like

712
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,600
trying out different pheno types of

713
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:56,639
flowers and just like just as like a

714
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:58,319
person who's partaking and just seeing

715
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,759
what's what happens with certain things

716
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:03,158
like even when I was you know in in the

717
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:04,759
dispensary and we would get a flower

718
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:06,679
that would come in several times and

719
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:08,879
people would be like oh it looks

720
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:11,038
different oh the experience was

721
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,159
different oh it smells a little

722
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:15,759
different I was like well it's not made

723
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:18,240
in a factory it's nature right so you're

724
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:20,278
going to have variations but what do you

725
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,798
think as far as like how people are

726
00:28:20,278 --> 00:28:24,240
being able to kind of drill down and

727
00:28:21,798 --> 00:28:26,319
create some more consistency with plants

728
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,359
well the thing is is like the the life

729
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:31,720
of the plant if in flowers is like

730
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:35,319
roughly 70 days M and it can be affected

731
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:36,880
that one clone if you're going from

732
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:37,918
clone or you know if you're growing from

733
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,120
seed it's a little different but if

734
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,559
you're trying to get consistent you're

735
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:43,439
growing from clone and you have a clean

736
00:28:41,558 --> 00:28:45,119
clone that doesn't have any systemic

737
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:49,080
bacteria pest or

738
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:52,278
pathogens uh the thing is is nutrition

739
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:54,038
and environment affect the outcome so if

740
00:28:52,278 --> 00:28:55,599
you want we're talking about chemotype

741
00:28:54,038 --> 00:28:57,158
right so if we're looking at a chemotype

742
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:59,359
and we're trying to get a specific

743
00:28:57,159 --> 00:29:00,600
profile you want to have that consistent

744
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:03,199
throughout the lifestyle but you want to

745
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:04,759
try to mimic exactly and record as much

746
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,880
data so you can get the same results

747
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:08,519
every time yeah and but one thing goes

748
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,880
off your humidity

749
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:11,839
fluctuates that could change it the

750
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,120
light

751
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:15,839
intensity that could change the chemical

752
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:18,398
profile at the end so the user could get

753
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:20,439
a different experience and that's the

754
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:23,158
hard thing you know as far as looking at

755
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:25,679
it from a pharmaceutical perspective as

756
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:28,679
smokable flour you know because you can

757
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,960
extract it and you can pull stuff out

758
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:32,679
uh you know fra fractional distillation

759
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,960
and all these other methods that people

760
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:36,679
are able to use you can separate a lot

761
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,919
of the cannaboids and you can separate

762
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:40,960
tarping you can do all these really cool

763
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:42,360
things uh and then you can have a

764
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,319
consistent product because you can test

765
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:47,759
it but to get the flour consistent every

766
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:49,639
time that's very hard to do extremely

767
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:51,879
hard to do and I mean you need it needs

768
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:54,159
to typically be grown indoors because if

769
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:56,519
you think about the light the the light

770
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,519
cycle throughout the year changes in a

771
00:29:56,519 --> 00:30:00,440
greenhouse or an outdoor you know you're

772
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:02,480
looking at you know if you're planting

773
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:04,038
multiple times a year you're going to

774
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,079
get a different environment and just

775
00:30:04,038 --> 00:30:07,079
like wine making the wine comes out

776
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:09,038
different every year if you're doing

777
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:10,639
outdoor your outdoor flower comes out a

778
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:12,119
little bit different every year right

779
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,519
even though it's the same genetics you

780
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:16,199
know and wine they're they they come

781
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:18,919
back every year well then that kind of

782
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,640
goes back to like you know and and so

783
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:22,720
many people like oh I'm so tired of

784
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,640
talking about this but when we when

785
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,399
people will talk about indica versus

786
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,679
sativa and of course we know that that's

787
00:30:27,398 --> 00:30:32,038
not correct

788
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:33,679
and that you know but getting into like

789
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:36,558
the chemotypes that's where we're really

790
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:38,640
nailing it like because you will see or

791
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:40,558
at least back in the day you saw like

792
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,880
maybe something that showed up on the

793
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:44,440
more uplifting side of the menu and then

794
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,440
another batch would show up on something

795
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:49,960
that's like more hybrid or a little bit

796
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:51,759
more drowsy and like really nailing it

797
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:55,120
by getting into the chemotypes but then

798
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:56,879
how do we my question is always just

799
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:59,038
kind of like how do we create that

800
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,080
lexicon so that the public understands

801
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:02,759
it and it's not just those of us that

802
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:04,918
are really passionate about what we do

803
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:06,398
and we're all like oo you know no I I

804
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:08,799
think this is a discussion that's

805
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:10,319
happening the the ganas that are out

806
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:12,480
there you know they're having this

807
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:16,079
discussion they have their own ways of

808
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:18,240
training and testing and I think

809
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:19,839
uh I think it's just a bigger

810
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,480
conversation that we all need to keep

811
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:25,839
constantly having and debate without

812
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:28,319
fighting yeah but discuss because I

813
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:30,079
think when you start getting into to you

814
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:32,359
know indica and sativo that was great

815
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:34,038
for a long time it was like a something

816
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:35,638
that people could relate to you go in I

817
00:31:34,038 --> 00:31:38,000
want it I want the indica or I want the

818
00:31:35,638 --> 00:31:39,319
sativa yep but really moving forward I

819
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,759
mean that's what people did for years

820
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:42,278
right and it's like it's so much more

821
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:45,480
complicated than that I mean there's so

822
00:31:42,278 --> 00:31:47,359
many more things that you know the boxes

823
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:49,440
that need to be checked especially if

824
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:51,879
you're you know is someone in a

825
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,600
dispensary how do you help people right

826
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,760
you can't do it off just indicia sativa

827
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:57,439
right no you can't but even that in

828
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:59,119
itself like when you tell someone you

829
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,480
know these are just kind of placeholders

830
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:03,879
to describe the spectrum of feel like

831
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:06,278
getting your average what it call your

832
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:08,320
normies to even understand that like I

833
00:32:06,278 --> 00:32:11,119
remember back in the day when I was just

834
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:14,119
smoking whatever you got like your guy

835
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:15,798
showed up with a few you know roaster

836
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:18,119
bags of stuff and they'd be like I've

837
00:32:15,798 --> 00:32:19,599
got Sour Diesel I've got granddaddy

838
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:20,798
purple and I've got some headband and

839
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:22,439
you'd be like well which one should I

840
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:25,200
get and they'd be like I don't know all

841
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:27,440
of them yeah that's my answer all of

842
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,038
them exactly especially now I wish I

843
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,360
could have all three of those right in

844
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:32,759
front of me right now I know right but

845
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:34,599
back then I used to think when people

846
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:37,960
would talk about indica and sativa and

847
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:40,278
it was always like some some friend of

848
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:43,159
mine who smoked a lot of weed and and

849
00:32:40,278 --> 00:32:46,519
liked frisbee golf and I was like

850
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:49,000
whatever you pretentious ass like you

851
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:51,679
know and then after you understand it it

852
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,919
is important to be able to talk about

853
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,880
the fact that there are lots of

854
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:57,840
different cultivars with lots of

855
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:00,039
different feels and but getting the

856
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:01,558
public to understand just that was

857
00:33:00,038 --> 00:33:03,720
difficult and now that they're hanging

858
00:33:01,558 --> 00:33:05,480
on to that how do we rip that away from

859
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,399
them and give them something that's more

860
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:09,759
accurate you just do it slowly but

861
00:33:07,398 --> 00:33:12,558
surely and I think over time things

862
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:14,158
change uh it's just it's one of those

863
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:16,599
hard discussions but it's like people

864
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:18,080
saying strain instead of cultivar yeah

865
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:20,199
we've been saying strain and that's

866
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:23,839
wrong wrong wrong wrong strains are

867
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:26,919
viruses yeah covid yep they strains of

868
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:28,599
Co but uh you know and then mushrooms

869
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:29,679
you could say strain go along with

870
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:32,839
mushrooms

871
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:34,919
fungus but uh cultivar is the correct

872
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:39,798
term variety

873
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:41,240
cultivar cross not strand y you know

874
00:33:39,798 --> 00:33:42,798
that that's a it's an interesting

875
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:44,200
conversation but like we're getting away

876
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:46,359
from that slowly but surely people are

877
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:49,558
saying cultivar I hear it more and more

878
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:51,319
that makes me so happy um I'm okay with

879
00:33:49,558 --> 00:33:54,480
strain just because it's like the

880
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:56,439
industry standard and so to talk to

881
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,319
people I still have to call it strain

882
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:01,320
because people are just it's it's over

883
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:04,200
their head and it's okay and I'm not TR

884
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:06,599
plant the seed I always go I always go

885
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,398
you know cultivar also known as you know

886
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:10,199
also referred to as a strain but I

887
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:11,838
always try to say cultivar first I like

888
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:13,638
get it in their head I'm like cultivar

889
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:15,519
cultivar cultivar yeah well I just want

890
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:17,679
people to feel that I'm not I don't feel

891
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:19,838
like I'm better than them right you know

892
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,398
or pretentious or whatever that is I

893
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:24,918
think if you're friendly about it they

894
00:34:21,398 --> 00:34:26,358
know for sure sometimes sometimes yeah

895
00:34:24,918 --> 00:34:28,358
sometimes but yeah the whole strand

896
00:34:26,358 --> 00:34:29,679
thing has got to go like

897
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:32,319
that's been gone for a long time

898
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,200
hopefully but I still you know the old

899
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,399
school guys you know the guys old school

900
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:38,118
if you saying strand yeah and I and and

901
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:39,398
I don't correct them from the 90s

902
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:41,240
they've been there way longer than I

903
00:34:39,398 --> 00:34:43,838
have I'm gonna I'm gonna leave that be

904
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:45,598
because because I'm just a newbie I'm a

905
00:34:43,838 --> 00:34:47,960
kid I'm not gonna correct everybody that

906
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:50,599
says strain or strand or whatever it's

907
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:52,599
just that's not my job yeah I feel that

908
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:54,000
I feel that I'm out here trying to make

909
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:55,960
the world a better place I'm not trying

910
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,159
to argue about stuff just trying to

911
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,720
cultivate conversation right

912
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:02,159

947
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:29,078
course you know a lot of our industry

948
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:31,639
friends friends and family have been on

949
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:34,519
it too right and you're going to be on

950
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:36,559
it absolutely absolutely 100% looking

951
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:38,199
forward to that so tell me about Peter

952
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:40,078
Coyote because I bet that was a really

953
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:41,239
cool interview it was and a lot of

954
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,000
people say that it was one of their

955
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:46,279
favorites and the funny thing is is that

956
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,719
Peter is sober but his he told his first

957
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:50,720
I always asked guests about their first

958
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:52,480
cannabis experience and his was crazy

959
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:55,078
because like they went to Mexico and

960
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,599
they got like a whole bunch of weed and

961
00:36:55,079 --> 00:37:00,440
they like hid it underground and they

962
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:03,039
ended up like getting busted for it and

963
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:04,838
it was just you know he's you know being

964
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:08,000
like the activist he was and all the

965
00:37:04,838 --> 00:37:09,838
crazy things that he did he just he he

966
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,239
had a really really good story but then

967
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:14,960
you know he's also h a Buddhist monk now

968
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:17,639
and so now he is talking about the fact

969
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:20,440
that he believes in the medicinal use of

970
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:23,318
cannabis but he feels like for you know

971
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:25,639
Euphoria and things like that that in

972
00:37:23,318 --> 00:37:27,519
our world we tend to do a lot of things

973
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:29,480
to distract ourselves instead of ground

974
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:31,119
rounding and being comfortable within

975
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:34,079
our bod so he was like you know maybe

976
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:35,599
instead of getting high you meditate

977
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,318
yeah and so it was it was really

978
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:40,640
fascinating because he's just a lovely

979
00:37:37,318 --> 00:37:42,719
human being and he's done so much I mean

980
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:46,598
aside from being like a prolific actor

981
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:49,838
he's a musician and an author and he

982
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:52,640
actually um narrated a documentary on

983
00:37:49,838 --> 00:37:54,799
medical cannabis several several years

984
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:56,480
narrated so many documentary hasn't he

985
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,400
though and he's got that voice totally

986
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,079
it's it's totally Rec iable the second

987
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,358
you hear it you don't even need to watch

988
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,920
yeah yeah that's it so it was it was a

989
00:38:02,358 --> 00:38:06,358
delight and you know he's just over in

990
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:09,079
sebastio so nice and then right after

991
00:38:06,358 --> 00:38:13,358
that is when I got Crosby and Crosby was

992
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:15,880
like oh that Peter Coyote he's a rascal

993
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:18,559
he's a ladies man and I was

994
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:21,039
like

995
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:23,880
R yeah I bet that interview was amazing

996
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:26,759
as well yeah it was we we went all over

997
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:28,720
the place and we actually got into some

998
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:30,319
really really deep stuff because at that

999
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:31,959
point in time he was saying you know I

1000
00:38:30,318 --> 00:38:34,599
probably have three to five more years

1001
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,400
to live Sarah and I have so much more to

1002
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:38,200
do and he his hands were starting to

1003
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,000
work better so that he was able to play

1004
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:42,078
the guitar again because he had stopped

1005
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,519
for a long time so he was working on a

1006
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:48,240
new album he was a Perpetual student and

1007
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:50,239
he was always doing so much to lift

1008
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:52,318
younger artists up and just really

1009
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:54,479
excited about working with people and

1010
00:38:52,318 --> 00:38:56,838
and seeing kind of what they're into and

1011
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,800
what makes them tick and he we had a

1012
00:38:56,838 --> 00:39:03,199
conversation about him being afraid of

1013
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:05,800
dying and when I was going through my

1014
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:08,039
chemotherapy I went through um

1015
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,800
chemotherapy called Full Fox 5 my mom is

1016
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:12,000
a cancer researcher so she actually did

1017
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:14,920
the clinical trials on the chemo that I

1018
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,960
took years later and I ended up being

1019
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:19,440
very allergic to the Platinum salts the

1020
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,519
oxala plat that they gave me and I

1021
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,679
almost died twice during it but the

1022
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:26,159
first time it happened I was in the

1023
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:28,000
chemo chair and my body was freaking out

1024
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:30,519
and I was going into aniflex

1025
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,358
and in inside I was very calm even

1026
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:35,159
though on the outside was very frantic I

1027
00:39:32,358 --> 00:39:36,920
was not in control of my body and I was

1028
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:38,639
watching people rush around and I was

1029
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:40,358
thinking to myself I was very calm and I

1030
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:44,679
was like

1031
00:39:40,358 --> 00:39:46,318
huh I'm dying who knew I was like and

1032
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:48,838
then it changed I told him that story

1033
00:39:46,318 --> 00:39:51,719
and I was like and then it really like

1034
00:39:48,838 --> 00:39:54,920
calmed me and and and gave me this whole

1035
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:56,358
other perspective about death where I

1036
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:58,200
always was afraid of it and I'm not

1037
00:39:56,358 --> 00:40:00,598
anymore and he was he said you know I

1038
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:04,879
hope I feel that way when it

1039
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:07,079
comes so when he passed it just because

1040
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:10,680
it was just months later it just tore me

1041
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:13,440
up I bet but we had such an amazing

1042
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:14,879
conversation and I actually had given

1043
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,400
him some questions that had come from

1044
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,280
our listeners and one of them was you

1045
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,880
know what should we tell kids about

1046
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:23,720
cannabis and he's like in typical cros

1047
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,680
fashion tell him the truth you know just

1048
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:27,838
just tell them what's happening and I

1049
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:29,358
was like you know he was

1050
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:30,880
it was a delight and I was really

1051
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:33,078
looking forward to spending more time

1052
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,960
with him I was I was going to go to his

1053
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:36,920
garden in the summer when all of his

1054
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,559
plants were going and I guess they had a

1055
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:41,079
bunch of cannabis that was in kind of

1056
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:42,639
like a Japanese garden oh wow and I was

1057
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:44,599
really excited to spend some time with

1058
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:46,440
him and Jan but it wasn't to be but I

1059
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:48,680
was really grateful for the time that I

1060
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:51,760
had with him and then with little Steven

1061
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:54,358
from the East Street Band that was that

1062
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:57,640
was a great conversation where he had

1063
00:40:54,358 --> 00:40:59,318
tried cannabis when he was younger and

1064
00:40:57,639 --> 00:41:01,799
he was of the ilk that you know it was

1065
00:40:59,318 --> 00:41:03,719
very psychedelic for him so he got what

1066
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:06,680
he he needed out of it and he stopped

1067
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:10,759
using it but he understood the medicinal

1068
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:14,719
value so he has a CBD brand and he also

1069
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:16,400
has a high THC brand in Massachusetts I

1070
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:18,838
think it may be in some other states as

1071
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,559
well but the question that I asked him

1072
00:41:18,838 --> 00:41:22,880
was because you know he was on Sopranos

1073
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:25,519
I asked him I said would Sylvio use

1074
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:29,640
cannabis and he just started to crack up

1075
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:33,759
and he's like no buddy sell

1076
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:35,279
it that's great classic yeah yeah and

1077
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,319
then we just got into politics because

1078
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:39,720
you know he's a very political guy so we

1079
00:41:37,318 --> 00:41:41,400
went down that rabbit hole yeah what's

1080
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:43,679
your favorite part of the podcast that

1081
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,720
you do I love it all I think with

1082
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:48,440
podcasts it's one of those things where

1083
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:50,679
like I've I've heard people say you know

1084
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:52,679
they're a lot of work you know people

1085
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:55,078
get tired of doing them but you have to

1086
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:57,078
love it to do it you have to you know

1087
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:59,039
absolutely and and I love connecting

1088
00:41:57,079 --> 00:42:00,920
with with people and talking with them

1089
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:03,400
and I love hearing back from people

1090
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:05,800
because you know unlike with yours where

1091
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:07,599
we get to hang out here I only have a

1092
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:11,359
few that have been in person everything

1093
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:14,838
is pretty much virtual so I really love

1094
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:17,559
the fact that it gets people to think

1095
00:42:14,838 --> 00:42:20,558
because you know my podcast not only

1096
00:42:17,559 --> 00:42:22,199
appeals to our colleagues but it's also

1097
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:25,440
people who may not be immersed in

1098
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:27,719
cannabis and it's thinking about how

1099
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:30,159
cannabis is and it's almost the macro

1100
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:32,719
micro thing like it's a call to critical

1101
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:35,440
thought it's a call to think about how

1102
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:37,358
everybody's different it's it's you know

1103
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,119
like when I teach my classes and I tell

1104
00:42:37,358 --> 00:42:41,838
people you know we may produce our own

1105
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:44,559
endogenous canono in our bodies not all

1106
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:46,679
of us tolerate phyto canabo and guess

1107
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:48,400
what that's okay so if it doesn't work

1108
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:49,799
for you and it's not right for you it

1109
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,240
doesn't necessarily mean that it

1110
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:54,440
shouldn't be allowed yeah we need to we

1111
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:56,199
need to have these conversations and see

1112
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:59,159
the beauty and all of our differences

1113
00:42:56,199 --> 00:43:03,078
but also feel EMP powered to be Catalyst

1114
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:06,039
for Change and and that's that's what I

1115
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:08,119
love about it I love being able to hear

1116
00:43:06,039 --> 00:43:11,440
about people's

1117
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:13,599
experiences learn from them and to be

1118
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:16,480
able to share that with listeners is

1119
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:18,200
it's a labor of love for me and and to

1120
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,719
be able to talk with people like you and

1121
00:43:18,199 --> 00:43:22,558

on my show but to be able to come on

1123
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:28,400
yours and really like appreciate the

1124
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:29,920
fact that there are a lot of us doing

1125
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,639
this and we're all doing really

1126
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:34,519
interesting stuff and I really enjoy

1127
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:36,920
that I feel like we're all just part of

1128
00:43:34,519 --> 00:43:39,440
this bigger machine yeah you know I mean

1129
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:41,400
not not just us but the whole world

1130
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,720
we're all part of like this

1131
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:49,119
amazing machine you know not even a

1132
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:53,078
machine but this entity and this this uh

1133
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:56,440
for driving force and this Consciousness

1134
00:43:53,079 --> 00:43:58,480
yeah and to be part of that I'm just

1135
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:01,480
happy to be part of of it you know I

1136
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:03,480
think just just super blessed and to be

1137
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:06,079
able to get people's stories and to be

1138
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:07,880
able to be that guy who's part of the

1139
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:08,880
oral history and recording because I

1140
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:11,559
feel like we're going to learn different

1141
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:13,000
in the future the books are great and

1142
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:16,480
the way people have learned is great but

1143
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:18,800
I think down the road we have instead of

1144
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:22,920
one person's perspective on it now we

1145
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:24,039
have 1002 200 300 500 thousands of

1146
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:27,079
people's

1147
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:32,358
stories about the Cannabis industry yeah

1148
00:44:27,079 --> 00:44:34,640
you know if we talk about um alcohol and

1149
00:44:32,358 --> 00:44:37,519
prohibition you know we we we've heard

1150
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:39,759
stories from handful of people but it's

1151
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:42,719
not the same picture that we have now

1152
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:45,599
for cannabis it's true it's true and

1153
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:48,039
it's um I think really putting faces to

1154
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:49,119
those voices is super important yeah one

1155
00:44:48,039 --> 00:44:51,679
of the things when we get into

1156
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:53,559
conversations about policy and I

1157
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:55,199
remember like when I worked in a

1158
00:44:53,559 --> 00:44:57,680
dispensary and you know after

1159
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:59,480
legalization a lot of people's favorite

1160
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:01,838
products and Brands and Growers were

1161
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:03,400
gone and the prices went way up and

1162
00:45:01,838 --> 00:45:05,920
especially people who were counting on

1163
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,440
this for True medicinal use were very

1164
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,838
upset there was a lot of Tears there was

1165
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,318
a lot of anger there was a lot of finger

1166
00:45:08,838 --> 00:45:13,159
pointing saying you know the brands are

1167
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:16,039
greedy you're greedy da and it was like

1168
00:45:13,159 --> 00:45:18,480
okay so let's talk about this let's talk

1169
00:45:16,039 --> 00:45:20,279
let's talk about how the sausage is made

1170
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,519
right um the reason that everything's

1171
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:23,440
gotten really expensive and you're

1172
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:24,599
missing some of your favorite products

1173
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:27,079
and you're missing some of your favorite

1174
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:29,838
Growers is because it's really hard to

1175
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:32,039
survive in this industry and there's

1176
00:45:29,838 --> 00:45:34,719
taxation all along the way I me teach

1177
00:45:32,039 --> 00:45:37,119
you what excise taxes Uncle Sam is your

1178
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:39,558
your Silent Partner exactly and I was

1179
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:41,640
like and if you don't like the way that

1180
00:45:39,559 --> 00:45:43,920
availability is and prices and the

1181
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:47,400
structure of how you can legally acquire

1182
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:49,240
cannabis in your state you have a voice

1183
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:51,800
The Regulators are making these

1184
00:45:49,239 --> 00:45:55,159
decisions based on outdated views of who

1185
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:57,880
you are so it's time to come out and say

1186
00:45:55,159 --> 00:46:02,639
I use cannabis I could contribute to

1187
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:05,200
society I pay Uncle Sam and a vote get

1188
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:07,199
active right it matters more than you

1189
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:09,078
think yeah and these podcasts normalize

1190
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:10,879
the people that uh you know were

1191
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:12,599
previously Outlaws and you start looking

1192
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,200
at them and listening to their stories

1193
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:15,680
and it's like all of a sudden you

1194
00:46:14,199 --> 00:46:17,838
realize they're people too and they're

1195
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:21,440
good people and sometimes things that

1196
00:46:17,838 --> 00:46:23,159
are illegal aren't bad yeah and

1197
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:26,079
sometimes things that are illegal that

1198
00:46:23,159 --> 00:46:27,558
are legal are terrible yes like

1199
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:30,039
McDonald's french fries

1200
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:32,800
oh but they're so good so good but so

1201
00:46:30,039 --> 00:46:36,440
bad so bad so do you smoke in the

1202
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:38,880
morning afternoon evening or oh I do it

1203
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:41,880
in the evening now when I I used to

1204
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:44,800
smoke throughout the day yeah but my

1205
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:46,720
work has changed like when I was working

1206
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,240
in in the shops I'd always I'd have like

1207
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:49,558
a little before I came in and I'd have

1208
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:53,358
some at lunch and then I'd have some

1209
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:55,040
after work yeah and now I find that a

1210
00:46:53,358 --> 00:46:57,440
little bit of THC is okay but it can be

1211
00:46:55,039 --> 00:46:59,599
a little distracting with my brain

1212
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,079
yeah and if I have a lot to do because

1213
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:04,240
I'm like writing and doing other things

1214
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:09,318
I I still use canono during the day but

1215
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:13,000
I'm doing CBG CB CBG CBD and just a tiny

1216
00:47:09,318 --> 00:47:15,039
bit of THC or thcv yeah because that's

1217
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,358
really great with my brain and then I

1218
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:18,719
get stuff done because then I can look

1219
00:47:16,358 --> 00:47:20,279
at my long list of stuff through the day

1220
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:23,000
and I'm like oh I know what to do with

1221
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:25,480
that but too much THC and then I'm

1222
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,079
like maybe I'll take a little break and

1223
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,920
get back to it later I'm just going to

1224
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:31,119
do that work that I need maybe not you

1225
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:33,079
know yeah I I mix it up every day is a

1226
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:34,400
different day yeah it's like life is

1227
00:47:33,079 --> 00:47:35,920
like a box of chocolates you never know

1228
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,400
what you're going to get with me

1229
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,039
especially you know I I it just depends

1230
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,720
on when I go to the gym in the morning

1231
00:47:40,039 --> 00:47:43,920
sometimes I smoke before I go to the gym

1232
00:47:41,719 --> 00:47:45,879
sometimes I don't I usually hit a pen

1233
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:48,039
and get like a little hit if I have a

1234
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:51,039
lot of cardio or something I really want

1235
00:47:48,039 --> 00:47:53,039
to focus uh cannabis really helps me

1236
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:54,440
focus when I exercise or if it's

1237
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:56,400
something I don't really want to do but

1238
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:58,800
it's something I've done a lot yeah

1239
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:01,358
that's in repetition cannabis is a great

1240
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:03,160
solution I I know some people who say

1241
00:48:01,358 --> 00:48:06,239
that red Congo is their thing that they

1242
00:48:03,159 --> 00:48:08,598
do before they go to the gym I believe I

1243
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:10,439
really like red Congo that's a good one

1244
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:13,480
yeah I like it's funny because Durban

1245
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:16,119
and red Congo are both African I love

1246
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:17,960
Duran completely different like one

1247
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:20,838
makes you laugh like crazy the other one

1248
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:23,519
gets you extremely high the Durban just

1249
00:48:20,838 --> 00:48:24,920
gets you higher than high yep uh my

1250
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:26,960
experiences with it I had one with

1251
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:28,838
Marlin where we just got way too high on

1252
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:31,519
a episode of the James loud show before

1253
00:48:28,838 --> 00:48:33,880
the James loud podcast uhhuh and the red

1254
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:35,960
Congo we've done the same thing where we

1255
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:37,358
just laugh it just makes me laugh it

1256
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:39,000
makes me it puts me in a good mood it

1257
00:48:37,358 --> 00:48:41,000
makes me laugh but it gets me extremely

1258
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,639
high as well but I find that red Congo

1259
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,159
is one of the most polarizing flowers

1260
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:47,159
people either love it yeah or they don't

1261
00:48:45,159 --> 00:48:50,000
and I would always tell people smell it

1262
00:48:47,159 --> 00:48:52,118
before you smoke it because if you

1263
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,159
because people who like red Congo and

1264
00:48:52,119 --> 00:48:55,318
this is a broad generalization but it

1265
00:48:54,159 --> 00:48:57,279
seems like they can't get enough of the

1266
00:48:55,318 --> 00:49:00,239
aroma they're like oo I love that that's

1267
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:02,000
totally my thing but that other people

1268
00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:04,118
that're like not so much and then they

1269
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,880
smoke it they're like yeah and I'm that

1270
00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:09,079
person because for me I appreciate red

1271
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:12,200
Congo and I love the bud structure like

1272
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:14,720
that those crunchy fluffy buds yeah but

1273
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:18,480
it doesn't work well with my body and I

1274
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:20,959
don't like the aroma of it but I always

1275
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:23,719
love watching people who love red Congo

1276
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:25,400
like get into it I love red Congo I and

1277
00:49:23,719 --> 00:49:28,358
the thing is is I smoke a lot of

1278
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:29,599
Skittles and gelato crosses because

1279
00:49:28,358 --> 00:49:32,199
that's mostly what's going around with

1280
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:33,480
my friends and circle of people and a

1281
00:49:32,199 --> 00:49:36,318
lot of the stuff I'm breeding for is

1282
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:39,798
purple candy but I also love a good gas

1283
00:49:36,318 --> 00:49:42,960
strain yeah I love OG I love Sour Diesel

1284
00:49:39,798 --> 00:49:45,920
and then the super silver haze the red

1285
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:47,440
Congos the Durban like if I get them I

1286
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,920
can't get enough of them while I have

1287
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,079
them and I'll like smoke but I want to

1288
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:52,119
share them with everybody because and

1289
00:49:51,079 --> 00:49:54,720
then my friends are like I don't really

1290
00:49:52,119 --> 00:49:57,798
like that okay some of my friends are

1291
00:49:54,719 --> 00:50:00,118
like anti they're anti sativa they're

1292
00:49:57,798 --> 00:50:02,639
anti oh you can't be afraid of sativas

1293
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:03,960
there's one for everyone I think so but

1294
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:06,440
I think there's also people that are

1295
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:07,798
like that's not my jam yeah I I hate

1296
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:10,079
Tangi or whatever I have a lot of

1297
00:50:07,798 --> 00:50:12,920
friends that hate tan like hate Tangi

1298
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:15,039
they use the word hate really with Tangi

1299
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:16,920
and I think if you look at how many

1300
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:19,920
awards Tangi won there's a reason they

1301
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:22,519
won those Awards I I can't hate on Tangi

1302
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:24,200
I don't hate Blue Dream yeah I may not

1303

blue dream has a I don't smoke it a lot

1306
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:31,159
but has a special place in my heart

1307
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:33,519
because it's a functional strain it's

1308
00:50:31,159 --> 00:50:35,358
aun and that one got me through chemo

1309

1320
00:50:56,159 --> 00:50:59,440
functional thing thing and I don't mind

1321
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:01,240

00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:10,358
amazing it's I've seen sticky amazing

1325
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:12,280
resinous blueberries like you open the

1326
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:14,279
bag up and then some people were just

1327
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:15,880
like I hate Blu and that's it's

1328
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,359
subjective right so everything's so

1329
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:18,760
subjective I used to be one of those

1330
00:51:17,358 --> 00:51:20,838
people that used to think that they

1331
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:22,400
couldn't have the more uplifting flowers

1332
00:51:20,838 --> 00:51:24,358
I used to think Ah that's what gets me

1333
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:27,400
anxious but then like the first time I

1334
00:51:24,358 --> 00:51:29,279
had Lamb's bread I was like oh

1335
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:31,599
Lamb's bread is so unique like the real

1336
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,760
Lamb's bread and like we've I've seen it

1337
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:35,480
called a couple different things over

1338
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,480
the years right same but every time it's

1339
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:39,639
got this muskiness to it and I love

1340
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:41,920
almost parmesan sort of it's almost

1341
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:44,759
parmesan and the funny thing is is like

1342
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:47,559
uh the last time I saw some AC cross

1343
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:50,480

1344
00:51:47,559 --> 00:51:52,040
was at Harborside farms at the time and

1345
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,960
I he was shown me this Lamb's bread

1346
00:51:52,039 --> 00:51:55,759
cross and he's like smell this what do

1347
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:57,400

1348
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:59,119
first thing that came to like lamb he's

1349

like it's the lamb Lamb's bread cross

1350
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:03,440

1351
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:07,720
bread is so

1352
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:10,798
unique um it's got this musky strange

1353
00:52:07,719 --> 00:52:13,118
Savory kind of smell to it and it's like

1372
00:52:58,519 --> 00:53:03,079
a guy who used to back in the 215 days

00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:12,318
purple buds that you see now or you're

1377
00:53:09,639 --> 00:53:14,239
like did you dye that or have you thrown

1378
00:53:12,318 --> 00:53:15,759
that through a Photoshop filter but it

1379
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:18,358
definitely you saw the purple in there

1380
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:23,079

1390
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,240
you said that because I was just

1391
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,839
thinking about ingred like maybe three

1392
00:53:41,239 --> 00:53:44,279
or four days ago and I'm like we haven't

1393

1399
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:59,880
long time ago and yeah so yeah I can't

1400
00:53:57,639 --> 00:54:01,719
do cheeses though they make me crabby

1401
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:03,760
yeah yeah I don't know why I know so

1402
00:54:01,719 --> 00:54:05,199
many people who love them and I used to

1403
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:07,040
explain to people and they'd ask about

1404
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:09,960
it I'm like it's like video game Weed

1405
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:12,079
Man smoke it you sink into the couch

1406
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:15,440
yeah play your games but for me I get

1407
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:17,839
just really like not wanting to do

1408
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:20,039
anything I probably wasn't so I I stay

1409
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:22,440
away from that one yeah doesn't make me

1410
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:24,239
paranoid just makes me like the couch

1411

lot of people but they never got good

1417
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:40,920
Jack is my my guess for the most part is

1418

they never really got to see the good

1419

Jack or some of the Jack crosses that we

1420

00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:47,919
yeah trade for OG that's all I smoke

1445
00:55:46,599 --> 00:55:49,318
couldn't give me I'd have some other

1446
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:51,920
stuff I'm like it's kind of like OG he's

1447
00:55:49,318 --> 00:55:54,199
like nah don't the same every everyone

1448
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:58,680
knows what they want I can't straight up

1449
00:55:54,199 --> 00:56:01,679
OG is hit or miss with me but like like

1450
00:55:58,679 --> 00:56:03,838
when when like Fire OG and Godfather OG

1451
00:56:01,679 --> 00:56:07,000
were out I used to like those you don't

1452
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:09,679
see those too much anymore yeah you just

1453
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,239
it depends like so that really piny

1454
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:14,118
where you get that where it tastes like

1455
00:56:11,239 --> 00:56:16,879
Pine and citrus where it's almost like

1456
00:56:14,119 --> 00:56:19,240
fresh pine needles that's I love that

1457
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,599
you know it's like and the thing is is

1458
00:56:19,239 --> 00:56:22,479
when it tastes that good down at the

1459
00:56:20,599 --> 00:56:24,838
roach that's when you know you got

1460
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:27,159
something special and it's like cu the

1461
00:56:24,838 --> 00:56:30,119
effect from good OG is like one of those

1462
00:56:27,159 --> 00:56:31,399
ones where it just makes you feel good

1463
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:33,039
it does it's like one of those I

1464
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:34,760
wouldn't consider it a morning or a

1465
00:56:33,039 --> 00:56:37,359
evening it's one of those all the time

1466
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:40,200
sort of things and I could smoke at any

1467
00:56:37,358 --> 00:56:42,358
time of the day Sour Diesel I can't do

1468
00:56:40,199 --> 00:56:44,159
Sour Diesel I love Sour Diesel that one

1469
00:56:42,358 --> 00:56:46,000
I think is the one that I had when I was

1470
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:50,399
a kid that made me stop smoking for a

1471
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:53,798
while couch lock no panic panic it

1472
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:56,720

1473
00:56:53,798 --> 00:56:58,079
yeah right you know and and I I know so

1474
00:56:56,719 --> 00:57:00,279
many people who love it but when people

1475
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:03,318
used to come in from New York and they

1476
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:05,559
would be like totally looking at the

1477
00:57:03,318 --> 00:57:07,279
menu and like their eyes s well no I

1478
00:57:05,559 --> 00:57:09,720
look at up be like you can get something

1479
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:13,519
besides sour diesel today and they would

1480
00:57:09,719 --> 00:57:15,118
just start laughing hilarious yeah it's

1481
00:57:13,519 --> 00:57:16,400
like that's the that was the big thing

1482
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:19,358
still is the big

1483
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:22,599
thing very East Coast thing piff piff is

1484
00:57:19,358 --> 00:57:25,519
a new the new I don't know that I have

1485
00:57:22,599 --> 00:57:26,680
some flow at home but yeah piff piff is

1486
00:57:25,519 --> 00:57:29,480
uh

1487
00:57:26,679 --> 00:57:32,639
it's a nl5 or it's a Northern Light yeah

1488
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:35,599
I think it's nl5 Haze cross okay and

1489
00:57:32,639 --> 00:57:40,000
it's got this really unique Aroma to it

1490
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:42,640
and it's not like space rocket sativa do

1491
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:46,760
you do you smell the nl5 in it you for

1492
00:57:42,639 --> 00:57:49,239
sure smell the the NL it's definitely

1493
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:50,920
yeah it's it's Unique and but it's like

1494
00:57:49,239 --> 00:57:53,199
there's a lot of crosses you know the

1495
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:58,159
Fort Collins cough also has that same in

1496
00:57:53,199 --> 00:58:00,519
there um but it's it's more of a mellow

1497
00:57:58,159 --> 00:58:04,598
kind of buzz and it's not super strong

1498
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:06,920
for for it being an uplifting on the

1499
00:58:04,599 --> 00:58:09,838
stimulant side of the palette or

1500
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:11,880
stimulant side of the effect it's

1501
00:58:09,838 --> 00:58:15,279
definitely kind of more mellow but it

1502
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:17,160
tastes great it's got this really great

1503
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:20,160
uh you know and the thing is is like the

1504
00:58:17,159 --> 00:58:22,118
smoke is velvety I I like it when it's

1505
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:23,759
like that velvety kind of smoke my my

1506
00:58:22,119 --> 00:58:26,160
buddy Josh grows it and it's like one of

1507
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,520
those ones Josh Freeman he's been around

1508
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:29,558
around a long time and he's really good

1509
00:58:27,519 --> 00:58:32,079
at growing all kinds of stuff living

1510
00:58:29,559 --> 00:58:33,920
soil he does he does soil always oh

1511
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:37,480
right on okay and uh yeah really really

1512
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:39,200
good but that piff he has it's like uh

1513
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:40,920
it's amazing and it's it has a lot of

1514
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:42,759
subtleties in it so it's complex with

1515
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:45,639
subtleties the smoke is good and it's

1516
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:48,160
mellow oh see that would be something

1517
00:58:45,639 --> 00:58:53,318
like a lot of people I know who are like

1518
00:58:48,159 --> 00:58:56,440
in their their 50s late 40s 50s early

1519
00:58:53,318 --> 00:58:58,759
60s their biggest complaint is I can't

1520
00:58:56,440 --> 00:59:00,880
smoke anything anymore everything is so

1521
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:02,799
strong that sounds like that would be

1522
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,280
one that you could be like you know you

1523
00:59:02,798 --> 00:59:06,038
can actually have a couple puffs of this

1524
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:08,559
and enjoy it not worry about freaking

1525
00:59:06,039 --> 00:59:12,720

1527
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:17,358

1528
00:59:15,639 --> 00:59:19,639

feel like you know right out of the 60s

1535
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:35,760
totally well it's I when I was work when

1536
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:38,039
I was in the shop there was a very

1537
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:40,760
famous um comedian who came in and I

1538
00:59:38,039 --> 00:59:43,319
won't name names but he was like he said

1539
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:46,000
[ __ ] y'all smoke now is too strong yeah

1540
00:59:43,318 --> 00:59:47,798
what he got and so I sent him home with

1541
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,318
katonic I was like look at like a one to

1542
00:59:47,798 --> 00:59:51,280
one or a two to one and he came back and

1543
00:59:49,318 --> 00:59:52,880
he was like that shit's my jam I'm

1544
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:54,319
totally into that that reminds me of

1545
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:56,400
what I used to canonic is awesome

1546
00:59:54,318 --> 00:59:58,920
actually yeah I love canonic one of

1547
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:00,920
those I feel like the flavors if you get

1548
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:02,240
good Canon because they've there's seeds

1549
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:04,280
of it that have gone around so there's

1550
01:00:02,239 --> 01:00:06,798
all these different fenot types but

1551
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:09,640
katonic the real one to one the

1552
01:00:06,798 --> 01:00:12,519
classic uh is amazing the effect of it

1553
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:14,480
is great um yeah it's one of those ones

1554
01:00:12,519 --> 01:00:15,679
where it just I feel like that's a great

1555
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,159
one for someone who doesn't want to get

1556
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:18,199
too high they just want to get the

1557
01:00:17,159 --> 01:00:19,159
effect and they want to have good time

1558
01:00:18,199 --> 01:00:21,719
with their friends but they don't want

1559
01:00:19,159 --> 01:00:24,078
to be high they they get because I have

1560
01:00:21,719 --> 01:00:26,000
a lot of older friends that grew weed in

1561
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:27,359
the 90s they're like burnouts now

1562
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,639
they're like I don't smoke weed anymore

1563
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:31,759
but I feel like those guys can probably

1564
01:00:29,639 --> 01:00:33,679
smoke some katonic oh yeah and I like to

1565
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:35,880
mix it I mean I'm I'm a big fan of

1566
01:00:33,679 --> 01:00:37,199
making a salad yeah that's another thing

1567
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:38,640
we we're like what does this taste like

1568
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:40,118
with this maybe if we cross them it'll

1569
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:42,480
taste like that it doesn't usually work

1570
01:00:40,119 --> 01:00:44,280
like that but like it's still fun to do

1571
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:46,559
and salads for effect especially if

1572
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:48,640
you're doing that oh yeah when you're

1573
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:50,519
like aware of what you've got like I

1574
01:00:48,639 --> 01:00:53,679
used to have like a little bag just full

1575
01:00:50,519 --> 01:00:56,159
of like half a of a bunch of different

1576
01:00:53,679 --> 01:00:58,000
things and I figure out like time of day

1577
01:00:56,159 --> 01:00:59,679
like what was I going to have you know

1578
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,599
or if I had like a headache I'd have

1579
01:00:59,679 --> 01:01:02,960
something that was like a white widow

1580
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:04,680
cross you know be like oh what's it

1581
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,838
going to be let's look at these

1582
01:01:04,679 --> 01:01:07,960

1585
01:01:09,318 --> 01:01:12,079
you need so many different kinds and

1586
01:01:10,798 --> 01:01:14,599
your little bag I'm like because I don't

1587
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:16,798
know how I'm gonna feel yeah I need I

1588
01:01:14,599 --> 01:01:19,000
need to correlate this with how I feel

1589
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:21,679
because everywhere I go show and tell

1590

01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,760
it's like oh yeah what do you got oh

1601
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:46,639
yeah we should do a salad I love those

1602
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:48,119
where you're like you somebody's got

1603
01:01:46,639 --> 01:01:50,000
this I got that let's see what happens

1604
01:01:48,119 --> 01:01:51,960
when we roll them together yeah that's

1605
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,679
it that's it or sometimes like just like

1606
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:56,599
throwing in some different hash with it

1607
01:01:53,679 --> 01:01:58,598
too I love doing that don't the reason I

1608
01:01:56,599 --> 01:02:01,119
don't smoke on podcasts is because I'll

1609
01:01:58,599 --> 01:02:03,359
just stare at you

1610
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:05,200
yeah I won't be much fun and you'll be

1611
01:02:03,358 --> 01:02:08,000
like why is she here what's going on

1612
01:02:05,199 --> 01:02:11,239
here yeah Sarah say something so we've

1613
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:13,000
had that happen and I feel like I just

1614
01:02:11,239 --> 01:02:16,358
what I've learned over the last year and

1615
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,760
a half especially is that the guest if

1616
01:02:16,358 --> 01:02:19,639
they don't want to smoke it's not worth

1617
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:22,119
having them smoke because we've had some

1618
01:02:19,639 --> 01:02:24,038
episodes where they were uncomfortable

1619
01:02:22,119 --> 01:02:25,440
or somebody wanted to smoke and I

1620
01:02:24,039 --> 01:02:26,440
probably shouldn't have let him smoke so

1621
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,480
much

1622
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:30,559
ah he spoke like an ounce before the

1623
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:34,358
episode

1624
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:37,640
like luckily we have great editors uhuh

1625
01:02:34,358 --> 01:02:41,199

01:04:44,599 --> 01:04:51,480
band for a while that I just a big rock

1676

what was the best what was the one if

1729
01:06:59,239 --> 01:07:04,719
you think of the the best experience

1730
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:07,358
that you had I think for me it was

1731
01:07:04,719 --> 01:07:09,879
probably first time at Madison Square

1732
01:07:07,358 --> 01:07:13,038
Garden um I had dreamed about playing

1733
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:14,798
there since I was a kid um when I used

1734
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:16,799
to hold the tennis racket pretend it was

1735
01:07:14,798 --> 01:07:19,159
a guitar when I was like eight years old

1736
01:07:16,798 --> 01:07:21,318
amazing and uh my group box said you

1737
01:07:19,159 --> 01:07:24,358
know we we played a lot of big places

1738
01:07:21,318 --> 01:07:26,038
and but usually as the opener so to

1739
01:07:24,358 --> 01:07:28,239
finally get there and be the headlining

1740
01:07:26,039 --> 01:07:30,400
act at Madison Square Garden was pretty

1741
01:07:28,239 --> 01:07:31,838
special so that's one I always remember

1742
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:35,278
and then you know like some place like

1743
01:07:31,838 --> 01:07:37,119
Radio City Music Hall was obviously very

1744
01:07:35,278 --> 01:07:40,199
exciting first time at Red Rocks was

1745
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:42,720
great you know some of the the iconic

1746
01:07:40,199 --> 01:07:45,038
places and then of course you know I'm a

1747
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:46,798
Bay Area guy so you know playing

1748
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:48,880
Shoreline in the Coliseum and the

1749
01:07:46,798 --> 01:07:50,838
Berkeley Greek those were all special

1750
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:53,640
because yeah I had played a lot of them

1751
01:07:50,838 --> 01:07:55,278
before but as not as the headliner right

1752
01:07:53,639 --> 01:07:56,798
so it was pretty cool I've been to all

1753
01:07:55,278 --> 01:07:58,679
those venues that must be amazing of

1754
01:07:56,798 --> 01:08:00,798
course yeah yeah we're all we're all

1755
01:07:58,679 --> 01:08:03,159
from here yeah so we know how special

1756
01:08:00,798 --> 01:08:04,880
they are and well and then the shoreline

1757
01:08:03,159 --> 01:08:06,440
has that that special connection with

1758

the dead and when you're backstage you

1759
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:10,159

1760
01:08:08,679 --> 01:08:12,440

1761
01:08:10,159 --> 01:08:14,038
Grateful Dead shine was literally built

1762
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:16,640

when they formed further you know I got

1776
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:49,960
the call yeah I feel like we all have

1777
01:08:47,838 --> 01:08:53,039
our place on this Earth and it's

1778
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:55,000
amazing uh when you find what you're

1785
01:09:10,119 --> 01:09:13,838
and to meet other people that have found

1786
01:09:12,119 --> 01:09:17,399
what they're passionate about and able

1787
01:09:13,838 --> 01:09:20,039
to put the years in and the time in and

1788
01:09:17,399 --> 01:09:22,158
and have great stories yeah I was going

1789
01:09:20,039 --> 01:09:25,560
to say you know almost every musician

1790
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:28,599
I've ever met and known appreciates of

1791
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:30,480
his people yeah I know a lot of

1792
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:33,600
musicians I know the further bus it was

1793
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:37,238
very yeah very you know it was a good

1794
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:38,880
thing for us to to have yeah when we got

1795
01:09:37,238 --> 01:09:40,479
together people said it made perfect

1796
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:43,600
sense well that's what I used to say

1797
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:45,198
there was so much weed around you know

1798
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,880
further in the Grateful Dead when I was

1799
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:49,639
playing with them and and I thought that

1800
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:51,520
was a lot of weed until I met Sarah wow

1801
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:53,600
and then there was even more yeah

1802
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:55,440
because you know everybody sends her

1803
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,800
everything to check out try this I'm

1804
01:09:55,439 --> 01:09:58,879
coming out with this what do you think

1805
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:00,279
and they want to get her approval

1806
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:02,000
totally they got to the point where

1807
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:03,479
every time we take an Uber I tip them

1808
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:06,319
with some kind of cannabis product to

1809
01:10:03,479 --> 01:10:08,599
get it out of my house

1810
01:10:06,319 --> 01:10:10,359
nice that's always a you know I feel

1811
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:14,039
like a lot of times that's a really

1812
01:10:10,359 --> 01:10:16,599
great tip for especially Uber guys a lot

1813
01:10:14,039 --> 01:10:18,198
of Stoners especially in the Bay Area

1814
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:20,679
you know I think a lot of people either

1815
01:10:18,198 --> 01:10:22,158
smoke or have friends that smoke and

1816
01:10:20,679 --> 01:10:23,440
even if they don't smoke but they take

1817
01:10:22,158 --> 01:10:25,319
it you know it's probably going to go

1818
01:10:23,439 --> 01:10:27,359
into some good hands absolutely yeah

1819
01:10:25,319 --> 01:10:28,639
people don't throw weed away no so

1820
01:10:27,359 --> 01:10:30,559
that's that's the beautiful thing about

1821
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:33,280
it I always asked the driver I said you

1822
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:35,960
into cannabis and inevitably 90% of the

1823
01:10:33,279 --> 01:10:38,279
time they're like oh yeah yeah so I get

1824
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:40,560
a nice bag of cookies but it working as

1825
01:10:38,279 --> 01:10:42,198
a as an educator and a consultant I get

1826
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:46,679
a lot of people who want to get feedback

1827
01:10:42,198 --> 01:10:48,799
on products so you know it's it's I love

1828
01:10:46,679 --> 01:10:52,399
checking stuff out but there's

1829
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:54,480
only amazing consume so much yeah you

1830
01:10:52,399 --> 01:10:56,238
never think that it's a good problem to

1831
01:10:54,479 --> 01:10:57,759
have which I know you have too yeah

1832
01:10:56,238 --> 01:11:01,439
there's just two of us at the house so

1833
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:04,360
we skip some you know I'm sure to yeah I

1834
01:11:01,439 --> 01:11:07,879
mean so like with with testing out flow

1835
01:11:04,359 --> 01:11:10,439
I've been in the habit of lighting up

1836
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:12,039
half joints like smoking a half a joint

1837
01:11:10,439 --> 01:11:13,359
or not rolling a half joint rolling a

1838
01:11:12,039 --> 01:11:16,640
full joint but I want to know how it

1839
01:11:13,359 --> 01:11:18,000
burns past the initial part because you

1840
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:19,360
really got to get I mean if it tastes

1841
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,840
good in the beginning that's great but

1842
01:11:19,359 --> 01:11:22,158
halfway down if it still tastes good

1843
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:24,199
then you're on to something well I will

1844
01:11:22,158 --> 01:11:27,198
say I've seen your joints and they're

1845
01:11:24,198 --> 01:11:29,119
big yeah I I like smoking big joints and

1846
01:11:27,198 --> 01:11:31,119
I feel like that's the best way to

1847
01:11:29,119 --> 01:11:32,960
determine if it tastes good or not yeah

1848
01:11:31,119 --> 01:11:37,359
so a half a joint for you is probably a

1849
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:39,319
full joint for most when we when on 420

1850
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:40,920
that joint you had I was like okay it

1851
01:11:39,319 --> 01:11:43,920
was beautiful oh yeah we got some more

1852
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:46,880
for you today James knows what's going

1853
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:49,760
on yeah I love I love the big joints I

1854
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:51,639
fatter than my thumb yeah the party

1855
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:55,039
joints yeah but you know I mean that's I

1856
01:11:51,639 --> 01:11:57,119
think that that's how I like to consume

1857
01:11:55,039 --> 01:12:00,158
you know how I really enjoy the flavor

1858
01:11:57,119 --> 01:12:02,519
and I use thin papers yeah smart and uh

1859
01:12:00,158 --> 01:12:05,279
you know you got I want them to draw a

1860
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:07,199
good amount of smoke yeah and I'm not a

1861
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:09,639
huge hash hole guy a lot of people are

1862
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:10,799
into the hash holes now and it's cool

1863
01:12:09,639 --> 01:12:12,679
I'll smoke them every once when while if

1864
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:15,639
somebody has them I'm not I don't go out

1865
01:12:12,679 --> 01:12:19,239
of my way to roll them or to buy them

1866
01:12:15,639 --> 01:12:21,800
but I get gifted some amazing stuff uh

1867
01:12:19,238 --> 01:12:24,599
but yeah I just love real good quality

1868
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:27,000
flour I just it just excites me yeah it

1869
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:28,679
does me too even though you know Sarah

1870
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:31,399
was just talking about the famous

1871
01:12:28,679 --> 01:12:34,199
comedian that liked katonic I'm kind of

1872
01:12:31,399 --> 01:12:36,000
that guy too yeah as you know when I was

1873
01:12:34,198 --> 01:12:38,439
smoking everything in California was

1874
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:41,760
outdoor it had a high amount of CBD in

1875
01:12:38,439 --> 01:12:43,879
it so it balanced everything out and so

1876
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:46,039
the stuff today kind of makes me a

1877
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:48,359
little shaky so yeah I'm kind of a

1878
01:12:46,039 --> 01:12:51,279
canonic guy too I only smoke what she

1879
01:12:48,359 --> 01:12:53,719
tells me I can yeah and uh there's a

1880
01:12:51,279 --> 01:12:56,439
grower up north Tina Gordon yeah from

1881
01:12:53,719 --> 01:12:58,000
moonm made farms who was just everything

1882
01:12:56,439 --> 01:13:00,879
she and it's outdoor you know it's

1883
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:03,600
sungrown and everything she does is

1884
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:05,760
really good for my body I have found so

1885
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:07,280
far have you tried Huckleberry Hill

1886
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:08,880
Farms you know we're just getting ready

1887

get ready to go visit Johnny yeah yeah

1889
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:15,400
she just stop a ridg line yeah stop a

1890
01:13:13,359 --> 01:13:18,439
ridg line on the way up there go talk to

1891
01:13:15,399 --> 01:13:20,079
yeah I mean those guys have some special

1892
01:13:18,439 --> 01:13:21,919
stuff I saw that had over there was

1893
01:13:20,079 --> 01:13:24,600
looking at that yeah yeah the

1894
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:28,440
Huckleberry Hill Farms that white Thorn

1895
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:30,520
Rose is something special okay and after

1896
01:13:28,439 --> 01:13:32,759
you smoke that I should have some Blue

1897
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:34,880
13 done and then you can smoke and

1898
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:36,840
compare and contrast I would love

1899
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:38,800
because I feel like the effect it's

1900
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:39,920
Feelgood weed it makes you feel good you

1901
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:41,480
can smoke it in the morning you can

1902
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:42,840
smoke it at night you can smoke it when

1903
01:13:41,479 --> 01:13:44,319
you're depressed you could smoke it when

1904
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:46,279
you're happy and it just makes you feel

1905
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:47,399
good yeah that sounds good yeah and

1906
01:13:46,279 --> 01:13:48,920
there's there's nothing wrong with that

1907
01:13:47,399 --> 01:13:50,519
and I feel like we need more weed like

1908
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:53,639
that we need to go back into breeding

1909
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:56,400
for effect a lot more I think that we've

1910
01:13:53,639 --> 01:13:57,960
gone into flavor and you know I I'm to

1911
01:13:56,399 --> 01:13:59,960
blame for that too where I've been

1912
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:01,920
breeding for flavor heavy on flavor and

1913
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:03,639
then kind of neglecting the effect part

1914
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:05,639
because I feel like the effect is tied

1915
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:08,000
in heavily with the flavors that I like

1916
01:14:05,639 --> 01:14:11,679
yeah but in all honesty I need to go

1917
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:13,279
back to breeding for effect and

1918
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:15,399
especially that Feelgood stuff where

1919
01:14:13,279 --> 01:14:18,198
it's like it makes me feel good and so

1920
01:14:15,399 --> 01:14:20,279
if I can breed it and I can smoke it

1921
01:14:18,198 --> 01:14:21,759
that's what I want to smoke right yeah

1922
01:14:20,279 --> 01:14:23,719
you know it's got to taste good too of

1923
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:25,840
course still got to check the boxes but

1924
01:14:23,719 --> 01:14:28,639
that Feelgood effect

1925
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:30,719
is something that we all need you know I

1926
01:14:28,639 --> 01:14:32,279
feel like that's that's the medicine

1927
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:35,480
that's the real you know that's the

1928
01:14:32,279 --> 01:14:37,399
Magic The Magic is found there yeah I do

1929
01:14:35,479 --> 01:14:38,879
still enjoy that dry hit before you

1930
01:14:37,399 --> 01:14:41,198
light it up though really like

1931
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:43,600
experiencing that I might dry hit him

1932
01:14:41,198 --> 01:14:45,439
like a couple hours before and then like

1933
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:48,120
you know I might try hit him 20 or 30

1934
01:14:45,439 --> 01:14:50,960
times sometimes or sometimes if I don't

1935
01:14:48,119 --> 01:14:52,840
want to smoke in the car on the way home

1936
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:55,198
so as far as strains you guys like to

1937
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:57,039
smoke together what is something that

1938
01:14:55,198 --> 01:15:01,839
works for both you

1939
01:14:57,039 --> 01:15:03,800
guys uh probably canotic just cuz or no

1940
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:06,960
you know what Cherry Moon Cherry Moon

1941
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:09,279
but yeah Tina Gordon again back to

1942
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:12,480
Cherry Moon nice Moon Farms Moon made

1943
01:15:09,279 --> 01:15:15,880
farms nice yeah is it a CBD

1944
01:15:12,479 --> 01:15:19,198
strain I no it isn't but it's like it's

1945
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:20,960
it's moderate THC with a really nice

1946
01:15:19,198 --> 01:15:24,319
like I feel like it just has a really

1947
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:27,279
balanced profile to it for me it's like

1948
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:30,679
he has a couple Puffs he's totally happy

1949
01:15:27,279 --> 01:15:32,759
I can smoke it and I feel something cuz

1950
01:15:30,679 --> 01:15:34,960
you know we I tend to like things that

1951
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:36,840
are A Little Bit Stronger Yeah I'm I'm

1952
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:39,719
the lightweight of the two of us for

1953
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:41,600
sure he's he's the example Twi as big

1954
01:15:39,719 --> 01:15:43,158
but lightweight well when I teach my

1955
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:46,000
classes and people are asking about

1956
01:15:43,158 --> 01:15:47,519
dosage and I'm like okay so body mass

1957
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,679
has nothing to do with it it's body

1958
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:53,080
chemistry I'm like I my husband who is

1959
01:15:50,679 --> 01:15:56,039
almost twice my size is my two hit

1960
01:15:53,079 --> 01:15:57,719
wonder yeah and have a high tolerance

1961
01:15:56,039 --> 01:15:59,639
and it has to do with what's going on

1962
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:01,800
with your body yeah it's amazing how

1963
01:15:59,639 --> 01:16:03,359
that works alcohol is the same way I

1964
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:06,520
know some women that can drink men under

1965

in the family I am but he said he was a

1994
01:17:12,479 --> 01:17:16,000
chef I know I remember that but just

1995
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:18,239
because you're a chef doesn't mean you

1996
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:22,399
cook at home I'm really picky about what

1997
01:17:18,238 --> 01:17:25,198
I eat yeah so I eat mostly protein on

1998
01:17:22,399 --> 01:17:27,439
low carb high fat high protein diet

1999
01:17:25,198 --> 01:17:29,158
uhhuh and I I get away with not eating

2000
01:17:27,439 --> 01:17:30,638
very much but uh you know and like

2001
01:17:29,158 --> 01:17:32,559
smoking weed will definitely make me

2002
01:17:30,639 --> 01:17:35,440
more hungry sure sure it's just one of

2003
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:37,000
those things yeah um but yeah when I

2004
01:17:35,439 --> 01:17:39,319
have fence over like I have all kinds of

2005
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,880
cool stuff to like stuff from the past

2006
01:17:39,319 --> 01:17:43,519
that people haven't seen in 20 years

2007
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:45,760
like before the volcano there was a

2008
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:47,800
vaporizer that you it would have a glass

2009
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:49,679
glass piece with a hose on it and you

2010
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:51,719
would have an element and you would blow

2011
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:53,600
hot hot air through the element and that

2012
01:17:51,719 --> 01:17:56,039
was the that's how we vaporized oh was

2013
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:57,360
that little wooden box w

2014
01:17:56,039 --> 01:17:59,880
my roommate broke mine I was really

2015
01:17:57,359 --> 01:18:01,439
pissed at him yeah well like if you

2016
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:02,880
break it now there's no like the company

2017
01:18:01,439 --> 01:18:04,519
doesn't exist anymore I don't know how

2018
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:06,279
to get the replacement pieces you'd have

2019
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:08,480
to have someone hand blow you the

2020
01:18:06,279 --> 01:18:10,920
replacement pieces there was the big

2021
01:18:08,479 --> 01:18:13,439
Buddha vaporizer and there there was a

2022
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:17,239
whole bunch of cool stuff and I have all

2023
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:19,638
kinds of nostalgia from 20 years ago 25

2024
01:18:17,238 --> 01:18:21,319
years ago from when I was a kid I love

2025
01:18:19,639 --> 01:18:23,000
that you know the only thing I haven't

2026
01:18:21,319 --> 01:18:25,599
done in a long time was use a magnifying

2027
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,880
glass to smoke right but but we did that

2028
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:28,320
back in the day and I'm probably going

2029
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:31,760
to do that again this weekend or a

2030
01:18:28,319 --> 01:18:33,479
toilet paper roll or an apple oh yeah in

2031
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:36,039
the dorms we used to do that out of

2032
01:18:33,479 --> 01:18:37,319
desperation sometimes yeah there was

2033
01:18:36,039 --> 01:18:39,880
always the bong

2034
01:18:37,319 --> 01:18:42,719
mcgyver he's got to get creative we we

2035
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:43,639
did some wild things for sure yeah I

2036
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:45,198
don't know what you guys are talking

2037
01:18:43,639 --> 01:18:46,760
about I've I've done that at cannabis

2038
01:18:45,198 --> 01:18:50,198
conferences where they don't allow weed

2039
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:53,920
in the state get an

2040
01:18:50,198 --> 01:18:55,638
Apple instab bong exactly did you guys

2041
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:57,399
put uh

2042
01:18:55,639 --> 01:18:59,079
fabric softener in the cardboard tubes

2043
01:18:57,399 --> 01:19:01,039
and like blow your hits into that when

2044
01:18:59,079 --> 01:19:03,639
you're younger in the in the dorms in

2045
01:19:01,039 --> 01:19:06,880
the dorms yeah yeah yeah you put some

2046
01:19:03,639 --> 01:19:08,319
balance in there you won't get caught

2047
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:10,119
you blow it right through that no we

2048
01:19:08,319 --> 01:19:13,039
just used to stick the towels under the

2049
01:19:10,119 --> 01:19:14,840
door oh we did that too open the window

2050
01:19:13,039 --> 01:19:16,840
my dorm was on the 14th floor San

2051
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:18,920
Francisco State so we were up high and

2052
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:20,319
we just opened the window and blew it it

2053
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:24,800
was right by the ocean so there's always

2054
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:26,319
a breeze so just take it away yeah and

2055
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:28,840
actually I don't think anybody cared at

2056
01:19:26,319 --> 01:19:31,238
San Francisco State probably not at

2057
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:33,000
Northern Michigan University they there

2058
01:19:31,238 --> 01:19:35,279
you you'd go to jail for res and in your

2059
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:37,000
pip back well it's funny because now

2060
01:19:35,279 --> 01:19:39,279
Northern Michigan University wants you

2061
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:41,479
to come and be an ed professor and teach

2062
01:19:39,279 --> 01:19:43,279
a cannabis class they're going to be

2063
01:19:41,479 --> 01:19:45,799
starting a bachelor's program in

2064
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:47,759
cannabis really cool yeah they all these

2065
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:49,279
colleges need to start they need to

2066
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:51,000
educate people on how to work in the

2067
01:19:49,279 --> 01:19:52,599
industry I mean I think all these things

2068
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:55,000
are a great idea but going back to my

2069
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:57,000
experience with culinary school I I feel

2070
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:59,639
like a lot of people went to culinary

2071
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:01,079
school they paid $100,000 for school and

2072
01:19:59,639 --> 01:20:02,279
then they end up working at Starbucks

2073
01:20:01,079 --> 01:20:04,359
because you don't get the industry

2074
01:20:02,279 --> 01:20:05,920
experience I feel like cannabis is the

2075
01:20:04,359 --> 01:20:08,639
same way if you want to work in the

2076
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:11,639
industry now if you want to be a breeder

2077
01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:13,400
or you want to you know I think cannabis

2078
01:20:11,639 --> 01:20:16,520
is amazing and if you were to go to

2079
01:20:13,399 --> 01:20:19,359
college for plant science uh that would

2080
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:21,040
be great and but but as far as learning

2081
01:20:19,359 --> 01:20:24,880
the basic stuff you should actually just

2082
01:20:21,039 --> 01:20:27,359
go get a job uh at a farm

2083
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:28,760
indoor outdoor Greenhouse whatever it is

2084
01:20:27,359 --> 01:20:31,039
I think that's the best way to learn so

2085
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:32,760
if you guys want a job in the industry

2086
01:20:31,039 --> 01:20:34,880
you want to be professionals the best

2087
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:37,239
thing to do besides growing in your

2088
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:39,480
closet at home which is great but go out

2089
01:20:37,238 --> 01:20:41,158
and get a job in the industry suck it up

2090
01:20:39,479 --> 01:20:42,519
for five years you're not going to make

2091
01:20:41,158 --> 01:20:44,079
a lot of money and that's okay but

2092
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:45,840
you're going to learn a lot and

2093
01:20:44,079 --> 01:20:48,399
sometimes that's you know whether you're

2094
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:49,920
a musician or whatever it is oh yeah

2095
01:20:48,399 --> 01:20:51,879
doing it is how you're going to learn

2096
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:53,399
how to do it absolutely we you know

2097
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:56,279
musician we didn't make any money the

2098
01:20:53,399 --> 01:20:58,198
first five or six years either yeah but

2099
01:20:56,279 --> 01:20:59,880
you know that it's it's interesting that

2100
01:20:58,198 --> 01:21:01,638
you're you're talking about culinary

2101
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:03,520
school and then this because that was

2102
01:21:01,639 --> 01:21:06,119
one of the things I was going to go to

2103
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:07,360
culinary school for pastry and I was

2104
01:21:06,119 --> 01:21:09,359
doing a lot of reading and there was

2105
01:21:07,359 --> 01:21:11,880
that big argument about do you just work

2106
01:21:09,359 --> 01:21:13,519
under someone or do you go to school and

2107
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:14,880
I had applied to school and then when I

2108
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:16,880
saw the loan that I was going to take

2109
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:19,639
out and that I was going to be lucky if

2110
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:23,319
I made 13 bucks an hour in a kitchen

2111
01:21:19,639 --> 01:21:26,880
when I got done I was like okay like how

2112
01:21:23,319 --> 01:21:30,039
do you get people to get excited about

2113
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:32,079
like actually doing the time in the

2114
01:21:30,039 --> 01:21:34,079
industry just working their way up but

2115
01:21:32,079 --> 01:21:36,119
also when we're looking at

2116
01:21:34,079 --> 01:21:37,719
education some of these programs that

2117
01:21:36,119 --> 01:21:40,760
are out and I have I know people who

2118
01:21:37,719 --> 01:21:42,560
have gone I ask them I say are you doing

2119
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:44,119
it for the institutionalization or are

2120
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:46,239
you actually learning something from it

2121
01:21:44,119 --> 01:21:48,158
and if they've been in the industry it's

2122
01:21:46,238 --> 01:21:50,599
the institutionalization and then the

2123
01:21:48,158 --> 01:21:52,238
second question I always ask is are your

2124
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:55,600
professors people who actually have

2125
01:21:52,238 --> 01:21:57,319
practical experience or are these tenur

2126
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:59,079
professors with Advanced degrees that

2127
01:21:57,319 --> 01:22:01,198
are teaching the curriculum that's given

2128
01:21:59,079 --> 01:22:03,158
to them and it's usually the second as

2129
01:22:01,198 --> 01:22:05,799
well and so I think if we are going to

2130
01:22:03,158 --> 01:22:07,719
be having these programs yeah we need to

2131
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:10,199
make it attractive for people in the

2132
01:22:07,719 --> 01:22:12,639
industry to work in them but more than

2133
01:22:10,198 --> 01:22:14,479
that the there has to be critical

2134
01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:16,359
thought in the educational institution

2135
01:22:14,479 --> 01:22:17,919
that it's not necessarily going to be a

2136
01:22:16,359 --> 01:22:19,719
person with a master's degree that's

2137
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:21,399
going to be teaching this class but

2138
01:22:19,719 --> 01:22:22,600
they're going to have the knowledge and

2139
01:22:21,399 --> 01:22:24,799
the background to help create the

2140
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:26,280
curriculum to actually put people people

2141
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:29,000
out there that know what they're doing

2142
01:22:26,279 --> 01:22:31,000
and can get good jobs yeah cuz I mean at

2143
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,399
the end of the day if I'm learning how

2144
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:35,158
to if I want to go to school for

2145
01:22:32,399 --> 01:22:37,638
breeding yeah I want to know from

2146
01:22:35,158 --> 01:22:39,599
somebody who actually does breed yeah

2147
01:22:37,639 --> 01:22:41,600
how to do it how what's their approach

2148
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:43,120
what's because you can the pl science

2149
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:45,760
stuff I think the basics it's great to

2150
01:22:43,119 --> 01:22:48,039
go to school for foundational stuff

2151
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:49,520
totally but the in the fundamentals

2152
01:22:48,039 --> 01:22:51,238
right like learn the fundamentals I

2153
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:54,040
think that's important but when it comes

2154
01:22:51,238 --> 01:22:56,119
down to cannabis and learning how to

2155
01:22:54,039 --> 01:22:59,679
breathe everyone has their own way of

2156
01:22:56,119 --> 01:23:02,039
doing it uh and learning somebody's

2157
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:04,319
style learning their approach because we

2158
01:23:02,039 --> 01:23:06,039
all have different approaches that that

2159
01:23:04,319 --> 01:23:07,319
helps you find your own way eventually

2160
01:23:06,039 --> 01:23:09,840
and that's what you really want to do is

2161
01:23:07,319 --> 01:23:11,799
find your own way to that now you can do

2162
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:14,039
that by practicing at home but doing

2163
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:16,000
that at scale is so much different than

2164
01:23:14,039 --> 01:23:18,198
breeding in a tent yep you know or

2165
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,399
breeding under under four lights when

2166
01:23:18,198 --> 01:23:22,238
you're breeding under 60 lights doing

2167
01:23:20,399 --> 01:23:24,799
pheno hunting under 60 lights as opposed

2168
01:23:22,238 --> 01:23:26,439
to four that's a whole different story M

2169
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:29,279
you know and you're able to explore a

2170
01:23:26,439 --> 01:23:30,559
lot more or doing a whole field you know

2171
01:23:29,279 --> 01:23:32,000
and usually you're not going to do that

2172
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:34,280
on your own dime it's better to go learn

2173
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,119
on somebody else's dime correct go lose

2174
01:23:34,279 --> 01:23:37,679
some not not lose some money but not

2175
01:23:36,119 --> 01:23:40,000
make a lot of money go work in humbled

2176
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:41,679
on a farm yeah well and you may find

2177
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:44,079
that as much as you thought that that's

2178
01:23:41,679 --> 01:23:46,760
what you wanted to do there's something

2179
01:23:44,079 --> 01:23:48,158
else in the Cannabis sphere that you

2180
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:50,000
that you weren't even turned on to

2181
01:23:48,158 --> 01:23:52,000
before that you actually want to do

2182
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:53,880
instead right well you created the

2183
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,800
curriculum for City College San

2184
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:57,600
Francisco the first curriculum the first

2185
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:59,679
curriculum yeah yeah yeah and it was a

2186
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:02,639
very interesting time because it was

2187
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:05,920
very political to be able to do that um

2188
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:09,319
and I was The Faculty were not as open

2189
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:11,399
to it so it was I was interesting

2190
01:24:09,319 --> 01:24:13,639
because I wasn't a faculty that was an

2191
01:24:11,399 --> 01:24:15,479
employee and so to kind of see some of

2192
01:24:13,639 --> 01:24:17,800
the politics but not but be removed from

2193
01:24:15,479 --> 01:24:19,919
it was a blessing but it was I was

2194
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:22,719
grateful to do it it was I did three

2195
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:25,079
three-hour classes it was a sess it was

2196
01:24:22,719 --> 01:24:26,840
there it was a whole session and then

2197
01:24:25,079 --> 01:24:28,319
when the next group of people came in

2198
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:30,000
and did the classes I think it was

2199
01:24:28,319 --> 01:24:32,198
easier for them to be able to get

2200
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:34,198
through some of the politics right and

2201
01:24:32,198 --> 01:24:36,119
really like be able to have the freedom

2202
01:24:34,198 --> 01:24:38,399
to put in some really good curriculum as

2203
01:24:36,119 --> 01:24:41,800
well nice it's it's you always got to

2204
01:24:38,399 --> 01:24:44,319
start somewhere right for sure so if you

2205
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:46,279
had one piece of advice for your younger

2206
01:24:44,319 --> 01:24:48,679
self and we're goingon to do this one at

2207
01:24:46,279 --> 01:24:51,158
a time okay okay what would that one

2208
01:24:48,679 --> 01:24:53,560
piece of advice be don't lose

2209
01:24:51,158 --> 01:24:55,759
hope don't lose hope there were so many

2210
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:59,840
times as a strugg musician in the early

2211
01:24:55,760 --> 01:25:01,320
days where I thought you know and you're

2212
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:02,560
not both my parents but one of my

2213
01:25:01,319 --> 01:25:03,799
parents was always kind of breathing

2214
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:05,360
down my neck you know join the

2215
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:08,440
apprenticeship have something to fall

2216
01:25:05,359 --> 01:25:09,960
back on and if I would have done that I

2217
01:25:08,439 --> 01:25:14,799
don't think I would have had a career in

2218
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:15,719
music so just don't lose hope yeah stick

2219
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:19,480
to your

2220
01:25:15,719 --> 01:25:20,520
guns yeah hey mind would be just staying

2221
01:25:19,479 --> 01:25:22,678
true to

2222
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:24,040
yourself especially when you're younger

2223
01:25:22,679 --> 01:25:26,520
it's like you doubt things and you get

2224
01:25:24,039 --> 01:25:29,359
really influenced by there are good

2225
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:32,320
influences of course that help shape our

2226
01:25:29,359 --> 01:25:33,920
personalities but um I think as human

2227
01:25:32,319 --> 01:25:35,599
beings we given this laundry list of

2228
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:38,359
things that we're supposed to do and be

2229
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:41,079
and it promises us this successful happy

2230
01:25:38,359 --> 01:25:43,479
life and not everybody has the same path

2231
01:25:41,079 --> 01:25:44,639
