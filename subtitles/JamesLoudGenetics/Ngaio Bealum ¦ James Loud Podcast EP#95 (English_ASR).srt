yeah I'm one of those guys I I enjoy

63

64
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:52,280
the class was really amazing there was a

65
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,759
lot of people from an Indian Reservation

66
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,479
we had people from all over the Canary

67
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:58,000
Islands I believe colia wow you know

68

over 40 people in the class it was a lot

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,400
of fun I love Oaker Dam because it used

70
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,200
used to be a very in-person thing then

71
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,920
Co happened and now it's basically open

72
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:07,518
to everyone all over the world

73
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,119
internationally you know it's great

74
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,599
having people excited about cannabis all

75
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,039
over the world I love it I think we're

76
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:13,639
in this beautiful time in a lot of

77
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:15,598
places and I talked about my class today

78
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:17,639
it is a beautiful time you know I think

79
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:20,158
it's scary for some people some people

80
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:23,439
are very upset about the way things are

81
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:25,719
but it's always been that way so for

82
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:28,438
cannabis not as many people are going to

83
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:30,239
prison that's the important thing yeah

84
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:32,560
and I think uh we just got a whole bunch

85
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,599
of Pardons for cannabis prisoners yes

86
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,039
and that is freaking amazing I I just

87
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:39,280
the one thing that's happened in the

88
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:40,598
last year was that a lot of well just

89
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,519
just recently not in the last year in

90
00:03:40,598 --> 00:03:44,359
the last week we have people getting out

91
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:45,840
of prison for cannabis crimes that they

92
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,319
never should have been put in prison no

93
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,560
one should ever go to jail for weed

94
00:03:47,318 --> 00:03:53,238
anywhere in the world ever no ever yeah

95
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,199
ever ever ever ever I cannot stress this

96
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:58,360
enough I agree never ever ever weed is a

97
00:03:56,199 --> 00:04:00,280
plant it's it's a plant it's it's a very

98
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,439
useful plant I'm I'm still of those old

99
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,799
school Jack ha hemp can save the planet

100
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:07,359
you know what I mean we all should be

101
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:09,000
taking advantage of this beautiful and

102
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,239
glorious plant which is does so much for

103
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,039
humans and uh you know not to get all

104
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:14,400
woo woo about it but for real no but

105
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:16,599
cannabis can make the world a better

106
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,840
place and it's for me it's impossible to

107
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,280
argue it has it has it has every day it

108
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:23,319
has in my life in your life and so many

109
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,359
other people around us right it's made

110
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:28,079
their world a better place and I think

111
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,080
it has the it has the you know the power

112
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:32,279
to change people's minds right uh which

113
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:34,038
is one of the reasons they try to keep

114
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:35,879
it illegal because you get stoned you

115
00:04:34,038 --> 00:04:37,439
start noticing yeah and then you're

116
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:39,079
like we got to change it something's

117
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:41,959
wrong here something's wrong something's

118
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:44,319
terribly horribly wrong yeah I mean I

119
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:46,599
think cannabis Tunes you in alcohol

120
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:47,959
Tunes you out that's why I like cannabis

121
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,039
better than alcohol even though I don't

122
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:52,799
mind alcohol whatever I J got a full bar

00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:44,318
but I also like uh I would just fry some

177
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,120
chicken you're out here

178
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,879
like chicken I made Korean fried chicken

179
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,519
yesterday Koreans learned that from the

180
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:52,478
from the black people yeah during the

181
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:55,120
Korean War it wasn't the colonel I swear

182
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:56,800
no it was the colonel have maybe you

183
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,598
know Colonel Jenkins who's a black guy

184
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,639
station in Korea during the war colel

185
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:03,839
Sanders the real yeah absolutely not C

186
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:05,038
Sanders but I love fried chicken too

187
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:07,279
that's one of my favorite things I love

188
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:10,399
extra crispy fried chicken now do you br

189
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:12,559
your chicken I do not mil you that's a

190
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:14,839
great way to do it though um you know I

191
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,560
think that like yesterday basically I

192
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:19,638
did I used cornstarch egg cornstarch egg

193
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:22,079
corn starch and then I fried it like

194
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:23,199
that and so basically you do twice fried

195
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:24,878
so you fry it once you get a little

196
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,240
crispy and then right before you eat it

197
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:29,280
you throw it in again to crisp it up o

198
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,879
and it's extra crispy and you can do

199
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,318
them strips you could do breast strips

200
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:34,240
if you want to go a little healthier or

201
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,000
you can do chicken I love chicken wings

202
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,918
chicken wings man I I'll eat chicken

203
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,759
wings 18 million different ways but I'm

204
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm going to maybe start an argument

205
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,360
yeah I'm not always a fan of a brine

206
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,038
because I think it makes everything too

207
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,919
salty yeah and I feel like we overs salt

208
00:07:46,038 --> 00:07:50,519
everything and I don't want I don't

209
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:52,918
always want like salt to be the first

210
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:54,318
flavor or the overwhelming flavor Sal

211
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:55,918
Salt's like a spice I like a little salt

212
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,360
on the skin and you get a little

213
00:07:55,918 --> 00:08:00,598
saltiness but then the chicken starts to

214
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,479
chicken it up you know mean so I was at

215
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:05,680
shap penes for nine months a long long

216
00:08:03,478 --> 00:08:07,959
time 20 years ago that's a still so so

217
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,319
what 20 years ago and so I was it shap

218
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:12,318
penes 20 years ago all right I was on

219
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,680
evening at The Improv in 1993 whatever

220
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,280
let just talk about it all right go

221
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,918
ahead shap shapes and so this is very

222
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:20,918
very important to our conversation

223
00:08:18,918 --> 00:08:23,918
because I learned at sha penice that you

224
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:26,399
use things like salt yeah you use things

225
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:28,399
like sauces to elevate the raw

226
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,519
ingredients right and that's how it

227
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:32,838
should be that's how it should

228
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:35,000
so salt and sugar forward in a lot of

229
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:37,120
American Cuisine these days well and the

230
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,360
fat and the Umami they want this you

231
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,879
know have a lot of fat I like fat I'm

232
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,680
there's nothing wrong with little some

233
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:45,080
butter I don't care I love butter I love

234
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,599
do you love it deep fried that's the

235
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,240
important thing I love everything I'm

236
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,600
not picky when it comes I mean I'm picky

237
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,759
with quality but I'm not picky about

238
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,920
different things because I feel like

239
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:55,759
there's so many different ways to

240
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:56,919
prepare stuff to make butter yeah yeah

241
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:59,039
well you were talking about oxtail

242
00:08:56,919 --> 00:09:00,879
earlier I love oxtail I think that if

243
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,958
you don't like oxtail but you like braz

244
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:03,799
meat you probably haven't had good

245
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,399
oxtail had the good oxtail I mean I used

246
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:06,759
to have how can you not like you like

247
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:08,000
how do you like a braz meat and not like

248
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:11,399
an oxtail I think some people don't like

249
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,078
the name oxtail well listen hey uh poor

250
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:15,000
people have always made the best food

251
00:09:13,078 --> 00:09:16,599
yeah and it's a damn shame that the rich

252
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,879
people have discovered the tail of the

253
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,399
cow because now it's $12 a pound or

254
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:21,759
whatever when it used to be the cheap

255
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,639
cut of meat and so you had to learn how

256
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:25,679
to do something with it I mean tritip

257
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:27,600
was like that back in the day there's so

258
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:29,199
many different cuts of meat that were

259
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,480
really cheap and then people figured it

260
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,680
out it's like Terrace major is a new one

261
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,120
that's the petite fet right and so now

262
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:37,838
they're calling it petite fet just keep

263
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,679
calling it Terrace major yeah you know

264
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,560
do that there's so many different cuts

265
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:43,359
right that that were like the butcher

266
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:44,518
steak right that they call The Butcher

267
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,039
steak because the butcher they couldn't

268
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:47,560
sell it so The Butchers would keep it

269
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:49,078
learn how to do something with it yeah

270
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:51,000
yeah yeah yeah that's how it always goes

271
00:09:49,078 --> 00:09:52,239
exactly right yeah if I got some chicken

272
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,879
bones and you got an onion we're going

273
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,680
to make soup yeah as a team that's

274
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:59,000

275
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:00,719

00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:12,518
at 420 together last year 2024 you were

306
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:14,039
the MC for the event I was um I was

307
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:15,600
there it was actually a really sad day

308
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:17,679
my friend Dave passed away we talked

309
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,920
about on the podcast he he passed away

310
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:23,679
that morning oh and you know it but it

311
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:25,799
was such a beautiful day so to celebrate

312
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:27,159
did Dave like weed celebrate he he loved

313
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:29,679
weed so there you go Dave got me

314
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:31,879
breeding for a effect I've breing for

315
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:33,559
flavor being a chef you know you can't

316
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:35,120
can't blame someone for bre I me flavor

317
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:36,638
and effect they kind of go hand in hand

318
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,078
and you think about different Tarpin

319
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:39,519
have different effects and the different

320
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:41,599
smell will give you different things

321
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,078
absolutely but I think there needs to be

322
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,480
more of a focus back on effect for

323
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:46,399
everybody how does it make you feel

324
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,120
forget about the flavor stuff and and

325
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,600
let's let's go down to the root like

326
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,679
does it make you feel amazing because

327
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,399
all these different cultivars all these

328
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,078
different cultivars that we have they

329
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:57,600
give you a different effect each one of

330
00:11:55,078 --> 00:11:59,919
them slightly different right yeah uh

331
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,440
not that no two are exactly the same cuz

332
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:04,120
there a lot of them are similar but but

333
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:07,279
there's some that are special that make

334
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:09,320
you feel a certain way and our body

335
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:11,000
chemistry is so unique that what works

336
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,000
for me may not work for you or the next

337
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,399
tell people that all the time it's

338
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,839
always different you got to find a butt

339
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:17,480
tender who smokes like you smoke yeah

340
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,360
right or you just got to try a bunch of

341
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,959
weed right you got to smoke a that's how

342
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,519
you learn what you like is by trying

343
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:24,078
everything yeah and then you go back to

344
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:25,320
the stuff you really like I got I have

345
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:26,919
friends who keep notebooks they like

346
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,079
they take detailed notes have notbook

347
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:31,078
you can go to I think there's an app for

348
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:33,519
that now was it the Buddhist app or

349
00:12:31,078 --> 00:12:35,838
buest yeah I should actually take more

350
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,198
advantage of that I think it's important

351
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,240
but you know sometimes I'm just St I

352
00:12:37,198 --> 00:12:40,159
don't want to write down I'm just

353
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,759
like oh that was good weed don't for

354
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,519
remember that one well you know it's the

355
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:44,720
jar test right which jar if you have a

356
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,720
bunch of jars which one do you go back

357
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,800
to that's that doesn't have a lot left

358
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,240
exactly that's usually the one the one

359
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:52,000
that makes you feel a certain way the

360
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,879
one that tastes the best I like Skittles

361
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,039
for the flavor but also when it's grown

362
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:58,360
in soil I love the way it makes me feel

363
00:12:56,039 --> 00:13:00,480

1975 yeah maybe

452
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:18,799
1978 they may have been the best band in

453
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:20,319
the world at that time yeah now from say

454
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:22,120
86

455
00:16:20,318 --> 00:16:24,838
to

456
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,759
93 fishbone was the best band in the

457
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:28,199
world I like fishbone too most people

458
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:30,120

459
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:31,679
you not know about fishbone if you like

460
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,480

they get down but they they get down

462
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,600
into very American groovy everybody's

463
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,759
locked in we're creating a higher

464
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,399
Consciousness sort of way absolutely at

465
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:44,399
least when they were at their Peak yeah

466
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,958
for sure yeah well in 80s was kind of

467
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,919
rough with music to be honest I think

468
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:50,919
there was a lot of electronic stuff

469
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:52,439
coming in that maybe doesn't appeal to

470
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:54,240
people today but there was still some

471
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,839
good stuff there some I mean listen

472
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,360
there was all that punk rock we're were

473
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:01,920
leaning into the industrial uh house was

474
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:03,399
kind of just getting getting creative

475
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:04,519
right after the Donna everything and

476
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:05,919
then people starting to figure it out in

477
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:07,439
Detroit and all that stuff oh yeah San

478
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,759

00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:38,798
course absolutely I play guitar yeah

492
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:40,200
well we should have brought our

493
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:41,400
instruments next time I'll bring a kunga

494

out for three hours we get a Dr yeah we

496
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,720

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,519
we're eating mushrooms we're getting a

498
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:54,759
drum circle going 100% Fire on the

499
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:57,158
Mountain that's what's up fire all right

500
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:58,960
so what do you think about I think it's

501
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:01,600
very tasty and clearly it makes me

502
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,279
chatty yeah I like I like the effects of

503
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:04,879
it I feel like it's a good hybrid it's

504
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:06,798
uplift just starting to kick in I feel

505
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,280
the uplift for sure you feel a little

506
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:10,000
behind the eyes a little bit U the

507
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:12,599
flavor is really really nice like you

508
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
said floral notes I get a lot more Peach

509
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:17,079
than just like straight tropical fruit

510
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,558
but that could just be me that be the

511
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:22,558
vibe that I'm on right now call it Peach

512
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:23,879
Thorn Rose nice nice but yeah I'm gonna

513
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:25,720
I'm gonna see Johnny next week and we're

514
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,080
going to talk about it I just I feel

515
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:30,519
like uh yeah it's it's got a special

516
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:32,599
look to it it's kind of like Skittles in

517
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:35,079
the sense that it's not super beautiful

518
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:37,119
as far as the structure but I think the

519
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:40,639
effect way

520
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:43,918
outweighs the the bag appeal it looks

521
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,120
and you know listen we it's so hard now

522
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,200
that they don't serve deli style right

523
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:51,079
first of all the worst first of all you

524
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,919
know you're it's sitting in myar the the

525
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:55,240
conditions are hot it's cold it's this

526
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:56,759
it's that it's not moving it's not

527
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,440
always maintaining the Tarpin like you

528
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:01,038
like and it takes 3 months to get the

529
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:03,120
approve so you know it starts to degrade

530
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:05,119
after a while you have to trust the

531
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:07,599
company you have to trust the grower now

532
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:09,399
you can't you know what I mean smell

533
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:11,599
smell the bag or at least look at it and

534
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,840
be like oh yeah okay yeah that's the

535
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:15,959
worst part about such a big recreational

536
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:18,599
Cannabis is the that we lost the deli

537
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:21,240
style where you can't actually so that

538
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:22,519
is some old school Funk right there I

539
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,880
smell a

540
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:25,720
little I definitely smell the funk and

541
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,840
like some

542
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,960
skunky uh oh yeah it's so that's the C

543
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:32,798
diesle what was it before run it was

544
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,880
just skunk it was just OG right so this

545
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:36,839
is very much an old school OG it grows

546
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,039
like a sativa though so it's it's got

547
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:41,480
that morphology where it's like really

548
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:44,319
bad node spacing thinner leaves taller

549
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:46,279
plants but it has that classic OG

550
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:49,200
structure and it has that really classic

551
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:51,639
nose burning OG gas but I'm also

552
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,440
smelling a little uh like a little

553
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,559
creaminess almost like a old school

554
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:59,640
Northern Lights or something like that

555
00:19:55,558 --> 00:20:01,240

559
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:11,038
90s early 2000s yeah yeah yeah maybe

560
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:12,719

561
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:15,839
just we got the cut

562

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,120
at least to me Blue Dream will never go

587
00:21:11,278 --> 00:21:14,480
away because what happens is it won't

588
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:16,479
you smoke a lot of Blue Dream and you're

589
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,558
like man I got to give other weeds a

590
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,400
chance yeah lay off of it or maybe you

591

you're like ah I need a blue dream

593
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:24,439
tolerance break or whatever then you

594
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,320
smoke a really good one again you're

595
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:29,759
like God that's my why did I never

596

598
00:21:32,278 --> 00:21:35,679
hang out you can clean you could do

599
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,200
stuff or not do stuff right Blue Dream

600
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,519
is so well balanced it's so well

601
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,558
balanced it's such an interesting

602
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:41,960
variety green crack on the I like green

603
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:43,519
crack too don't get me wrong but Green

604
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,558
Crack you bu I hate the name too always

605
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:47,000
hat it's the worst name it's not a great

606
00:21:45,558 --> 00:21:49,319
no and the thing is is the reason it's

607
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,919
called Green Crack is because you smoke

608
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:52,558
it and it gets you so high but you build

609
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:54,120
a tolerance to it right away so like

610
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:55,960
within a week it doesn't get you high

611
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:59,239
anymore it's like crack like

612
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,720
literally I would smoke it and then

613
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,120
I didn't realize that was the origin of

614
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,960
the name and and the thing is is like if

615
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:08,678
I only I did this one time where I only

616
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,480
grew green crack and so after a week my

617
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:12,000
literally a green crackhead yeah and it

618
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,440
was like so I'd give my friends over

619
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,798
smoking they'd be like oh this is so

620
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,400
strong and I'd smoke big joints with

621
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:18,720
them and I wouldn't be phased and they

622
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,000
would be completely out I had a friend

623
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,798
we were at uh this is

624
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,038
2012 at the parade for the Giants in San

625
00:22:23,798 --> 00:22:28,119
Francisco and I brought big joints of

626
00:22:26,038 --> 00:22:29,599
Green Crack to smoke with everybody and

627
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:31,319
I passed one of my friend Joe and we

628
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:33,079
were out in front of the library onean

629
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:35,200
crowd control committee oh yeah we were

630
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:37,240
in front of the library in San Francisco

631
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,880
and he took a couple hits from it and

632
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,558
had to actually sit down on the ground

633
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,278
he was so high I'm like what are you

634
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:43,519
doing dude like we just took a couple

635
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:45,798
hits and he's like this is the strongest

636
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:47,079
weed I smoke yeah you have to be

637
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:48,679
careful you have to be careful with the

638
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:51,798
amateur sometimes I've definitely killed

639
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:53,000
a party or two with a regular size joint

640
00:22:51,798 --> 00:22:54,359
but you know what are you going to do

641
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,079
and he wasn't even an amateur it's just

642
00:22:54,359 --> 00:23:00,439
different than what he's used to

643
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:00,439
smoke so yeah I was in New York

644
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,640
just before New Year's and we went to a

645
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:06,918
couple spots and a friend of mine knew

646

or what it looks like and then yeah got

666
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:45,760
stoned at the park or whatever and

667
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:47,439

limine tpine classic tpine is becoming

737

very popular yeah that the terpinolene

738
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,600
is very popular but we had all kinds of

739
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:28,519
stuff there was like some Durbin there

740

785
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:03,640
I'm drinking this uh this new coffee

786
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,278
it's a mushroom coffee called rise so is

787
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,399
it coffee with mushrooms in it or is it

788
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:10,679
just all mushroom coffee it has a rabika

789
00:28:07,398 --> 00:28:12,918
coffee in it and it's amazing and it

790
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:14,798
makes me super focused before I taught

791
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:16,840

792
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:19,119

793
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:20,439
mane and coffee it has like five

794
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:22,558
different mushrooms five different

795
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,919
mushrooms and then it it definitely

796
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:28,440
makes you more focused without giving

797
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:30,720
you that heavy caffeine buzz and I like

798
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,480
caffeine by itself but man I think

799
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,519
caffeine with mushrooms is this key it's

800
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,960
not psychedelic mushrooms but it's just

801
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:38,759
it's the good stuff it's the momy it's

802
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:40,360
the vitamin D yeah right mushrooms are

803
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:42,599
heavy in that it's it's all those kind

804
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:44,839
of things I love mushrooms I love all

805
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:46,759
mushrooms yeah there's not a bad

806
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:49,199
mushroom out there well some will kill

807
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:50,278
you well so those kind of mushrooms I

808
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,600
don't like but the other I'm sure

809
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:53,960
they're beneficial for the planet and

810
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:55,959
the environment and other different ways

811
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,278
but maybe you shouldn't kill it or eat

812
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,038
it maybe there's some you definitely

813
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:00,558
shouldn't eat more than more than a few

814
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:02,839
you shouldn't eat your mushrooms before

815
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:04,278
you get into them I also do like mus

816
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:06,079
love all the mushrooms that you can eat

817
00:29:04,278 --> 00:29:07,240
that I've eaten i' I love all you never

818
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:09,879
had a bad mushroom you never ate one

819
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:11,240
mushroom and went like you know I think

820
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,399
so so I talk about it on the show a

821
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:15,240
little bit I do like golden teachers for

822
00:29:13,398 --> 00:29:16,678
the fact that they're not super

823
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,839
introspective sometimes I like the

824
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:20,080
introspective right but sometimes I like

825
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:21,720
just feeling good and laughing with my

826
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:23,879
friends nothing wrong with that and the

827
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:26,000
thing with golden teachers is you can

828
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,720
eat so many of them and still have an

829
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,359
amazing trip whereas like you go penis

830
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,720
envy you eat too much of those and

831
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:33,199
you're not coming back for a while and

832
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,120
you're not wanting to eat mushrooms for

833
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,319
a while right can I brow your scissors

834
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:38,798
absolutely oh we had scissors here the

835
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:40,759
right the whole time I was like I got to

836
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:43,319
ask somebody for scissors and then you

837
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:44,839
know you look around become a I can't

838
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:45,879
open this I don't have scissors and I

839
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:48,199
did have scissors and you did have

840
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:50,240
scissors that's why we're a team you

841
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,480
brought the scissors and I noticed them

842
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,038
I'm going to try to make this as like

843
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:57,038
it's like ASMR right now

844
00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:59,200
right oh

845
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:02,119
yeah so it's not annoying if it's

846
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,399
intentional exactly yeah so I mean I

847
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:07,319
think there's something for everybody

848
00:30:03,398 --> 00:30:08,798
with cannabis and with mushrooms and our

849
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:10,798
body chemistries are so uniquely

850
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:12,679
different that with with these mushrooms

851
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:14,720
it's like some people I the new blue

852
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:16,159
Magnolias those are amazing I haven't

853
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,679
tried I got to be honest I haven't done

854
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:21,159
mushrooms in about a year I even know I

855
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:23,120
don't even know all the all the hip new

856
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:25,480
it's so funny that there's like mushroom

857
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:27,119
heads now like mushroom Chronos like oh

858
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:31,240
yeah bro I like to combine a golden

859
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:33,398
teacher with a I like 10 10% I micro do

860
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,278
three days a week and then I macro do

861
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:37,359
every other week I put cactus in there a

862
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:38,839
couple days and I mean this it's wild

863
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:41,119
I'm make an aloe vera dark chocolate

864
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:43,119
mushroom smoothie and it really really

865
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:44,639
cleans me out spiritually and physically

866
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:46,678
well I mean the spectrum of psychedelics

867
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,440
is so broad now when we were kids it was

868
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:50,240
like oh you want to eat some mushrooms

869
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,600
or take some acid right that was it that

870
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,000
was that was it there was go to San

871
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:55,519
Francisco you can go to Golden Gate Park

872
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,558
pick up some acid you know but but now

873
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:59,919
it's like oh what do you want to try you

874
00:30:57,558 --> 00:31:01,879
want to cros this this this this or this

875
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:04,360
or 10 other things I mean and it's nice

876
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:06,679
to have a choice it's nice to that you

877
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:09,240
can be aware because convenience but it

878
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:11,639
can complicate things and paralysis of

879
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,720
options but it's also nice to be like

880
00:31:11,638 --> 00:31:15,319
yeah I'm going to go uh to a concert and

881
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,079
I want to do some dancing so I'll take

882
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:18,720
some golden teachers right where it's

883
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:19,678
not you know it's not a little crazy

884
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,278
exactly I'm not going to sit there in

885
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,120
the corner thinking about choices that I

886
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:24,480
made missing my friends laughing and

887
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:26,918
crying you're not rethinking your life

888
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,599
ining which is's nothing wrong with that

889
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:31,600
no's time and a place for that for sure

890
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:33,398
yeah and maybe you know the giant Rave

891
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:35,519
with 15 of your friends who don't want

892
00:31:33,398 --> 00:31:38,398
to babysit your high ass totally is not

893
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,759
the time not the time for that I mean I

894
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:41,239
go on road trips sometimes where I take

895
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:43,038
a big dab before I go and I start

896
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:45,679
rethinking my life on the way there you

897
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:48,119
know I I may or may not have had an

898
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,519
existential moment on a Greyhound bus in

899
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:51,599
the middle of the night because the

900
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,759
cookie was way too strong for me and I'm

901
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:54,759
just sitting there thinking about all

902
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:56,119
these things and you're on a Greyhound

903
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:57,599
so you can't really turn to the stranger

904
00:31:56,119 --> 00:32:00,359
or the bus driver be like hey man I'm

905
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:01,719
really high right now you slow down can

906
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:04,439
we can we just stop for a minute can we

907
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:08,360
get snacks I need black pepper I can use

908
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,360
some sugar right

909
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:13,679
right like I said I just opened it uh I

910
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,480
think it may have been sitting around

911
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:20,480
for a while but based on the color yeah

912
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:22,639
I ain't gonna lie it was in the sun I do

913
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,120
I smell some ammonia I had a different

914
00:32:22,638 --> 00:32:25,359
right I had a different Super Silver

915
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:27,278
Haze but I smoked it before I could

916
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:28,918
bring it over and it was really super

917
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:30,038
silver hazy I'm just glad it's making a

918
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:31,320
comeback I thought that one might be

919
00:32:30,038 --> 00:32:32,960
exciting but I'm sorry that it's not

920
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:35,278
that's all right so I hope we can still

921
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,200
be friends I other things in my bag

922
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:40,880
though don't don't get it twisted nice I

923
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,880
do too yeah let's look at it yeah so in

924
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,679
fact I feel like all that buildup we had

925
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,120
to borrow scissors we had to cut the

926
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:47,440
thing open five different times I'm

927
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:49,479
still gonna we're gonna smell this one

928
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,159
first we're gonna do a blind tasting

929
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:53,759
with you

930
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:56,120
today like black

931
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:59,200
pepper that beta

932
00:32:56,119 --> 00:33:01,518
caropine definitely

933
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:04,480
definitely I can't really smell oine but

934
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,480
I feel like it would be in there

935
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:10,000
somewhere yeah this is grown in a

936
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,760
specific substrate and then this one is

937
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,720
grown in a different substrate all same

938
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:18,759
strain same exact coltivar from the same

939
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,919
exact mom grown side by side with the

940
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:22,480
one in this jar with a different

941
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,759
substrate do I get to know the stra at

942
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,798

refrigerator nice uh but I cannot vouch

953
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:52,038

00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:21,440
the 707 Headband cut to conception and

968
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,000

00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,480
so we're going to be seeing headband

970
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,960
really soon if you like that 707 now

971
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,519
there's so many different types of

972
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:35,639
headband

973
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:35,639
um out there some sort of gas no think

974
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,960
candy try the other ones and then then

975
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,760
you can make your decision it's not it's

976
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:44,480
not a gelato no no it's not a gelato oh

977
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,359
it's this it's the genetic that I talk

978
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,519
about the most on my show probably I got

979
00:34:46,358 --> 00:34:50,799
this infatuation with this candy

980
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:53,039
variety and all our Watchers know

981
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,839
exactly what I'm talking good for them

982
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:58,440
well whatever it is it's tasty as

983
00:34:55,838 --> 00:35:00,599
yeah man I can't

984
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:02,280
I'm sure what you say I be like oh

985
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:04,119
duh oh yeah we're gonna go

986
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,000
through all three of the jars and maybe

987
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:08,200
by the end you'll be like oh yeah I know

988
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,519
that or maybe I don't it is fruity it's

989
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:12,759
not a cherry cherry pie or a cherry cush

990
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:14,119
because there's too much gas involved

991
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:16,440
it's not the Gorilla Glue because it's

992
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:19,400
not spicy you

993
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:22,000

997
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:29,919
I'm sorry I should really pay more to

998
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,160
Old School you that's a good thing I

999
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,800
should pay more attention to weed gossip

1000
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:37,960
but also it's kind of funny I'm not

1001
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,760
really here to argue about who had and I

1002
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:42,000
get it like dog it's your legacy like if

1003
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,400
you worked for generations and years to

1004
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,079
perfect this one strain and everybody

1005
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,358
wants to get it and everybody says they

1006
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:49,160
had it everybody says they started first

1007
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:52,159
of course of course you're G to get

1008
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:54,559
fired up about it sometimes to me and

1009
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:58,239
this is just My Little Hippie ass

1010
00:35:54,559 --> 00:36:00,880
showing uh cannabis like juggling is

1011
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:02,199
open source yeah right of course

1012
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,240
somebody's going to have it somebody's

1013
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:05,039
going to you know there could be

1014
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:07,519
parallel Evolutions or somebody you

1015
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:09,960
never know how these things come about

1016
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:12,000
and and I love them all and I'm a fan of

1017
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:14,720
all the Styles but it's tough it's tough

1018
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,400
to be proprietary and and and and I feel

1019
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:20,279
like the Cannabis plan itself does not

1020
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:22,760
like uh people who are too

1021
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:24,760
proprietary yeah about it you know what

1022
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:26,880
I mean I think right that's how you end

1023
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:28,720
up with the Cavendish banana

1024
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,680
which is going to be pretty soon the

1025
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:32,318
only one we're really growing in any and

1026
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:33,679
I believe in Sharing but I also believe

1027
00:36:32,318 --> 00:36:35,079
in being a steward of the plant and

1028
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:37,199
giving it to the right people and not to

1029
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:39,079
the wrong people right so like there

1030
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:40,799
there's there's so many different

1031
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:43,240
options these days and you can give it

1032
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,519
to the wrong person believe me genetics

1033
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:47,919
can go in the get in the wrong hands

1034
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:50,000
unfortunately but I also believe that

1035
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,440
sharing is caring and sharing good

1036
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,079
genetics though everybody deserves

1037
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,119
access to Quality flour right and

1038
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:58,160
quality genetics that goes yeah I sell

1039
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:59,280

1045
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:12,000
more of a darker yeah right you know

1046
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:14,598

1047
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,800
of flavor and this one flavor are kind

1048
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:19,240
of the same

1049
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,560
soil that one of one of them soil I

1050
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:21,879
believe it's one actually are you sure

1051
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:24,358
there's no diesel in here because it's

1052
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:26,000
got that diesel mouth feel where you

1053
00:37:24,358 --> 00:37:28,318
know what I mean where you're a little

1054
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,679
coated it's candy

1055
00:37:28,318 --> 00:37:32,000
it's

1056
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:34,960
candy which candy is

1057
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,960
it you're going to tell me you're

1058
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,960
going to tell me I'm just GNA be

1059
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:44,118
like be easier if you smoked in a joint

1060
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,358
because down to the roach you tastes

1061
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:52,160
like candy you exhale you get candy this

1062
00:37:48,358 --> 00:37:55,838
not a strawberry no it's a starts with

1063
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:58,920
z gitt yes and ends with

1064
00:37:55,838 --> 00:38:00,519
z gitt

1065
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,838
I but it doesn't

1066
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:05,039
it's yes of course now it makes perfect

1067
00:38:02,838 --> 00:38:08,078
sense yeah yeah I always think of

1068
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:11,519
Skittles as a little more runy you know

1069
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:13,760
I mean a little more deep skunk in it

1070
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:16,358
some well and the beauty of Skittles is

1071
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,800
you can Harvest on day 51 to day 53 and

1072
00:38:16,358 --> 00:38:19,598
you get one expression you harvest on

1073
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,480
day 63 you get another expression I

1074
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,599
think this was probably harvested

1075
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,599
somewhere in the middle of that like day

1076
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:27,960
56 okay so you get a little bit of that

1077
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:30,079
gas turn to the side that's

1078
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,639
burn a little bit gas coating mouth

1079
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:35,079
Coating in this one yeah I mean I like

1080
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:39,118
them both I can't really pick one well I

1081
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:39,119
think there's one more that's

1082
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:45,679
in is it that door number two yes this

1083
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:48,719

1085
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:52,879
excited about this one I'm not going to

1086
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:54,200

pepper pepper and fruit yeah well and

1091
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,960
when you harvest Skittle at the right

1092
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:06,280
time when you harvest that cultivar you

1093

1169
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:50,640
cooking in any sort of skill set like

1170
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:52,760

confident doing podcast now I love doing

1181
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:20,838
podcast of course and I what I realized

1182
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:22,358
is podcasts are all about the guest it's

1183
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:23,838
not about the host it's how can you get

1184
00:42:22,358 --> 00:42:26,598
I don't know you talk a lot no I'm

1185
00:42:23,838 --> 00:42:28,558
kidding I'm kidding I do no I I I do

1186
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:30,519
talk a lot love talking and I love

1187
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:32,200
elevating my guest though I feel like

1188
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:34,280
it's all about highlighting your guest

1189
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:36,879
what they do I'm definitely elevated I

1190
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:39,960
feel like and it's probably a cumul

1191
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:42,160
cumulative effect yeah but um that third

1192
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:45,159
one seemed to kick everything else into

1193
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:46,598
overdrive it does right right so I don't

1194
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:49,118
know if you lined it up like that

1195
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:52,400
specifically yeah but uh we put DMT in

1196
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:54,160
the last one I'm joking I'm totally

1197
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:58,039
joking that would be funny if we did but

1198
00:42:54,159 --> 00:43:00,039
we would never do that DM Isle hilarious

1199
00:42:58,039 --> 00:43:01,800
yeah it would be until you started

1200
00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:03,599

Voltron do this little limited release a

1226
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,838
SE drop like

1227
00:43:58,199 --> 00:44:02,078
first I imagine you guys just you know

1228
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:04,119
in a helicopter just dropping seeds drop

1229
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:06,839
seeds not bombs absolutely pass joints

1230
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:08,559
not judgment yeah but uh but then I

1231
00:44:06,838 --> 00:44:11,759
realized it's like a shoe drop or

1232
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:14,760
whatever selling the seats we are

1233
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,760
selling it's not the WKRP turkey drop no

1234
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:18,440
it is not no by winess I thought weed

1235
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:20,000
seeds could fly we're sharing the seeds

1236
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:22,800
with the world and you know I do my

1237
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,119
share of giving back oh no I I wasn't uh

1238
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,519
I wasn't casting aspersions I was just

1239
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:29,200
high and visualizing you weren't

1240
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:30,880
gaslighting taking literally as

1241
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:33,480
Stoners do that's one of those things

1242
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:35,200
like when you're entertaining a room

1243
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:37,199
full of Stoners cuz you know I've done

1244
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:38,799
dispensaries and all the time it

1245
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:41,000
can be kind of challenging because they

1246
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,280
will take everything literally like if a

1247
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,960
comic goes yeah me and my girlfriend

1248

1252
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:55,880
bit is still good so don't worry right

1253
00:44:54,199 --> 00:44:58,118
you know but it's it's it's just one of

1254
00:44:55,880 --> 00:45:00,480
those things but yeah uh I forgot what I

you know I was on a cooking show yeah

1298
00:46:31,159 --> 00:46:35,239

1299
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:36,720
so I just started smoking weed in

1300
00:46:35,239 --> 00:46:38,598
college I was like I really like this

1301
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:40,879
weed and I come from a long line of

1302
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:42,960
activists so then I started like you

1303
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,920
know looking into it and and reading

1304
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:47,119
about activism of it and the history and

1305
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:49,280
then Jack Harris's book came out a

1306
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:52,960
little around there in the 90s I and I

1307
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:54,720
met um Debbie Goldsberry and Don from

1308
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:57,440
the Cannabis Action Network from back in

1309

here for this whole thing cuz to me

1311
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:04,240
canus legalization does a lot of things

1312
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,559
right it it helps cops be less racist

1313
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:07,679
because they can't just pull you over

1314
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:09,079
for weed yeah uh or they can't use it as

1315
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:10,719
a pretex to pull you over for weed it

1316
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:13,318
keeps people out of jail they search

1317

1442
00:51:28,838 --> 00:51:33,440
that they call ketchup

1443
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:36,240
yeah you don't like ketchup on your

1444
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:38,280
steak nor on my eggs nor on my baln

1445
00:51:36,239 --> 00:51:40,679
sandwiches nor on my Burgers nor on my

1446
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:41,920
fish or my potatoes yeah on the potatoes

1447
00:51:40,679 --> 00:51:43,919
especially I think that's a big one in

1448
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,079
America is don't ketchup with potatoes

1449
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,039
the Dutch put mayonnaise on their

1450
00:51:45,079 --> 00:51:49,400
potatoes so who are we who are we to to

1451
00:51:48,039 --> 00:51:51,119
talk Dutch mayonnaise is different too

1452
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,680
though I really like Japanese and I like

1453
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:55,480
Dutch mayonnaise Dutch mayonnaise sounds

1454
00:51:52,679 --> 00:51:57,039
like either a wrestler or a sex move it

1455
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:58,358
could be dangerous either

1456
00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:00,000
Dutch mayonnaise that's his signature

1457
00:51:58,358 --> 00:52:01,519
move is the Dutch mayonnaise that's why

1458
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,440
they call him Dutch mayonnaise yeah you

1459
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:05,039
got to watch out the BL the blue waffle

1460
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:08,440
and the Dutch mayonnaise gave the Dutch

1461
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:10,358
mayonnaise off the top rope it was over

1462
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:12,920
over they just said

1463
00:52:10,358 --> 00:52:15,078
damn because the Dutch so I like eggs a

1464
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:17,720
lot I've been working on egg salad

1465
00:52:15,079 --> 00:52:19,798
sandwiches Japanese style Korean style

1466
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:21,919
all that stuff there's a spot in

1467
00:52:19,798 --> 00:52:25,480
Sacramento called panes and they're

1468
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:27,838
mostly Italian y but they put a little

1469
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:31,400
curry powder in the egg salad sandwich

1470
00:52:27,838 --> 00:52:34,199
and it's just oh it's so good so curry

1471
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:36,960
with mayonnaise makes one of the best

1472
00:52:34,199 --> 00:52:38,358
aoli yes and I love it especially just

1473
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,960
where it's a hint of it where it just

1474
00:52:38,358 --> 00:52:42,960
it's it's slightly yellow but you get

1475
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:45,079
that Curry it lifts everything up right

1476
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:47,280
that's one of those on just a little

1477
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:50,839
something just a little yeah little SM I

1478
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:52,640
mean the world is about diversity and

1479
00:52:50,838 --> 00:52:54,119
differentiation from place to place I

1480
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:55,440
love that where you can go to someplace

1481
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:57,440
and they got something special like that

1482
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:59,200
where it's like wow just a little you

1483
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:01,119
like to have somebody put a Twist yeah

1484
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:02,480
right if I wanted everything to be

1485
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:04,318
exactly the same I would just go to

1486
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,679

1487
00:53:04,318 --> 00:53:07,519

00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,760
jalapenos and they have a little red uh

1533

use the red wine vinegar is it doesn't

1537
00:54:49,318 --> 00:54:53,318
let the strawberry lose its color it

1538
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:54,798
maintains the color so it has it's this

1539
00:54:53,318 --> 00:54:55,759
but you have to eat them 24 hours after

1540
00:54:54,798 --> 00:54:58,239
you make them I was going to say how

1541

1547
00:55:07,039 --> 00:55:10,798
max all right and they're spicy because

1548
00:55:09,559 --> 00:55:13,040
you slice that especially when you use

1549
00:55:10,798 --> 00:55:14,599
jalapenos and it gives you that

1550
00:55:13,039 --> 00:55:15,880
green jalapeno flavor with a little kick

1551

00:57:20,599 --> 00:57:24,640

1624
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:53,160

1635
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:25,400
talents on stage sometimes I think

1636
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:28,000
in in standup comedy we can forget that

1637
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:29,318
we have a lot of of skills you know but

1638
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,559
if you watch Like Richard Pryor like

1639
00:58:29,318 --> 00:58:33,159
he's acting his ass off yeah while he's

1640
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:35,599

Areno Hall was very funny yeah so Areno

1646
00:58:50,519 --> 00:58:54,880
one of the kids I grew up with my

1647
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:56,519
friend's younger brother was the guy the

1648
00:58:54,880 --> 00:59:00,200
kid that drove the I think it was a

1649
00:58:56,519 --> 00:59:02,400
Ferrari or Lamborghini on the in the the

1650
00:59:00,199 --> 00:59:04,118
intro to the show he's the one who

1651
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,599
stalled it out and they that was

1652
00:59:04,119 --> 00:59:06,960
basically he didn't do it on purpose but

1653
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:08,798
they ended up leaving it in because they

1654
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,519
thought it was funny because it's funny

1655
00:59:08,798 --> 00:59:12,318
yeah yeah yeah my friend that's what

1656
00:59:10,519 --> 00:59:15,400
happens sometimes the universe also has

1657
00:59:12,318 --> 00:59:17,679
a sense of humor does it does over and

1658
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:20,079
over and over again yeah yeah yeah and

1659
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:21,239
so then you know uh I'd been a comic

1660
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:23,200
maybe two years before starting to

1661
00:59:21,239 --> 00:59:25,598
become like a more serious cannabis

1662
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:28,598
activist and so I'm always like let me

1663
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:30,440
host your thing let me MC for this we we

1664
00:59:28,599 --> 00:59:32,000
used to throw the occasional cannabis

1665
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:34,400
Comedy Festival which is what we call it

1666
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,960
cuz sometimes we wait a year and throw

1667
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:37,559
it sometimes we throw two or three at a

1668
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:39,240
year sometimes we'd wait two years to

1669
00:59:37,559 --> 00:59:41,599
throw one so it wasn't like the annual

1670
00:59:39,239 --> 00:59:45,000
it was the occasional totally the

1671

occasional Canabis Comedy Festival um

1672

club called the pepper tree out there

1705
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:56,079

01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,159
everywhere man every Show's a good show

1709
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:03,960
bro if you do you like small more

1710
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:05,719
intimate shows or the bigger shows I

1711
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:07,798
like them all I just like to stand on

1712
01:01:05,719 --> 01:01:09,439
stage and talk man I'm kind of funny and

1713
01:01:07,798 --> 01:01:12,519
you know it's a different it's a

1714
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:14,440
different uh approach yeah and and how

1715
01:01:12,519 --> 01:01:15,759
you do the things you know what I mean

1716
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:17,280
sure uh when you're doing the smaller

1717
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:18,520
show you can talk a little faster

1718
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:21,640
especially if they're all right up on

1719
01:01:18,519 --> 01:01:23,960
you you can make smaller faces but more

1720
01:01:21,639 --> 01:01:26,318
intricate faces yeah you know what I

1721
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:27,480
mean right because everybody can see

1722
01:01:26,318 --> 01:01:29,358
you're you know it's like watching a

1723
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:31,880
close-up magician at that point and then

1724
01:01:29,358 --> 01:01:33,798
if you're at the big spot where it's 25

1725
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:35,240
200 people or whatever you got to talk a

1726
01:01:33,798 --> 01:01:37,038
little slower you got to wait a little

1727
01:01:35,239 --> 01:01:38,519
longer because that joke's got to go all

1728
01:01:37,039 --> 01:01:40,559
the way to the back of that giant

1729
01:01:38,519 --> 01:01:43,838
freaking Auditorium and then come all

1730
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:47,200
the way back to you yeah you know you

1731
01:01:43,838 --> 01:01:49,318
have to make uh bigger faces and maybe

1732
01:01:47,199 --> 01:01:50,639
fewer of them because I mean now with

1733
01:01:49,318 --> 01:01:52,759
the modern technology they got the

1734
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:55,159
bigger screen so it's easier yeah to

1735
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:56,720
treat a bigger room like a smaller room

1736
01:01:55,159 --> 01:01:58,118
so sure

1737
01:01:56,719 --> 01:02:00,159
yeah you see these guys doing stadiums

1738
01:01:58,119 --> 01:02:02,798
and they have these huge jumbotrons or

1739
01:02:00,159 --> 01:02:05,278
whatever it is comedy needs face it does

1740
01:02:02,798 --> 01:02:07,159
it's a physical activity right so you

1741
01:02:05,278 --> 01:02:08,920
you really need a lot of the cues you

1742
01:02:07,159 --> 01:02:12,598
get from the eyes or from the from the

1743
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:14,400
face or whatever so totally it it helps

1744
01:02:12,599 --> 01:02:15,559
it helps you mentioned although I used

1745
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,680
to listen to albums like this all the

1746
01:02:15,559 --> 01:02:19,119
time and imagine their faces you know oh

1747
01:02:17,679 --> 01:02:21,558
yeah I love doing that back in the day

1748
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:24,358
with vinyl comedy of the theater of the

1749
01:02:21,559 --> 01:02:26,400
mind yeah yeah I mean I loved reading

1750
01:02:24,358 --> 01:02:27,920
books and imagining what was happening

1751
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,680
you know we have these movies now and

1752
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:31,278
everybody's so focused on movies but you

1753
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:33,000
know I I also love books read the book

1754
01:02:31,278 --> 01:02:34,440
you can put the movie in your head yeah

1755
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,760
I would cast the whole thing I'm like

1756
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:38,039
this one's going to be an animated

1815
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:49,039
growing cannabis because he thought his

1816
01:04:47,079 --> 01:04:50,559
sister had cancer and he had heard that

1817
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:52,640
it could help so he started growing

1818
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:55,319
cannabis and then it turned out he was

1819
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:57,719
really good at it he was really good at

1820
01:04:55,318 --> 01:05:01,358
growing weed man and uh he used to grow

1821
01:04:57,719 --> 01:05:03,480
great fantastic weed and uh he got

1822
01:05:01,358 --> 01:05:07,598
busted back in the day he had opened a

1823
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:08,639
little uh dispensary um he was selling

1824
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:11,240
because his weed was so good he was

1825
01:05:08,639 --> 01:05:13,000
selling to all the clubs of course he

1826
01:05:11,239 --> 01:05:15,118
got busted by the feds

1827
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:18,880
twice right and I was like man why don't

1828
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:20,960
you quit he's like I'm crazy this is an

1829
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:22,440
important thing to do right and I was

1830
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:24,639
like yeah all right man but just be

1831
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:26,440
careful and then uh one day the DEA

1832
01:05:24,639 --> 01:05:29,480
showed up and just scared off they were

1833
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:30,760
like just you need to quit right now wow

1834
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:32,079
and so he disappeared for a while and

1835
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:35,240
then he came back and then he passed

1836
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:38,079
away well it's so sad so sad yeah I mean

1837
01:05:35,239 --> 01:05:40,798
welcome to sad talk James listen to

1838
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:43,599
James loud talking quietly about s sad

1839
01:05:40,798 --> 01:05:45,000
things yeah yeah yeah I mean it's funny

1840
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:46,559
because I think if you were to look a

1841
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,480
hundred years in the future you would

1842
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:51,240
think it was kind of crazy this whole

1843
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:53,358
thing that's gone on with prohibition of

1844
01:05:51,239 --> 01:05:54,679
cannabis you know you look 100 years in

1845
01:05:53,358 --> 01:05:56,278
the past too I think people would think

1846
01:05:54,679 --> 01:05:57,798
it was crazy why people act like that

1847
01:05:56,278 --> 01:06:00,239
how could we have been so blind why are

1848
01:05:57,798 --> 01:06:02,920
we we so shortsighted when then they

1849
01:06:00,239 --> 01:06:04,719
watch the James live podcast and H the

1850
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:07,480
answer is usually either racism or

1851
01:06:04,719 --> 01:06:09,278
sexism right that's usually the answer

1852
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:12,318
to why things are not how you want them

1853
01:06:09,278 --> 01:06:14,960
to be right yeah and I know it's hard

1854
01:06:12,318 --> 01:06:16,239
for some people to look at that but yeah

1855
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:18,400
that's generally the answer if you go

1856
01:06:16,239 --> 01:06:19,919
way back it's pretty complex too there's

1857
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:22,000
like the financial it's pretty simple

1858
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:24,159
generally it's either racism or sexism

1859
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,358
yeah a lot of times it's just racism

1860
01:06:24,159 --> 01:06:28,558
especially in America

1861
01:06:26,358 --> 01:06:30,880
it's really weird and I'm I'm sure

1862
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:32,839
you'll probably get some comments and uh

1863
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:35,519
when I'm watching this on YouTube I will

1864
01:06:32,838 --> 01:06:36,719
try to chime in if you remain cogent and

1865
01:06:35,519 --> 01:06:39,679
don't lose your mind we're going to have

1866
01:06:36,719 --> 01:06:42,199
a reasonable and a reasoned and audite

1867
01:06:39,679 --> 01:06:44,558
debate don't get up here just talking

1868
01:06:42,199 --> 01:06:46,519
all willy-nilly but a lot of times in

1869
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:52,559
America the reason cannabis was against

1870
01:06:46,519 --> 01:06:55,679
the law was racism 100% 100% yeah 100%

1871
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:57,798
yeah right uh you can take you yeah it's

1872
01:06:55,679 --> 01:07:00,480
complex as it is you can break it down

1873
01:06:57,798 --> 01:07:02,480
right all the way down to racism I agree

1874
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:05,480
100% right that's that's the that is the

1875
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:08,119
reason yeah that's the exact reason yep

1876
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:11,798
right why a lot of cannabis laws were so

1877
01:07:08,119 --> 01:07:14,798
strict yeah racism which is funny

1878
01:07:11,798 --> 01:07:17,599
because black people smoke weed at a

1879
01:07:14,798 --> 01:07:20,838
little smaller rate than white people

1880
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:22,599
yeah but whatever right so anyway moving

1881
01:07:20,838 --> 01:07:25,159
on moving on I mean I think these are

1882
01:07:22,599 --> 01:07:27,559
important topics for my show though so

1883
01:07:25,159 --> 01:07:28,759
so as I'm here listen I'll come on every

1884
01:07:27,559 --> 01:07:31,519
week we'll just have a little serious

1885
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:34,520
debate for 15 minutes 15 serious minutes

1886
01:07:31,519 --> 01:07:37,079
with wum and James loud absolutely you

1887
01:07:34,519 --> 01:07:39,759
know but but it's these kind of things

1888
01:07:37,079 --> 01:07:41,640
that that change people's perspectives

1889
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:43,880
right and I think true if you don't have

1890
01:07:41,639 --> 01:07:47,798
the hard conversations how do you change

1891
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:49,240
things amen amen so yeah and and I love

1892
01:07:47,798 --> 01:07:51,239
talking about stuff I love talking about

1893
01:07:49,239 --> 01:07:52,879
the hard conversations I think there's

1894
01:07:51,239 --> 01:07:54,838
so many we can talk about here's a

1895
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:56,318
here's a hard question for you yeah cold

1896
01:07:54,838 --> 01:07:59,558
water hash or

1897
01:07:56,318 --> 01:08:01,239
BHO so this is a this yeah I'm going to

1898
01:07:59,559 --> 01:08:03,720
get a little bit of hate for this

1899
01:08:01,239 --> 01:08:05,358
one I asked the tough questions man this

1900
01:08:03,719 --> 01:08:09,199
is the tough question question so if we

1901
01:08:05,358 --> 01:08:12,558
look at BHO BHO as far as processed with

1902
01:08:09,199 --> 01:08:15,519
solvent with butane you actually get the

1903
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:18,798
water soluble Tarpin that you don't get

1904
01:08:15,519 --> 01:08:21,238
from bubble hash now as far as for a

1905
01:08:18,798 --> 01:08:23,158
flavor M I think that there's nothing

1906
01:08:21,238 --> 01:08:25,919
wrong with butane I enjoy the flavor of

1907
01:08:23,158 --> 01:08:28,879
BHO if it's processed and made correctly

1908
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:30,759
with I think BHO is an amazing product

1909
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:33,239
minimal amount of explosions yeah and I

1910
01:08:30,759 --> 01:08:35,600
mean even minimal amount of explosions

1911
01:08:33,238 --> 01:08:38,479
eyebrows all those things intact yes

1912
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:40,520
there was a a trend when when uh when

1913
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:43,198
blasting at home or whatever first

1914
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:44,560
became a thing you know the dab heads be

1915
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:46,519
like oh yeah man I'm doing that be like

1916
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:47,960
man it's dangerous so what happens like

1917
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:49,839
someone learn about it they learn the

1918
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:51,798
technique they get into it they set

1919
01:08:49,838 --> 01:08:53,679
themselves on fire and then they quit

1920
01:08:51,798 --> 01:08:56,278
yeah San Francisco there was multiple

1921
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:59,319
there was Hotel fires it

1922
01:08:56,279 --> 01:09:01,199
I've had I me to about it but I think

1923
01:08:59,319 --> 01:09:03,319
it's honest you know and and people

1924
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:05,798
people had accidents do yeah you know

1925
01:09:03,319 --> 01:09:07,880
but as far as like a product I think the

1926
01:09:05,798 --> 01:09:10,960
product BHO is a good product I think

1927
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:13,640
bubblehash and rosin are great too uh

1928
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:15,719
but they're not true solvent list water

1929
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:18,119
is the universal solvent talked about on

1930
01:09:15,719 --> 01:09:21,239
my show y there's nothing wrong I really

1931
01:09:18,119 --> 01:09:23,759
enjoy those uh now static hash is I'm

1932
01:09:21,238 --> 01:09:26,358
super stoked on the static hash lay this

1933
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:27,880
lay this process on the L so static hash

1934
01:09:26,359 --> 01:09:31,920
is where you you know you can do it the

1935
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:35,798
simplest way to do it is to put the your

1936
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:37,520
your basically your ke or your sift on

1937
01:09:35,798 --> 01:09:39,319
on a piece of parchment and you rub it

1938
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:42,839
with the glove and then whatever sticks

1939
01:09:39,319 --> 01:09:45,239
to the glove you brush it off into a

1940
01:09:42,838 --> 01:09:46,880
bowl and you know it's it's basically

1941
01:09:45,238 --> 01:09:49,318
using static you can go over it this how

1942
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:52,119
to get like the tiniest little all the

1943
01:09:49,319 --> 01:09:53,719
it magnetically draws the glove and then

1944
01:09:52,119 --> 01:09:55,519
so you're getting this product uh

1945
01:09:53,719 --> 01:09:59,039
there's machines that do it that's like

1946
01:09:55,520 --> 01:10:01,600
a super fancy finger hash it is it's

1947
01:09:59,039 --> 01:10:03,000
like and so so now we're Reinventing the

1948
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:05,360
wheel we're going back to what we did

1949
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:08,000
years ago our static hash is lovingly

1950
01:10:05,359 --> 01:10:10,759
handcrafted by only Superior people with

1951
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:13,640
small yet delicate hands they wave the

1952
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:15,600
static and they brush we use a oh yeah

1953
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:17,280
ostrich plume yeah and they actually

1954
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:20,480
have machines to do with plates

1955
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:21,840
ergonomically Mag plates right yeah and

1956
01:10:20,479 --> 01:10:23,599
yeah I'm I get excited about that

1957
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:25,000
because that is a true solventless

1958
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:27,960
product you're not running water so

1959
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:30,000
you're getting getting a you prefer a

1960

of the ones before the 2000s you know

2102

2103
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:54,560
time ago but there was some there were

2104
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:56,639

2112
01:16:12,079 --> 01:16:16,158
know what it was but I used to get this

2113
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:18,960
from my boy I just call it magic Harvest

2114
01:16:16,158 --> 01:16:20,960
because my homie knew somebody in

2115
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:22,439
Portland who grew he's retired now so

2116
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:24,760
don't go looking for him but he would

2117
01:16:22,439 --> 01:16:26,919
Harvest on the solstices and the Equinox

2118
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:29,360
right cuz like he had it super hippie

2119
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:31,760
dialed in on his indoor and it was

2120
01:16:29,359 --> 01:16:34,599
so flavorful and the high was super

2121
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:35,840
Pleasant and it was just stinky yeah

2122
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:37,280
like it was stinky like I'm driving it

2123
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:40,159
down from California I got it in like

2124
01:16:37,279 --> 01:16:42,800
two Ziplocs in a plastic thing wrapped

2125
01:16:40,158 --> 01:16:44,479
in another ziplock and my car still yeah

2126
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:46,400
still like I had a little bit in my

2127
01:16:44,479 --> 01:16:49,759
jacket and my home girl from across the

2128
01:16:46,399 --> 01:16:51,599
gym was like what dog is that you right

2129
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:54,000
I made a friend because the next door

2130
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:56,120
neighbor smelled us smoking it and he

2131
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:59,039
came over he's like hey hey what's

2132
01:16:56,119 --> 01:17:00,519
up I got to see what's going on yeah we

2133
01:16:59,039 --> 01:17:03,800
used to have to put it in coolers now

2134
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:05,880
obviously they have bags that that are

2135
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:07,719
resistant but coolers were a great way

2136
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:10,119
to transport stuff back in the day D but

2137
01:17:07,719 --> 01:17:11,439
I'm saying like we tried I you could it

2138
01:17:10,119 --> 01:17:13,198
was just stinky it was just one of those

2139
01:17:11,439 --> 01:17:16,519
on some of the weed was back just one of

2140
01:17:13,198 --> 01:17:17,960
those on the weed back in the 90s when I

2141
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:20,360

why put

2187
01:18:55,639 --> 01:19:01,480
yeah but yeah it's a WiFi type zbx which

2188
01:18:59,639 --> 01:19:03,000
is a skittles back cross all right and

2189
01:19:01,479 --> 01:19:04,439
so you get the best of both world you

2190
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
get the candy and you get the gas and

2191
01:19:04,439 --> 01:19:07,759
it's definitely heavy on the gas that

2192
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:11,198
nose burning gas with a little bit of

2193
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:13,960
great color great structure great effect

2194
01:19:11,198 --> 01:19:17,359
how much how much emphas emphasis yeah

2195
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:18,800
do you place on color like are you

2196
01:19:17,359 --> 01:19:20,719
always trying to get a little pink a

2197
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:22,760
purple in it or do you sometimes I mean

2198
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:24,880
train wreck is just bright green okay so

2199
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:27,760
here's my thought on the whole process

2200
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:29,520
on me the market loves purple right now

2201
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:30,600
the market always love purple well there

2202
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:32,840
was a time where you couldn't sell

2203
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:34,280
purple to save your life purple Cadillac

2204
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:35,159
there was GDP and then purple C I

2205
01:19:34,279 --> 01:19:36,920
remember having problems with purple

2206
01:19:35,158 --> 01:19:39,279
Cadillac well I never I never smoked it

2207
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:40,800
but yeah and so there was a point where

2208
01:19:39,279 --> 01:19:43,158
GDP came out everybody loved it and all

2209
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:44,960
a sudden everyone hates it right and so

2210
01:19:43,158 --> 01:19:47,079
it's made the with cookies it brought

2211
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:49,039
the color back but I feel like if you're

2212
01:19:47,079 --> 01:19:51,119
pheno hunting and you're really going

2213
01:19:49,039 --> 01:19:53,800
through stuff and you look at the purple

2214
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:55,198
feno versus the Green feno in a progyny

2215
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:57,679
of a bunch of different

2216
01:19:55,198 --> 01:20:00,599
siblings yeah the ones that are louder

2217
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:02,279
are going to be more green right I find

2218
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:04,360
a lot of times yeah you're correct and I

2219
01:20:02,279 --> 01:20:06,759
also find a lot of times that if it's

2220
01:20:04,359 --> 01:20:10,119
too purple yeah like the high will be

2221
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:11,560
nice but it'll be shortlived short lived

2222
01:20:10,119 --> 01:20:12,800
like I don't know cuz they're picking it

2223
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:15,880
early to keep the purple I don't know

2224
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:17,840
what's going on but a lot of times that

2225
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:19,560
purple but a lot of times that purple

2226
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:21,840
the high doesn't last as long as you

2227
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:23,400
think it's going to last as you get with

2228
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:24,960
maybe something the same way in green I

2229
01:20:23,399 --> 01:20:26,359
don't know why that is I know I think

2230
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:27,840
it's very cultivar dependent some

2231
01:20:26,359 --> 01:20:29,359
cultivars are meant to be purple and a

2232
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:31,199
lot of people try to force their to

2233
01:20:29,359 --> 01:20:32,559
be purple and that's no good what what

2234
01:20:31,198 --> 01:20:36,039
beet you can't just put beet juice in

2235
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:37,560
your water no let's go with cold temps

2236
01:20:36,039 --> 01:20:39,880
let's put ice on the plants we're going

2237
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:41,760
to freeze it throw in some beet juice

2238
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:42,920
yeah we're going to do all the things oh

2239
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:45,320
it's like whatever it takes to get it

2240
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:46,840
purple because purple is what sells and

2241
01:20:45,319 --> 01:20:50,039
that mentality

2242
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:51,840
is it's here but you still keep an eye

2243
01:20:50,039 --> 01:20:57,960
on color when you're picking fenos or do

2244
01:20:51,840 --> 01:21:00,760
you just % of what I TPS I want effect

2245
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:01,840
effect right but at the same time T well

2246
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:03,639
effect and turps are two different

2247
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:05,480
things I onage yeah you want the

2248
01:21:03,639 --> 01:21:07,760
Entourage but how does it make you feel

2249
01:21:05,479 --> 01:21:09,439
but really we go through and take the

2250
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:11,800
loudest smelling stuff we smoke

2251
01:21:09,439 --> 01:21:12,960
everything with all those 600 we had day

2252
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:14,440
like literally everybody smoked

2253
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:16,079
everything listen I can help if you need

2254
01:21:14,439 --> 01:21:18,559
some help I'm a former judge of the

2255
01:21:16,079 --> 01:21:21,719
emerald cup my rates are very reasonable

2256
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:23,480
yeah yeah we pay in weed yeah so we we

2257
01:21:21,719 --> 01:21:25,520
we basically sit around and talk about

2258
01:21:23,479 --> 01:21:27,519
it and we we fill out forms right with

2259
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:28,639
all this stuff you have to we're really

2260
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:30,960
you're taking it seriously we're taking

2261
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:32,520
it very seriously because we're trying

2262
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:34,279
to find that next new winner and it

2263
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:35,679
takes a lot of work and energy and you

2264
01:21:34,279 --> 01:21:36,920
can't just grow it out once you have to

2265
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:38,239
grow it out another time and then

2266
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:41,600
compare to the first time now let me ask

2267
01:21:38,238 --> 01:21:43,959
you this sure on uh on average how many

2268
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:47,039
seasons will will we will assume a

2269
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:50,000
season is 12 to 14 weeks uh does it take

2270
01:21:47,039 --> 01:21:53,359
for you to get a good finished pheno

2271
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:55,840
from so you started with 600 so maybe

2272
01:21:53,359 --> 01:21:57,559
two months later you have 60 right so on

2273
01:21:55,840 --> 01:22:00,079
that first batch you're growing and out

2274
01:21:57,560 --> 01:22:02,679
of those 60 we have Superstars already I

2275
01:22:00,079 --> 01:22:04,479
know you already have five five you like

2276
01:22:02,679 --> 01:22:05,719
I would say we have 10 out of those that

2277
01:22:04,479 --> 01:22:07,479
are superstars where I know they're

2278
01:22:05,719 --> 01:22:09,319
going to be special okay I already know

2279
01:22:07,479 --> 01:22:11,158
my lines anyway so we already knew going

2280
01:22:09,319 --> 01:22:12,359
in that we wanted to pop more of these

2281
01:22:11,158 --> 01:22:14,039
than other ones because there's going to

2282
01:22:12,359 --> 01:22:17,000
be winners you know my drips that you

2283
01:22:14,039 --> 01:22:20,039
can get online there was 20 things and

2284
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:21,880
out of the 20 15 were Keepers where it's

2285
01:22:20,039 --> 01:22:24,279
like we got to regrow 15 of these

2286
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:25,639
they're so good that's very rare a lot

2287
01:22:24,279 --> 01:22:27,920
of times times I'll pop a 100 and we

2288
01:22:25,639 --> 01:22:29,119
might keep two okay you know so and it

2289
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:31,480
just depends on how well you know your

2290
01:22:29,119 --> 01:22:33,119
line what you're breeding for so you got

2291
01:22:31,479 --> 01:22:36,718
that you're breeding let's say we're

2292
01:22:33,119 --> 01:22:38,920
breeding for uh seeds and cuts or seeds

2293
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:40,359
well let's say we're we can breed for

2294
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:41,679
commercial viability what's going to

2295
01:22:40,359 --> 01:22:43,759
work on the commercial Market that's

2296
01:22:41,679 --> 01:22:46,480
candy gas that yields really well that

2297
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:48,119
that's molden mildew resistant right all

2298
01:22:46,479 --> 01:22:49,919
those things are important quick quick

2299
01:22:48,119 --> 01:22:51,158
finish finishing is important no quick

2300
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:52,840
finishing will make you more money

2301
01:22:51,158 --> 01:22:55,079
because people want let's say you have

2302
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:57,440
something that finishes in 45 days yeah

2303
01:22:55,079 --> 01:22:59,119
you can get nine rips per year nine

2304
01:22:57,439 --> 01:23:01,039
Harvest per year right and so there's

2305
01:22:59,119 --> 01:23:03,359
value in something like that and now if

2306
01:23:01,039 --> 01:23:05,840
you have something that finishes in 42

2307
01:23:03,359 --> 01:23:08,238
to 45 days which is very rare isn't that

2308
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:10,880
fast it is but it's not impossible but

2309
01:23:08,238 --> 01:23:13,238
we have one that finishes in 42 days to

2310
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:16,920
45 days they you get three pounds of

2311
01:23:13,238 --> 01:23:19,119
light it has over 20% T has 25 how tall

2312
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:22,000
is it is it bushy it's bushy but it's

2313
01:23:19,119 --> 01:23:23,840
very vigorous and it's also purple right

2314
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:26,039
and so how's how's the mold resistance

2315
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:27,639
on a bushy fast gr see the thing is is

2316
01:23:26,039 --> 01:23:30,479
with does have time to get mold it

2317
01:23:27,639 --> 01:23:31,840
doesn't have time right and so these

2318
01:23:30,479 --> 01:23:33,959
things have a lot of commercial

2319
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:36,480
viability it's far as is the tur profile

2320
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:39,840
the best no but it's really high in THC

2321
01:23:36,479 --> 01:23:41,959
so for processing for extraction when

2322
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:43,600
we're processing for hash it's a really

2323
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:46,039
good one right and it has potential for

2324
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:47,800
that so there's different that's an old

2325
01:23:46,039 --> 01:23:52,359
school one that is a great old school

2326
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:54,880

2327
01:23:52,359 --> 01:23:55,799
the vortex I don't remember the vortex

2328
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:58,639

also remember the sage the sa sativa

2331
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:06,359
Afghani genetic equivalent yeah from

2332
01:24:03,639 --> 01:24:07,920
Adam Dunn genetic equilibrium yeah THC

2333
01:24:06,359 --> 01:24:10,000
the old school DJ Short

2334
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:11,440

don't remember New York blueberry diesel

2342
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:28,440

2343
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:30,639
diesel on the exhale I haven't seen it

2344
01:24:28,439 --> 01:24:32,879

yeah strawberry Durban diesel oh that

2346
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:37,520

2350
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:45,960
who's got the seed Vault you probably

2351
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:47,280
have something I have a really special

2352
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:49,079
seed Vault there's all kinds of stuff

2353
01:24:47,279 --> 01:24:51,639
from all over I have land if I were to

2354
01:24:49,079 --> 01:24:53,479
write a heist movie we would just be uh

2355
01:24:51,639 --> 01:24:55,279
taking some samples from somebody's seed

2356
01:24:53,479 --> 01:24:57,638
Vault yeah

2357
01:24:55,279 --> 01:24:59,439
well we got seeds we got lots I noticed

2358
01:24:57,639 --> 01:25:02,840
is that what those are yeah those are

2359
01:24:59,439 --> 01:25:04,960
all the BC and dgr seeds oh really so

2360
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:06,360
which one is this one yeah that one is

2361
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:07,719
uh most of those don't germinate and

2362
01:25:06,359 --> 01:25:09,559
that's why weuse we run them through a

2363
01:25:07,719 --> 01:25:11,239
machine you feed them to the parrots you

2364
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:13,000
could but we use them as a prop it's

2365
01:25:11,238 --> 01:25:15,439
like you put a hole in them put the hole

2366
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:17,079
in the playing deck yeah at the uh the

2367
01:25:15,439 --> 01:25:18,879
card deck at the casino and then you can

2368
01:25:17,079 --> 01:25:21,960
just take them home with the old ones

2369
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:23,239
exactly okay cuz I was wondering yeah

2370
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:25,039
and then we got coffee there so when

2371
01:25:23,238 --> 01:25:26,279
you're smelling and you're feno hunting

2372
01:25:25,039 --> 01:25:28,760
you're going through these things you

2373
01:25:26,279 --> 01:25:30,880
can clean your pallet of course got to

2374
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:32,600
love coffee I know you do a lot of feno

2375
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:34,440
hunting and whatnot in your life but do

2376
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:35,760
you also judge events and whatnot like

2377
01:25:34,439 --> 01:25:37,638
I've judged for High Times in the

2378
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:40,360
emerald cup and some of the early early

2379
01:25:37,639 --> 01:25:44,000
cups I used to throw I threw the LA

2380
01:25:40,359 --> 01:25:45,920
medical cannabis cup uh I think we threw

2381
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:49,679
three of them in LA in the early the mid

2382
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:51,118
2000 like 2005 through 2005 to 2007 I

2383
01:25:49,679 --> 01:25:52,760
think that was a good time well and I

2384
01:25:51,118 --> 01:25:55,399
throw events I did the Dabo last year

2385
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:58,400

2427

2496

Stoners are always cuter than old drunks

that is for for sure yeah you know I

2498
01:29:56,039 --> 01:30:01,439
it's just the argument it's hard to

2499
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:03,079
argue the the quality of life with

2500
01:30:01,439 --> 01:30:04,879
cannabis versus quality of life with

2501
01:30:03,079 --> 01:30:06,719
alcohol I mean listen everything not

2502
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:10,560
everything's for everybody some

2503
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:12,840
people can be fairly healthy responsible

2504
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:14,199
drinkers yeah you know it's a social

2505
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:16,719
thing the French the French are pretty

2506
01:30:14,198 --> 01:30:18,079
good at it yeah I mean I'm I'm not a I'm

2507
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:19,439

2508
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:22,198
drinker I will definitely have a beer on

2509
01:30:19,439 --> 01:30:23,839
a hot day or every once in a while oh I

2510
01:30:22,198 --> 01:30:26,479
got a full bar over here every once in a

2511
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:28,400
while you should not maybe not should

2512
01:30:26,479 --> 01:30:30,559
not for everybody but every once in a

2513
01:30:28,399 --> 01:30:33,439
while the right move is to get a little

2514
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:35,440
hammered yeah I think it's great but not

2515
01:30:33,439 --> 01:30:37,158
necessarily you're doing that every day

2516
01:30:35,439 --> 01:30:38,879
or every weekend no but if I go to Spain

2517

01:31:26,399 --> 01:31:29,920
my city I your city I spend a lot of

2545
01:31:28,319 --> 01:31:31,479
time well it could be your city too but

2546
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:33,359
it's definitely my city if I think of

2547
01:31:31,479 --> 01:31:35,799
all the cities out there I uh San

2548
01:31:33,359 --> 01:31:38,799
Francisco Barcelona those are my cities

2549
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:40,639
I I often start looking for apartments I

2550
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:42,039
don't think I would ever move but I

2551
01:31:40,639 --> 01:31:43,600
often sometimes when I'm there I'm like

2552
01:31:42,039 --> 01:31:47,118
well I could live in this part of town I

2553
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:50,560
could have a little p right over here

2554
01:31:47,118 --> 01:31:53,039
where not like it used to be bro well

2555
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:54,719
it's still pretty affordable so so drink

2556
01:31:53,039 --> 01:31:57,198
it's no longer cheap still inexpensive

2557
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:59,039
when Co hit we were looking at signing

2558
01:31:57,198 --> 01:32:00,678
like literally the day before they were

2559
01:31:59,039 --> 01:32:02,960
getting the paperwork typed up for an

2560
01:32:00,679 --> 01:32:05,840
apartment yeah it was I think it was

2561
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:07,920
either 15 or ,200 EUR a month which is

2562
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:08,920
very that's very affordable probably had

2563
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:11,279
a little

2564
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:13,399
balcona it's like walking distance to

2565
01:32:11,279 --> 01:32:15,079
everything yeah but that's way cheaper

2566
01:32:13,399 --> 01:32:17,079
than here you know and that's like a

2567
01:32:15,079 --> 01:32:20,960
vacation apartment basically right right

2568
01:32:17,079 --> 01:32:22,679
right and luckily Co happened when it

2569
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:25,039
did and not the day before because I

2570
01:32:22,679 --> 01:32:27,639
would have signed that lease and

2571
01:32:25,039 --> 01:32:30,359
stuck but as it happened we didn't end

2572
01:32:27,639 --> 01:32:32,079
up sign signing the lease uh I do love

2573
01:32:30,359 --> 01:32:33,759

haven't been to but uh Barcelona's just

2605
01:33:42,079 --> 01:33:45,760
such a great City and everything's very

2606
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:48,880
convenient to get to dude you can walk

2607
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:51,000
around everywhere you can uh you can

2608

find a like so many good local weed

2609
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,319
clubs because it's technically illegal

2610
01:33:52,158 --> 01:33:55,319
so you're just supposed to smoke in the

2611
01:33:53,319 --> 01:33:57,279
club so the the best although Barcelona

2612
01:33:55,319 --> 01:33:59,479
isn't as strict as other spots of Spain

2613
01:33:57,279 --> 01:34:02,359

all my compatriots would be mad at me

2637
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:56,000
and my flirting opportunities would be

2638
01:34:53,198 --> 01:34:58,399
severely diminished right right

2639
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:00,520

2640
01:34:58,399 --> 01:35:02,479

2656
01:35:34,158 --> 01:35:36,960
always eat the octopus because I feel

2657
01:35:35,679 --> 01:35:38,600
bad because I feel like we should be

2658
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:40,039
learning from them more than we should

2659
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:41,880
be eating them you watch the octopus

2660

teacher no even before then oh really

2661
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:46,199
even before then they're clearly they're

2662
01:35:44,359 --> 01:35:47,960
intelligent sentient beings right

2663
01:35:46,198 --> 01:35:49,759
clearly clearly so we're just kind of

2664
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:52,279
being not cows are not intelligent

2665
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:53,880
sentient beings as well no and like so I

2666
01:35:52,279 --> 01:35:56,198
have this relationship with alpaca I

2667
01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:57,880
worked on a farm we we had a farm up in

2668

Lake County worked on there and they had

2669
01:35:57,880 --> 01:36:01,440

2670
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:02,840
a relationship with them they would know

2671
01:36:01,439 --> 01:36:04,359

Charis all that stuff but you know that

2743
01:38:30,599 --> 01:38:36,239
Charis the best chars comes from the the

2744
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:38,039
tender hands right I have a bit in my

2745
01:38:36,238 --> 01:38:39,279
ACT where I talk about the best hash of

2746
01:38:38,039 --> 01:38:41,039
course made from the thighs of the

2747
01:38:39,279 --> 01:38:42,840
virgins after they run naked through the

2748
01:38:41,039 --> 01:38:44,960
Cannabis Fields three days before the

2749
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:47,480
Harvest but it's hard to find a virgin

2750
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:49,279
out here yeah but um so I I would like

2751
01:38:47,479 --> 01:38:52,238
that to happen and and you see you see

2752
01:38:49,279 --> 01:38:53,880
it getting closer right Canada's legal

2753
01:38:52,238 --> 01:38:55,598
Germany's legal Switzerland will

2754
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:57,239
probably be legal in the next few years

2755
01:38:55,599 --> 01:39:00,279
if you can buy Heineken you better be

2756
01:38:57,238 --> 01:39:02,559
able to buy weed from everywhere just

2757
01:39:00,279 --> 01:39:04,399
the same way in Switzerland you can buy

2758
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:06,520
hemp you can buy High CBD hemp in the

2759
01:39:04,399 --> 01:39:08,679
liquor store already like it's up to 1%

2760
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:10,960
THC so it will have an effect on you it

2761
01:39:08,679 --> 01:39:12,560
will have a it will we we we in the

2762
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:13,960
beginning people used to say CBD is not

2763
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:16,320
psychoactive which is not true it is

2764
01:39:13,960 --> 01:39:18,679
psychoactive but it's not psychoactive

2765
01:39:16,319 --> 01:39:20,519
the way that THC is cyle no it does pass

2766
01:39:18,679 --> 01:39:22,520
the blood brain barrier so in that

2767
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:23,920
regard yeah sure definitely has side

2768
01:39:22,520 --> 01:39:26,520
effects that are very

2769
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:28,800
psychedelic no no

2770
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:30,639
psychoactive yeah and sometimes which is

2771
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:32,119
different than being an active psycho

2772
01:39:30,639 --> 01:39:34,199
yeah it's much better than being an

2773
01:39:32,118 --> 01:39:37,759
active psycho which there's plenty of

2774
01:39:34,198 --> 01:39:40,000
those an active psycho on psychoactives

2775
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:41,599
never turn your back on a drug I don't

2776
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:43,039
double negatives you never know you

2777
01:39:41,599 --> 01:39:45,119
never know they could be hella smooth

2778
01:39:43,039 --> 01:39:47,719
yeah it might correct you might correct

2779
01:39:45,118 --> 01:39:50,679
things right exactly so yeah we live in

2780
01:39:47,719 --> 01:39:52,560
this strange time it's a beautiful time

2781
01:39:50,679 --> 01:39:53,880
but it's still a strange time but I

2782
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:55,679
think it's always been a strange time

2783
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:57,560
right I'm sure as far back every day is

2784
01:39:55,679 --> 01:40:00,920
a strange day but it's a little stranger

2785
01:39:57,560 --> 01:40:02,080
than it usually is yeah I mean long

2786
01:40:00,920 --> 01:40:05,639
right there's a lot of people who want

2787
01:40:02,079 --> 01:40:07,158
to be Emperor yeah you know this is why

2788
01:40:05,639 --> 01:40:09,239
you shouldn't always teach the classics

01:40:07,158 --> 01:40:12,079

01:40:14,439 --> 01:40:20,079
it can be For Better or For Worse you

2793
01:40:17,198 --> 01:40:22,279
have to be able to discern for yourself

2794
01:40:20,079 --> 01:40:23,519
and you have to make good choices yeah

2795

thank you so much yeah totally so but

2906
01:44:30,158 --> 01:44:34,118
yeah so if you had one piece of advice

2907
01:44:31,679 --> 01:44:36,960
for your younger self take a marketing

2908
01:44:34,118 --> 01:44:39,719
class oh yeah I love it it's all

2909
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:41,760
marketing these days right uh that's I

2910
01:44:39,719 --> 01:44:43,760
mean at least in comedy too because you

2911
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:45,320
you know everybody also take a video

2912
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:46,320
editing class apparently because I just

2913
01:44:45,319 --> 01:44:48,198
thought I was going to be a comic I

2914
01:44:46,319 --> 01:44:52,399
didn't know I had to be like a video

2915
01:44:48,198 --> 01:44:54,319
editor and a sound mixer and a a master

2916
01:44:52,399 --> 01:44:57,198
marketer and all the stuff but that's a

2917
01:44:54,319 --> 01:44:59,198
lot of what it comes down to uh in a lot

2918
01:44:57,198 --> 01:45:01,638
of ways I mean it's always been that a

2919
01:44:59,198 --> 01:45:03,839
little bit but even more and more now

2920
01:45:01,639 --> 01:45:06,239
and especially now

2921
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:07,960
because everybody's just expected to do

2922
01:45:06,238 --> 01:45:09,638
all those things social media is like a

2923
01:45:07,960 --> 01:45:11,920
whole another job and so now you have to

2924
01:45:09,639 --> 01:45:13,560
be a social media person you're also a

2925
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:18,239
stand up comedian you also got to write

2926
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:20,760
things and you also have to be uh a a a

2927
01:45:18,238 --> 01:45:22,799
Content not when I say content creator

2928
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:23,560
but you have to be a production facility

2929
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:27,279
yeah

2930
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:28,599
right so those are the things yeah

2931
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:30,639
that's what I would say so what do you

2932
01:45:28,599 --> 01:45:34,440
have planned for the future for yourself

2933
01:45:30,639 --> 01:45:36,400
uh Tranquility inner peace yeah uh

2934
01:45:34,439 --> 01:45:37,839
profitability yeah all those things I'm

2935
01:45:36,399 --> 01:45:39,399
going to be like I said I see you in

2936
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:41,719
Barcelona for the international Canabis

2937
01:45:39,399 --> 01:45:45,158
business conference I'll be at the New

2938
01:45:41,719 --> 01:45:47,399
Mexico Growers Cup in mid-march that's

2939
01:45:45,158 --> 01:45:49,158
why I got to come back from Spain yeah

2940
01:45:47,399 --> 01:45:50,920
that's like the 22nd in

2941
01:45:49,158 --> 01:45:52,799
Albuquerque uh we're working on some

2942
01:45:50,920 --> 01:45:54,960
things in the desert hot springs I'll be

2943
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:56,760
at the Missouri Growers cup I'll be at

2944
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:58,000
the Oregon Growers cup I don't think

2945
01:45:56,760 --> 01:45:59,880
they're doing an emerald Cup this year

2946
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:01,118
so I probably won't be there but I'll be

2947
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:02,480
has that been canceled officially

2948
01:46:01,118 --> 01:46:04,118
because I thought they had a five they

2949
01:46:02,479 --> 01:46:06,879
had a fiveyear contract in Oakland so I

2950
01:46:04,118 --> 01:46:08,559
believe last I heard yeah but it's been

2951
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:09,880
months since I talked to those guys so I

2952
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:10,960
have to send some emails but last I

2953
01:46:09,880 --> 01:46:12,279
heard they they weren't going to do

2954
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:14,800
another one we're getting Tim on the

2955
01:46:12,279 --> 01:46:16,759
show it's hard it's hard not to do those

2956
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:19,320
because they are so much fun I love

2957
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:21,920
Emeral cup you know what to me the

2958
01:46:19,319 --> 01:46:25,000
emerald cup is the one that really I

2959
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:28,000
think takes time to celebrate the plant

2960
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:29,639
itself and not just partying well the

2961
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:31,000
the problem with an emerald cup is it's

2962
01:46:29,639 --> 01:46:33,039
supposed to be the Harvest Cup right

2963
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:34,960
it's it's the Harvest cup that happens

2964
01:46:33,039 --> 01:46:36,560
after outdoor is done where you can

2965
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:38,118
share your outdoor with everybody else

2966
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:40,360
CU I grow outdoor in my backyard so I

2967
01:46:38,118 --> 01:46:42,079
love bringing de fres outdoor to show

2968

01:46:42,079 --> 01:46:45,279

3004
01:48:03,319 --> 01:48:06,279
out with those guys exactly and they

3005
01:48:04,719 --> 01:48:07,880
make it so hard I'm not one of those

3006
01:48:06,279 --> 01:48:10,639
guys dude I came up here to talk about

3007
01:48:07,880 --> 01:48:12,639
weed they you can't you know I'm I'm not

3008
01:48:10,639 --> 01:48:14,560
really trying to put broccoli in my

3009
01:48:12,639 --> 01:48:17,639
grinder wink wink nudge nudge I'm not

3010
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:19,719
trying to spell it o UI apostrophe D

3011
01:48:17,639 --> 01:48:21,239
like I come from back in the activist

3012
01:48:19,719 --> 01:48:23,118
days where you stood up for it but it's

3013
01:48:21,238 --> 01:48:24,919
so harder now because back then just

3014
01:48:23,118 --> 01:48:26,158
stand up for weed and they can't really

3015
01:48:24,920 --> 01:48:28,079
kick me off my job I'm

3016
01:48:26,158 --> 01:48:30,439
selfemployed so I can do what I want

3017
01:48:28,079 --> 01:48:32,198
right but now I got to rely on this

3018
01:48:30,439 --> 01:48:33,960
Instagram to get my word out to do my

3019
01:48:32,198 --> 01:48:35,638
marketing right and there's censorship

3020
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:37,359
heavy censorship for us I can't even

3021
01:48:35,639 --> 01:48:39,079
just like you can't tell anybody where

3022
01:48:37,359 --> 01:48:41,079
to get it you can't tell them what it is

3023
01:48:39,079 --> 01:48:43,760
like I can sometime if I post a stupid

3024
01:48:41,079 --> 01:48:45,039
if I post a weed meme yeah then they

3025
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:46,560
don't care they think that's hilarious

3026
01:48:45,039 --> 01:48:48,800
they'll spread it around everybody but

3027
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:50,400
if I post some like this is beta

3028
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:52,360
corh and it's found in these sort of

3029
01:48:50,399 --> 01:48:54,319
strains here's a picture of a plant blah

3030
01:48:52,359 --> 01:48:56,118
blah blah they're like hey hey hey hey

3031
01:48:54,319 --> 01:48:58,799
hey education goes against our

3032
01:48:56,118 --> 01:49:01,279
guidelines well Mark Zuckerberg claims

3033
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:03,199
that he's going to stop the sensorship

3034
01:49:01,279 --> 01:49:05,158
or reduce the censorship only you know

3035
01:49:03,198 --> 01:49:06,919
censoring really bad stuff we'll see

3036
01:49:05,158 --> 01:49:08,638
what happens with that well I think what

3037
01:49:06,920 --> 01:49:10,599
he's talking about is political ideas

3038
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:12,800
which we don't have time because been

3039
01:49:10,599 --> 01:49:14,560
here two hours already is he's going to

3040
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:16,719
try to stop people censoring that which

3041
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:18,880
is a whole different set of

3042
01:49:16,719 --> 01:49:21,079
disinformation but them restricting the

3043
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:24,199
flow of cannabis education I think will

3044
01:49:21,079 --> 01:49:25,760
continue because it's I wish it didn't

3045
01:49:24,198 --> 01:49:27,919
well of course not and it shouldn't it

3046
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:29,960
shouldn't be a thing people come to my

3047
01:49:27,920 --> 01:49:32,800
you come to Uno 420 because you want to

3048
01:49:29,960 --> 01:49:35,198
see weed and weed related I'm like the

3049
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:37,079
Hank Hill of cannabis I I mean I don't

3050
01:49:35,198 --> 01:49:39,158
sell weed and weed related accessories

3051
01:49:37,079 --> 01:49:41,118
but you've come to learn about cannabis

3052
01:49:39,158 --> 01:49:44,359
or to hang out on in the Cannabis

3053
01:49:41,118 --> 01:49:48,799
culture so not being able to do that is

3054
01:49:44,359 --> 01:49:50,319
a drag go to my patreon patreon Ino 420
