shoreline at the dead company Shoreline

16
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:10,799
in 2023 maybe that's probably probably

17
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,640
likely yeah with Shane and Tim and uh

18
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,040
with then those guys yeah seen quite a

19
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,960
few shows over the days yeah how many

20
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:23,118
shows I can't remember no I I I I toured

21
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:26,719
full-time with them from 85 to 95 nice

22
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:29,159
and and I've seen most of the the

23
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:31,359
following bands most of most of the show

24
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,399
so it's a couple thousand I'm sure wow

25
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:35,719
it's amazing yeah it's never too late to

26

have a happy childhood that's for sure

27
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:39,519
that's the beauty of it so what do you

28
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:41,519
think of the sphere I was I I was really

29
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:43,078
impressed I have to admit what was a

30
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:44,718
little disappointing for me was they

31
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:47,919
didn't have enough time to develop the

32
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:49,959
graphics and the limited amount number

33
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,079
of Graphics that they had worked up

34
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:55,199
limited the set list so that you were

35
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,959
seeing the same three shows pretty much

36
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,478
each week well there's always time to

37
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,839
change and I guess they're coming back

38
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:04,280

39

68
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:15,719
and how you got bio365 off the ground

69
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:17,759
sure um and I I'll I'll try and give a

70
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:19,759
really brief thumbnail on how I got the

71
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:23,679
bio 365 so you can understand how

72
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:26,598
twisted I am um so I basically uh had

73
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,040
had a great life growing up in Cleveland

74
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:32,518
Ohio my father was very successful and

75
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:34,560
he was a bit of a twisted old guy and he

76
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,360
he he tried to guilt me into achievement

77
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,158
he would like when I was 12 14 years old

78
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,439
he'd say I hope you forgive me someday

79
00:03:39,158 --> 00:03:42,199
you don't have to worry about feeding

80
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:44,120
your children or keeping a roof over

81
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:46,158
your head and frankly I don't see you

82
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,480
have any reason to achieve and without

83
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:49,359
achieving I don't know how you can feel

84
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:50,518
good about yourself without feeling good

85
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,760
about yourself I I don't know how you

86
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,280
can ever be happy so I I hope you

87
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:56,840
forgive me and I'm going where's the

88
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,079

Sweetwater and TR Studios and and um I

130
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:47,879
had the time and and I was such a fan

131
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:50,079
that the idea of spending 120 days a

132
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:52,680
year on the road with them was was

133
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:56,478
Heaven I bet and and what I can remember

134
00:05:52,680 --> 00:06:00,079
was yeah so I I I you know I did that

135
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:02,360
for 10 years you know I I got into

136
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:04,599
things that that were were really

137
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,800
important to me not necessarily great

138
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:10,879
opportunities I I I had become a vegan

139
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,038
and and a and then a raw fooder and

140
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:14,360
opened up a raw food restaurant in lsor

141
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:17,759
in around

142
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:21,038
2000 um and but the let me get back to

143
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:25,800
the to the Dad we had about I'm gonna

144
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:28,159
say 10 guys from somoma and mesino who

145
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,478
they would give us these wonderful bags

146
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,160
and we would give them laminates and and

147
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:35,839
then eventually when you know after

148
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:38,439
after 96 or whenever the the collective

149
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:40,679
started up the they taught me how to

150
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:44,038
grow and and introduced me to the plant

151
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:46,160
and and uh and and I ended up starting a

152
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:50,079
collective in in somoma level Valley

153
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:52,479
somoma in probably around 2012 nice and

154
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:54,079
and uh anyway that that's that was my

155
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:55,318
introduction to the plant I mean other

156
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:59,399
than it had been my medicine of

157
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:02,479
preference from the age of about 12 yeah

158
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:05,519
um and I I'm constantly surprised by how

159
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:08,680
many Ohioans are have such a strong

160
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:12,680
background with the plant right you know

161
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:14,079
so Farming Farming yeah farming yeah um

162
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,240
and and interesting that's how I also

163
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:19,439
got into farming and soil which is a

164
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,199
good segue um at the raw food restaurant

165
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,560
um imagine a restaurant where everything

166
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,800
you served came in the the door that

167
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:29,560
morning as a raw fruit nut or vegetable

168
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,520
yeah no cans no bottles we had to

169
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,839
dehydrate things for two three days to

170
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:35,719
create texture but we grew a lot of the

171
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:38,519
of our of our produce for the restaurant

172
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,599
in in our garden in in corter Madera and

173
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:44,639
I I learned about living soil then I

174
00:07:40,598 --> 00:07:47,360
learned then I we we were using compost

175
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,800
um but uh that's when I first really

176
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,800
started getting interested in in what

177
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,079
made a plant what made a plant taste

178
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:57,280
good you what made it what why were

179
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:59,519
these giant tomatoes from from the

180
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:01,598
supermarket why did they y'all have no

181
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,399
flavor at all you know but this ugly

182
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:05,519
thing that came out of you know my

183
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:07,318
backyard is just bursting with flavor

184
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:10,158
and it's so amazing I worked at

185
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:13,479
shapanese I interned there 20 years ago

186
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:16,000
uhhuh and that was my experience was

187
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:18,800
like how could this tomato taste so

188
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,639
amazing compared to the stuff that I'm

189
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,960
used to tasting and my parents grew

190
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,879
tomatoes and they were good but this was

191
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:28,598
even another level well it it it's

192
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,080
really it's amazing and it's also really

193
00:08:28,598 --> 00:08:33,838
identical for can

194
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:36,199
yeah um and you know I'm sure a lot of

195
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,360
your audience has heard the living soil

196
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,039
story and and that but you know just

197
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,680
real quickly you know plants spend a

198
00:08:40,038 --> 00:08:44,240
quarter or a third of their energy

199
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,599
making specific food for specific

200
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,360
biology that lives in their root Zone

201
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,560
that Cycles specific nutrients a plant

202
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,120
needs magnesium it makes up the food for

203
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:54,679
the microbe in the soil that Cycles

204
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,839
magnesium and it sweats it out through

205
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:59,120
its roots and the microb brings the

206
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:01,519
Magnesium to the plant and exchanges it

207
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,839
for the food that the plant makes for it

208
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,720
and that way the plant's feeding on

209
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:06,920
demand getting all the specific

210
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,920
nutrients it needs to build the building

211
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:14,639
blocks that it its DNA is wanting to

212
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:16,719
express yeah um and and you know I I I

213
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:18,639
would say bad things about salts or

214
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,720
anything because most of our customers

215
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:22,439
use salts and and and some of them go

216
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,839
grow some pretty good cannabis but

217
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,480
you're you're basically filling up a

218
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,800
bucket and hoping that it's going to

219
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:30,159
meet the needs of the plant right and

220
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:33,078
the plant's needs are always real time

221
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:35,439
you know if if if a an aphid lands on a

222
00:09:33,078 --> 00:09:37,479
leaf um the plant senses it actually

223
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,800
makes up a a food for microbes that

224
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,240
float in the air and it sweats it out

225
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:43,559
through the leaf and the microbes will

226
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,039
come down and create a layer of slime

227
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:47,439
over the leaf and that's the plant's

228
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:50,240
defense that leaf eaing

229
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,880
aphid now if 12 more aphids land on 12

230
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,959
other leaves it's got to make 12 times

231
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:55,720
that specific molecule yeah and

232
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:58,799
eventually you know the bucket's going

233
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:03,240
to run out of one and and that's that

234
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:05,278
giant that tastes like cardboard yeah so

235
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,480
um it's really important to me that that

236
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:10,559
you know cannabis become more of an

237
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:13,240
organic organically grown product I know

238
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:15,359
the quality is better I I used to say

239
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,600
that salts were were Force feeding a

240
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,039
goose but really it's water boarding the

241
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:23,440
plant um and that that's just not a way

242
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:24,599
to Good Health yeah um so hopefully

243
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,760
we're moving in that direction there's

244
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,320
some people growing some organic fire

245
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:30,838
out there organic and Sanic I feel like

246
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,879
organic is a great approach too where

247
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:36,480
they're using synthetic with Organics to

248
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:38,399
try to achieve a a great product I think

249
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,278
at least it's a great Direction yeah

250
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,120
I'll tell you something really

251
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:43,958
interesting so um we were doing an early

252
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,799
test when when we we started the soil

253
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:48,159
company we're running our nutrient Den

254
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:49,958
soils against competitors and right we

255
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:53,360
threw in one of our our nutrient light

256
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:56,599
soils and so basically what our soil is

257
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:59,399
really all about is is biomimicry MHM

258
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,240
and the first leg of biomimicry is is bi

259
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:03,078
ology in the root Zone it's not just a

260
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,360
way of of selective feeding so that the

261
00:11:03,078 --> 00:11:07,599
plant expresses itself better it's also

262
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,919
a big part of its defenses in the root

263
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,000
zone so the problem is a lot of good

264
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:14,799
gardeners add biology and then it drains

265
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,958
out drains the waste with the rest of

266
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:19,759
their stuff and and and so I think I I I

267
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:23,078
started to tell you earlier my wife in

268
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:26,319
2007 started a biochar research company

269
00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:28,039
and created Five patents around creating

270
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,920
optimal optimally temperatured and

271
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:32,679
carbon content

272
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:36,639
uh and inoculating the Char with with

273
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:38,319
Biology and and with nutrients and when

274
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,600
you when you create biochar you create a

275
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,760
ton of synthetic natural gas and right

276
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,759
in the middle of their they're creating

277
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:46,879
this this

278
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:48,759
capability fracking came along and

279
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:51,078
destroyed the the business model so that

280
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:52,720
they couldn't really go forward they

281
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:55,679
wanted to give the Char away as a way of

282
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,680
sequestering carbon and uh so the the

283
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:59,078
the soil scientist from Cornell who is

284
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:01,359
her partner said well I'm just going to

285
00:11:59,078 --> 00:12:04,078
take the stuff and make a soil but he

286
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,639
wanted to make a living soil and he

287
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:09,879
patented a biological activation and

288
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:13,159
aging process that we do in a HEPA

289
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:15,639
filtered indoor clean space we don't use

290
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:18,240
any unpasteurized manures in any of our

291
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:21,240
nutrient packages yeah and we're and

292
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,839
we're able to create a a living base

293
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,360
that we mix into all of our our

294
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:28,320
different media um that's as clean and

295
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,839
consistent as as anything in in any in

296
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,760
any substrate out there yeah um but it's

297
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:36,680
a whole Community we we take our wide

298
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:38,600
spectrum biology biochar and organic

299
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:42,239
nutrients and we put them through a 30

300
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:44,278
to 45 day activation and aging process

301
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,278
um and the plants love it so so number

302
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:50,198
one biomimicry is does the plant have

303
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:51,799
the biology it expects to see one of the

304
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:54,000
interesting things is if you don't have

305
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:55,759
the biology the plant is smart enough to

306
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,720
stop wasting the energy of making the

307
00:12:55,759 --> 00:13:00,159
food and it puts it into biomass and

308
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:04,720
that's why that tomato is bigger

309
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:07,759
okay um so the second leg of biomimicry

310
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,800
um is air and water paracity okay

311
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:13,078
because plants need space for their

312
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:18,719
roots to grow our soils are remarkable

313
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:23,838
in that our our cocoa is 14% solid 24%

314
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:26,160
air and 62% water MH um and so what we

315
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,800
find is we we we'll have a customer

316
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:29,439
growing in a in in a five gallon

317
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:31,759
container and we can grow a bigger plant

318
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,199
in a two gallon container yeah you know

319
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:37,159
because it's all about root space and

320
00:13:34,198 --> 00:13:40,159
and air and then Sops that that support

321
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:41,480
those roots filling up the container um

322
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:43,879
so so that's really important and the

323
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:47,000
third thing and this is something that

324
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:50,000
is almost absent in in in in most Hydro

325
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,360
operations is it when it rains in when

326
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
it plants get water from excuse me from

327
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:57,480
the soil with tension mhm when it rains

328
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,278
there's plenty of water plant doesn't

329
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:03,199
have to pull at all water is just there

330
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:05,679
for it every day it dries out every day

331
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:08,198
the plant has to pull a little harder to

332
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:10,838
get water from the soil right that dry

333
00:14:08,198 --> 00:14:12,359
stressing is is probably if not the

334
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:15,839
number one trigger of secondary

335
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:20,000
metabolites it's up there and you can't

336
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:23,160
dry down plant in in in rock wool or or

337
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,000
in a straight cocoa um they don't water

338
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:28,159
long enough or even in a Pete um so

339
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,720
having a water release curve that mimics

340
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:33,240
nature turns out to be really important

341
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,759
for the plant to express itself in its

342
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:38,039
best yeah um so that's really that

343
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:40,320
that's what our soils are about we

344
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:42,198
actually manufacture them in a in not

345
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,360
just completely indoors meaning all

346
00:14:42,198 --> 00:14:47,758
inputs all finished product are stored

347
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,560
indoors we sallyport the building yeah

348
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:52,919
so that there's no way the internal

349
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:56,518
Factory can be open to the outside um

350
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:58,479
and we like I said we use IPM in our

351
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:01,159
production we were using hypo aism mites

352
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:04,959
and neemat toads for fungal control it's

353
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:07,958
as clean as your grow rooms hopefully um

354
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:11,119
and and that that shows off in its

355
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:13,479
consistency and and its performance

356
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,879
excellent we've been obviously going

357
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,519
with the ups and downs of or I should

358
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:19,958
say mostly Downs of the Cannabis

359
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:21,959
industry um we've actually grown pretty

360
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:26,439
pretty successfully I mean we have more

361
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:30,078
than half of the top 10 msos um GTI

362
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:33,160
Verano um pharmacan columb be care of

363
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:36,439
cannabis um but but more importantly for

364
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:41,360
me we have the greatest group of of

365
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:43,319
foundational ogs breeders Growers um who

366
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,639
really understand our soil and are are

367
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:48,000
are growing great great fire with it

368
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:51,480
yeah um and and that that to me is more

369
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,039
rewarding I I I'm very disappointed in

370
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,639
what's happened to the to the Cannabis

371
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:59,198
industry it it it doesn't honor the

372
00:15:55,639 --> 00:16:02,399
plant it it's run by Finance people

373
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:04,399
getrich quick entrepreneurs that um that

374
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:08,159
don't understand the plant or the values

375
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:10,120
that created our our community and uh

376
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:14,120
you know I'm I'm trying to figure out

377
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:16,240
how we can get get back to to where we

378
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:19,039
started yeah I don't think there's any

379
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,639
one solution it's a bunch of small steps

380
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:24,559
yeah yeah well it's interesting so you

381
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:26,639
know I had a a very interesting Final in

382
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:29,719
in business strategy at Harvard Business

383
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:32,440
School and and it was about a a lobster

384
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,240
boat company that was very high-tech

385
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:37,199
they had designed their whole Fleet of

386
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:40,600
of lobster boats um they had a big R&amp;D

387
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:43,679
facility they they they went out of

388
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:46,399
business in about two years and the

389
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:48,879
thing was the economics of the lobster

390
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:52,159
business are determined by the economics

391
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:54,159
of a boat with three guys on it um and

392
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:56,360
that's their cost and that's what

393
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:57,799
they're going to sell at and there's no

394
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,480
advantage to scale there's actually

395
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:01,240
disadvantages of scale because you're

396
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:04,318
paying for all of that R&amp;D you're paying

397
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:06,759
to manage all these people right um I

398
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:08,599
think cannabis is exactly the same the

399
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:11,439
the functional unit in cannabis is the

400
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:14,279
room whether it's a th000 or 4,000

401
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:16,558
square fet if you have 20 of them you

402
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:20,759
have more than 20 times the cost of one

403
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:22,918
single 4,000 foot room right um and I

404
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:23,959
don't understand if cultivators are

405
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:26,600
willing to

406
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:29,600
ferate I I don't understand why you

407
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:32,519
can't be competitive in in most States

408
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:35,000
you know depending on on Power and and

409
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:37,480
you know what what what the indoor

410
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,599
prices you know bottom out at it's it's

411
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:43,880
just it's become a race to the bottom

412
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:46,519
and I I I just believe that cannabis can

413
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:48,799
be grown less expensively than it is

414
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:50,879
there's too many people have too many

415
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:52,400
magic things they're throwing in there

416
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,919
they're they're not doing any real

417
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,000
evaluation of side by side of what

418
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:59,440
they're putting in and whether it's

419
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:03,000
benefiting them right um they the they

420
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,240
aren't really looking at system costs um

421
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,919
and and there's a there's a lot of

422
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:10,359
cultural practices that have come from

423
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:12,640
the old day when we didn't have room

424
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:15,158
to cultivate the way we were trying to

425
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,000
cultivate so you up pooted and you shove

426
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:21,240
things this way and that way and you

427
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:24,079
know there's really no reason to to

428
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,679
plant your clone anywhere and Transplant

429
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:27,558
it again I mean there's no reason to

430
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,360
transplant at all after you plant your

431
00:18:27,558 --> 00:18:31,759
your rooted your rooted

432
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:33,359
right um and and and you can grow in

433
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:34,279
much smaller containers like I said than

434
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:36,399
people are

435
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:39,079
growing I think yeah I think there's big

436
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,640
benefit to growing in smaller containers

437
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:44,000
um you know for us is dryb backs getting

438
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,600
oxygen to the roots and but but you know

439
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,359
I think it's all we're learning and we

440
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:48,678
go through these Trends whether it's

441
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:52,119
using

442
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:54,480
18 uh inputs you know as opposed to

443
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:57,079
using three which I think is more common

444
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,038
now than ever uh so we go through these

445
00:18:57,079 --> 00:19:00,798
wild trends of well this has to be

446
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:02,200
better or this is better because this

447
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:04,519
person does it and maybe they're getting

448
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,960
good results but the the flowers changed

449
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:09,519
a lot over the last 10 years

450
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,840
especially um I got some really sticky

451
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:14,839
sticky flow that I I'll show you later

452
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:16,720
and we're not seeing that anymore we're

453
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:18,319
not seeing the really really sticky

454
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,600
stuff that just you could push it onto

455
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:23,038
anything and it'll stick and there's

456
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:25,199
there's a lot of reasons for that but

457
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:26,879
also the genetics of preference you know

458
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,558
we've also bottlenecked ourselves into

459
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,799
this corner l

460
00:19:29,558 --> 00:19:33,079
yeah into this stuff that's much

461
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:35,079
different that doesn't necessarily taste

462
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:36,960
like the Cannabis that we grew up with

463
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:40,038
or that I grew up with and I'm sure

464
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,400
you've seen it's like uh it's

465
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:45,480
interesting the way people think and the

466
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,360
way people work and you know how we get

467
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,960
so excited about one thing that we lose

468
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:50,759
all these other great things along the

469
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,720
way yeah and that's really happened

470
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:54,759
since the 90s and and in and in the

471
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,798
whole industry you don't really know

472
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:59,759
what you're getting anyway I mean that's

473
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:01,839
the biggest misconception ever well I I

474
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:03,960
I should take that back I mean it used

475
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:06,599
to be I I I heard this story that there

476
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:09,159
was a group there was like 50 Elders in

477
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:10,480
humbold and and people could present

478
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:12,360
things to them and they would go yeah

479
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,079
that's that's the real Sour Diesel you

480
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:16,199
know but but unless you get the from the

481
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:17,759
original breeder yeah it's it's really

482
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,360
kind of it's kind of tough to know and

483
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:21,919
especially these the new strands the

484
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:23,719
candy brunch stuff all tastes the same

485
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,960
it's all renamed a lot of it's not all

486
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,759
of it but a lot of it's renamed um and

487
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,480
then Sour Diesel is the best example

488
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,960
because for the longest time I I almost

489
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,360
thought my mind was playing tricks on me

490
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,640
that I didn't remember it right but then

491
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:37,479
a guy named Dave I talk about this on my

492
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,840
podcast all the time he pres I I was at

493
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,919
reg on the river and he comes up to me

494
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:42,519
gives me a bud and it was the sour

495
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:44,679
diesel I remember from my childhood and

496
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:46,720
there was one Sour Diesel that we had it

497
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:48,120
wasn't all these different we had one I

498
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,798
mean maybe there was more for other

499
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:54,000
people but back uh 2000 and before there

500
00:20:51,798 --> 00:20:56,879
was one Sour Diesel and I you know I

501
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,279
have some of it in my freezer yeah but a

502
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,159
lot of the sour that's going around now

503
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:01,960
is this gassy version of Sour Diesel so

504
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,400
that's what people think Sour Diesel is

505
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,120
right right and it it happens over and

506
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,640
over and over again OG Kush there's a

507
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:09,558
lot of OG cush around but it's not the

508
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,880
OG cush I remember from 10 years AG

509
00:21:09,558 --> 00:21:16,038
right right um yeah it's it's funny to

510
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,200
hear uh to hear guys like Josh D and

511
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:20,759
ghost talk about it that they they talk

512
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:24,159
about having a cut of TK that nobody

513
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:26,960
else has yeah and they don't Rel it you

514
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:29,960
know and I I haven't smoked it but they

515
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,640
they like swear about it I got some TK I

516
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:34,000
got some TK here today but it's but but

517
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,320
is it the real TK I mean that's the

518
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,798
thing yeah and so and it's so subjective

519
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:39,439
because the name doesn't mean anything

520
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:41,119
and if fingerprinting technology is

521
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,759
going to help with that I feel like

522
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:44,399
that's the beauty my Florida DNA and a

523
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:46,278
couple other companies where you can

524
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,679
fingerprint the genetics they have

525
00:21:46,278 --> 00:21:50,919
basically uh 2,000 Snips they can

526
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:53,200
compare more right and so it's actually

527
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:54,759
more accurate than a human fingerprint

528
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,519
and they can tell you yes it's that

529
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:59,319
exact thing or no it's not right and so

530
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:00,879
the more of us they on board with

531
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:02,439
getting our stuff fingerprinted the

532
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,400
easier it's going to be down the road

533
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:06,159
right I I agree and I I think

534
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,600
blockchain's going to be involved in it

535
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,600
I think that there's there's a lot of

536
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:13,319
technology that that that is coming at

537
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:16,798
the plant and I think in in in mostly

538
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:19,918
positive ways yeah exception of your IR

539
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:22,558
radiation and a few things but um sure I

540
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,840
think that yeah there there's so little

541
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:24,839
sence we were talking about that earlier

542
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:28,199
that you

543
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:30,240
know very few of my customers really

544
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,360
know know what what you know the impact

545
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,480
of their their inputs are or or are

546
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:38,158
willing to actually push push the the

547
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,400
parameters on on dryback or use

548
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,360
tensiometers to actually take the plant

549
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,480
to where you know it's not going to go

550
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:48,479
into Wilt but is really going to have to

551
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,798
suck yeah um and and again there's just

552
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,480
going to be a lot more science I think

553
00:22:49,798 --> 00:22:54,558
improving the practices yeah there has

554
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,440
to be a lot more AB testing people need

555
00:22:54,558 --> 00:23:01,399
to do a lot of testing and the thing is

556
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:03,120
is testing testing it with most people

557
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,600
is just like okay well this was better

558
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:05,678
they're not they're not documenting it

559
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:07,399
they're not doing it properly I mean

560
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,320
there are people I take that back there

561
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,080
are people that are doing it correctly

562
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:14,158
we just need more of them yeah yeah

563
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:19,359
there I mean there I find it really

564
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:19,360
funny I I was in Florida up until

565
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:24,319
2021 and the C the product was just

566
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,360
terrible there was there were there were

567
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:30,639
17 licenses maybe 12 of them were

568
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:33,599
operating no competition you know it and

569
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,120
uh and now it looked like such an

570
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:38,359
attractive State especially with wck

571
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:40,278
coming MH that there's some real players

572
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:42,719
down there growing some great great

573
00:23:40,278 --> 00:23:45,240
cannabis nice like IDE I don't know if

574
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,038
you know ideal out of Oregon yeah the

575
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:50,599
name for sure they're growing 100%

576
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:53,079
organic just beautiful flower

577
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:55,240
um there's real competition coming to

578
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:58,038
Florida and so I I think it's really

579
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:00,038
cool that's awesome yeah I mean I I hope

580
00:23:58,038 --> 00:24:02,079
everyone has access to good flower at

581
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:04,919
the end of the day these guys at

582
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:08,319
flowery okay they they've got a whole

583
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:10,320
feno hunting setup they're they're doing

584
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:13,960
a lot of breeding I think they're yeah

585
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:16,119
sunburn cannabis uh we got

586
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,679
peik doing his thing that's one of the

587
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:21,599
great great stories you

588
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:24,400
know at a 1991 Grateful Dead show at

589
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:27,519
Deer Creek Indiana you know Kem dog

590
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,600
bought a bag off a peab bud mik and that

591
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:33,240
was the start was the start that changed

592
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:35,240
the game I have uh somebody gifted me

593
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:38,519
tickets I traded them for some seeds but

594
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:40,640
tickets from both the the shows so for

595
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:44,240
the 91 shows oh really

596
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:47,240
yeah good stuff yeah yeah but yeah and

597
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:50,278
that uh serendipitous day

598
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:52,599
changed the Cannabis that we've seen

599
00:24:50,278 --> 00:24:54,159
it's changed the what we see now yeah

600
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:55,759
without that it would be different I

601
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,520
believe I firmly believe it would be

602
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:59,278
different and they brought gas to the

603
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:01,918
market I think

604
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:05,480
absolutely gas and you know the funky

605
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:07,960
stuff I I think that and and and OG Kush

606
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:10,079
you know is just those are my true

607
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,600
foundational yeah I love both of those a

608
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:14,278
lot yeah I have both you and I also do

609
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:17,240
like some of the sweet stuff and I like

610
00:25:14,278 --> 00:25:19,960
the you know we we have the gdps and I

611
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,880
get excited that's nostalgic for me too

612
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,519
but I like the skunks I like stuff

613
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,200
that's really skunky we had cat piss

614
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:27,278
when I grew up you know that that was

615
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,558
the big thing was that really nose

616
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:32,798
burning cat piss it wasn't gas like OG

617
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:35,480
it was skunky like a dead skunk or like

618
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:37,879
a sprayed skunk yeah uh yeah with

619
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,360
ammonia that burned your nose yeah and

620
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:42,120
that to me is what you know that got me

621
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:44,719
excited I I saw that the that that Kevin

622
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:46,798
and skunk VA are putting together

623
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,159
something where they're they're uh

624
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:51,119
they're going to do tissue culture and

625
00:25:49,159 --> 00:25:53,880
and run Nursery apps I guess grateful

626
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:55,278
heads grateful heads Heads yeah yeah

627
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,480
they're doing some cool stuff and I I

628
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:59,440
think we're doing a breeding project

629
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:01,679
trying to bring back back the old ciss

630
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,480
genetics I mean I think we're doing on

631
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:07,759
the so so what ciss is though ciss is a

632
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,319
description of an aroma what a lot of

633
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:11,640
people don't get is like well they want

634
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:13,519
to lay a flag in the ground say that was

635
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,360
my cat piss well maybe you had a cat

636
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:17,278
piss and maybe this other guy did

637
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:19,278
because it smelled like ammonia you know

638
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:20,720
or whatever it is but that's a

639
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:23,038
description of a smell it's not like

640
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:26,880
blue dream where it's like a strain name

641
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:28,839
or cultivar name m um so I'm looking for

642
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,600
that one that smells like

643
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:32,918
sprayed skunk with ammonia that burns

644
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:34,398
your nose so and there over the years

645
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:36,759
I've smelled ammonia and stuff we had

646
00:26:34,398 --> 00:26:37,839
the A5 Haze and that was ammonia right

647
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:39,519
that was really good but that was

648
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:41,359
straight ammonia that that would burn

649
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:45,119
your nose I didn't I didn't have that

650
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:46,479
broad access you know until the 2000s

651
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:50,719
yeah you know and a lot a lot of stuff

652
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:54,558
was just wasn't around I by uh one of my

653
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:57,360
mentors guy named jaaya and uh he had he

654
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:59,798
had a strain which was a blue dream uh

655
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:01,719
New York sour diesel cross wow it was

656
00:26:59,798 --> 00:27:03,679
alpha blue is what he called it it

657
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,720
sounds amazing and it it was wonderful

658
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,759
but you know you couldn't get anybody to

659
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,919
grow it cuz it's 12 weeks you know and

660
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:11,960
it's like it's rough even now I mean I

661
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,278
have so I have a blue dream times a

662
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:16,399
double Lemon Cherry that that's that's

663
00:27:14,278 --> 00:27:18,440
like a nine weer and so but it has

664
00:27:16,398 --> 00:27:19,678
everything that I love about blue dream

665
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,440
and so we're calling it dream candy

666
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,200
we're launching that this year oh nice

667
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,840
so we feno hunted that we got three

668
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,159
different ones one's a dead ringer for

669
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:28,158
blue dream that takes a little bit

670
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,360
longer and then we have the one that

671
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:32,080
somewh in the Middle where I feel like

672
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:34,398
it it can reintroduce Blue Dream to the

673
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:37,119
world in a way where some of these kids

674
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:40,000
that want that Lemon Cherry gelato

675
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:41,798
runs uh they'll be excited about it yeah

676
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,200
yeah that's great so sometimes you got

677
00:27:41,798 --> 00:27:47,119
to sneak it in the back door I'm I'm

678
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:49,600
building my uh my home on orcus island

679
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:52,359
now and putting in a room so I nice I

680
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:54,119
look forward to yeah genetics I got

681
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:57,038
genetics I got lots of genetics I going

682
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:58,719
to read your book I I hadn't uh yeah I

683
00:27:57,038 --> 00:28:02,038
got a book for you as well

684
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,798
I'm excited to hear more about bio365

685
00:28:02,038 --> 00:28:06,158
and telling everybody about your product

686
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:08,119
because I feel like you have a special

687
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:11,880
substrate it's not like other cocoa

688
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:14,398
products uh you have one that we did

689
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:16,640
some trials side by side and we got much

690
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:18,678
bigger plants and it wasn't even the one

691
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:23,240
that was extremely

692
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:26,440
hot it's interesting um the the nutrient

693
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:29,919
light soils um they still have that um

694
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:31,360
base of biochar in biology they they

695
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:35,080
just have a smaller quantity of

696
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:38,839
nutrients right and every time you feed

697
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:41,319
your salts to the plant our biology is

698
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:43,720
going to consume maybe five or

699
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:46,398
10% and it's going to allow the plant to

700
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:49,038
signal in between your feedings and

701
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:50,278
balance itself off right you know so we

702
00:28:49,038 --> 00:28:52,278
we did this trial where we had our

703
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:53,440
nutrient Den soils going against some

704
00:28:52,278 --> 00:28:54,919
competitors and we had one of our

705
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,360
nutrient light cells in there and it

706
00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:58,799
actually

707
00:28:56,359 --> 00:29:00,519
outperformed the the the the nutrient

708
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:02,879
dense ones which we've never seen before

709
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:05,319
and we we we went back to the lab and

710
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,919
actually measured the the respiration of

711
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:09,200
the biology and saw that the biology was

712
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:11,840
growing yeah from the

713
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,480
salts and and and so you know most

714
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:17,240
people say oh no salts kill biology yeah

715
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,278
no no lack of water kills biology sure

716
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:22,599
you know if your if your substrate holds

717
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:24,599
enough water yeah the biology is fine MH

718
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:26,918
you know and and so that that surprised

719
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:29,359
us but you know some of some of our best

720
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:31,559
uh scale cult cators are are are really

721
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:33,199
pushing the plant with with the nutrient

722
00:29:31,558 --> 00:29:35,119
light soils where they're they're

723
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,200
getting The Best of Both Worlds yeah

724
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:40,479
we're seeing a lot more utof flowers out

725
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,278
there yeah I think autoflow is slowly

726
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,240
growing what happened is it took this

727
00:29:42,278 --> 00:29:45,798
huge leap and everybody decided they're

728
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,759
going to plant acres and acres and Acres

729
00:29:45,798 --> 00:29:49,839
of it and then they didn't get the

730
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:52,119
results they were looking for so but but

731
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:53,480
then a ton of people were making seeds

732
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:54,959
everyone got excited about Autoflower

733
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,399
seeds there's there's a couple companies

734
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,038
that make really good autoflow seeds I

735
00:29:56,398 --> 00:30:00,079
feel like I make great Autoflower seeds

736
00:29:58,038 --> 00:30:02,319
seeds and there's a handful of other

737
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:05,839
ones um that are actually putting in the

738
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:08,278
work one of the largest uh msos thought

739
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:11,158
that they' go they do two cycles yeah

740
00:30:08,278 --> 00:30:13,278
right and just use it for molecules

741
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:14,760
right and the flower turned out so

742
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:16,519
beautiful they ended up selling it as

743
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:18,679
flower yeah and they're and they're and

744
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:21,278
they're doubling up this year and and

745
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:23,120
cutting back actually indoor I've seen

746
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:26,679
it I've seen it happened yeah and it's

747
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:28,319
funny uh you can get a lot faster return

748
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:30,120
if you know what you're doing and you

749
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:32,359
use large enough plant numbers you can

750
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:35,319
actually get higher yield and larger

751
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:37,319
yields per acre right uh you know it's

752
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:39,319
it's incredible and you can get more

753
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:42,720
Harvest per year yeah so I love light

754
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:44,200
deprivation I love the quality of

755
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,759
products you can get and I love

756
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,240
Greenhouse too I feel like Greenhouse is

757
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:49,000
the future I feel like you can get an

758
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:51,399
indoor looking product for those people

759
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,480
that need their flow to look good right

760
00:30:51,398 --> 00:30:56,599
I'm not one of those guys but I'm an

761
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:58,240
outdoor believer but you know I also

762
00:30:56,599 --> 00:31:01,319
early on I spent a lot of time in in

763
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:06,200
Colorado um maybe like

764
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:08,798
201 18 19 yeah and uh and in Colorado

765
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:13,440
every year one of two things would

766
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:16,638
happen Okay uh there'd be hail and snow

767
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:19,519
and freeze and you lose 60 70% of the

768
00:31:16,638 --> 00:31:22,038
crop if not all of it yeah or the

769
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,599
weather would be good and they turn out

770
00:31:22,038 --> 00:31:26,240
so much that the prices would drop $

771
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:29,278
three $400 a pound wow I mean it was it

772
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:31,159
was a feast or famine and and there's

773
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:34,480
just not enough visibility on Supply in

774
00:31:31,159 --> 00:31:36,519
this business to not see it tilt into

775
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,079
over Supply unfortunately you know

776
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:41,558
especially with with all the this get

777
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:44,398
rich quick wow you know it's it's sad

778
00:31:41,558 --> 00:31:46,759
for me it's really sad for me that the

779
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:49,000
guys who really you know built those

780
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:52,440
foundational strains who who who built

781
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,000
the industry plant as we know it um

782
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:57,240
they' mostly been screwed yeah you know

783
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,359
um being a head cultivator at the

784
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,519
biggest cultivator in California you

785
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:02,638
make the same as the the uh Chief

786
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,880
Executives

787
00:32:02,638 --> 00:32:07,599
assistant you know and in California

788
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,720
it's it's not a great living and anybody

789
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:10,839
went into business with their own

790
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:14,200
Capital got killed like everybody else

791
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:16,119
and it's just uh it's it's been hard to

792
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,880
see well that's why I don't do

793
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:21,079
cultivation you know it's I love

794
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,278
cultivating I I have a lot of respect

795
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:24,960
for the guys that do it they're doing

796
00:32:22,278 --> 00:32:27,558
the Lord's work mhm uh because the price

797
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,919
per pound is so low right now it's very

798
00:32:27,558 --> 00:32:31,440
difficult to be successful yeah and I

799
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,240
would much rather work on the genetic

800
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:37,120
side where I can work with everybody and

801
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:40,440
I can be the the velcro today I I think

802
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:42,839
genetics you know for for the wreck

803
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,880
operations that we that we work with

804
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:46,240
genetics are the only way to

805
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:49,559
differentiate themselves yeah you know

806
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,079
and and that they need to yeah we we try

807
00:32:49,558 --> 00:32:53,839
to do everything in house so literally

808
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:55,759
we're doing the seed production we're

809
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:58,720
doing the pheno hunting we're then

810
00:32:55,759 --> 00:33:00,079
licensing genetics selling clones

811
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,600
we're trying to stick with that Nursery

812
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:05,439
model but I think the future is

813
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:07,959
licensing genetics for us yeah I I agree

814
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,360
the there's a loophole now I guess that

815
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:12,960
under the farm bill where you can you

816
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:14,959
can ship clones and seeds anywhere seeds

817
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,440
anywhere yeah it's well as long as it's

818
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,038
below 3% THC you can ship it anywhere

819
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,038
and thca right so like you could have

820
00:33:20,038 --> 00:33:24,599
thca the ti whatever but like they're

821
00:33:22,038 --> 00:33:28,278
selling some people are selling flour

822
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:31,480
thca flour that tested 23% thca but test

823
00:33:28,278 --> 00:33:34,159
below 3% Delta 9 THC I'd like to know

824
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:35,880
who who bred that one yeah well I think

825
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:39,200
almost all of it is like that and at the

826
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:42,360
end it tests higher for for Delta 9 THC

827
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:44,200
ah okay so yeah it's a big loophole

828
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:45,638
right now that that that will change

829
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,399
people are you know people are in denial

830
00:33:45,638 --> 00:33:50,038
but they're going to change I would I

831
00:33:47,398 --> 00:33:52,319
would think so so but I do love the fact

832
00:33:50,038 --> 00:33:55,038
that you can ship seeds freely around

833
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:56,359
the world basically um you know

834
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:57,839
definitely in the United States you can

835
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:59,918
go state to state without getting

836
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:02,398
arrested or put in jail for a seed which

837
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:04,960
wasn't always the case right um but it

838
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:07,359
is just a seed they've misregulated

839
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,878
everything yeah I I I don't know if you

840
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:12,440
can bet on them fixing it or screwing it

841
00:34:09,878 --> 00:34:14,918
up worse you know it's well I think it's

842
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:18,280
GNA get fixed and it's GNA get SC again

843
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:20,158
the Delta H stuff really bothers me yeah

844
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:22,280
you know that's the ultimate get rich

845
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,720
quick you know I don't care about the

846
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:26,399
quality of the high it's no and as a

847
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:28,398
molecule it's not a bad molecule there

848
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:30,559
are no bad molecules in opinion you know

849
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:32,118
but as far as like the get-rich quick

850
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:33,320
side of it it's just kind of disgusting

851
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:35,919
because they're taking the worst of the

852
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:38,599
worst product processing it worst of the

853
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:41,000
worst hemp and turning it and processing

854
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:42,559
it and turning it into a product that

855
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,838
will get you high it will have some

856
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:46,918
effect on yeah but it's but but what is

857
00:34:44,838 --> 00:34:50,000
it do into your body what else is in

858
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:51,279
there again it's it's it's you know

859
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,480
anybody's willing to jump through a

860
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:58,720
loophole just to make a few Buck is not

861
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:59,679
the Cannabis industry I remember want to

862
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:02,239
no

863
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:03,838
unfortunately but uh you know and then

864
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:05,199
we go through waves with everything so

865
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:06,358
it's going to get better and then it's

866
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:08,399
going to get worse and then it's going

867
00:35:06,358 --> 00:35:11,519
to get better and you know to which

868
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:14,480
degree we'll we'll see I mean I think

869
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:16,440
basically going from schedule one to a

870
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,719
or yeah schedule one down to

871
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:21,240
rescheduling to schedule three I think

872
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:22,399
that's a good thing I I think there's

873
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:25,199
it's good and

874
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:28,838
bad I think the big deal for the

875
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:30,319
industry is the 280 MH because no no

876
00:35:28,838 --> 00:35:32,400
one's making money there's one or two

877
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,119
companies really actually turning a real

878
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,639
profit yeah um and and and they're going

879
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,320
to have to refinance at much higher

880
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:40,559
rates than their first round of

881
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,960
financing it's just been a horror show

882
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:44,880
yeah so two 280 I think is the most

883
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,079
important for the the economics of the

884
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,440
industry that has no impact on the

885
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:52,200
structure or the quality of the industry

886
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:55,039
yeah um but it'll make it viable I think

887
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:56,480
um I'm concerned that in in bringing it

888
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:59,519
down to schedule three they they might

889
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:02,800
put other Hoops around it that make it

890
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:05,759
more difficult or or more challenging

891
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,800
for The Operators to I mean the schedule

892
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,119
3 is supposed to have all sorts of

893
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,519
facility rules and and right it's

894
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:13,200
supposed to we'll see what happens we

895
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:15,920
don't know nobody knows we don't know we

896
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:17,559
don't know and I I yeah I mean the truth

897
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,119
is we don't know and we can hope for the

898
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:21,400
best and you know I mean we've we've

899
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:23,800
done that in the past and it hasn't

900
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:25,440
always worked out for us but you know

901
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,880
we'll see we have an opportunity to do

902
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,599
something great right and and I think

903
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:32,960
you're right we are I think we are

904
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:35,240
improving I I'm I'm you know I know we

905
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:38,039
are but there's just that overall

906
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:40,078
frustration and you know we did blow a

907
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:42,318
great opportunity I don't know how many

908
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:46,000
more we'll get yeah you know

909
00:36:42,318 --> 00:36:48,679
it's but it's also you know for for Bio

910
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,679
we're not we're not you know looking at

911
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:53,838
at food crops expanding I mean we we

912
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:56,879
developed our Salesforce with you know

913
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:59,639
kind of expertise in one plant yeah um

914
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:02,119
that that that were broadening now um we

915
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:04,400
we we have always had a a good micro

916
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:06,960
greens customer base in in in in the

917
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,480
East and um we we're doing something

918
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,639
that um we're really excited about is

919
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:15,119
we're certifying our soil is is pathogen

920
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:18,639
free salmonella leria

921
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:20,200
ecoi and and that's that's really it's

922
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:21,920
important in in for controlled

923
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:24,799
environment Agriculture and in the food

924
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:27,119
side that's really going to be important

925
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,760
I agree I mean I think same thing with

926
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:31,039
clones I think clones should be

927
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,839
certified Pest and pathogen free I think

928
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:36,159
people should put that stamp on their

929
00:37:32,838 --> 00:37:37,920
genetics pathogens are such a big deal

930
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:40,920
and for the longest time we were

931
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:43,159
ignoring it pretending it didn't exist

932
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:45,639
and then once they had to agree because

933
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:47,920
it was devastating people it was

934
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:50,239
devastating States like California I

935
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:54,079
mean I think we were so heavily infected

936
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:55,199
with hopl and viroid yeah and ferium and

937
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:57,240
I mean people aren't even talking about

938
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:58,039
ferium right now but ferium is a huge

939
00:37:57,239 --> 00:38:01,239
problem

940
00:37:58,039 --> 00:38:03,480
in East too the humidity levels are

941
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:05,039
everybody overw Waters it's just and

942
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,679
everyone wants to blame hop Lon too then

943
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:08,559
and it's like well maybe it's h maybe

944
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:10,679
it's ferium I mean there's there's other

945
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:12,960
pathogens too you know we're looking at

946
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:15,039
I think over 50 registered pathogens in

947
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,159
cannabis that they know of so I used to

948
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:20,480
have a a data Communications business

949
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:22,358
and and um we arbitraged in

950
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:27,960
international rates whether they were

951
00:38:22,358 --> 00:38:29,519
Telex or fax or or or phone um and

952
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,159
what what we would do is we'd go into

953
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:34,599
the customer and would sayl it doesn't

954
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:36,759
matter what you're paying per Telex

955
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:40,359
minute or fax minute

956
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:42,920
or killer characters for of email yeah

957
00:38:40,358 --> 00:38:44,960
your real costs are are in your your

958
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,960
business process that creates and uses

959
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:49,358
those messages for running your business

960
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,679
and storing them and retrieving them and

961
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:54,078
and confirming they were delivered and

962
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:57,480
that's where all your costs are yeah let

963
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:59,240
us paint a picture of a better world and

964
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:02,599
if you like it we'll implement it for

965
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:04,598
you and then you'll have much better

966
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:06,838
total system costs and we would El we

967
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:08,240
would eliminate the paper and the People

968
00:39:06,838 --> 00:39:09,719
by doing things like taking an

969
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:12,879
application system that would print out

970
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:15,239
an airway bill and then the person would

971
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,119
take it off the printer to a fax machine

972
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:19,078
and shove it in a fax machine on the

973
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,480
other side of the world in in the

974
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:22,640
freight forwarders other office that

975
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,079
take that fax machine paper and then'

976
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:27,400
stick it into they' key it into an

977
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:30,480
application system on the other side so

978
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:33,000
so we would hook a PC up to the

979
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:35,358
application system looking like a

980
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,280
printer it would take that printed

981
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:40,759
message turn it into an EDI message send

982
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:43,359
it through our Network Force deliver it

983
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:45,880
to a PC on the other end of the world

984
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:47,719
where our our PC would keyboard emulate

985
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:50,400
the transaction into their application

986
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:53,199
system amazing okay and so eliminating

987
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,838
the people eliminating the paper um they

988
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:56,480
saved so much more money than didn't

989
00:39:54,838 --> 00:39:59,000
matter what they paid and they were

990
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:03,119
locked in Forever with us yeah which was

991
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:05,639
a nice side um in in in terms of system

992
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:07,119
cost and cannabis you know I was sitting

993
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:09,279
there one day with with a with a

994
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:12,358
customer going over their their

995
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:15,920
cultivation costs and they were paying

996
00:40:12,358 --> 00:40:18,759
$220 for couple gallons of my

997
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:21,200
soil the pot they put in cost

998
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:23,319
$4 every time they touched the pot they

999
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:26,239
had to fill it empty it wash it

1000
00:40:23,318 --> 00:40:27,679
sterilize it was 50 cents mhm they were

1001
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:29,959
paying much more for the pot than they

1002
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:32,519
were for my media which was the whole

1003
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:35,720
basis of their successful cultivation

1004
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:36,838
and I said that sucks um so the first

1005
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:38,679
thing we tried to do is eliminate the

1006
00:40:36,838 --> 00:40:41,400
pot and so most of our soil we deliver

1007
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:44,279
today in sealed grow bags anywhere from

1008
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:47,920
one and a qu gallons up to 20 gallons

1009
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:50,880
yeah um and uh and you know you want to

1010
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:53,240
talk about you know hoo Lon vroid the

1011
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,640
number one vector is probably the path I

1012
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:57,639
would agree and and I would agree 100%

1013
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:59,279
you know and you can go through all the

1014
00:40:57,639 --> 00:41:01,838
work of sterilizing everything you

1015
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,160
should um but you might as well get rid

1016
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:05,239
of the pot and save the money and the

1017
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:07,480
labor and and

1018
00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:10,598
and you know we can engine we can

1019
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:13,400
actually engineer a bag with with micro

1020
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:15,039
parations in it that let it dry back

1021
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:18,200
beautifully much better than like a

1022
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:20,960
smart pot which is all over the place

1023
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:22,838
right um so that you know we're looking

1024
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,240
at system cost and trying to get people

1025
00:41:22,838 --> 00:41:26,639
understand where they're where they're

1026
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:28,000
spending their time when you know where

1027
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:30,480
they're spending their

1028
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,960
touch points yeah understanding all that

1029
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,240
well and there's so many little details

1030
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:36,800
that you need to be aware of when the

1031
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:38,959
profit isn't what it used to be right so

1032
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,880
every little scent counts yeah and you

1033
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,400
know and the the more you scale the more

1034
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,838
that's noticeable

1035
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,240
too but uh yeah I mean it's a different

1036
00:41:44,838 --> 00:41:49,599
world we live in a completely different

1037
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:52,479
world from the Coco that I hated in the

1038
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:54,720
year 2000 when my buddy brought over

1039
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:57,719
these bricks of cocoa that were like

1040
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:59,279
this and a kidy pool and a shovel said

1041
00:41:57,719 --> 00:42:03,358
you got to break all these

1042
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:05,480
up you know I I I really admire the the

1043
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:07,920
regenerative Farmers out there who are

1044
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:10,159
making their own soil and and really

1045
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,920
loving it and seeing the benefits I mean

1046
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:14,519
there there's no question um whether

1047
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:17,280
you're talking Korean or or biodynamic

1048
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:19,759
biodynamic biodynamic yeah versus

1049
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:24,040
kfal but but if you ever had to price

1050
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:26,760
the labor in the time into it you know

1051
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:29,159
you obviously can't scale it and and and

1052
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:30,880
it's it's is really hard to very

1053
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:33,399
difficult to SC so I heard Wrigley in

1054
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:36,358
Nevada is scaling they do they do living

1055
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:39,200
soil 40,000 sare F feet or something but

1056
00:42:36,358 --> 00:42:42,960
I think it's very difficult to scale and

1057
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:45,598
maintain quality with anything so when I

1058
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:49,519
when I was growing um for my my raw food

1059
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:54,039
restaurant yeah um we in order to to

1060
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:56,358
really trust my my compost we had to buy

1061
00:42:54,039 --> 00:42:58,279
a chicken CP and get chickens and

1062
00:42:56,358 --> 00:43:00,199
generate our own chick can manure and

1063
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:02,839
and you know making sure you could get

1064
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:06,279
clean inputs was was constantly The

1065
00:43:02,838 --> 00:43:08,558
Challenge and um controll environment

1066
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:11,480
you know you're you're monocropping

1067
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:13,800
incredible density right um it's a giant

1068
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:16,639
Buffet so

1069
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:20,318
um most people won't bring compost into

1070
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:22,679
into an indoor or uh unless they're

1071
00:43:20,318 --> 00:43:24,519
doing it themselves and they really know

1072
00:43:22,679 --> 00:43:27,318
right and then then that just becomes

1073
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:30,119
again really expensive

1074
00:43:27,318 --> 00:43:31,519
so hey guys you're doing a great job

1075
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:35,920
there's living soil that you can get

1076
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:38,440
right out of the bag yeah and uh and and

1077
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:41,039
the plants will love it

1078
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:44,039
yeah yeah so where do you see the

1079
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:46,599
industry and substrates going in the

1080
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:50,318
next five to 10

1081
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:52,000
years so again I because I do believe

1082
00:43:50,318 --> 00:43:54,679
that we're we're moving forward and

1083
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,358
we're making progress I I believe that

1084
00:43:54,679 --> 00:43:58,919
the the industry is going to go towards

1085
00:43:56,358 --> 00:44:02,318
organic cultivation I think it's going

1086
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:05,639
to go towards um

1087
00:44:02,318 --> 00:44:07,679
towards better honoring the plant and

1088
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:11,358
again that comes back to to to

1089
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:16,118
biomimicry yeah it comes down to um you

1090
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:18,639
know we just need you know literally

1091
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:21,318
four five years of the of the research

1092
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:24,078
that's going on now yeah and for it to

1093
00:44:21,318 --> 00:44:25,920
really solidify and we'll we'll just

1094
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:29,720
understand better I I'm really confident

1095
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:31,920
of that um but I I I do I do see that

1096
00:44:29,719 --> 00:44:35,159
that it has to be that has to be a

1097
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,358
priority on on the corporate level um

1098
00:44:35,159 --> 00:44:38,440
and and these guys are all getting

1099
00:44:36,358 --> 00:44:40,759
hammered throwing you know really

1100
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:43,280
mediocre [ __ ] on the market and not not

1101
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:46,160
able to differentiate themselves and and

1102
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:48,559
you know it's not it's not that hard

1103
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:50,920
yeah you know like I said I don't I I

1104
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:54,119
don't see any cost advantage to to to to

1105
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:57,639
the scale there um but you just need

1106
00:44:54,119 --> 00:45:01,318
really clean techniques and and clear

1107
00:44:57,639 --> 00:45:05,480
clear clear Sops that that you know

1108
00:45:01,318 --> 00:45:06,838
don't just take cultural practices and

1109
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:09,318
yeah I mean I think that that even

1110
00:45:06,838 --> 00:45:12,558
carries over into genetics with the Sops

1111
00:45:09,318 --> 00:45:14,920
and you know sop specific for genetics

1112
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:18,400
with companies it's like

1113
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:20,920
uh that's the future and and empowering

1114
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,240
your customers with information that's

1115
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,559
going to get them better results because

1116
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:25,919
at the end of the day quality is

1117
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:27,359
everything I think quality we we can

1118
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,838
agree that quality is what's going to

1119
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:31,039
make the difference in the future market

1120
00:45:28,838 --> 00:45:31,880
and you know having unique genetics but

1121
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:34,039
also

1122
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:35,280
quality uh qual you know it doesn't

1123
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:37,838
matter how good the genetics are if

1124
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:40,599
they're not grown well unfortunately

1125
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:44,440
yeah and and again I think that those

1126
00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:47,400
values will will naturally reemerge as a

1127
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:49,240
as a matter of of competition actually

1128
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:52,119
yeah you know and that that's obiously

1129
00:45:49,239 --> 00:45:55,598
what's happening down in Florida is um

1130
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:59,838
nit and kaana figured out how to bring

1131
00:45:55,599 --> 00:46:02,119
an effect Brands down to Florida and and

1132
00:45:59,838 --> 00:46:03,960
tuck them under his license right but

1133
00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:06,880
they they operate as

1134
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:08,880
independent cultivations but they're in

1135
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,440
his building and he's technically paying

1136
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,960
the salaries of the of the employees

1137
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:16,000
interesting but you know like I said

1138
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:16,838
that's how ideal went in down there and

1139
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,719
you

1140
00:46:16,838 --> 00:46:21,159
know there's some there's some real

1141
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:24,000
Growers down there I'm I'm impressed I'm

1142
00:46:21,159 --> 00:46:27,078
excited yeah because I feel a little bit

1143
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,280
of Floy as as a home state you know I I

1144
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:32,680
was embarrassed you know you live in

1145
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:34,400
Florida yeah yeah it's interesting uh

1146
00:46:32,679 --> 00:46:36,118
the Dynamics and then once interstate

1147
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:39,160
commerce comes into play how do you see

1148
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:44,280
that yeah you know so when I grew up in

1149
00:46:39,159 --> 00:46:46,000
Ohio um you couldn't buy California wies

1150
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:47,680
really you couldn't buy K's beer this is

1151
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,519
this is

1152
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:55,318
60s it it took 20 years plus for states

1153
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:57,239
to negotiate out the alcohol yeah um

1154
00:46:55,318 --> 00:46:59,679
restrictions that are very similar to

1155
00:46:57,239 --> 00:47:01,959
cannabis I I don't

1156
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:03,759
know what you know why Colorado is going

1157
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:07,280
to want to give up their cultivation

1158
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:08,599
taxes to California yeah um so I don't

1159
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:12,559
see it happening

1160
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:15,440
quickly um even with Federal if Federal

1161
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:17,440
was go completely legal still I I I

1162
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,119
still think the states would would would

1163
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:22,318
want to retain control from from the

1164
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:24,599
taxation standpoint yeah no I'm not

1165
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:28,039
optimistic about it happening in in the

1166
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:29,760
next 10 years yeah um but at the same

1167
00:47:28,039 --> 00:47:32,838
time I'd be the first one to tell you

1168
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:35,359
that I have an interest in a remaining

1169
00:47:32,838 --> 00:47:37,239
state by state totally you know yeah I

1170
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:38,598
mean I would love to go to Texas and be

1171
00:47:37,239 --> 00:47:41,000
be able to smoke this stuff from

1172
00:47:38,599 --> 00:47:43,559
California yeah but also if Texas could

1173
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,559
produce their own I would just also be

1174
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:49,119
happy and they will and they will I mean

1175
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:51,920
you know what I would say is that the

1176
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:56,039
the the progress of the industry is very

1177
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:57,480
much been stunted by the economics of

1178
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:59,679
the industry yeah you know people are

1179
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:01,639
just trying to survive it's rough right

1180
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:03,759
now it's really rough for cultivators

1181
00:48:01,639 --> 00:48:06,159
yeah we lost several years in a row 40%

1182
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:08,079
of our customers yeah stopped

1183
00:48:06,159 --> 00:48:09,879
operating yeah I mean it affects

1184
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:12,680
everybody so not just the cultivator

1185
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:14,838
suffer the nutrient company right the

1186
00:48:12,679 --> 00:48:16,159
substrate companies uh the lighting

1187
00:48:14,838 --> 00:48:19,159
companies and then there's an

1188
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:21,239
overabundance of some of these um

1189
00:48:19,159 --> 00:48:22,639
markets with within like even lighting

1190
00:48:21,239 --> 00:48:25,598
and other stuff like that where there's

1191
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:26,960
so many you know and I think there's

1192
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,119
there's some good products just like

1193
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,000
everything else there's good products

1194
00:48:28,119 --> 00:48:32,079
and bad products out there you know and

1195
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,719
and it's it's funny the the technology

1196
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:36,599
really is I mean I I see things every

1197
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:39,318
month you know not you know they've now

1198
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:42,599
now got lights that are killing you know

1199
00:48:39,318 --> 00:48:46,199
killing pathogens and in in in the rooms

1200
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:49,318
and and under canopy lights and yeah and

1201
00:48:46,199 --> 00:48:52,960
also the strains

1202
00:48:49,318 --> 00:48:56,159
are they're very finicky and you know o

1203
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:59,358
OG's just don't like LEDs you know no

1204
00:48:56,159 --> 00:49:02,358
they don't like they like C yeah exactly

1205
00:48:59,358 --> 00:49:05,639
so I mean and and and and there's also I

1206
00:49:02,358 --> 00:49:08,759
mean again strains

1207
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:11,480
uh there's so much drift yeah you know

1208
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:13,079
and and and we're probably I don't know

1209
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:14,199
I don't know much about this stuff but

1210
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:16,318
you know some of the things I'm reading

1211
00:49:14,199 --> 00:49:19,239
is that you know we're seeing a steady

1212
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:22,239
weakening of of of the genes from when

1213
00:49:19,239 --> 00:49:25,239
we had real land race strains and and

1214
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:28,439
the plants just less less able to adapt

1215
00:49:25,239 --> 00:49:30,558
um and I don't know if that's true but

1216
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:33,679
um the person said it with so much

1217
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:36,079
confidence I had to believe him yeah

1218
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:39,318
well I think land race varieties

1219
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:41,480
are grown in specific climates and

1220
00:49:39,318 --> 00:49:44,239
specific environments that serve a

1221
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:46,280
purpose and you know I think a lot of

1222
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:47,919
those there there wasn't the inbreeding

1223
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:49,519
that we've done now to where we're

1224
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:52,240
bottlenecking ourselves like with these

1225
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:54,039
gelato and stuff like that they're you

1226
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:55,798
know I would say that that's potentially

1227
00:49:54,039 --> 00:49:57,558
one of the contributions why we have

1228
00:49:55,798 --> 00:49:59,199
things like hop PL and viid that's such

1229
00:49:57,559 --> 00:50:01,480
a problem is because our genetics aren't

1230
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:03,279
as strong as they used to be yeah that's

1231
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:05,559
that's a really good point and I I don't

1232
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:09,280
know I remember getting getting really

1233
00:50:05,559 --> 00:50:11,359
stoned on what was probably 12 or 14%

1234
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:14,040
you know not that long ago I mean in the

1235
00:50:11,358 --> 00:50:16,279
90s even totally Sour Diesel even when

1236
00:50:14,039 --> 00:50:19,239
we first started testing it was like the

1237
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:21,040
outdoor that was 12 to 14% was really

1238
00:50:19,239 --> 00:50:22,679
strong and good it was really good I

1239
00:50:21,039 --> 00:50:24,719
mean we didn't care about percentages

1240
00:50:22,679 --> 00:50:26,318
right right exactly and now it's it's

1241
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:27,399
it's become a price marker and you know

1242
00:50:26,318 --> 00:50:30,239
in the market

1243
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:33,039
it's really sad to me that's it's really

1244
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:34,879
sad and it just is a sign of a

1245
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:37,079
uneducated Market because if people are

1246
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:39,079
buying for the THC percentage first of

1247
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:40,318
all that doesn't tell you the whole

1248
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:41,599
story it doesn't even tell you really

1249
00:50:40,318 --> 00:50:43,519
part of the story other than it's going

1250
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:45,480
to get you maybe more High than

1251
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:48,000
something else but really I'm all about

1252
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:49,719
effect like i' I'd love if they put a

1253
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,039
description of how it made you feel

1254
00:50:49,719 --> 00:50:53,480
although that's subjective it's you know

1255
00:50:52,039 --> 00:50:57,079
it's very subjective at least we could

1256
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:58,639
get an idea um or the flavor Prof FES

1257
00:50:57,079 --> 00:51:03,160
whether it's lemon or whether it's

1258
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:04,480
berries or fruit or gas you know I think

1259
00:51:03,159 --> 00:51:06,399
there's so many other ways we could

1260
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:09,039
Define I think that's that's evolving

1261
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:11,760
I've heard that you know the the the gas

1262
00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:15,519
candy yeah

1263
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:17,319
sour yeah you know designation is five

1264
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:19,079
of them whatever I me that's the way we

1265
00:51:17,318 --> 00:51:21,960
need to go and then in Humble we need

1266
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:25,039
terar we need to identify it like wine

1267
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:26,720
we yeah I would love that my partner and

1268
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:29,279
I've

1269
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:33,679
really keenly interested as to the role

1270
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:37,160
of Terre um in uh in cultivation of

1271
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:39,118
cannabis versus wine the um the

1272
00:51:37,159 --> 00:51:42,199
interesting thing though is that the

1273
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:45,160
biology you get ends up pretty much

1274
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:47,399
reflecting the nutrients you're feeding

1275
00:51:45,159 --> 00:51:50,358
um you can start with anything but it's

1276
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:52,079
it's going to change based on on what

1277
00:51:50,358 --> 00:51:53,159
you're feeding it and and the plant

1278
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:55,640
itself

1279
00:51:53,159 --> 00:51:57,239
so we're trying to nail down what that

1280
00:51:55,639 --> 00:52:01,239
what that really means we go out and

1281
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:04,919
Sample you know humble Coastline you

1282
00:52:01,239 --> 00:52:07,759
know biology and culture it and see how

1283
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:11,680
it it it worked with some you know

1284
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:14,079
plants that were you know that was a

1285
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:16,318
Terre you know we're trying to figure

1286
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:18,640
out how to to do it and measure it and

1287
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:20,960
determine whether it's sustainable or

1288
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:22,558
valid you know it's it's it's

1289
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,960
interesting areas beyond my pay grade

1290
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:25,640
for sure that's exciting to me though I

1291
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:27,119
mean because you can go up and I think I

1292
00:52:25,639 --> 00:52:29,440
talked about humble but really it's all

1293
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:30,760
around the world like terroir is you can

1294
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:32,318
go from one region to the next and you

1295
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:33,640
could taste Sour Diesel and maybe it's

1296
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:37,558
the same cut and it tastes completely

1297
00:52:33,639 --> 00:52:40,440
different well any any any cultivar is

1298
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:43,119
is both it's environment and genetics

1299
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:45,079
you can't there's no two you can take

1300
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:46,358
the same exact genetics and grow it two

1301
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:47,680
different places it's never going to be

1302
00:52:46,358 --> 00:52:49,880
the same that's what gives you the

1303
00:52:47,679 --> 00:52:51,078
phenotype is nutrition and environment

1304
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:53,280
so that's what you give you the

1305
00:52:51,079 --> 00:52:55,000
expression that you see at the end right

1306
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,119
and uh you know and all these things

1307
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,880
with environment you could have

1308
00:52:56,119 --> 00:53:00,920
different levels of humidity you can

1309
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:03,039
have different amount of sun you know

1310
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:06,559
it's like the minerality all these

1311
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:08,599
things as far as uh it's pretty amazing

1312
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:10,839
getting into this and then I also see

1313
00:53:08,599 --> 00:53:12,160
this as something where we can open this

1314
00:53:10,838 --> 00:53:14,119
up to the whole world where you can get

1315
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:16,719
a tasting experience going driving up

1316
00:53:14,119 --> 00:53:18,798
the 101 and you can stop at these farms

1317
00:53:16,719 --> 00:53:20,239
and maybe get a tasting experience and

1318
00:53:18,798 --> 00:53:21,960
then that puts the money back into the

1319
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:24,759
farmers which is really what we need to

1320
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:27,199
do I was I was really hopeful that uh

1321
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:29,440
that the Farmers Market

1322
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:32,879
legislation would pass I don't know if

1323
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:34,240
it even came up for a vote but um I

1324
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,119
thought that was really a beautiful way

1325
00:53:34,239 --> 00:53:38,719
to to to support the the northern

1326
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:41,640
Farmers yeah well we did get approved

1327
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:43,879
tasting lounges lounges cannabis lounges

1328
00:53:41,639 --> 00:53:46,159
got approved so that you know Gavin

1329
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:49,280
Newsome love him or ha him me proved

1330
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:52,719
that yeah um but can you purchase at

1331
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:54,480
them now I believe you can purchase at

1332
00:53:52,719 --> 00:53:56,598
them now they they changed that yeah so

1333
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,599
I I believe I'm not 100% but but I

1334
00:53:56,599 --> 00:54:01,280
believe you can purchase at them but you

1335
00:53:58,599 --> 00:54:02,880
obviously can't consume alcohol and it's

1336
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,680
going to be one or and I believe they

1337
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:07,358
can do cannabis

1338
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:09,598
cafes so and I love the concept of a

1339
00:54:07,358 --> 00:54:12,199
Cannabis Cafe I'm not big on putting the

1340
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:13,519
Cannabis in the food from for myself

1341
00:54:12,199 --> 00:54:16,439
just personal preference I'd rather

1342
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:18,838
smoke a amazing flour in a joint and

1343
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:20,400
then go eat some delicious food I'm with

1344
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:22,679
you but I'm sure somebody's going to

1345
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,519
change that opinion you know I mean it's

1346
00:54:22,679 --> 00:54:27,719
yeah a lot of creative people out there

1347
00:54:24,519 --> 00:54:30,519
and and um

1348
00:54:27,719 --> 00:54:32,679
you know I I when when I was in the raw

1349
00:54:30,519 --> 00:54:35,239
food business you know what heat does is

1350
00:54:32,679 --> 00:54:38,239
it melds flavors together and it

1351
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:40,879
intensifies them right um and and it

1352
00:54:38,239 --> 00:54:43,399
gets rid of water um so you can you can

1353
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:45,200
take a cultural flavor model and

1354
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:47,559
disassemble it and reassemble it with

1355
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:50,118
raw components and and you just have to

1356
00:54:47,559 --> 00:54:53,319
adjust for those that flavor intensity

1357
00:54:50,119 --> 00:54:55,880
and and and um what what what I was

1358
00:54:53,318 --> 00:54:58,440
really intrigued with I I was talking

1359
00:54:55,880 --> 00:55:02,240
with the population geneticist just the

1360
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:05,760
other day and he was talking about

1361
00:55:02,239 --> 00:55:09,358
really understanding how to to

1362
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:10,359
sequence the specific expressions of

1363
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:13,719
specific

1364
00:55:10,358 --> 00:55:16,318
trines and and then go ahead and and

1365
00:55:13,719 --> 00:55:19,118
breed from there yeah bre breed from the

1366
00:55:16,318 --> 00:55:22,079
ability to to take these you know

1367
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:24,960
subexpressions and and and put them

1368
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:27,119
together and and and and and also to

1369
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:29,280
vary the intensity

1370
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:30,318
yeah of the expression I don't

1371
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:32,960
understand it I would love to talk to

1372
00:55:30,318 --> 00:55:36,719
that guy yeah I get a bunch of questions

1373
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:38,838
he's he he's um he was at ancestry nice

1374
00:55:36,719 --> 00:55:40,358
he was leading their they had a they had

1375
00:55:38,838 --> 00:55:45,038
a division which I think they closed

1376
00:55:40,358 --> 00:55:48,318
which was was linking um sequencing to

1377
00:55:45,039 --> 00:55:50,760
specific Health outcomes yeah um and you

1378
00:55:48,318 --> 00:55:53,480
know with all the population genetics

1379
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:55,280
type of math I get excited you know we

1380
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:57,039
talk about the white papers from from

1381
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:59,359
abstracts Tech that just came out on

1382
00:55:57,039 --> 00:56:01,720
flavorants and you know sulfur based

1383
00:55:59,358 --> 00:56:04,719
compounds that are smaller than they

1384
00:56:01,719 --> 00:56:06,318
smaller molecules than tpin uhhuh um you

1385
00:56:04,719 --> 00:56:08,038
know THS and stuff like that right right

1386
00:56:06,318 --> 00:56:09,639
yeah I know yeah that gets me excited

1387
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:11,039
like breeding for those type of things

1388
00:56:09,639 --> 00:56:13,400
those type of expressions and I feel

1389
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:16,039
like there is the relation to the effect

1390
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:17,760
in the flavor oh for sure and uh you

1391
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:19,319
know I love the flavor of cannabis

1392
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,480
though I love smoking good stuff I love

1393
00:56:19,318 --> 00:56:23,400
the way it makes me

1394
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:25,280
feel um and there's something great for

1395
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:26,798
every type of occasion too so that's the

1396
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:29,240
beauty of it we have all the different

1397
00:56:26,798 --> 00:56:30,838
things in our Arsenal and we can pick

1398
00:56:29,239 --> 00:56:32,038
and choose between them it's like okay

1399
00:56:30,838 --> 00:56:34,719
I'm going to go do this I'm going to go

1400
00:56:32,039 --> 00:56:38,119
to a dead company but you know what

1401
00:56:34,719 --> 00:56:40,159
takes a long time yeah takes years it

1402
00:56:38,119 --> 00:56:41,798
does it takes all this stuff is very

1403
00:56:40,159 --> 00:56:43,679
it's it's the Slow Race we're we're

1404
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:45,960
doing the marathon and not the Sprint

1405
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:48,719
but people want the Sprint you we're

1406
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:50,720
we're Americans and a lot of Americans

1407
00:56:48,719 --> 00:56:52,679
no they want instant gratification and I

1408
00:56:50,719 --> 00:56:54,358
think that's part of the problem with

1409
00:56:52,679 --> 00:56:56,038
the Cannabis industry is it's not

1410
00:56:54,358 --> 00:56:57,798
instant gratification we didn't get here

1411
00:56:56,039 --> 00:56:59,559
over overnight it took us a long time

1412
00:56:57,798 --> 00:57:02,079
that's a great Point

1413
00:56:59,559 --> 00:57:03,920
yeah so yeah I mean it's it's still

1414
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:05,519
beautiful it's you know I mean the fact

1415
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,680
that we're here right now talking about

1416
00:57:05,519 --> 00:57:09,318
cannabis legally no one's going to come

1417
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:11,798
arrest us for talking about I think

1418
00:57:09,318 --> 00:57:14,199
that's great yeah they will close down

1419
00:57:11,798 --> 00:57:17,119
my bank account

1420
00:57:14,199 --> 00:57:19,879
yeah um but yeah you're you're right and

1421
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:21,240
I'm I'm an eternal optimist I you know I

1422
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:25,880
don't know I don't know what other

1423
00:57:21,239 --> 00:57:28,598
choice exists I'm the same you know um I

1424
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:31,318
I I I've once heard this philosophy that

1425
00:57:28,599 --> 00:57:35,240
um the guy basically said whatever

1426
00:57:31,318 --> 00:57:37,199
happens to you has to benefit you right

1427
00:57:35,239 --> 00:57:38,519
you know and he had this whole big

1428
00:57:37,199 --> 00:57:39,919
scheme that you know the universe is

1429
00:57:38,519 --> 00:57:41,880
perfect and if it wasn't it would have

1430
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:44,599
collapsed by now and so everything that

1431
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:45,838
happens must be good to happen and but I

1432
00:57:44,599 --> 00:57:48,559
just look at it from a practical

1433
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:51,119
standpoint um is is that's where you

1434
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:55,720
learn you know I mean that's that's the

1435
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:57,400
opportunity um and and uh the the only

1436
00:57:55,719 --> 00:57:59,439
thing that makes any sense to do is to

1437
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:01,480
say hey I'm going to learn from this and

1438
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:03,240
we're going to fix it yeah I mean you

1439
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:04,639
have to go through enough bad stuff to

1440
00:58:03,239 --> 00:58:06,798
really really understand it

1441
00:58:04,639 --> 00:58:09,358
unfortunately and I mean I think that's

1442
00:58:06,798 --> 00:58:13,318
part of getting older I'm 47 now and so

1443
00:58:09,358 --> 00:58:15,798
I've learned I'm almost 48 next month

1444
00:58:13,318 --> 00:58:18,079
but I've learned a lot in my 48 years

1445
00:58:15,798 --> 00:58:19,599
about what to do and what not to do and

1446
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:22,559
learning from my mistakes learning from

1447
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:23,680
my friends mistakes but I feel like you

1448
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:25,839
have to make a certain amount of

1449
00:58:23,679 --> 00:58:27,679
mistakes and you know certain amount of

1450
00:58:25,838 --> 00:58:30,599
suffer in has to go on in your life for

1451
00:58:27,679 --> 00:58:33,239
you to appreciate how wonderful this

1452
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:34,838
place really is even in the bad times I

1453
00:58:33,239 --> 00:58:37,318
think both both those points that you

1454
00:58:34,838 --> 00:58:41,239
know the appreciation but also the you

1455
00:58:37,318 --> 00:58:43,639
know the learning um the the getting it

1456
00:58:41,239 --> 00:58:46,399
right yeah you know and

1457
00:58:43,639 --> 00:58:48,960
and I my father used to say to me

1458
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:51,480
businesses don't fail because they don't

1459
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:53,119
have a reason for being they fail

1460
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:56,599
because they run out of money before

1461
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:59,318
they figure it out yeah you know and and

1462
00:58:56,599 --> 00:59:01,960
and so I I just I have to believe we we

1463
00:58:59,318 --> 00:59:03,558
we can do this we we can do it much

1464
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:07,039
better than we're doing it now and we

1465
00:59:03,559 --> 00:59:09,920
will yeah know that's and I think

1466
00:59:07,039 --> 00:59:11,920
striving for that perfection even though

1467
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:14,838
I feel like the needle constantly is

1468
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:17,159
moving I think striving for Perfection

1469
00:59:14,838 --> 00:59:18,960
is what life's all about too because I I

1470
00:59:17,159 --> 00:59:21,480
think that it's never going to be

1471
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:24,119
perfect but it could always be better

1472
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:25,798
agreed agreed to go and I hate I hate to

1473
00:59:24,119 --> 00:59:27,720
fall back on my my father had all these

1474
00:59:25,798 --> 00:59:29,960
say he call the saying sayings of

1475
00:59:27,719 --> 00:59:31,879
chairman Sam you know nice yeah all

1476
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:34,720
these really wise things he say we would

1477
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:37,680
say nobody is as good or as bad as you

1478
00:59:34,719 --> 00:59:39,719
think they are you know and and and he

1479
00:59:37,679 --> 00:59:42,159
would say business is about getting

1480
00:59:39,719 --> 00:59:43,358
people to do what you need them to do

1481
00:59:42,159 --> 00:59:44,798
whether you're working for them or

1482
00:59:43,358 --> 00:59:46,480
they're working for you whether you're

1483
00:59:44,798 --> 00:59:49,559
selling to them or they're selling to

1484
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:51,000
you right um is listening and and and

1485
00:59:49,559 --> 00:59:53,680
finding out what it's going to take to

1486
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,199
make it work for the other person and he

1487
00:59:53,679 --> 00:59:57,000
he was pretty insightful while he was

1488
00:59:55,199 --> 01:00:01,159
twisting me up

1489
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:02,838
nice I love them mentors life is all

1490
01:00:01,159 --> 01:00:03,838
about having good mentors and people

1491
01:00:02,838 --> 01:00:08,279
that we

1492
01:00:03,838 --> 01:00:11,159
can uh learn from right you know Elders

1493
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:12,319
mentors even younger even younger

1494
01:00:11,159 --> 01:00:14,318
mentors I'm learning from people that

1495
01:00:12,318 --> 01:00:16,159
are younger than me yeah uh but I

1496
01:00:14,318 --> 01:00:18,358
learned in working in the restaurant

1497
01:00:16,159 --> 01:00:19,679
industry I learned amazing things from

1498
01:00:18,358 --> 01:00:22,159
my dishwashers if you're willing to

1499
01:00:19,679 --> 01:00:25,318
learn there's amazing places you can

1500
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:26,960
find information and right you know

1501
01:00:25,318 --> 01:00:28,838
especially cooking you know it's like we

1502
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:31,798
had a guy I learned how to

1503
01:00:28,838 --> 01:00:36,000
make uh amazing food from one of my

1504
01:00:31,798 --> 01:00:38,318
dishwashers so if you had one piece of

1505
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:42,599
information for your younger self going

1506
01:00:38,318 --> 01:00:45,798
into the the industry with bio

1507
01:00:42,599 --> 01:00:49,480
365 what would that piece be my dilemma

1508
01:00:45,798 --> 01:00:52,119
with bio 65 bio 365 excuse me is that

1509
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:53,679
I'm too old yeah uh and I wanted it to

1510
01:00:52,119 --> 01:00:56,440
happen too fast I didn't want to wait 10

1511
01:00:53,679 --> 01:00:58,399
years and I couldn't force it especially

1512
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:00,000
with the way the industry was you know

1513
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:01,838
we were doubling every year even though

1514
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,358
40% of our customers were going out of

1515
01:01:01,838 --> 01:01:07,798
business but you couldn't you couldn't

1516
01:01:04,358 --> 01:01:11,239
sustain it and and so I think that was

1517
01:01:07,798 --> 01:01:14,838
my my biggest uh take on on the trise we

1518
01:01:11,239 --> 01:01:16,598
we actually went through a real so

1519
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:19,400
there's something called Klein's coraly

1520
01:01:16,599 --> 01:01:21,318
to Murphy's Law you know Murphy's Law is

1521
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:23,680
whatever can go wrong will go wrong

1522
01:01:21,318 --> 01:01:25,920
right Klein's corer is whatever hasn't

1523
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:27,480
gone wrong yet is just waiting for an in

1524
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:32,760
opportune

1525
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:35,199
time so you know we open by 365 with two

1526
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:37,880
pilot lines in New York and California

1527
01:01:35,199 --> 01:01:40,679
and reading and

1528
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:42,400
uh when we validated that that that we

1529
01:01:40,679 --> 01:01:45,838
had something and we wanted to invest in

1530
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:48,760
it built a scaled plant in courland New

1531
01:01:45,838 --> 01:01:50,519
York yeah and that plant had a $40 a

1532
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:54,200
yard

1533
01:01:50,519 --> 01:01:56,599
better uh direct labor cost than than

1534
01:01:54,199 --> 01:02:00,118
the plant and breing

1535
01:01:56,599 --> 01:02:03,680
and at the time which was the end of

1536
01:02:00,119 --> 01:02:06,480
2019 um the shipping from New York to

1537
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:09,199
California was $40 a yard so it looked

1538
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:12,318
like a wash the intelligent thing to do

1539
01:02:09,199 --> 01:02:15,159
was to close down the reading plant um

1540
01:02:12,318 --> 01:02:17,079
get rid of the the the the overhead of

1541
01:02:15,159 --> 01:02:19,879
the the plant rent and the manager the

1542
01:02:17,079 --> 01:02:22,039
stuff that wasn't direct labor um and

1543
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:26,838
build a new one in California you know

1544
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:30,200
and we did that Clos it in January 2020

1545
01:02:26,838 --> 01:02:32,558
and Co hit and the freight rate

1546
01:02:30,199 --> 01:02:35,439
tripled all of a sudden we were losing

1547
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:37,680
$200,000 a month in Freight penalty for

1548
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:41,358
not having the West Coast

1549
01:02:37,679 --> 01:02:42,480
Factory and then we it's covid so try

1550
01:02:41,358 --> 01:02:45,880
couldn't go out couldn't go out looking

1551
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:47,880
to find a place till the lockups ended

1552
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:51,200
couldn't find a place because Logistics

1553
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:54,000
warehouse space was so in demand for for

1554
01:02:51,199 --> 01:02:56,798
the logistics um ordered all the

1555
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:59,960
equipment which took two years to arrive

1556
01:02:56,798 --> 01:03:01,880
because the the control boxes were they

1557
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:04,278
couldn't get the semiconductors for

1558
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:05,720
right so I mean we lost a phenomenal

1559
01:03:04,278 --> 01:03:08,760
amount of money during that period just

1560
01:03:05,719 --> 01:03:11,598
in Freight penalty and and that that was

1561
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:12,920
just bad bad luck because I it wasn't

1562
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:16,000
the wrong

1563
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:19,440
decision um and retrospect it might have

1564
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:22,000
been but um that that was the toughest

1565
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:26,480
thing for us to overcome um and and

1566
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:29,199
finally we did and and so it's

1567
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:31,240
I I think that you know it was hard to

1568
01:03:29,199 --> 01:03:33,679
get the market to understand that we

1569
01:03:31,239 --> 01:03:35,719
weren't just a commodity substrate right

1570
01:03:33,679 --> 01:03:38,639
that we weren't just like a charar or

1571
01:03:35,719 --> 01:03:40,919
you know real coco or what whatever and

1572
01:03:38,639 --> 01:03:42,960
and you know so that that's been our

1573
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:44,278
biggest challenge but I think we're

1574
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:46,400
getting to the point where people

1575
01:03:44,278 --> 01:03:47,798
understand who we are and they see all

1576
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:50,400
the people growing in it and they go

1577
01:03:47,798 --> 01:03:51,798
something must be going on there and so

1578
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:54,639
that's that's that's gotten us over the

1579
01:03:51,798 --> 01:03:56,920
top and we're now you know profitable

1580
01:03:54,639 --> 01:03:59,118
and growing and and and and hope to

1581
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:00,838
continue um as I said in in in other

1582
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:03,440
