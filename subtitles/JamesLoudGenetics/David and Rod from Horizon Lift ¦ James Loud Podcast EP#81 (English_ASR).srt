having us dude thank you guys for coming

9
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:29,399
on so we've become friends over the last

10
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:32,200
six months uh originally we were

11
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:33,479
introduced through grow world and I

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,320
thought you guys had an interesting

13
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:38,039
product you guys came down toward the

14
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,079
facility and said that you thought you

15
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:41,640
had a good product for us I started

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,280
getting all these ideas on what we could

17
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,640
do with your system and you guys had

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,280
these ideas and you met with our our

19
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,399
main grower and we kind of came up with

20
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,198
a concept that worked and I feel like

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,198
you guys have something really special

22
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:55,839
Thanks James I mean we think that you

23
00:00:54,198 --> 00:00:58,238
know products shouldn't be pitched they

24
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,480
should be proven you know so we created

25
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:00,759
a product and we're trying to get it out

26
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:02,640
there and let people find out for

27
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:04,319
themselves how well it works yeah so

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,000
let's tell everybody a little bit about

29
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:10,079
what you guys doing in the lift my story

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,438
goes back to 1981 yeah so um well before

31
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:15,759
the lift um I was involved in the um

32
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:17,359
retail sales of products um in Portland

33
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,719
Oregon right um little place called

34
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:21,359
light Manufacturing Company there was

35
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:23,640
two of us in the whole town um spring

36
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:25,478
forward you know I got on Craig hard

37
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,000
Graves radar and endered up at Sunlight

38
00:01:25,478 --> 00:01:30,519
Supply and I've touched over 2,000

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,519
products in this industry today amazing

40
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:34,158
yeah it's been it's been a fun run so

41
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:36,879
I'll interject and say that's how

42
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,399
actually we got introduced to Rod is we

43
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,359
used to sell we call xrt but you guys

44
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:43,159
probably know it as a rope ratchet and

45
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:46,200
we started selling those through Rod he

46
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:48,680
found us and contacted us said I think I

47
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,960
could sell a lot of these for you and we

48
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,520
did and had a great time with it and

49
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:55,319
then he contacted us again this was

50
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:58,319
probably close to like eight years ago

51
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:02,239
now and he said hey this is going from a

52
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:04,919
garage and a closet to a corporate

53
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:07,000
commercial facility how do we take it

54
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,598
from going from selling our rope

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,800
ratchets in a closet or in a small only

56
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:14,959
four to 12 lights to a thousand light

57
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,879
facility how do we actually make it

58
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,080
easier for the consumer he said can you

59
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:22,120
take what you guys have created with the

60
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,480
Rope ratchet and automate it and then

61
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,360
that's basically what started our

62
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:28,759
relationship and uh we've been trying to

63
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,360
perfect it for eight years now and took

64
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:33,560
about five but we've been selling it for

65
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,000
the last three so um yeah that's how and

66
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,039
the ratchets have been around forever

67
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,919
that was that's what we all used

68
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:41,840
ratchets are versions of rout some

69
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:43,280
people use chains you know but like I

70
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,680
think that what you guys have is very

71
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,479
Innovative in the sense that you've

72
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:50,400
automated something that we've all used

73
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:53,079
uh that actually can improve the quality

74
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,959
of the product uh improve efficiencies I

75
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,480
think it's great well the evolution of

76
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,239
light hangers was Jack chain yeah you

77
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:00,679
know completely through the 80s it was

78
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:02,640
Jack chain

79
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,640
nobody moved their lights you know and

80
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,439
then it was the grow yo-yo I think we

81
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:09,238
all remember the grow yo-yo with the

82
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:10,560
spring inside and after about a time one

83
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:11,560
side would go down and you'd walk in

84
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,719
your room and the lights sitting

85
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,439
sideways in your room over your canopy

86
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:19,318
um so the grow grow yoyo was just an

87
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:21,400
unefficient product yeah um we went to a

88
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:23,039
sales meeting and the owner of the

89
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,959
company brought this product from Bart

90
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,079
and handed it to me and said what do you

91
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,598
think about this and I said don't say

92
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,439
another word let me contact the patent

93
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:32,158
holders so

94
00:03:30,438 --> 00:03:34,560
found out who the patent holder was

95
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:36,120
these gentlemen and we cut a deal and

96
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,759
became the exclusive vendor of the

97
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,200
product um first time the industry's

98
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:42,639
ever seen this product and we called it

99
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:44,280
sun grip yeah um and we all know what

100
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,639
happened after that I mean Sun grip went

101
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,719
crazy um everybody started coming in to

102
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:50,479
compete the knockoffs started showing up

103
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,239
and you know unfortunately it's really

104
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:54,518
tough to stop the knockoffs you know

105
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,799
when really tough when they start coming

106
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:58,039
um there's just too big of a Floodgate

107
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,560
you know you just can't poke all the

108
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:02,878
holes fast enough right and you know

109
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,239
it's like whacka all yeah exactly and

110
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:06,120
people that deliver free to your house

111
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,680
and stuff didn't help that at all you

112
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,599
know so um you got a lot of direct sales

113
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,959
happening in today's environment yeah

114
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:15,839
the direct sales have really changed the

115
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,199
industry I mean as a whole yeah where we

116
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,079
used to go to grow shops and buy

117
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,639
everything from Grow shops and we had

118
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:22,879
you know vendors that that sent products

119
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:24,079
to these Grow shops that were real

120
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:25,560
knowledgeable and then you had people at

121
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:27,560
Grow shops that were extremely

122
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,759
knowledgeable and they would help you

123
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,120
select the best products for your

124
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,680
environment now everything is online and

125
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,879
people want to go direct with everything

126
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,360
and I think that's actually kind of

127
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:40,240
taken away some of the beauty of our

128
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,879
industry yeah and I think you know the

129
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,280
one thing they they Overlook is you know

130
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:46,240
customer service versus price point yeah

131
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:48,159
it's great to get a great price but if

132
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,879
something fails with the product who's

133
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,680
going to support it right there's nobody

134
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:54,079
at the other end of the phone well we've

135
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,800
seen problems big problems in this

136
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:58,359
industry with the lack of customer

137
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,800
service from lighting companies to other

138
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,560
products where there's a phone number

139
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,960
and nobody ever gets back to you and

140
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,720
what do you do if you have lights that

141
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:06,079
you've spent you know especially with

142
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,039
these larger facilities where you spend

143
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:08,560
all this money on lights and then you

144
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:10,000
don't have customer service or you don't

145
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,038
have this or you don't have that and

146
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,680
it's like it's it's changed the game

147
00:05:12,038 --> 00:05:15,519
completely and you know it's less

148
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,400
personable yeah and it's funny you say

149
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:19,159
lighting you know I mean without

150
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:21,038
customer service you know lighting's got

151
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,360
a whole bunch of holes in it yeah so I

152
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:25,680
mean it's hard to repeat a light over

153
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,000
and over and over and hit 100% you know

154
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,800
all lighting has a failure rate we just

155
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,120
hope that's a small one um so knowing

156
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,879
that all lights are going to fail at

157
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,319
some point customer service is

158
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:38,000
imperative right it's a disservice to

159
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:39,800
just hand somebody a box and go good

160
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,360
luck when you guys are like gortex for

161
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,240
lighting right so you guys improve the

162
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,720
efficiency of a light uh I I think that

163
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,600
there's a bunch of different uh

164
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,960
interesting ways you can utilize the

165
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,160
lift but yeah we're using it here and we

166
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:56,879
veg in a small amount of canopy and so

167
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,240
that saves us light and then we're we're

168
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,000
lowering them way down and then as the

169
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,160
plants get get taller we expand that so

170
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,600
we're saving money right out the gate

171
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,599
right and then we're able to dial the

172
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,479
ppfd in U and then change it from

173
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:11,159
day-to-day as the plants grow we can we

174
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:13,959
can raise it up or we can concentrate

175
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,599
the ppfd I think uh it's a great product

176
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:19,399
for that and I will say sorry Rod but I

177
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:22,079
will say that we initially how Rod

178
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:24,079
proposed kind of this project was how do

179
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:25,758
we get people off ladders how do we make

180
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:28,279
their lives more efficient how do we

181
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,720
save them customer or employee work

182
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:34,318
hours that was kind of the start of it

183
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:37,039
and we didn't even really think about

184
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,479
grow increasing your yield um you know

185
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:41,399
having more THC you know that wasn't

186
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:42,839
even a part of our equation when we made

187
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:45,279
this and this was almost just like an

188
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:47,399
added benefit of being able to

189
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:50,679
constantly have the ppfd in the perfect

190
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:52,279
position then it Growers who know what

191
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,639
they're doing have already been doing

192
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:59,959
that but the average let's say newbie

193
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:01,079
grower doesn't do that uh properly per L

194
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:02,198
I don't know what the word is a lot of

195
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:03,758
people don't even have par meters in

196
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:05,319
their house yeah that don't even do that

197
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,080
and they're just going off eyeballing or

198
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:09,960
even temperature readers which is also

199
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:12,120
super important so uh we feel like if we

200
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:14,519
took the ppfd reader with the surface

201
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,240
Leaf temperature reading uh we found

202
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:19,038
like we found like the sweet spot to

203
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,598
grow which was an added bonus on top of

204
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:23,639
not having your employees get on ladders

205
00:07:20,598 --> 00:07:25,319
anymore and and etc etc for safety right

206
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:27,079
it's all run from an iPad I love it

207
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,080
exactly or your phone yeah or your phone

208
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:31,159
yeah now it's a it's a world of

209
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:32,639
efficiency now you know when I started

210
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,599
hearing people go you know how much can

211
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,319
you grow a grand of weed for yeah you

212
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:38,598
know it's like well we never really

213
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,639
cared about that you know if you really

214
00:07:38,598 --> 00:07:41,759
think about it wow a guy's got to get

215
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,158
really efficient if people are going to

216
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,240
start playing that game you know because

217
00:07:44,158 --> 00:07:47,120
there are some people that are pretty

218
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,400
crafty yeah you know and they they

219
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,079
lessen the inputs um and still get a

220
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:54,359
great product you know Horizon lift

221
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:56,158
doesn't add cost to the grow you know

222
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,280
you're simply moving a light up and down

223
00:07:56,158 --> 00:08:00,079
you know and it's four to five movements

224
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:03,559
a cycle at most

225
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:05,639
you know for 2 seconds so you know it's

226
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,639
a product that came into the environment

227
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:10,800
made it a better environment without

228
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:12,840
adding cost um or additional labor yeah

229
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,759
um because we all know labor is a huge

230
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:17,198
component of a grow now huge um

231
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,479
electricity and labor and like you

232
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,280
talked about electric labor if you can

233
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:24,439
save on those two things then you're you

234
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:26,279
know I think at the end of the day

235
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:28,598
people want to grow the highest quality

236
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:31,079
product possible at the cheapest price

237
00:08:28,598 --> 00:08:34,360
possible yeah like abely right

238
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:36,278
absolutely without sorry but without

239
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,120
taking away from the quality is the most

240
00:08:36,278 --> 00:08:39,879
important part right that's has to well

241
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,080
now there's this race to the bottom and

242
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:45,120
so 10 years ago before all this

243
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,879
commercialization like this really

244
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,839
increased commercialization of the

245
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:50,759
product uh you could get away with

246
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:53,480
selling an average quality product but

247
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:55,240
now today there's plenty of average

248
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,839
stuff out there but it doesn't go for a

249
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,799
lot so if you're and also how much do

250
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,560
you produce that pound for you produce

251
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:03,759
that pound for $600 and you can only

252
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:05,119
sell it for seven that's a problem right

253
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:07,759
and you produce it for three and sell it

254
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,560
for seven that's a different story but

255
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:12,000
there's so much product on the market

256
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:14,439
like especially in California we have

257
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,759
this surplus of product yet we only

258
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:20,440
consume so much so in metric especially

259
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:22,600
with the recreational Cannabis it's like

260
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,480
recreational and medical there's there's

261
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,759
only so much product that we need people

262
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,278
want the best product they can get for

263
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,838
the price so unless you're growing the

264
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:30,720
best you might as well just quit I mean

265
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:33,320
that's my opinion right now and so

266
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,360
quality has to be the leading Factor whe

267
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,959
and it starts with genetics but then

268
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,959
it's also inputs and all these other

269
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:41,239
things that that happened over a period

270
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:43,359
of the life of the plant you know and

271
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,680
you back in the 80s and 90s you know the

272
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,919
indoor environment was the only

273
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:49,919
environment you know for multiple

274
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:52,039
reasons you know so I think there's more

275
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:53,879
study and more time on the indoor

276
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:56,799
environment than any other environment

277
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:59,720
you know there's a lot being done now um

278
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:01,559
but I still think today um all the is

279
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,120
really from an indoor environment I mean

280
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:05,078
people are kind of feeling their way

281
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,278
through hoop houses and green houses and

282
00:10:05,078 --> 00:10:08,559
double teers and you know everybody's

283
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:11,320
kind of finding their way through that

284
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:13,319
right now to where there's 35 years of

285
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,560
indoor growing out there and we probably

286
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,839
wouldn't be growing indoors at the level

287
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:18,759
we're grown at if it wasn't for

288
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,640
prohibition of marijuana you know I mean

289
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:21,958
I think abely we were grown outside and

290
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,199
then people wanted to hide from the

291
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:26,159
police yeah helicopters over your fields

292
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,720
and all that stuff and that was what was

293
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:29,039
going on right yeah and so we we went

294
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,240
indoors and then they did were not

295
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,559
allowed research it right federally it's

296
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,240
like you can't research because it's a

297
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:36,638
bad plan it's illegal all these things

298
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,959
and you know we've lived in this

299
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:41,879
backwards world and now indoor is

300
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:43,399
fetching the most price it's you know

301
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:46,519
it's supposed to be the best I don't

302
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:49,000
honestly think indoor is the best in in

303
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:50,759
every regard I think there's a place for

304
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,720
outdoor there's a place for Greenhouse I

305
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:54,838
think there's a place for light lifts in

306
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,120
a greenhouse you know I think we

307
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:57,839
actually are in a greenhouse up in

308
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:00,278
Oregon that's helped out actually them

309
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,399
quite a bit so yeah but supplemental

310
00:11:00,278 --> 00:11:04,919
right like so exactly cuz you have the

311
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,919
sun in addition to and I think that's a

312
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:08,240
great thing and you know what I ran into

313
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:09,519
and you know when you introduce a

314
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,919
product all sorts of things come out of

315
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,480
the Woodworks green houses aren't always

316
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:15,559
structured the same right so you have an

317
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,519
amount of weight that you're going to

318
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:19,958
put on that ceiling in a greenhouse um

319
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:21,759
some of them can't take it because

320
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:23,359
you're using Unistrut you know you're

321
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:25,958
adding too much additional weight to

322
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,839
that structure some grease houses can

323
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:30,599
yeah so you know in that environment you

324
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,000
would have to certify the weight you

325
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,519
know make sure the structure is going to

326
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,039
hold the weight um and then go because

327
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:40,000
it is huge advantage in Greenhouse

328
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:42,240
environments yeah um I I'm just cautious

329
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,078
to go hey everybody put these up in your

330
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,240
Greenhouse um because there is going to

331
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:48,078
be structural Integrity problems well I

332
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,159
think the definition of a greenhouse is

333
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:52,359
so broad yeah right so what there can be

334
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:54,319
so many different types I mean some

335
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,600
people consider hoop houses green houses

336
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,278
right and it's like yeah but these Dutch

337
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,079
green houses the venl like these glass

338
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:02,919
houses they can support you know they

339
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:04,559
they cost more than indoor GRS typically

340
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:06,679
yeah so you know especially for the

341
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:08,638
nicer ones yeah I think Rod's talking

342
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:10,479
about like up in Oregon the green houses

343
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,680
that have been there for 30 years cuz

344
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,240
like we've actually sold to a greenhouse

345
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:16,719
in Texas and I mentioned that about

346
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,120
structure and they're like we're waited

347
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,240
for a hurricane so this thing's not

348
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,278
going anywhere you know difference yeah

349
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,799
all these cutf flower green houses that

350
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:26,799
you converted into cannabis and all

351
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:29,159
these things they're not all suitable

352
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:31,000
for the lift and some a lot of people

353
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:33,159
people don't have power anyway not

354
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,240
everybody but you know power has to be

355
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:37,919
consideration too but I'm a fan of

356
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:40,198
supplemental lighting light lifts I like

357
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:42,240
under canopy I think they all need to be

358
00:12:40,198 --> 00:12:43,639
explored we're exploring them together

359
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,879
we're doing a trial with the under

360
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:47,000
canopy we're doing a trial with the

361
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:48,198
liift and then together for seed

362
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,799
production I think we're the only ones

363
00:12:48,198 --> 00:12:51,679
doing that right now I'm excited for

364
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:52,958
that yeah me too and I think the results

365
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:55,159
that we get from that it's going to be

366
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:57,000
really telling because I know that we're

367
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:58,039
going to get more from the Light Lift I

368
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,839
know that we're going to get more from

369
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:01,679
the under canopy now if we combine them

370
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,279
what happens yeah what happens I know so

371
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:05,679
that's a mystery but we're going to

372
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:07,720
explore that yeah I love it yeah yeah

373
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:10,278
it's fun you know I think I've got seven

374
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,680
years into this product yeah um and you

375
00:13:10,278 --> 00:13:14,078
know every product that I ever put

376
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:15,799
across a goal line I personally test it

377
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:17,000
you know it was just a rule that I had

378
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:18,879
with myself if I'm going to tell

379
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,958
somebody else to use it then I got to

380
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:23,000
know in my heart that it works right

381
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:24,679
yeah you know that this isn't snake oil

382
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,240
and you know there's been some products

383
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:27,919
that people just absolutely scratch

384
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,039
their head at you know I mean I'll take

385
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:31,719
you back to frequency water

386
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:33,879
right I mean my sales staff wanted to

387
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,560
freaking shoot me they're like Rod there

388
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:38,078
is no frequency water and I'm like well

389
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:40,638
you tell me why I sprayed that on a bug

390
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:44,638
and the bug is gone right and I tested

391
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:46,600
it and it's water right so I mean if you

392
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,320
can tell me what I'm missing here you

393
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,240
know I'll go a different direction but

394
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:54,440
for now I think I got the Holy Grail you

395
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:56,519
know I have no chemicals no residue I'm

396
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,560
spraying water on bugs and killing them

397
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:01,839
yeah you know with frequency and

398
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:05,198
I'm not a technician do I know that

399
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:07,079
there was frequency in there no but

400
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:09,479
whatever was in there I tested it and it

401
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:11,719
was water and it was killing bugs yeah

402
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,399
so along my path I've run into some

403
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,680
really strange products that you know

404
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:17,278
went this is super beneficial for this

405
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:19,479
environment but people go I don't

406
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:21,480
believe it it's snake oil well there's

407
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,720
been so much snake oil out there and

408
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,240
then also we we get these things and it

409
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:28,120
takes a long time to actually perfect

410
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,680
them right so like purple LED lights

411
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,078
that's a reference that we've used on

412
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:32,919
this show so much but it's like

413
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:36,078
something that I did not believe in when

414
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:37,879
I heard LEDs and I saw purples the blur

415
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:40,000
I was like no way am I ever going to use

416
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:42,320
that you got a six inch tall or one foot

417
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,879
tall plant this looks like trash I I

418
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,360
don't want any part of that autof

419
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:49,559
flowers don't want any part of it but

420
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,600
people are creative people are

421
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:54,559
persistent people will figure out how to

422
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,360
improve stuff and sometimes for LED

423
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:59,399
lights example there's a standard down

424
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,639
everybody uses LED you know that's you

425
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,759
and and that's the beauty of this

426
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,799
industry too is that we are Innovative

427
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:07,800
and we are creative you guys have

428
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:09,078
Innovation and I think right when we

429
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:11,599
think we've got it all figured out

430
00:15:09,078 --> 00:15:12,719
something else new comes out yeah always

431
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,199
and you see that especially and it's

432
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,199
just being a steward of the environment

433
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:18,120
you know I mean you go you know I've

434
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:20,599
done this the same way for over and over

435
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:23,159
and over how can I make it better right

436
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,440
you know and my job was to create

437
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:28,120
products to make the environment better

438
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,480
um and when that when the ratchets all

439
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,360
the data we collected on the ratchets um

440
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,120
showed us that people move their lights

441
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,839
yeah you know people tell me today it's

442
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,399
like why do you need to move your lights

443
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,319
and I'm like I don't know but I've

444
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:41,720
collected a shitload of data and people

445
00:15:40,318 --> 00:15:43,078
move their lights there's a reason

446
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,720
they're buying ratchets and not Jack

447
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:47,318
chain yeah right so they wouldn't buy

448
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,800
the ratchets if they weren't relocating

449
00:15:47,318 --> 00:15:50,639
their lights and then I went around to a

450
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:53,159
bunch of rooms and said how often do you

451
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,399
move these people move them a lot more

452
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:58,240
than you would think yeah so knowing

453
00:15:55,399 --> 00:16:00,399
that I went well let's make this easier

454
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,079
let's automate what if a guy could stand

455
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,278
in his doorway with his phone and

456
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:08,159
readjust his whole room I mean how long

457
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:10,120
is that to take versus standing in the

458
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:11,719
room with a with an application right

459
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:14,679
you know and so then I went to them and

460
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,560
said is this possible you know and we

461
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:19,039
revved it and revved it and revved it

462
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:21,078
with weights and motors and on and on

463
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:23,000
and on I mean it's not a simple process

464
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:25,439
it was about five years of R&amp;D five

465
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,480
years R&amp;D seven revisions you know is

466
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,720
what you're looking at today and and I'm

467
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,360
really happy with it yeah you you know

468
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,480
we get the comment you know why did you

469
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,278
go

470
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,680
Bluetooth not everybody's got Wi-Fi

471
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:39,399
right it's line of sight and I don't

472
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:41,000
want the thing to move lights in every

473
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:42,519
room yeah I want them to move them

474
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,919
within a certain distance so that I'm

475
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:46,560
looking at the room that's moving and

476
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:48,838
not the one down the street right so you

477
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:50,559
know it made more sense for the

478
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:53,079
environment that we were in there's a

479
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:55,000
lot of confusion in that environment I

480
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:58,519
will add sorry I will add to that is

481
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:02,120
that the few questions we've gotten

482
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:03,759
about Wi-Fi versus Bluetooth was some

483
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,798
want to have a just a completely

484
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:08,880
automated place they want to be able to

485
00:17:05,798 --> 00:17:11,279
sit in a computer room at their house

486
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,760
and be able to see a video of their

487
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:16,399
facility and be able to touch a button

488
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:19,720
they want they sensor that changes that

489
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,959
so we've actually looked into that and

490
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,480
the difference is is one is sensors

491
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:26,919
aren't perfect two your height of your

492
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,160
canopy is never perfectly even it's

493
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:30,559
always going to grab the top one so we

494
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,798
felt that it was just in the best

495
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:35,918
interest of the grower to be in the room

496
00:17:33,798 --> 00:17:38,759
if you're growing the high quality you

497
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,960
know marijuana that you're hoping for

498
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:42,480
you're going to have to be there and be

499
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,640
Hands-On you can't do it from a separate

500
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,640
control room well and I think there is

501
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,400
some future that does include stuff like

502
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,160
that where it's 100% automated and you

503
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,320
have a sensor and every day as the

504
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,600
plants are growing taller it could move

505
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:58,119
it up if you're trying to keep the

506
00:17:54,599 --> 00:18:00,279
perfect you know ppfd you had it y or

507
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:02,639
Leaf surface temperature or however you

508
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:04,759
want to monitor that I mean I think

509
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,759
maybe someday that's going to be the

510
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:09,798
next Evolution yeah yeah we do have that

511
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:13,279
capability and we could actually do it

512
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:15,200
but we haven't seen that it's worth it

513
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:17,079
at this point but I do think that it

514
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,798
will eventually go in that direction

515
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:20,119
yeah I mean I see the future is there's

516
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:21,440
going to be places where they don't have

517
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:23,798
a lot of employees because the thing is

518
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,400
is what we need to do is you know save

519
00:18:23,798 --> 00:18:26,839
money as much as possible create the

520
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,200
best product possible at the lowest

521
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:30,079
price and so they're going to take away

522
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,679
labor cu Labor's expensive expensive if

523
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:34,319
we could take away electricity or you

524
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:36,159
know Turn Down the Lights make the

525
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:39,200
lights more efficient that's another way

526
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:41,440
but either way the the cost of the

527
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,720
product is extremely important and

528
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,919
everybody is very aware of every penny

529
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,640
that they're spending these days the

530
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:49,559
ones that are still here yep yeah and

531
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,640
I've Ted a lot of facilities in Europe

532
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:53,839
yeah Europe is very very cautious on

533
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,400
price points yeah so I mean they have

534
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:57,480
some of the most efficient grows I've

535
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,519
ever seen um as well as I toured a lot

536
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,120
of RADS facilities over there yeah and

537
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:02,918
you talk about green houses you know

538
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:04,279
they got roller structures in them to

539
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:06,360
where when they change the lights they

540
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:07,440
put a dolly up on top and they roll

541
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:10,000
across the top of the greenhouse

542
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,000
changing bulbs yeah so I mean they build

543
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,759
structure into their green houses to

544
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,279
make them more efficient um some of the

545
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:18,759
most amazing grows I've ever seen in my

546
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:20,960
life over there yeah I mean the some of

547
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:23,119
those Dutch green houses are just

548
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,159
unbelievable you know and I mean the

549
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:26,798
technology that goes into it it's like

550
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:28,919
uh you have the full control of an

551
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:31,639
indoor with the light of the Sun and

552
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:33,880
supplemental lighting M yeah and their

553
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,840
technology is amazing too you know them

554
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,240
having the largest flowers in the world

555
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:39,639
yeah um obviously comes from their Bloom

556
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,079
stimulant I went over there and kicked

557
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,880
tires on Bloom stimulant and some of

558
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:44,519
their technology is just out of this

559
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,679
world well they have so many years of

560
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:48,319
R&amp;D you know they've been r&amp; ding this

561
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:50,919
stuff forever plus they have a really

562
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:53,720
good environment for r&amp; ding in the cold

563
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:55,120
in the winter extremes you know like if

564
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,600
you look at extremes it's a great place

565
00:19:55,119 --> 00:20:00,359
to test stuff out in extremes how how

566
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:03,439
well does it do when it gets zero mhm

567
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:05,558
yeah you know House and Garden yeah you

568
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,759
know I mean very successful European

569
00:20:05,558 --> 00:20:09,678
nutrient and you know I sat down with

570
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:11,119
that team you know and they were

571
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,840
completely happy with the distribution

572
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:17,279
they had and shaked my hand and said you

573
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:18,879
won't be selling ours wow so it was a

574
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,119
bold move you know I thought I had the

575
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,760
world in my hand I said you know we're

576
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:24,199
National distributor you know we can put

577
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:27,000
you all over the United States in 24

578
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:30,640
hours um and he shook my hand and said

579
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,440
no thanks yeah you know I well back to

580
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,200
home I gold that's how it goes not

581
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,840
taking the bag of tricks home this time

582
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,319
you know but you know I've seen some

583
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:40,000
really neat stuff over there I mean

584
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:43,158
Europe is an amazing place to learn you

585
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,839
know about growing yeah um not that

586
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:46,600
America is you know that far behind them

587
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:48,000
but right and but it's different it's

588
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:49,158
different over there like it's just like

589
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,279
it's different here there's a lot of

590
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:52,360
great things if you want to learn about

591
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:54,960
genetics there's good things you can

592
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:57,158
learn in Europe especially Dutch Dutch

593
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,038
and and over in Spain and over in in

594
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:00,520
Holland but also here I mean we have

595
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:02,839
amazing scientists here and I think we

596
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:04,839
have people pushing the envelope in

597
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:06,119
every region of the world right now yeah

598
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:08,639
and if you think about it you know the

599
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:12,359
one example I would use is gavita yeah

600
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,679
you know hey Twan jer what's up Bros so

601
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:15,479
you know went over there there were some

602
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,919
of the first people I met and you know

603
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,919
developed a really good relationship

604
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:22,679
with them and you know was able to bring

605
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,159
that back to sunlight yeah um we did

606
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:25,480
really well with that yeah I mean they

607
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,039
made a great light too especially the

608
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,400
double-ended gavita when it first came

609
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:31,038
out was a game fantastic you know there

610
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:34,120
and the the first one I remember that

611
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:35,440
was double Ed was the epap that papon

612
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:37,000
right and so that came out and that was

613
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,000
great that was a greenhouse light and

614
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,640
then gavita is like just put all these

615
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,119
indoors people tried putting the eaps

616
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:46,320
indoors but really the gavita kind of

617
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:48,239
changed the game uh as as also as far as

618
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:50,439
like the quality that it put out you

619
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,278
know I was pretty impressed the first

620
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,960
the first harvest with the gavita and

621
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:56,278
there was some big players involved with

622
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,120
epap yeah you know I thought epap was

623
00:21:56,278 --> 00:22:00,079
going to be the platform and uh

624
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:01,639
everybody I'll tell you Twan and J ear

625
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:02,759
outworked them yeah you know they came

626
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,320
to the United States and just flat

627
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:07,960
outworked them yeah so they they did an

628
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:09,879
amazing job yeah it was impressive it

629
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,759
was impress that that whole period was

630
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,278
really impressive because that was kind

631
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:15,359
of the beginning of the

632
00:22:13,278 --> 00:22:18,038
commercialization of cannabis right

633
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:19,639
where it really took on a whole new it

634
00:22:18,038 --> 00:22:21,720
was like this whole new momentum that we

635
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,679
were experiencing that we' never seen

636
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,440
before and it's like what's next what's

637
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,798
next and everything was bigger than the

638
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,120
the previous move and people were

639
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:31,519
getting these big grows in Colorado and

640
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:33,439
it was just the scale that people were

641
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:35,599
starting to go at was like holy [ __ ]

642
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,720
this is really becoming big business

643
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:41,240
yeah because it's one thing where we had

644
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:42,960
these hydro shops and there's these big

645
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,200
manufacturers and they're selling and

646
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,360
it's all going through hydro shops the

647
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,360
next thing is is like we're talking

648
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:50,278
about Farms that they're running acres

649
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:53,278
and green houses that are acres and you

650
00:22:50,278 --> 00:22:56,440
know even the first time I walked into a

651
00:22:53,278 --> 00:22:59,720
20,000 SQ foot canopy I was like holy

652
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,720
[ __ ] this is crazy yeah now 20,000 ft of

653
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:04,319
canopy in a greenhouse is nothing you

654
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,640
know that's that's not very big yeah and

655
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:06,879
what do you do when you harvest that

656
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,320
amount of Wheat and you have no way to

657
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,679
preserve it yeah you know I mean that's

658
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:13,918
that's a huge amount of product that is

659
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,200
decomposing well yeah and I think the

660
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,278
thing is is like a lot of people were

661
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,440
like we're just going to goow and figure

662
00:23:16,278 --> 00:23:19,000
it out along the way and it's like

663
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,880
there's so many components you need to

664
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,839
really dial in as far as storage drying

665
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,400
and curing properly how do you store it

666
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:27,038
how do you preserve it how do you make

667
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,600
it last as long as possible even if

668
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:31,079
you're able to sell it you still want

669
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:33,959
have those things in mind absolutely for

670
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:36,079
sure and you know I mean dispensaries in

671
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,558
the Pacific Northwest you know with the

672
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:40,079
testing process and the time it takes to

673
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:42,079
actually get it into the jar and get it

674
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:44,798
for sale yeah you know you've got

675
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:46,519
products that are two months old you

676
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:49,400
know and if this wasn't preserved

677
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:50,558
properly you know you got brown frown

678
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,320
well that was the beauty of the medical

679
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:54,119
days Pacific Northwest Portland I was

680
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:57,240
born in Portland I'm a big fan of

681
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:59,519
Portland yeah you know in Washington and

682
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:02,240
Oregon and California I spent a lot of

683
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:05,480
time in those three states my in my life

684
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:08,240
and with medical the product was really

685
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:10,200
fresh right like it was sold compared to

686
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,440
now yeah absolutely right it was like

687
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,840
you bring your stuff down you're a

688
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,720
vendor you bring it down you show it to

689
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:16,959
them they want to get it sold and you

690
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,200
know your money back or if they paid

691
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,640
cash they want to you know get their

692
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,400
money back for the cash that they paid

693
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:24,360
right away and uh so it was a whole

694
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,320
different model there wasn't the testing

695
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:28,678
I like testing I think testing is great

696
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:30,359
I think testing is important uh you know

697
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:33,278
it's tested more than any other AG

698
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:34,759
product out there yeah but uh I think

699
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:36,759
that that's a beautiful part but the

700
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:38,879
problem is is like the farm to table

701
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:41,359
experience right like how fast are you

702
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,760
getting two months old if it's preserved

703
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:44,558
correctly can still be a really good

704
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:46,798
product but if it's not preserved

705
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:49,079
correctly right uh like the seeds in the

706
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:51,918
mail or what whatever happens sometimes

707
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:53,319
these things like if if the seeds get

708
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,919
hot and they go in the mail you could

709
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:57,480
have bad seeds if the flower gets hot

710
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,360
what's sitting on someone's shelf or

711
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:02,159
waiting to get packed packaged that

712
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:03,558
flour is a bad product or it could be an

713
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,799
inferior product to what it would have

714
00:25:03,558 --> 00:25:07,678
been before if it's sitting in a one gon

715
00:25:05,798 --> 00:25:10,839
glass jar and the sun's hitting it from

716
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,519
the window um you've got a problem yeah

717
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:14,720
there's a lot more to this it's that

718
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:16,200
still needs to roll out and and

719
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,480
preserving the product I think is one of

720
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,200
the big ones it's one of the most

721
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,919
important ones in the shortest period of

722
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,159
time that you can screw your plant up

723
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:23,559
you know you have this whole life of the

724
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,278
plant where you can screw it up and it

725
00:25:23,558 --> 00:25:28,879
can it can take away from that big pie

726
00:25:26,278 --> 00:25:31,000
right but that preservation period where

727
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,000
you're drawing it you're curing it

728
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,480
you're trimming it and you're storing it

729
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,519
for sale or selling it that's the in my

730
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,558
mind that's one of the most important

731
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:42,679
periods you know that's as important as

732
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:44,158
starting with good genetics yeah and I

733
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:46,559
hear it from a lot of The Growers you

734
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,480
know they're going you know hey I I wish

735
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:50,278
my product could get to the Shelf faster

736
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,399
yeah you know because my reputation's on

737
00:25:50,278 --> 00:25:55,359
it you know and because it's not

738
00:25:52,398 --> 00:25:57,278
properly handled you know I pick up some

739
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:59,319
bad reputation because the product's not

740
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:01,319
what I gave them yeah you know I want to

741
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:04,398
see direct sales that that's where I

742
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:06,599
would really love to see direct sales is

743
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:08,759
from the farm to the consumer where you

744
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:11,278
can go up you can talk to the grower or

745
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:13,119
the hash maker or whatever and you can

746
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:15,119
talk to him about the love that he put

747
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:18,079
in that plant and how much he cared

748
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:20,959
about those plants and you can go buy a

749
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:23,119
fresh ounce or a fresh eth yeah uh I

750
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,240
mean I think that's the future that's

751
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:25,918
the you know we've done that with

752
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,798
breweries and wineries forever I say

753
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,960
that's yeah that's the standard there I

754
00:26:27,798 --> 00:26:31,398
heard of in New Mexico where they were

755
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,519
growing in the back of the building they

756
00:26:31,398 --> 00:26:33,918
were drying in the middle of the

757
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:36,398
building and the dispensary was in the

758
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,720
front they had two glass windows to

759
00:26:36,398 --> 00:26:40,319
where people could look through and see

760
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:42,798
the product drying and it had a list of

761
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:46,119
the fresh product available next week

762
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:47,839
yeah and I went amazing platform you

763
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:49,719
know I haven't been to New Mexico to see

764
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:51,918
it um I've seen some pictures of it but

765
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:54,440
I went what a great platform yeah

766
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:56,240
Califoria I mean it that is as quick as

767
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,720
you can get it there yeah California

768
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,839
just came out with the new law right

769
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,919
that you're allowed to actually have a

770
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:04,278
facility that you can smoke and have

771
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,600
food and drink now I believe that just

772
00:27:04,278 --> 00:27:08,640
passed got signed in right I'm excited

773
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:09,839
for the future that for smoking lounges

774
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,000
yeah that's what I mean I think it might

775
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:12,918
change kind of like what you were

776
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,038
talking about I hope it does I hope it

777
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:17,480
does because we you know I feel like

778
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:19,640
cannabis is a lot healthier than alcohol

779
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,599
I agree and we're doing it with alcohol

780
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:24,559
why not do it with cannabis and I feel

781
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:25,558
like uh it's the perfect model

782
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:27,119
especially because there's so many

783
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:30,158
passionate people there's passionate

784
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:30,158
people with alcohol with

785
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:36,360
people

786
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:38,398
Canabis talk invested you know and then

787
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:40,079
that just makes it more of an experience

788
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:42,759
too like the second you can get it's

789
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:44,558
just like meeting you guys and using

790
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:45,798
your product I get to I get this

791
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:47,119
different experience it's one thing

792
00:27:45,798 --> 00:27:49,319
buying stuff but then when you meet the

793
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:50,479
people behind it then you start to

794
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:53,200
understand really what the product's

795
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,399
about what went into it uh customer

796
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,080
service is so huge too yeah yeah for

797
00:27:55,398 --> 00:27:59,000
sure we've had a lot of people pour over

798
00:27:57,079 --> 00:28:01,158
the fence you know from you know

799
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,679
different industries that yeah didn't

800
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:07,120
cut their teeth there you know and you

801
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:09,798

you know like cat hasn't been around a

803

long time yeah you know and there's

804
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,798
really nothing you can do about that but

805
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,240
you know you know the guys that have

806
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:19,319
been here a long time yeah um and

807
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,919
they're knowledgeable and the old school

808
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:22,519

00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:42,640
be so much more Community Driven

part of the industry that's Community I

822
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,720
feel like my show is all about community

823
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,159
and bringing to light different people

824
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:51,319
in the community they're doing great

825
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:53,360

828
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:59,240
amazing really amazing they were totally

829
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:01,840
different I mean today's environment is

830
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:03,798
great um but it's it's it's not that

831
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:06,959
relaxed you know Brotherhood it used to

832
00:29:03,798 --> 00:29:09,879
be no but everything good has an end and

833
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,399
it changes things more disco we missed

834
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,760
disco I miss disco I don't know about

835
00:29:11,398 --> 00:29:15,719
you guys but I miss around during the80s

836
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:18,519
yeah yeah so I you know but but like

837
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:20,720
Studio 54 and disco it had its day where

838
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:22,159
I bet it was so amazing and I wish I

839
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,798
would have been able to experience it

840
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:27,399
but you know things change and you know

841
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:29,359
we grow and evolve and the one thing

842
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:30,678
constantly Chang for sure yeah and you

843
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:32,398
know I go back to the beginning when

844
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:34,798
this guy goes come check this out and he

845
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:37,678
had taken two buckets and filled one

846
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:40,079
with PE gravel and was pouring water on

847
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,720
it and there were cucumbers there

848
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:45,038
Tomatoes were huge I mean this thing was

849
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,319
blowing up in his backyard you know and

850
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:49,319
he says I think we could sell this wow

851
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:51,519
you know and that cut my teeth into

852
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:52,720
Hydroponics I ended up making assembly

853
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:54,880
line we were assemble them in his

854
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,038
basement and out to the UPS truck they'd

855
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,720
go and next thing you know we had our

856
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:00,158
retail store and

857
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,480
the police would park across the street

858
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,080
and they'd put cameras on the telephone

859
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:06,480
poles and you know the 80s was was a

860
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:09,119
tough time you know Nancy rean was out

861
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,079
there swinging that bat you know she

862
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:12,839
says yeah I picked it up when Richard

863
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:15,278
Nixon dropped it and I'm gonna Club way

864
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:18,038
more people than he did right and uh she

865
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:19,839
rre Havoc a lot of people did a lot of

866
00:30:18,038 --> 00:30:22,440
people did and I think a lot of some

867
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:24,519
people unknowingly were doing the wrong

868
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,240
thing and now if they were to look back

869
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:28,798
they'd say well cannabis wasn't so bad

870
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:31,759
yeah regardless of everything else you

871
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:33,440
know it's like uh it's it's a strange

872
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:37,839
thing that we went through all this and

873
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:39,720
and people suffered so much uh yeah you

874
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:41,278
know it's just it's really unfortunate

875
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,278
yeah you think about a time when you

876
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:45,798
know people got five years for 100

877
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:48,519
plants yeah or for seeds people got

878
00:30:45,798 --> 00:30:51,278
prison sentences for seeds yeah you know

879
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:52,960
for this plant it's not a crime no it's

880
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:54,558
seeds are considered hemp we can ship

881
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,960
them anywhere you can give them to your

882
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:58,480
friends you can ship them in the mail

883
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:02,440
it's it's hemp they there's no makes

884
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:04,399
sense to me me too yeah absolutely

885
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,159
that's great for you yeah yeah so you

886
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:09,158
started working in hydroponics in the80s

887
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:10,519
in the 81 or and 81 a friend of mine

888
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:13,840
created the system and had me come over

889
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:15,278
to his house and um we we got kicked out

890
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:17,759
of this house because we had too many

891
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:19,480
UPS trucks coming for for deliveries and

892
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:20,440
ironically enough everybody stared at

893
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,120
each other and go you know how do we

894
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:24,200
sell this thing it's it's a hydroponic

895
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:25,798
system and ironically enough we took out

896
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,038
a little tiny ad in Popular Science

897
00:31:25,798 --> 00:31:30,839
magazine yeah um Popular Science was

898
00:31:28,038 --> 00:31:33,398
huge back in the early 80s um ad comes

899
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:35,879
out first of the month and phone starts

900
00:31:33,398 --> 00:31:37,239
ringing every time we set the phone down

901
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,360
there wasn't call waiting back then so

902
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,079
every time we set the phone down it

903
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:41,839
would start ringing again yeah and we

904
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:44,038
sat there and took orders for almost

905
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:47,599
eight hours straight off of this phone

906
00:31:44,038 --> 00:31:49,599
wow and we went my God people like this

907
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:51,678
you know and so we went how long is this

908
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:52,879
going to last maybe it's a fat so we

909
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:54,240
stayed there making them out of his

910
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,120
house until we got the letter from the

911
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,519
city saying you guys got to move you

912
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:59,038
can't run a business in a neighborhood

913
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:01,638
my friend started light manufacturing

914
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:04,000
company and we started buying rock wall

915
00:32:01,638 --> 00:32:05,678
for the the system and we upgraded the

916
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,599
tubing we upgraded a lot of the fittings

917
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:11,919
for it you know we we revolutionized it

918
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:14,038
and out it went and sold a million

919
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:16,759
dollars the first year wow and all of a

920
00:32:14,038 --> 00:32:19,319
sudden you know people started paying

921
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:21,720
attention like man there's a grow shop

922
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:23,558
over there you know and it was us and

923
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:26,240
you know American egg was the other shop

924
00:32:23,558 --> 00:32:28,000
yeah there was two of us in Portland and

925
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,120
ironically enough if they didn't get

926
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,319
they wanted for our store they said well

927
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:32,759
I'm not shopping here I'm going to shop

928
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:34,319
an American egg and then guy would come

929
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:35,679
in the store and go I'm never shopping

930
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:39,240
an American egg I'm shopping at your

931
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:41,278
store so we swapped customers for years

932
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:43,558
back and forth because you got one

933
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:45,759
choice or the other right you know and

934
00:32:43,558 --> 00:32:47,200
uh system did really well and I started

935
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:51,960
getting into product development you

936
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:55,440
know we we uh got that nutrient handbook

937
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:57,480
out by Rusk right way back in the 80s

938
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:00,159
way back and we all read that right we

939
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:02,720
all put put in our two cents and uh we

940
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:05,679
built a fertilizer called Golden grow

941
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,200
and what we found and no one's done it

942
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,840
to this day is you know the

943
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,960
micronutrients are tough to blend into a

944
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:13,798
200 pound batch of powder right so

945
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:16,360
you've got very small amounts you know

946
00:33:13,798 --> 00:33:18,200
other than you know you got decent iron

947
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:21,519
but we went you know how is this working

948
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:23,919
you know how do we know that every scoop

949
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:26,880
is going to give that same micronutrient

950
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:29,440
kick we couldn't so we created an A and

951
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,159
B and we created a micronutrient liquid

952
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,880
yeah so once we liquified it we have now

953
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:36,799
divided it equally so we had you know

954
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:40,080
golden grow golden Bloom and micro gold

955
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:41,798
yeah um and we sold it for 20 years and

956
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:44,079
absolutely made a fortune from it all

957
00:33:41,798 --> 00:33:46,038
from that book I have a question for you

958
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:48,558
because I'm real curious as to what you

959
00:33:46,038 --> 00:33:50,519
just said made me wonder did nutrients

960
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:51,960
start out as a dry mix that then went

961
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:54,759
into liquid and now we're going back

962
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:56,840
into dry again or was it always liquid

963
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:58,158
well it was uh cuz I know there was

964
00:33:56,839 --> 00:34:01,798
three- part for a long time General

965
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:04,840
Hydroponics was around in 1976 right um

966
00:34:01,798 --> 00:34:06,558
their distribution range um wasn't huge

967
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:08,119
you know you kind of really had to pull

968
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:11,079
some teeth to yank it all the way up to

969
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:13,159
Oregon right um but it was on the Shelf

970
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:14,359
there was another liquid that we had

971
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:18,119
that was came out of the commercial

972
00:34:14,358 --> 00:34:21,480
industry when EG had commercial e yeah

973
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:25,440
um there was a lady out of Seattle um

974
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:27,918
that had Eco grow and so she had her own

975
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,159
powder and so we went you know hey look

976
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:32,440
you know there's room for us in this

977
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:33,878
game um so got that book and trial and

978
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:36,679
error trial and error oop killed that

979
00:34:33,878 --> 00:34:38,719
one you know too much of that um we

980
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:40,358
finally got it figured out and you know

981
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:42,039
we had the hydroponic system we had the

982
00:34:40,358 --> 00:34:44,918
hydroponic media and we had the

983
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:47,079
fertilizer for it yeah and Off to the

984
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:49,199
Races we went I mean it was a very very

985
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:51,960
successful business um all we had to

986
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:54,638
worry about was you know people pulling

987
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:56,039
in with covered license plates and cops

988
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,240
burning down the street after them when

989
00:34:56,039 --> 00:34:59,880
they left and I mean it was tumultuous

990
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:02,279
time everyone had to talk about tomatoes

991
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,640
they couldn't use the word weed cannabis

992
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,320
anything like that I mean that's how it

993
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:06,879
was even when in the 9s when we used to

994
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,599
go to G shops it was Tomatoes or you

995
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,838
would get kicked out of the shop people

996
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:12,200
would lose their [ __ ] you know and and

997
00:35:10,838 --> 00:35:14,239
they would put Undercovers in there all

998
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:15,879
the time you know and that we would have

999
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:18,439
a really good conversation and all they

1000
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:20,039
said well yeah I'm growing weed I'm like

1001
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:22,440
well dude you gotta leave the store yeah

1002
00:35:20,039 --> 00:35:25,079
oh no no no I'm cool you know and that

1003
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:27,720
was the I'm cool no he's a cop he's

1004
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:29,519
gotta go right so I mean it was just

1005
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:31,879
crazy how they would just try to

1006
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:33,719
infiltrate us week after week well in

1007
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:36,240
Portland they really cracked down on it

1008
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:38,078
and they made huge arrests and it it was

1009
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:41,279
it was pretty gnarly for a period of

1010
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:43,359
time yeah Green Merchant green Merchant

1011
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,599
yeah wolf seall was part of that too I

1012
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:49,719
believe they got stuck up in that Alex

1013
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:53,000
from throw's Edge yeah yeah it it got a

1014
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:55,480
lot of us I know yeah um I'd like to say

1015
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,039
I got away scotf Frey but that's not the

1016
00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:01,480
case but that's a story for another time

1017
00:35:58,039 --> 00:36:03,039
yeah totally so David yeah tell me how

1018
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:05,358
you got your start with cannabis were

1019
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:06,719
you smoking in high school I did yes so

1020
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:09,838
I probably started smoking in high

1021
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:11,838
school and just have been a you know uh

1022
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:15,400
what's the term for it just a casual

1023
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:18,159
smoker for for that but uh literally I

1024
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:21,358
met Rod like 10 years ago and just

1025
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:23,399
absolutely loved like this space like

1026
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:25,440
came from the hardware background it's a

1027
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,079
different category definitely a

1028
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,960
different vibe and a different culture

1029
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:33,280
so once we actually hooked up with Rod

1030
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,679
and Sunlight Supply at the time it was

1031
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,920
like oh H how do I get into this because

1032
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:39,919
I like the people like meeting people

1033
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,800
like you meeting people like Rod like

1034
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,960
every person I've met I've really

1035
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:47,000
enjoyed and curious people intelligent

1036
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,318
people always trying to find the next

1037
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,838
best way where I was coming from a

1038
00:36:49,318 --> 00:36:53,559
different category where it was a race

1039
00:36:50,838 --> 00:36:54,759
to the bottom how do we take as much out

1040
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:56,599
and we don't really care about the

1041
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,280
quality like you spoke about earlier

1042
00:36:56,599 --> 00:37:00,318
about cannabis you want to take the

1043
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:03,240
money out but you also need to leave the

1044
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:04,960
quality well this was the exact opposite

1045
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:08,118
we're taking out quality to try to

1046
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,960
basically get it as low as possible and

1047
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:13,039
it gets tight and it gets hard and it's

1048
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:17,159
not fun so once I actually came over to

1049
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:18,838
here and kind of been poking around and

1050
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:21,838
looking into things it was like oh this

1051
00:37:18,838 --> 00:37:23,960
is this is where I should be and uh it's

1052
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:25,838
been good ever since so I'm on a big

1053
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:28,800
steep learning curve like I said I've

1054
00:37:25,838 --> 00:37:31,440
been in it for eight years but I am not

1055
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,880
a professional grower I am learning

1056
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,720
daily as we go so which I also enjoy as

1057
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,079
well like I ask you stupid questions all

1058
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:39,559
the time like when I come see your

1059
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:41,599
facility I ask probably the most basic

1060
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:43,318
but I'm try those kind of questions are

1061
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,519
never stupid in my opinion those are you

1062
00:37:43,318 --> 00:37:45,759
those are the kind of questions that you

1063
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:47,440
should be asking because if you don't

1064
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,119
know the answer you might as well ask me

1065
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,760
or ask somebody who knows the answer

1066
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:54,318
because and then sometimes we stumble on

1067
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,960
some crazy ideas you know with the light

1068
00:37:54,318 --> 00:37:58,759
and with with the system that you guys

1069
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,318
have love it because we could we've

1070
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,680
customized it to our own specs right so

1071
00:38:01,318 --> 00:38:04,119
we took the unist strut and we painted

1072
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:06,000
it white and we wanted to match the

1073
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:08,440
building and then you know the unit

1074
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,000
start up top that used to just be

1075
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:14,000
stainless we we've covered that you know

1076
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:16,039
it's not stainless but yeah Ste this the

1077
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,318
steel we we basically painted it white

1078
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:19,279
and then it Blends in the room and it

1079
00:38:17,318 --> 00:38:20,759
really fits and you know and depending

1080
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,800
on the type of light you can really

1081
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:25,680
customize the system yeah which I like I

1082
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,519
feel like you know my partner is all

1083
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:30,039
about Aesthetics I'm all about fun

1084
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:31,519
functionality and quality and he's like

1085
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:32,800
how can we make this look better cuz you

1086
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:34,440
already have all that stuff covered so

1087
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,119
let's make it look nice too well if you

1088
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:38,559
marry the two then you have the perfect

1089
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:40,960
equation right so so you obviously need

1090
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:43,559
to have your quality and your and and

1091
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,358
that but Aesthetics is also a very big

1092
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:47,400
component of it and I will say your

1093
00:38:45,358 --> 00:38:49,279
facility is beautiful I mean those rooms

1094
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,599
you have in there world class I mean

1095
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,359
yeah it's a showroom too right at the

1096
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:54,359
end of the day it's a showroom and it

1097
00:38:52,358 --> 00:38:55,639
it's also it's a showroom for me but but

1098
00:38:54,358 --> 00:38:58,559
companies like yourself it's a showroom

1099
00:38:55,639 --> 00:39:00,559
for you so we can share with the world

1100
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:02,159
our ethos how we believe the plants

1101
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:04,639
should be grown you know how how the

1102
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:06,480
different genetics work together and and

1103
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:08,559
specifically genetics it's like we're

1104
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,519
focused on genetics so it's like how can

1105
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:12,639
we grow the plant to the best of ability

1106
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:14,960
so we can show our genetics the the true

1107
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:17,039
potential of our genetics maximize your

1108
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,599
potential of genetics yeah yeah so at

1109
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:20,800
the end of the day it's a it's a great

1110
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:23,160
showcase for everybody that's involved

1111
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,560
we you know I'm I'm a very big fan of

1112
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:26,239
all the products that I use and we're

1113
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:28,000
constantly r&amp; ding stuff so I want to

1114
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:29,759
test everything

1115
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,719
get as much feedback as I can and make

1116
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,160
my decision on what I want to use for

1117
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:35,879
the future you I think that's the best

1118
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:37,598
way to R&amp;D is really get everything in

1119
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:39,680
the pot try all these different things

1120
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:41,559
out and then come up with the the

1121
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:43,879
solution that works the best yeah I

1122
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:45,599
agree and I think the way you also do it

1123
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,559
is another thing is like you have it

1124
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,640
down to such an exact science right

1125
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:51,358
you're we talked about you're only

1126
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:53,719
changing one variable for each test

1127
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:55,759
right we're not changing nutrients so

1128
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:57,000
whatever it is you're changing one

1129
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,640
variable and I think that's going to

1130
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,639
give us the best honest assessment of

1131
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:04,039
how well this would do and I like you

1132
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:06,400
spoke about earlier I'm really

1133
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:08,559
interested in combining our Horizon lift

1134
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,400
with an under canopy light because we

1135
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:13,159
have done testing in facilities in the

1136
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:16,000
past and not to be a snake snake oil

1137
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:19,598
salesmen but we've seen a large increase

1138
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,599
in the yield by moving your lights right

1139
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:23,680
and so they've also seen that with the

1140
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,838
under canopy lights now it's coming out

1141
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:26,879
that they've starting to see the

1142
00:40:24,838 --> 00:40:28,599
increase of the yield and the the plants

1143
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,318
on the bottom are kind of getting a

1144
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:34,000
little thicker and just kind of

1145
00:40:31,318 --> 00:40:35,920
strengthening on the bottom that was

1146
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,280
photosynthesis occurs of the top it's

1147
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:41,079
not supposed to work but yet trial and

1148
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:44,480
error it's working right so I'm really

1149
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:47,160
excited to see the difference of under

1150
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,920
canopy lights are Horizon lift and then

1151
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:52,559
the combining of those two to see is it

1152
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,039
too saturated is it too much or is it

1153
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:57,480
going to be like oh wow this is like the

1154
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:58,759
the best or just the answer getting

1155
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:00,240
sorry getting the answer for that's

1156
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,599
going to be big for me I'm always

1157
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:04,318
excited about the answer right like what

1158
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:06,280
are what's going to happen it's you know

1159
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:08,559
you're kind of like an explore going

1160
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:10,560
through you know Christopher Columbus

1161
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:14,358
probably not the best example but these

1162
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:16,358
days these days these days come on SM

1163
00:41:14,358 --> 00:41:18,519
know Christopher smoke totally and but

1164
00:41:16,358 --> 00:41:20,279
but being able to explore different

1165
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:21,639
things I mean that keeps me excited to

1166
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,680
come to work every day and it's like

1167
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:24,879
yeah what are we going to find out today

1168
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:26,598
well we already have a whole bunch of

1169
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,559
fires to put out what else are we going

1170
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:30,640
to learn about the plant or about the

1171
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:32,078
way we're growing uh you know these

1172
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:33,318
different spectrums with lights that's

1173
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,880
what I'm always interested in is all

1174
00:41:33,318 --> 00:41:37,358
these different spect spectrums you know

1175
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:39,000
we can do Spectrum tuning uh which I

1176
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:40,519
think is great but that can totally be

1177
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,239
abused and you can totally screw your

1178
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:43,599
crop up when you start experimenting on

1179
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:45,719
your own if you don't know what you're

1180
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:47,400
doing yeah and so many people are like

1181
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:49,838
oh I'll just do this this and this that

1182
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:52,119
sounds about right yeah I think it's

1183
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:55,000
much easier to test um with a fixed

1184
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:57,039
position product yeah you know um when

1185
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,800
when you're creating your own variables

1186
00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:01,759
um you're kind of skewing your own test

1187
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,560
totally um so I'm a firm believer in you

1188
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,960
know here's what it's supposed to do

1189
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:06,318
well let's make it do that or at least

1190
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,000
use that as a starting point you know

1191
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:10,440
it's like let's start here and then

1192
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,960
maybe tweak this or add a bunch of far

1193
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:15,720
red and see what that does or you know I

1194
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,199
think some of these guys they just want

1195
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:18,480
to go all over the board and they don't

1196
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:21,639
understand how to experiment it's like

1197
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:24,000
to really get a good trial you need to

1198
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:25,358
grow it out and see what it does and if

1199
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,800
you're comparing it you need to compare

1200
00:42:25,358 --> 00:42:28,719
it in the same exact way that you

1201
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,480
compare the first thing and you know I'm

1202
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:32,239
not a lighting technician but you know

1203
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,719
what I see with the under canopies is

1204
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:37,039
they're getting really red you know so

1205
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:40,199
they're taking a full spectrum light yep

1206
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:42,079
right and and they're basically jamming

1207
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:45,118
red up into it yep putting a whole bunch

1208
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:47,160
of far red and does far red make it

1209
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:50,160
bloom better well absolutely it does you

1210
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:52,239
know it also more yeah I'm seeing more

1211
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:53,679
purple with the LED abolutely right so

1212
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:55,719
now the the sides are actually more

1213
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:57,799
purple than the tops and I think that's

1214
00:42:55,719 --> 00:42:59,759
really cool you know for me I think

1215
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,160
there's a demand for purple flow I don't

1216
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,760
know that it it's always going to be

1217
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:04,318
there but right now the demand is to

1218
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:06,720
have purple it doesn't have to be all

1219
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:08,199
purple but people want purple look yeah

1220
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:11,719
they want that look in the bag and you

1221
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:13,358
know or or in the jar or whatever and

1222
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:15,959
with these under canopies they have that

1223
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:17,480
far red now we're seeing an increase

1224
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,679
also we're talking about saving labor

1225
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,838
because you're not having to strip your

1226
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:22,199
under canopy you're getting flour there

1227
00:43:20,838 --> 00:43:23,759
and you're getting more of a yield so

1228
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:27,318
now you're saving labor you're getting a

1229
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,319
bigger yield and now what happens if we

1230
00:43:27,318 --> 00:43:31,119
put light lifts in there that's that's

1231
00:43:29,318 --> 00:43:32,880
you know still the question is to be

1232
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:34,838
answered but I think that's exciting for

1233
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,079
me it's like okay well everybody else is

1234
00:43:34,838 --> 00:43:37,719
getting the same results we can all

1235
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:39,680
agree that under canopies are doing this

1236
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:42,159
we can agree that you're getting better

1237
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:43,318
results with the Light Lift you know as

1238
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:44,759
far as everybody's getting better

1239
00:43:43,318 --> 00:43:46,440
results they're getting bigger yields

1240
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,760
they're getting frostier weed they're

1241
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:50,400
getting you know I think there's

1242
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:52,680
benefits that we can prove and now but

1243
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,480
nobody's combined them yeah so nobody's

1244
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:56,799
combined them for seed production now

1245
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,920
are we going to get more seeds right cuz

1246
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,640
now every every penny counts the value

1247
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:03,760
of seeds has gone down now if we can

1248
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:05,358
push that uh we're increasing profits

1249
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,520
but we could possibly be increasing

1250
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:09,400
quality because a lot of times on the

1251
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:11,159
under canopy you know you get better

1252
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:14,318
penetration if you're using light lifts

1253
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:16,480
too right so now the question is we get

1254
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:18,480
better penetration plus we have underc

1255
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,679
yeah are we going to get 100% yield in

1256
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,480
seeds because a lot of times I used to

1257
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:22,759
get a lot of white seeds below okay

1258
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:25,079
right where the light didn't penetrate

1259
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:27,520
proper oh gotcha so yeah I think you're

1260
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:29,079
going to do really well now

1261
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:31,079
having line on both sides of it and

1262
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:32,160
being able to compress it right um I

1263
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:33,920
think you're going to you're going to

1264
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:35,719
have control of the throttle well and

1265
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,119
now okay the other question is so so

1266
00:44:35,719 --> 00:44:38,639
we're going to do one run one way but

1267
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,440
we're going to have to continue to do

1268
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:41,838
this because I really want to see okay

1269
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:45,119
so if I veget a little bit longer and

1270
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:47,799
have a taller plant okay now we have a a

1271
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:49,960
wider canopy so can I yield more that

1272
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:51,839
way maybe

1273
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:53,599
interesting more on the bottom cuz you

1274
00:44:51,838 --> 00:44:55,078
have more we got more on the bottom and

1275
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:57,519
then we have the power from the top and

1276
00:44:55,079 --> 00:45:00,000
we can really dial in the ppfd makes

1277
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:02,039
sense uh and I don't know I don't know

1278
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,838
what the answer is but I I know that

1279
00:45:02,039 --> 00:45:07,318
it's worth exploring and if I can get

1280
00:45:03,838 --> 00:45:08,838
more seeds if I can yield more uh and we

1281
00:45:07,318 --> 00:45:11,880
can translate that into flower

1282
00:45:08,838 --> 00:45:14,599
production too it's like who knows yeah

1283
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:16,680
do panels out produce bars yeah I mean

1284
00:45:14,599 --> 00:45:18,440
we don't know any of this yet you know

1285
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:20,679
we're getting a bunch of data from from

1286
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:22,838
people who manufacture lights yeah um

1287
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:25,558
but like you said the proof's in the

1288
00:45:22,838 --> 00:45:28,159
test yeah you know it's like okay prove

1289
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:29,519
it yeah everybody talks I'm all about

1290
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:32,039
the proof is in the pudding because I

1291
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:33,440
hear so much noise from people right

1292
00:45:32,039 --> 00:45:35,119
there's so much noise in this industry

1293
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,720
you got to mjbiz and everybody's got the

1295
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:40,558
everybody's got the best that but it's

1296
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,599
like I need to go around with my friends

1297
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:43,760
and go what do you use what what gets

1298

grow the best flowers that grow the best

1300
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:47,719
stuff right at the end of the day it's

1301
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:48,920
like the people that are growing the

1302
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:51,199
best what are they using and how are

1303
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:54,440
they getting those results yeah I'll

1304
00:45:51,199 --> 00:45:55,960
tell you that um years ago gentleman

1305
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:57,519
named Neil Anderson came to me with a

1306
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:00,358
product called micro Rising

1307
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:02,358
yeah never heard it before you know I've

1308
00:46:00,358 --> 00:46:04,519
heard Whispers you know from a guy who

1309
00:46:02,358 --> 00:46:06,400
was playing with it um he actually

1310
00:46:04,519 --> 00:46:07,759
brought it to me and says try this you

1311
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,200
know and I what is it going to do and he

1312
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:13,839
explained it to me and I was like what

1313
00:46:10,199 --> 00:46:17,078
that's snake oil yeah well micro riz's

1314
00:46:13,838 --> 00:46:18,920
real you know and after multiple tests I

1315
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:21,240
went oh my God this stuff protects the

1316
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:23,519
plant the plant grows better I mean once

1317
00:46:21,239 --> 00:46:25,039
it colonizes you know and getting that

1318
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:27,079
colonization you know is is a little bit

1319
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:28,318
of a challenge itself but on once you

1320
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:31,079
understand how to colonize that on the

1321
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:33,880
root on the root Zone yeah an amazing

1322
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:38,000
product yeah um and

1323
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:39,960
so welcome RTI yeah and I mean it's it's

1324
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,079
something that's in nature too it's not

1325
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:44,079
like we're creating something in a lab

1326
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:45,440
this is something that occurs in nature

1327
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:47,280
yeah you know and it's like there's so

1328
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,920
many things like that yeah you know

1329
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,800
that's it's just you scratching the

1330
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:52,440
surface of all the different products

1331
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:55,559
but there's so much snake oil it's hard

1332
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:57,240
for the consumer to go to a shop and

1333
00:46:55,559 --> 00:46:59,319
sift through all that information

1334
00:46:57,239 --> 00:47:01,399
everybody's got the everybody got the

1335
00:46:59,318 --> 00:47:04,279
new latest and greatest and

1336
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:06,039
so you know but as we mature as an

1337
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,880
industry all these things get picked

1338
00:47:06,039 --> 00:47:10,279
apart and people slowly start learning

1339
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:12,920
what the the better products are oh yeah

1340
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:16,319
I do feel like that in in you're in the

1341
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:19,639
industry is it does eventually get to

1342
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:22,599
the best product quality all of that is

1343
00:47:19,639 --> 00:47:24,759
where everybody's aiming for right like

1344
00:47:22,599 --> 00:47:26,920
like I referred to is the other category

1345
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:28,760
is no one's aiming for Perfection and

1346
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:31,599
the other category and I feel like in

1347
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:33,920
cannabis everybody starts out to grow

1348
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:36,880
the best highest quality cannabis out

1349
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:38,680
there yep yeah ego will lie yes that

1350
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,880
gets ego will tell you that yours is the

1351
00:47:38,679 --> 00:47:41,279
best right everybody thinks they've

1352
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:42,800
grown and I think there's this

1353
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,519
attachment that we have with this plant

1354
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,599
where we've grown it we put our hearts

1355
00:47:44,519 --> 00:47:48,199
and souls into it and it's like this is

1356
00:47:46,599 --> 00:47:50,160
amazing and it's hard to look beyond

1357
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:52,039
that and I have a lot of respect for The

1358
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:54,159
Growers that are like this is good but

1359
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:55,599
I'm going to do better my next round or

1360
00:47:54,159 --> 00:47:57,639
[ __ ] this isn't as good as the last

1361
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:59,640
round yeah got it people are just so

1362
00:47:57,639 --> 00:48:01,480
fixated on dude well being honest with

1363
00:47:59,639 --> 00:48:03,920
yourself right yeah it's really

1364
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:05,480
difficult it's hard to do yeah and we're

1365
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,880
human I think it's just there's human

1366
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:09,318
nature involved with that always uh but

1367
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:11,358
even like the flower market like you

1368
00:48:09,318 --> 00:48:13,480
look at the flower market and what's

1369
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:15,480
available now it's like it's slowly in

1370
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:18,039
in metric in California Oregon

1371
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:21,039
Washington Colorado all these places it

1372
00:48:18,039 --> 00:48:23,279
gets better and better and better uh and

1373
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:24,480
I think may maybe that'll change but

1374
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,960
what I've seen in California is was

1375
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,880
terrible in the beginning it's slowly

1376
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:31,960
gotten better over the period of uh four

1377
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:34,318
almost five years now and I you know

1378
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:36,079
it's like in the beginning it was all

1379
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:37,679
hype and there's still a lot of hype

1380
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,880
being sold people are like oh there's

1381
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:41,519
branding there's all this and I'm going

1382
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:44,559
to sell it but slowly but surely The

1383
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:46,519
Branding has to support a quality

1384
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:48,359
product you know absolutely we've seen

1385
00:48:46,519 --> 00:48:49,559
that with with all kinds of stuff over

1386
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:51,239
the years you know I'm sure with

1387
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:52,680
nutrients too like all the hype with the

1388
00:48:51,239 --> 00:48:54,719
nutrients some of these companies where

1389
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:56,838
it's like whoa those look like cool

1390
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:58,598
freaking labels but you got to have a

1391
00:48:56,838 --> 00:49:00,679
quality product to back it in the bag

1392
00:48:58,599 --> 00:49:02,519
yeah yeah we found you know and I'm not

1393
00:49:00,679 --> 00:49:04,118
going to mention any names and stuff but

1394
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:07,440
celebrities don't necessarily sell

1395
00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:09,079
nutrients right you know and uh we found

1396
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,639
that out the hard way they shouldn't be

1397
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:13,039
selling nutrients The Growers should be

1398
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:14,960
the celebrities in my opinion we should

1399
00:49:13,039 --> 00:49:17,239
make those Growers the celebrities right

1400
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:20,358
the ones that are grow the best in the

1401
00:49:17,239 --> 00:49:22,558
simple product development brain you go

1402
00:49:20,358 --> 00:49:25,920
well this guy's a celebrity that's known

1403
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:27,798
for smoking cannabis Snoop Dog we're in

1404
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,599
yeah totally Snoop Dog nutrients man

1405
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:31,798
everybody's going to want these Che and

1406
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:33,440
Chong right they're the work out that

1407
00:49:31,798 --> 00:49:35,440
way I would buy B Real's nutrients and

1408
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,039
try them be real I think he's in a

1409
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,400
different level because I feel like he's

1410
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:40,920
more connected with the plant on the

1411
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,798
growing side Dr Green them but but

1412
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:44,440
there's very few celebrities I feel like

1413
00:49:42,798 --> 00:49:46,280
would be good representation for a

1414
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,358
nutrient company you know there's only

1415
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:51,000
so many things you can do with a

1416
00:49:47,358 --> 00:49:52,838
nutrient you know it's NPK yep you know

1417
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,838
and you know how many how many ways can

1418
00:49:52,838 --> 00:49:57,199
you twist NPK around right um and the

1419
00:49:55,838 --> 00:49:58,838
additives start coming

1420
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:01,399
yeah are the additives good or bad for

1421
00:49:58,838 --> 00:50:02,679
what you're doing you know cuz the guy

1422
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:05,400
who ask you know what's the best way to

1423
00:50:02,679 --> 00:50:07,480
grow this you know I just start laughing

1424
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:10,480
you know it's like there's a million

1425
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:12,920
ways to do this you know it's smoke your

1426
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:15,280
stuff if it's high quality you're doing

1427
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:18,519
it right yeah if it's low quality you're

1428
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:20,359
doing it wrong how does it taste one way

1429
00:50:18,519 --> 00:50:21,639
to go hey this is the best way to do it

1430
00:50:20,358 --> 00:50:24,039
you do it this way and you'll be the

1431
00:50:21,639 --> 00:50:26,159
best right um I've seen people grow

1432
00:50:24,039 --> 00:50:28,279
these plants aund different ways if

1433
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:30,519
there was way we would all do it that

1434
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:33,319
way we all do it that way but there's

1435
00:50:30,519 --> 00:50:35,159
not one way and it's a very uh it's a

1436
00:50:33,318 --> 00:50:37,960
live product you know we're growing

1437
00:50:35,159 --> 00:50:40,598
something that's alive that takes a long

1438
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:43,358
time I mean relatively to grow and to

1439
00:50:40,599 --> 00:50:45,119
perfect and from one batch to the next

1440
00:50:43,358 --> 00:50:46,239
it's agriculture you know from one batch

1441
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,920
to the next it's going to be slightly

1442
00:50:46,239 --> 00:50:51,078
different even with the best indoor

1443
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:52,639
environments you can still get different

1444
00:50:51,079 --> 00:50:54,920
variables where you get a slightly

1445
00:50:52,639 --> 00:50:56,679
different end product yeah stuff's

1446
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:57,920
getting more standardized but yeah you

1447
00:50:56,679 --> 00:50:59,480
know then you get the guy that goes you

1448
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:02,760
know hey I jammed a bunch of stuff into

1449
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:05,760
a cow's horn yeah buried in the ground

1450
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:08,599
and that's how I grow yeah and you go

1451
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:10,599
it's good to me yeah you know that works

1452
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:12,920
for me your weed's great yeah I mean

1453
00:51:10,599 --> 00:51:15,000
we're fixated on the the look of the

1454
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:16,280
product too which is I think is you know

1455
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,679
it's always going to have to look good

1456
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:20,000
but I think we're going to go more back

1457
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:22,118
to the effect and The Taste yeah uh

1458
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,599
Instagram is really screwed that up cuz

1459
00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:27,119
that's what you see is those beautiful

1460
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:28,519
pictures right looks ridiculous but yeah

1461
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:30,559
and at the end of the day maybe you do

1462
00:51:28,519 --> 00:51:32,039
but I think most people if you showed

1463
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:33,280
them what they what you thought they

1464
00:51:32,039 --> 00:51:35,599
wanted and they tried it they'd be like

1465
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:37,599
wow you know some good old school weed

1466
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:39,480
like the the flower that we had in the

1467
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:42,160
90s I never got to experience 80s weed

1468
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:45,280
because I started smoking in ' 91 G13

1469
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:47,399
yeah but uh like literally the stuff in

1470
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:49,798
the 90s was amazing the flavor of it the

1471
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:51,720
effect the way it made you feel yeah

1472
00:51:49,798 --> 00:51:53,519
that's when oi Kush knocked on the door

1473
00:51:51,719 --> 00:51:55,558
yeah you know OJ Kush came hard in the

1474
00:51:53,519 --> 00:51:57,639
90s and it's like pushed everybody out

1475
00:51:55,559 --> 00:52:00,559
of the way right I mean it stayed as a

1476
00:51:57,639 --> 00:52:02,759
staple for a long time um and then you

1477
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:03,920
had some you know side stuff coming in

1478
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:06,240
there was a strain in the Pacific

1479
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:08,559
Northwest called Wacom weed you know and

1480
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:11,039
people would go the hell's Wacom weed

1481
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:13,280
what came from Wacom County yeah right I

1482
00:52:11,039 --> 00:52:14,679
mean people didn't make names back then

1483
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,880
they're like well what do we call this

1484

1486
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:23,079
simplified the industry was you know and

1487
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:24,838
I don't think you know throughout the

1488
00:52:23,079 --> 00:52:28,079
whole 80s there was more than five or

1489
00:52:24,838 --> 00:52:30,119
six drains wow um it was very limited

1490
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:32,119
huh um and they were you get some

1491
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:33,838
one-offs once in a while but as far as

1492
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:35,920

1497
00:52:42,318 --> 00:52:46,239
a little gone by then that was 80s but

1498
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,639
they had some Regional stuff like we

1499
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:49,679
used I mean we used to get Mexican weed

1500
00:52:48,639 --> 00:52:50,759
but that it could have been from

1501
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:52,239
anywhere it could have been from

1502
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,920
Colombia you know I me for all we knew

1503
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:55,959
we got Mexican weed and it had seeds in

1504
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,760
it and but there was even some good

1505
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:59,920
stuff some that the higher end Mexican

1506
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:02,839
stuff was actually pretty good you know

1507
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:05,440
you get Hawkin Spears and yeah um that

1508
00:53:02,838 --> 00:53:07,558
was good and you know you would get the

1509
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:10,200
blonde Lebanese hash you know would come

1510
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:12,240
in big patties and got you real high got

1511
00:53:10,199 --> 00:53:14,519
you really high yeah that's the stuff we

1512
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:17,519
used to smoke with hot knives you eat

1513
00:53:14,519 --> 00:53:18,679
the hot knives up on the stove stove I

1514
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:20,159
burned a whole bunch of my parents

1515
00:53:18,679 --> 00:53:22,318
knives like that yeah you go to make a

1516
00:53:20,159 --> 00:53:23,679
sandwich every damn butter knives burn

1517
00:53:22,318 --> 00:53:25,358
where the hell are all the butter no I

1518
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:27,199
just hit them from my parents I I didn't

1519
00:53:25,358 --> 00:53:29,279
want them to see any burn kniv I wasn't

1520
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:30,480
I guess I was too stoned I put them back

1521
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,400
yeah I would my parents would have lost

1522
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,880
their [ __ ] over burnt knives in the door

1523
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,358
like I just kept them so then it was

1524
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:37,720
like why do we only have four knives

1525
00:53:35,358 --> 00:53:39,639
yeah where all the knives go you know

1526
00:53:37,719 --> 00:53:41,078
there used to be 12 there's only four

1527
00:53:39,639 --> 00:53:45,239
what happened because you can hot knife

1528
00:53:41,079 --> 00:53:46,519
with scissors or with forks yeah exactly

1529
00:53:45,239 --> 00:53:48,199
probably could used spoons we never

1530
00:53:46,519 --> 00:53:50,440
tried that though oh you probably could

1531
00:53:48,199 --> 00:53:52,000
have got away with spoons y didn't L

1532
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:54,240
represented something was uglier never

1533
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,039
ran out of knives though never ran out

1534
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:58,519
of KN kep and there's more at the store

1535
00:53:56,039 --> 00:54:01,318
if you need them oh yeah had good times

1536
00:53:58,519 --> 00:54:04,400
for sure so yeah so let's talk about

1537
00:54:01,318 --> 00:54:06,759
your your past with weed in the 80s when

1538
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:10,798
did you start smoking the 70s late 70s

1539
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:13,559
yeah I was about 74 74 wow 1974 I think

1540
00:54:10,798 --> 00:54:16,798
I was 14 went to my first concert David

1541
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:19,200
Bowie oh nice um and I was like these

1542
00:54:16,798 --> 00:54:22,559
people are cool they smoke weed and go

1543
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:25,000
at concerts yeah and I was sold you know

1544
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:27,200
and from that point on it was Ted Dent

1545
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,318
Leonard skinnard get sales pitched

1546
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:30,558
though right you get to concer you see

1547
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:32,039
all these people having fun like how can

1548
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:33,798
you not relate to that you know it's

1549
00:54:32,039 --> 00:54:35,440
like I think that's just an easy sell

1550
00:54:33,798 --> 00:54:37,920
for a lot of people especially younger

1551
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:40,240
it's like it changes your perspective of

1552
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:42,240
going to Dead shows going to whatever

1553
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:44,078
seeing good music and I think music in

1554
00:54:42,239 --> 00:54:46,118
cannabis just go hand inand yeah and if

1555
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:48,280
you remember you know people would stand

1556
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:50,358
up you know they didn't sell you seats

1557
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:51,960
so everybody would get down crowded and

1558
00:54:50,358 --> 00:54:54,960
stuff and then you could pass around

1559
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:56,119
fifths and joints and everything because

1560
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,838
they couldn't get in there it was too

1561
00:54:56,119 --> 00:54:58,920
tight

1562
00:54:56,838 --> 00:55:00,759
right and so concerts were totally

1563
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:02,559
different you know I saw lad Zeppelin

1564
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:04,799
from 10 feet away in the Kingdom that's

1565
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:07,240
amazing you know absolutely epic yeah

1566
00:55:04,798 --> 00:55:08,960
you know and uh life memories well

1567
00:55:07,239 --> 00:55:11,159
cannabis really Tunes you in which is

1568
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:14,480
what I like about the music with the

1569
00:55:11,159 --> 00:55:16,639
Cannabis uh smoking getting high on that

1570
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:19,639
level is you really get tuned into the

1571
00:55:16,639 --> 00:55:21,960
music whereas alcohol yeah other drugs

1572
00:55:19,639 --> 00:55:22,920
alcohol Tunes you out right like but you

1573
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:25,240
take some

1574
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:27,200
psychedelics you take some you smoke

1575
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:29,439
some weed eat some edibles whatever and

1576
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:31,159
get that experience you're tuned in like

1577
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,960
you're hyper sensitive to all the music

1578
00:55:31,159 --> 00:55:35,038
and the environment and it's such a

1579
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:37,679
great feeling and a great experience and

1580
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:38,960
really they're all experiences and not

1581
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:40,759
one of the experiences are quite the

1582
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,920
same like you could go to thousands of

1583
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:43,960
concerts you might have similar

1584
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:45,280
experiences but not one of them is going

1585
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:47,159
to be exactly the same it's like

1586
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:49,359
something that happens in time and it'll

1587
00:55:47,159 --> 00:55:50,679
never repeat itself exactly the same

1588
00:55:49,358 --> 00:55:53,078
well there's one thing that stayed the

1589
00:55:50,679 --> 00:55:55,480
same the old time every girl you walked

1590
00:55:53,079 --> 00:55:57,760
into in California was either Bob Marley

1591
00:55:55,480 --> 00:56:00,199
or Grateful Dead really every one of

1592
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,920
them was playing yeah you know and you

1593
00:56:00,199 --> 00:56:05,239
know I got to be a pretty big fan of one

1594
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:07,760
love you know like dude that's our Vibe

1595
00:56:05,239 --> 00:56:09,318
you know Grateful Dead pushed our Vibe I

1596
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:11,319
agree The Grateful Dead had a huge

1597
00:56:09,318 --> 00:56:14,318
impact on the Cannabis industry yeah you

1598
00:56:11,318 --> 00:56:16,599
know still does Marley yeah you know Bob

1599
00:56:14,318 --> 00:56:19,239
had his place yeah for sure and the

1600
00:56:16,599 --> 00:56:21,798
impact that he's left is just huge right

1601
00:56:19,239 --> 00:56:24,239
huge you know and his message you know

1602
00:56:21,798 --> 00:56:25,920
his message just never got old right um

1603
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:27,159
you know some of the music today you

1604
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,200
know you listen to it once it's like

1605
00:56:27,159 --> 00:56:30,639
that's enough of that song yeah you know

1606
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:32,358

within their that parking lot and very

1656

accepting of everybody right it was it

1657
00:58:15,239 --> 00:58:19,598
was inclusive and not exclusive I think

1658
00:58:17,239 --> 00:58:23,038
a lot of the communities now try to be

1659
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:25,119
exclusive and yeah Grateful Dead was

1660
00:58:23,039 --> 00:58:26,520
very inclusive of everybody and very

1661
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:28,119
accepting of everybody for for who you

1662
00:58:26,519 --> 00:58:29,599
are you're allowed to do your own thing

1663

1665
00:58:32,119 --> 00:58:36,599
mean these are people that had passion

1666
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:37,920
for the plant not for the money yeah um

1667
00:58:36,599 --> 00:58:39,599
well that's where all this stem from

1668
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:41,680
we're we're here because of that passion

1669
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:44,440
right like at the end of the day started

1670
00:58:41,679 --> 00:58:46,078
that's where it all stemm from you know

1671
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:49,720
at some point we all had to make a you

1672
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:51,720
know a living but beyond that it's like

1673
00:58:49,719 --> 00:58:54,078
my my passion for the sacred plant still

1674
00:58:51,719 --> 00:58:55,798
exists heavily I still am just super

1675
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:57,200
grateful for all the things that have

1676
00:58:55,798 --> 00:58:59,038
happened to me up to this point in my

1677
00:58:57,199 --> 00:59:00,199
life The Good The Bad and everything I

1678
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:02,280
wouldn't be here talking to you guys

1679
00:59:00,199 --> 00:59:04,078
without all mix of all that yeah I I

1680
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:06,798
agree it's you know it's been my whole

1681
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:10,839
life yeah you know from 14 years old

1682
00:59:06,798 --> 00:59:13,519
yeah you know I went wow I feel good you

1683
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:16,440
know I'm not all bummed out you know way

1684
00:59:13,519 --> 00:59:17,599
I went right I never understood why

1685
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:20,400
cannabis was

1686
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:22,039
illegal because it made me feel good it

1687
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,639
made me feel and and once I started

1688
00:59:22,039 --> 00:59:26,400
smoking it was like I felt like I was

1689
00:59:23,639 --> 00:59:28,199
home like I found my thing and the fact

1690
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,200
that they've arrested people the fact

1691
00:59:28,199 --> 00:59:34,118
that they've ruined lives it's it's

1692
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:36,759
crazy that it was so accepted to do that

1693
00:59:34,119 --> 00:59:38,760
for as long as it was you know and we've

1694
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:41,400
moved beyond that I think our

1695
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:44,359
memories uh unfortunately people's

1696
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:46,559
memories are shortterm they they start

1697
00:59:44,358 --> 00:59:48,038
forgetting all the crazy stuff and

1698
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:49,359
people especially the younger guys that

1699
00:59:48,039 --> 00:59:51,000
are they never experienced the stuff

1700
00:59:49,358 --> 00:59:52,400
that we had to go through uh even in

1701
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,079
Grow shops where you had to talk about

1702
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:56,318
tomatoes I mean it sounds crazy when you

1703
00:59:55,079 --> 00:59:58,160
think about it like if if you were to

1704
00:59:56,318 --> 01:00:00,119
tell people 50 years from now it's going

1705
00:59:58,159 --> 01:00:01,639
to sound even more crazy yeah yeah and

1706
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:03,838
with all the bad things happening in the

1707
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:06,480
world why did you put mandatory minimum

1708
01:00:03,838 --> 01:00:07,960
sentencing on marijuana yeah I mean

1709
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,920
isn't there worse things you know and

1710
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:10,798
it's what well it's the Gateway and I

1711
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:13,280
was like let me tell you what the

1712
01:00:10,798 --> 01:00:14,400
gateway to heroin is heroin yeah right

1713
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:16,798
it's not

1714
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:19,240
OD start calling stuff gateways you know

1715
01:00:16,798 --> 01:00:21,400
it's like man that first sip of freaking

1716
01:00:19,239 --> 01:00:23,439
beer was the Gateway well and the most

1717
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:25,280
most of the people that murder people

1718
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:28,480
they're not smoking weed they're not

1719
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:28,480
smoking weed murdering

1720
01:00:29,719 --> 01:00:33,639
cheeseburgers but they're not murdering

1721
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:35,119
people I think the weed Mellows people

1722
01:00:33,639 --> 01:00:37,159
out it also makes you reflect upon

1723
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:38,838
yourself yeah makes you think cannabis

1724
01:00:37,159 --> 01:00:40,519
isn't for everybody because I definitely

1725
01:00:38,838 --> 01:00:42,798
think it makes you look at yourself in a

1726
01:00:40,519 --> 01:00:44,838
different perspective and some people

1727
01:00:42,798 --> 01:00:46,159
can't handle that yeah right and so hard

1728
01:00:44,838 --> 01:00:47,519
to look at yourself it's it's hard to

1729
01:00:46,159 --> 01:00:49,798
look at yourself and it does kind of put

1730
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:51,280
things into perspective and that's what

1731
01:00:49,798 --> 01:00:52,719
I love about it though that's really at

1732
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,559
the end of the day it's like puts life

1733
01:00:52,719 --> 01:00:55,959
into perspective you know it puts The

1734
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:57,440
Good the Bad and the Ugly into perspec

1735
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:59,159
perspective yeah and you look at that

1736
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:01,880
last can of green beans in the cupboard

1737
01:00:59,159 --> 01:01:05,038

01:02:01,519 --> 01:02:05,719
just this Catalyst that's able to get

1767
01:02:03,199 --> 01:02:07,679
guys like you guys on the show so you

1768
01:02:05,719 --> 01:02:09,919
guys can tell your story you know my

1769
01:02:07,679 --> 01:02:11,679
show is so much bigger than me and I

1770
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:14,119
just try to really highlight the guests

1771
01:02:11,679 --> 01:02:15,440
and and get their important stories out

1772
01:02:14,119 --> 01:02:17,200
really at the end of the day it's like

1773
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:19,679
we're part of this bigger bigger thing

1774
01:02:17,199 --> 01:02:21,679
that's so much bigger than any one of us

1775
01:02:19,679 --> 01:02:23,199
individually and to be part of that is

1776
01:02:21,679 --> 01:02:26,639
really special and I think the more we

1777
01:02:23,199 --> 01:02:29,759
can all recognize that uh you I think it

1778
01:02:26,639 --> 01:02:32,679
warms my heart but also it's just I

1779
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:34,359
think it's our duty to do justice to

1780
01:02:32,679 --> 01:02:37,000
this plant and do justice to the other

1781
01:02:34,358 --> 01:02:38,920
people in our industry yeah and the fact

1782
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,798
that you went to culinary school and now

1783
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:43,079
you're creating flavors in marijuana

1784
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:44,798
yeah hand in hand yeah a lot of things

1785
01:02:43,079 --> 01:02:46,519
in my life have kind of tied in I you

1786
01:02:44,798 --> 01:02:49,559

this point but they all kind of circle

1798
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:15,240
back into what I do now so even the

1799
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:17,400
cooking kind of goes into with the

1800

keep fighting keep pushing through yeah

1825
01:04:09,838 --> 01:04:13,480
I found it you know there's definitely

1826
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:16,199
different levels of stress that people

1827
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:17,880
can handle yeah you know um I had the

1828
01:04:16,199 --> 01:04:19,278

1829
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:21,798
gentleman for 10 years at Sunlight

1830
01:04:19,278 --> 01:04:24,440
Supply that I'd never seen anybody in my

1831
01:04:21,798 --> 01:04:27,079

chew it up swallow it and go forward

1833
01:04:27,079 --> 01:04:29,839
yeah I was like there were days where I

1834
01:04:28,679 --> 01:04:31,598
looked at him and I was like man my head

1835
01:04:29,838 --> 01:04:34,639
would just blow yeah it's like all the

1836
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:36,240
things are coming at you right now um he

1837
01:04:34,639 --> 01:04:38,078
was brilliant he was a genius at what he

1838
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:41,479
did and that's what made that play

1839
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:43,278
successful he built a team that was

1840
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:45,960
second and none and so when he came and

1841
01:04:43,278 --> 01:04:48,000
offered you a job he went well I'm

1842
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:49,760
either against them or I'm with them

1843
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,798
yeah and it's going to be a hell of an

1844
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:55,400
uphill battle if I'm against them so you

1845
01:04:52,798 --> 01:04:57,519
threw yourself onto the team and it was

1846
01:04:55,400 --> 01:05:00,160
a great opportunity you know being

1847
01:04:57,519 --> 01:05:02,559
surrounded with that much talent um was

1848
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:04,639
absolutely amazing um we used to call

1849
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:06,760
him Stein brener yeah because he he

1850
01:05:04,639 --> 01:05:08,838
hired talent for the position and you

1851
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:10,520
know we could walk in and just devastate

1852
01:05:08,838 --> 01:05:12,318
environments well that's how cannabis

1853
01:05:10,519 --> 01:05:14,278
has changed before you could do it at

1854
01:05:12,318 --> 01:05:16,519
your house by yourself have a good

1855
01:05:14,278 --> 01:05:18,358
product make a living at it now it

1856
01:05:16,519 --> 01:05:20,159
requires a team and I love the team

1857
01:05:18,358 --> 01:05:21,639
right so I love the team mentality I

1858
01:05:20,159 --> 01:05:23,838
love the thing where it's much bigger

1859
01:05:21,639 --> 01:05:25,879
than yourself whatever but like there's

1860
01:05:23,838 --> 01:05:29,159
something special about forming a good

1861
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:32,480
team and you becoming

1862
01:05:29,159 --> 01:05:33,759
another uh piece of the machine right so

1863
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:35,480
like when when I'm a component the

1864
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:37,559
machine and I have these guys we all fit

1865
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:39,440
into place we all win together we all

1866
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:41,680
lose together there's just something

1867
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:43,480
special about that there is for sure so

1868
01:05:41,679 --> 01:05:45,239
have a very nice team too so yeah our

1869
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:48,119
our team is really good but that also

1870
01:05:45,239 --> 01:05:49,719
translates to when we work with you guys

1871
01:05:48,119 --> 01:05:51,880
or we work with this other company or we

1872
01:05:49,719 --> 01:05:53,278
have these collaborations you know and

1873
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:55,240
then we all win together it's like such

1874
01:05:53,278 --> 01:05:57,278
a amazing thing when we're all winning

1875
01:05:55,239 --> 01:05:59,318
right sure and if we lose we all lose

1876
01:05:57,278 --> 01:06:00,920
together we can talk to each other about

1877
01:05:59,318 --> 01:06:02,719
it but when we win we win together and

1878
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:04,440
it's a great feeling yeah and it's a lot

1879
01:06:02,719 --> 01:06:07,078
easier to win together than it is a part

1880
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:08,880
it is and and we can so there's no one

1881
01:06:07,079 --> 01:06:09,920
person that can do it all so finding

1882
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:12,079
people with their strengths and

1883
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:13,318
weaknesses and finding the things that

1884
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:15,079
are going to make you more efficient

1885
01:06:13,318 --> 01:06:16,558
it's like those are so important but

1886
01:06:15,079 --> 01:06:19,000
yeah working with people that you you

1887
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:20,920
don't want 10 head Growers you need one

1888
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,960
head grower yeah you need guys that can

1889
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:25,000
pull families you need guys that can

1890
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,079
water you need guys that can do this and

1891
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,838
that and then

1892
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:29,760
then you need media guys and you need

1893
01:06:27,838 --> 01:06:31,880
the one guy that handles a lot of stress

1894
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:34,319
yeah someone's got to do

1895
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:36,000
it got take that stress and if they

1896
01:06:34,318 --> 01:06:38,119
enjoy it it's that much better because

1897
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,000
it's like and you know what some people

1898
01:06:38,119 --> 01:06:41,838
are like you can't enjoy stress well

1899
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,079
it's not that I enjoy stress it's that I

1900
01:06:41,838 --> 01:06:46,639
deal with it and I enjoy the outcome

1901
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:47,960
after yeah like and I'm willing to over

1902
01:06:46,639 --> 01:06:49,558
I'm willing to wake up in the morning

1903
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:52,000
even when [ __ ] seems like it's falling

1904
01:06:49,559 --> 01:06:54,319
apart completely get out of bed go to

1905

going to handle it the best we can Y and

1909
01:07:00,519 --> 01:07:03,159
you know and I think that's what builds

1910
01:07:01,838 --> 01:07:04,400
good companies yeah I think that's the

1911
01:07:03,159 --> 01:07:06,159
best way to go about at least I hope

1912
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:09,119
that's what's building our company it's

1913
01:07:06,159 --> 01:07:10,719

1924
01:07:26,119 --> 01:07:30,039
learn about yourself a lot more by doing

1925
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:32,240
all these different things like what you

1926
01:07:30,039 --> 01:07:33,839
like what you don't like the type of

1927
01:07:32,239 --> 01:07:35,479
people you like to work with the type of

1928
01:07:33,838 --> 01:07:37,920
people you do not like to work with

1929
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:40,480
because there's a handful of those right

1930
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:42,480
and the suits you know I can deal with

1931
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:44,440
some suits I don't mind dealing with

1932
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:47,278
business people and I don't mind dealing

1933
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:48,720
with guys that are hippies you know like

1934
01:07:47,278 --> 01:07:50,920
classic hippie you know it's like

1935
01:07:48,719 --> 01:07:54,118
because some of those guys have the best

1936
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:56,480
ideas and stories and you know it's it's

1937
01:07:54,119 --> 01:07:58,880
all about being able to interpret

1938
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:00,199
people's information too MH they're

1939
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:02,519
generally not

1940
01:08:00,199 --> 01:08:04,000
overthinkers you get a lot of of of

1941
01:08:02,519 --> 01:08:07,278
corporate environment stuff and and they

1942
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:10,039
want to overthink things a lot yeah um

1943
01:08:07,278 --> 01:08:12,920
Stony guys are always simplified I like

1944
01:08:10,039 --> 01:08:15,640
Stoners because I'm a stoner me too

1945
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:18,719
right been fond of them since I was 14

1946
01:08:15,639 --> 01:08:20,198
absolutely and I think that in business

1947
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:21,880
I like dealing with people that smoke

1948
01:08:20,198 --> 01:08:24,039
cannabis that use the product right they

1949
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:25,679
that smoke cannabis we're in cannabis

1950
01:08:24,039 --> 01:08:27,039
let's smoke if you don't that's okay I'm

1951
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:29,719
not going to judge you on that but

1952
01:08:27,039 --> 01:08:31,679
really like we can relate on a different

1953
01:08:29,719 --> 01:08:33,960
level if you're also a smoker we can

1954
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:36,359
talk about the flavor of way it makes

1955
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:38,679
you feel and somebody like then it

1956
01:08:36,359 --> 01:08:40,400
becomes more than money too right yeah

1957
01:08:38,679 --> 01:08:41,520
it becomes something that we're both

1958
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:45,158
passionate about something that I've

1959
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:47,319
dedicated my life to and uh you know

1960
01:08:45,158 --> 01:08:48,519
it's it's a beautiful thing yeah I've

1961
01:08:47,319 --> 01:08:51,880
never met a person that a grow that

1962
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:53,719
didn't smoke I mean people are in it y

1963
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:56,119
you know for the passion of the plan

1964
01:08:53,719 --> 01:08:57,520
usually yeah usually yeah yeah there's

1965
01:08:56,119 --> 01:08:59,920
there's I have a couple friends you've

1966
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:02,000
been a couple places I haven't yeah you

1967
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:03,838
know they all go hey we can't smoke here

1968
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,319
but we can go over there right no I mean

1969
01:09:03,838 --> 01:09:06,838
we're in this we're in this commercial

1970
01:09:05,319 --> 01:09:08,319
world now and I have friends that are

1971
01:09:06,838 --> 01:09:10,158
really good Growers that don't smoke but

1972
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:12,679
I have friends that are really good do

1973
01:09:10,158 --> 01:09:14,158
Growers that do smoke and you know a mix

1974
01:09:12,679 --> 01:09:17,039
of inbetween some guys smoke a very

1975
01:09:14,158 --> 01:09:19,559
little and but but like I love the way

1976
01:09:17,039 --> 01:09:22,278
it makes me feel I love talking about it

1977
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:23,920
247 yeah some of my friends can't handle

1978
01:09:22,279 --> 01:09:25,759
how much I like talking about it all the

1979
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:27,520
time but it's like it's what excites

1980
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:29,399
yeah well you know it kind of relates to

1981
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:32,319
the wine industry yeah you know it's

1982
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:34,358
very similar and you know this this is

1983
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:36,359
my forecast I think you're going to see

1984
01:09:34,359 --> 01:09:38,319
wine and weed soon yeah right I think

1985
01:09:36,359 --> 01:09:39,838
wine and weed is going to be a staple

1986
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:42,000
together because there's they're such a

1987
01:09:39,838 --> 01:09:44,479
perfect marriage right it's a pairing

1988
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:48,039
yeah right what pairs with this p o r oh

1989
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:50,000
this indicia right I mean it's a natural

1990
01:09:48,039 --> 01:09:52,399
progression you know I actually have a

1991
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:56,479
question on that related to the wine so

1992
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:59,238
like someone said this um your old

1993
01:09:56,479 --> 01:10:01,799
friend um about the wine industry

1994
01:09:59,238 --> 01:10:03,718
creating like the bill yeah creating

1995
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:06,600
basically the Cannabis industry creating

1996
01:10:03,719 --> 01:10:09,560
the same type of thing where there's ter

1997
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:12,400
or there's regions and like uh you grow

1998
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:15,159
the best whatever strain you want up in

1999
01:10:12,399 --> 01:10:17,198
Humbolt and then up in sowa county is a

2000
01:10:15,158 --> 01:10:18,920
different strain so you think that's

2001
01:10:17,198 --> 01:10:20,599
actually oh it's happening it's already

2002
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:23,319
in the process of happening I think it's

2003
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:25,520
a great thing I think however we can

2004
01:10:23,319 --> 01:10:29,359
support The Growers that are still still

2005
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:31,880
around in Humble mesino Trinity Sonoma

2006
01:10:29,359 --> 01:10:34,479
especially because I'm California all

2007
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:38,920
all over the United States in wine they

2008
01:10:34,479 --> 01:10:41,279
have avas uh viticultural areas right

2009
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:43,039
and so in cannabis but based on Tero and

2010
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:45,319
location I think it's great because if

2011
01:10:43,039 --> 01:10:47,359
you grow sour diesel for instance I love

2012
01:10:45,319 --> 01:10:50,079
Sour Diesel yeah if you grow that in

2013
01:10:47,359 --> 01:10:51,759
mesino on the coast as opposed to Inland

2014
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:53,119
you're going to get a different product

2015
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:56,320
same thing if you were to go grow it in

2016
01:10:53,119 --> 01:10:58,158
Napa County versus somoma yeah you're

2017
01:10:56,319 --> 01:10:59,399
going to get a different product right

2018
01:10:58,158 --> 01:11:01,679
and especially with outdoor where you

2019
01:10:59,399 --> 01:11:03,960
have one cycle a year it's heavily

2020
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:06,079
influenced by the environment the

2021
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:07,480
minerality all these things these are

2022
01:11:06,079 --> 01:11:09,640
all conversations we all need to be

2023
01:11:07,479 --> 01:11:11,399
having but then also going to the winery

2024
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:13,360
and tasting right yeah I want to go to

2025
01:11:11,399 --> 01:11:15,359
winery and I want to taste different

2026
01:11:13,359 --> 01:11:17,399
yeah like where that's grown around the

2027
01:11:15,359 --> 01:11:19,399
area and like you go to the actual

2028
01:11:17,399 --> 01:11:21,359
facility and get to see it up go some

2029
01:11:19,399 --> 01:11:23,399
personal I think that would be a big

2030
01:11:21,359 --> 01:11:26,599
thing for the canas industry and the

2031
01:11:23,399 --> 01:11:28,679
winery the winery model has already been

2032
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:31,679
established right it's already the the

2033
01:11:28,679 --> 01:11:33,560
the brewery models like the the micro

2034
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:35,079
Brewery and the the brewery model where

2035
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:36,560
you do the tasting and you get the tour

2036
01:11:35,079 --> 01:11:39,198
like that's already been done like the

2037
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:41,520
footwork has been laid for can right by

2038
01:11:39,198 --> 01:11:43,279
the alcohol industry now we just need to

2039
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:45,480
take bits and pieces to make it make

2040
01:11:43,279 --> 01:11:48,158
sense for us and to be able to push that

2041
01:11:45,479 --> 01:11:50,399
forward because everybody wants to go up

2042
01:11:48,158 --> 01:11:51,879
to Humble I I don't know about everybody

2043
01:11:50,399 --> 01:11:54,599
but I definitely do and I think a lot of

2044
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:56,760
my friends would love to go to to a grow

2045
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:58,679
especially harvest season where you can

2046
01:11:56,760 --> 01:12:00,239
go talk or watch them harvest the plants

2047
01:11:58,679 --> 01:12:01,880
and it's like you're seeing the fresh

2048
01:12:00,238 --> 01:12:04,839
stuff come down and it's like wow this

2049
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:07,480
is cool or some breeder we got Jackson

2050
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:09,239
uh mean jeene from freeorn I would love

2051
01:12:07,479 --> 01:12:10,959
to go see his farm where he's harvesting

2052
01:12:09,238 --> 01:12:13,079
his genetics and see his new stuff for

2053
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:15,279
the year where he's either feno hunting

2054
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:17,079
stuff or he's breeding new things yeah

2055
01:12:15,279 --> 01:12:18,599
got it you know I mean there's a ton of

2056
01:12:17,079 --> 01:12:20,679
guys in the industry where it's like I

2057
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:22,480
would love to go see what they're doing

2058
01:12:20,679 --> 01:12:24,760
what they're doing white Thorn Rose we

2059
01:12:22,479 --> 01:12:27,519
talk about uh Huckleberry Hill Farms

2060
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:29,239
okay I had yeah yeah I I Johnny's great

2061
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:30,719

2062
01:12:29,238 --> 01:12:33,039
there and you get the tour and you can

2063
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:36,279
get a different version of what I think

2064
01:12:33,039 --> 01:12:38,319
is coming but I would love to where

2065
01:12:36,279 --> 01:12:40,039
that's you know you just basically have

2066
01:12:38,319 --> 01:12:41,799
a reservation just like with the winery

2067
01:12:40,039 --> 01:12:43,760
where you get a reservation you call

2068
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:45,400
their number you got the T the private

2069
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:47,000
tasting room tting room you get your

2070
01:12:45,399 --> 01:12:48,198
smoking jacket in you know I mean

2071
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:51,039
there's all kinds of ways they could do

2072
01:12:48,198 --> 01:12:53,319
it yeah yeah I've heard rumors you know

2073
01:12:51,039 --> 01:12:56,359
so in California yeah in California with

2074
01:12:53,319 --> 01:12:58,319
this new law maybe that fastpac that a

2075
01:12:56,359 --> 01:13:01,599
little bit yeah yeah well they really

2076
01:12:58,319 --> 01:13:03,399
need direct sales from farms I mean I

2077
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:04,520
think that's just a no-brainer yeah yeah

2078
01:13:03,399 --> 01:13:06,599
I think we're aways from them being

2079
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:08,040
mixed together yeah um but I don't think

2080
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:10,280
we're far away from having them

2081
01:13:08,039 --> 01:13:12,238
separated in the same environment yeah

2082
01:13:10,279 --> 01:13:13,840
it just makes sense yeah totally and

2083
01:13:12,238 --> 01:13:16,599
what do you mean by that well I think

2084
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:18,119
you know you'll have wine and cannabis

2085
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:20,719
in the same environment but you won't

2086
01:13:18,119 --> 01:13:22,960
have cannabis in the wine no I don't

2087
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:25,480
want canis in my wi personally I love

2088
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:27,239
good wine and I love good weed and I do

2089
01:13:25,479 --> 01:13:29,158
not want any of that good weed in my

2090
01:13:27,238 --> 01:13:31,519
good wine I just I think you just

2091
01:13:29,158 --> 01:13:33,079
negated both how do you know you didn't

2092
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:35,360
create a better product again we haven't

2093
01:13:33,079 --> 01:13:37,238
test it I mean I hope somebody does I

2094
01:13:35,359 --> 01:13:39,279
hope they win I hope that person wins

2095
01:13:37,238 --> 01:13:41,479
but it's not I'm not going to test it

2096
01:13:39,279 --> 01:13:43,439
I'm not even interested I put tobacco in

2097
01:13:41,479 --> 01:13:45,759
beer one time when I was brewing beer I

2098
01:13:43,439 --> 01:13:48,719
used to I used to brew beer back in I

2099
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:50,960
used to make saki I brewed beer now why

2100
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:52,920
did you put I figured I wanted tobacco

2101
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:54,639
beer cuz you know this is back I used to

2102
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:56,719
smoke cigarettes and I was like and it

2103
01:13:54,639 --> 01:14:00,319
was okay like the beer was okay if you

2104
01:13:56,719 --> 01:14:02,399
smoke cigarettes but if you you get sick

2105
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:05,719
yeah you would have problems both

2106
01:14:02,399 --> 01:14:08,599
ends so that didn't go very well go if

2107
01:14:05,719 --> 01:14:10,840
you grab um tobacco with tomatoes it

2108
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:14,679
makes a poisonous tomato I believe it

2109
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:17,440
really it's uh got to be careful what

2110
01:14:14,679 --> 01:14:20,079
you tobacco is a pretty strong product

2111
01:14:17,439 --> 01:14:22,479
nasty stuff um and it has a tendency of

2112
01:14:20,079 --> 01:14:26,039
taking over what it's hooked to oh yeah

2113
01:14:22,479 --> 01:14:28,879
um so years ago guy mixed and came out

2114

him taking us on and yeah that's

2140
01:15:28,079 --> 01:15:31,840
actually been been nice so we actually

2141
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,399
have our first trial going with that we

2142
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:35,360
just signed up with them and we have

2143
01:15:33,399 --> 01:15:36,799
someone in Southern California and it's

2144
01:15:35,359 --> 01:15:38,920
a great feature right you get a free

2145
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:40,800
lift to try for your first grow cycle

2146
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:42,960
yeah so you know whether you get to put

2147
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:44,639
it through it all of its Paces

2148
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:47,000
everything's done and then you can tell

2149
01:15:44,639 --> 01:15:48,440
us how it is and so this is a way that

2150
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:51,600
we can actually get a little more

2151
01:15:48,439 --> 01:15:54,039
documentation to by showing people what

2152
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:56,039
they're doing on their weekly grow how

2153
01:15:54,039 --> 01:15:58,079
the Horizon lift is so we feel it's a

2154
01:15:56,039 --> 01:15:59,479
win-win right we feel like every person

2155
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:00,960
who's going to do the trial if they do

2156
01:15:59,479 --> 01:16:02,718
it properly and right they're going to

2157
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:04,840
end up ordering more and it's a sale for

2158
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:07,480
us and if not we at least get to collect

2159
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:09,239
that data and and prove our concept more

2160
01:16:07,479 --> 01:16:11,439
we're trying not to do it ourselves we

2161
01:16:09,238 --> 01:16:14,359
want people in the industry who are

2162
01:16:11,439 --> 01:16:16,319
actually going to be doing it from not a

2163
01:16:14,359 --> 01:16:18,039
biased perspective really I mean that's

2164
01:16:16,319 --> 01:16:19,399
what I'm trying to avoid well you get

2165
01:16:18,039 --> 01:16:20,560
people from girl world the beauty of it

2166
01:16:19,399 --> 01:16:21,960
is they're interested in your product

2167
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:23,639
already yeah definitely and so if

2168
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:24,679
they're interested enough to try it and

2169
01:16:23,639 --> 01:16:26,960
then they get good results they're going

2170
01:16:24,679 --> 01:16:28,920
to or more I think it's pretty their

2171
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:31,158
model's pretty straightforward I like it

2172
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:32,880
I like the other ambassadors on like

2173
01:16:31,158 --> 01:16:35,960
myself I'm an ambassador for girl world

2174
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:37,880
I like their products I I the beauty of

2175
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:40,039
what girl world does with me is I can

2176
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:41,600
pick and choose I can I can say yeah I

2177
01:16:40,039 --> 01:16:43,679
want to work with this guy no I don't

2178
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:44,920
want to work with that guy U because

2179
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:46,520
there's some products I believe in and

2180
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:48,239
there's other ones I'm like no I I don't

2181
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:50,880
believe in that so I'm not going to put

2182
01:16:48,238 --> 01:16:53,198
my name and attach my name to that and

2183
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:55,440
so you know and I think they're they do

2184
01:16:53,198 --> 01:16:58,198
a pretty good job of you know filtering

2185
01:16:55,439 --> 01:17:00,479
out most of that stuff anyway yeah but I

2186
01:16:58,198 --> 01:17:03,599
like that I have the indecision and it's

2187
01:17:00,479 --> 01:17:05,718
like because I think uh the podcast is a

2188
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:08,360
great platform for people and fantastic

2189
01:17:05,719 --> 01:17:09,880
you know I think I can do uh a lot of

2190
01:17:08,359 --> 01:17:12,079
good research and development for some

2191
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:13,079
of these companies and sharing the

2192
01:17:12,079 --> 01:17:14,319
information because I'm all about

2193
01:17:13,079 --> 01:17:16,039
sharing at the end of the day I want

2194
01:17:14,319 --> 01:17:18,000
everyone to win the people I work with

2195
01:17:16,039 --> 01:17:19,800
especially defitely yeah generally the

2196
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,760
manufacturer is not the pipeline right

2197
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:23,719
you know you've got people that are good

2198
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:25,039
at making products yeah um and the

2199
01:17:23,719 --> 01:17:26,679
person that makes the product is

2200
01:17:25,039 --> 01:17:27,880
generally not very good at marketing

2201
01:17:26,679 --> 01:17:29,679
because they're product development

2202
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:31,800
people yeah so you know you run into

2203
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:34,000
some issues sometimes when you've got

2204
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:36,360
one effort going and you don't have part

2205
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,960
of the other effort so you know our

2206
01:17:36,359 --> 01:17:40,279
introduction to you and you know the

2207
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:43,359
help we've gotten from you is imperative

2208
01:17:40,279 --> 01:17:45,719
um because we don't do social media yeah

2209
01:17:43,359 --> 01:17:47,839
you know and social media as we know is

2210
01:17:45,719 --> 01:17:49,560
what's happening today we try we're

2211
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:52,319
terrible at it and we're not very good

2212
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:55,039
at it so that's just being honest yeah I

2213
01:17:52,319 --> 01:17:58,039
mean everybody has

2214
01:17:55,039 --> 01:18:00,399
not as good as you exactly so we are

2215
01:17:58,039 --> 01:18:02,319
going to be at MJ Biz together uh you

2216
01:18:00,399 --> 01:18:04,799
guys have a booth there and I will be at

2217
01:18:02,319 --> 01:18:06,238
the booth every day for a couple hours

2218
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,639
yeah nice I'm looking for people want to

2219
01:18:06,238 --> 01:18:09,279
come see me and hear about my

2220
01:18:07,639 --> 01:18:11,400
experiences with the lifts I think the

2221
01:18:09,279 --> 01:18:13,479
videos that we make here in the facility

2222
01:18:11,399 --> 01:18:15,479
we'll be there at MJ with you guys yep

2223
01:18:13,479 --> 01:18:17,479
we're going to have a couple of lifts at

2224
01:18:15,479 --> 01:18:18,839
the show that we're going to be showing

2225
01:18:17,479 --> 01:18:21,439
and operating and we're going to have a

2226
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:23,639
par meter with the ppfd reader just

2227
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:25,439
showing you how little you have to move

2228
01:18:23,639 --> 01:18:27,679
your lights to drastic Al change your

2229
01:18:25,439 --> 01:18:29,719
ppfd that part was really amazing by the

2230
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:31,600
way you know the fact that the very

2231
01:18:29,719 --> 01:18:34,000
slight slight movements can completely

2232
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:35,960
change make a big difference yeah so the

2233
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,960
other thing that I found interesting is

2234
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:40,279
what one inch of movement can do to

2235
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:42,198
least surface temperature yeah you know

2236
01:18:40,279 --> 01:18:44,519
one inch of movement can be four degrees

2237
01:18:42,198 --> 01:18:47,119
you know and I'm like wow that is

2238
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:48,120
extremely sensitive yeah you know and so

2239
01:18:47,119 --> 01:18:50,559
then you start playing with your

2240
01:18:48,119 --> 01:18:53,800
distances and and you go wow here's The

2241
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:55,679
Sweet Spot yeah um so it's been a fun

2242
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:58,360
product um I've had some really good

2243
01:18:55,679 --> 01:19:00,920
success with it in multiple environments

2244
01:18:58,359 --> 01:19:03,158
um but like we said you know hard to get

2245
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:04,920
the word out I got one last question for

2246
01:19:03,158 --> 01:19:08,599
you what are your thoughts on turning

2247
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:11,000
your lights down from 100% to 50%

2248
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:12,440
25% what are what are your thoughts on

2249
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:15,520
well as you know I'm not a lighting

2250
01:19:12,439 --> 01:19:19,319
technician y you know um I have seen

2251
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:22,920
some testing done y um and it does not

2252
01:19:19,319 --> 01:19:25,158
just equally go down yeah so um in these

2253
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:27,359
units there's multiple drivers and when

2254
01:19:25,158 --> 01:19:29,879
you're turning them down some drivers

2255
01:19:27,359 --> 01:19:33,319
turn down further than other drivers um

2256
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:35,840
spectrums change um a lot of things can

2257
01:19:33,319 --> 01:19:39,238
happen yeah and in no way whatsoever are

2258
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:41,079
am I saying they're going going to um

2259
01:19:39,238 --> 01:19:44,638
but the chance is there yeah you know

2260
01:19:41,079 --> 01:19:46,198
it's not an exact science I mean when we

2261
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:47,800
started looking at LEDs three years

2262
01:19:46,198 --> 01:19:49,719
before they came out on the market you

2263
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:51,840
know and we just kept shaking our heads

2264
01:19:49,719 --> 01:19:55,920
going these don't grow plants you know

2265
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:59,000
these don't grow plants um and then

2266
01:19:55,920 --> 01:20:00,840
fluence came along and fluence was the

2267
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:03,319
first light we got a hold of put it a

2268
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:06,679
bunch over some plants and went they are

2269
01:20:03,319 --> 01:20:09,079
responding yeah they are responding and

2270
01:20:06,679 --> 01:20:10,600
so there was the Breakthrough yeah right

2271
01:20:09,079 --> 01:20:13,158
everybody went that was the game changer

2272
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:16,320
they broke through yeah right and so now

2273
01:20:13,158 --> 01:20:18,679
here comes technology storing I mean I

2274
01:20:16,319 --> 01:20:21,599
think 86 manufacturers first show I went

2275
01:20:18,679 --> 01:20:25,239
to First MJ Biz 86 rck and lighting

2276
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:27,120
manufacturers one ship 86 business where

2277
01:20:25,238 --> 01:20:29,879
those lights are made yeah there's not

2278
01:20:27,119 --> 01:20:31,559
86 factories right right so you've got

2279
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:33,520
you know factories making multiple

2280
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:35,880
Lights under different names and you

2281
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:37,920
know there's it's kind of a crapshoot

2282
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:40,279
right now to sort through the good and

2283
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:42,560
the bad um but the funny thing is that

2284
01:20:40,279 --> 01:20:44,599
has a way of surfacing itself yeah um

2285
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:47,080
the bad have tendency of fading and and

2286
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:49,360
they good rise to the top right so we'll

2287
01:20:47,079 --> 01:20:50,840
see that over the next couple years um

2288
01:20:49,359 --> 01:20:52,359
and I think there's a lot more light

2289
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:54,119
technology that's going to be out I

2290
01:20:52,359 --> 01:20:56,319
think it's it's the early cell phone

2291
01:20:54,119 --> 01:20:58,158
right now yeah um and I think in a few

2292
01:20:56,319 --> 01:21:00,279
more years you're going to see some some

2293
01:20:58,158 --> 01:21:01,920
really neat stuff with you know

2294
01:21:00,279 --> 01:21:04,519
variating Spectrum we're like right

2295
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:07,920
beyond that Motorola flip

2296
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:09,760
phone right there yep we are right there

2297
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:11,960
with a big Motorola phone yeah and I

2298
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:14,600
think it's a you know I think we've made

2299
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:17,399
strides huge strides but we still have

2300
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:19,159
some really big strides to go yeah light

2301
01:21:17,399 --> 01:21:21,679
tuning wouldn't be necessary if they had

2302
01:21:19,158 --> 01:21:23,158
the right frequency yeah and you know

2303
01:21:21,679 --> 01:21:25,079
you've got some other things to look at

2304
01:21:23,158 --> 01:21:29,439
going forward you know we're running out

2305
01:21:25,079 --> 01:21:31,840
of pee right and you know Coco's

2306
01:21:29,439 --> 01:21:34,599
expensive to move what about

2307
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:36,760
cork so I've heard cor you know I don't

2308
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:38,480
know anybody that wants to use it no DNA

2309
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:39,480
I think DNA genetics they were launching

2310
01:21:38,479 --> 01:21:41,079
it I can't remember who they were

2311
01:21:39,479 --> 01:21:43,279
partnered with but they're going to Cork

2312
01:21:41,079 --> 01:21:45,399
cork is a substrate but cork was also

2313
01:21:43,279 --> 01:21:46,158
there's like a limited amount of Cork

2314
01:21:45,399 --> 01:21:48,399
Wine

2315
01:21:46,158 --> 01:21:50,079
industry you know that being said the

2316
01:21:48,399 --> 01:21:52,638
growth of the industry is going to have

2317
01:21:50,079 --> 01:21:54,760
an impact on on the Renewables yeah you

2318
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:57,800
know you know at some place will out pay

2319
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:59,119
them you know so you used to go by so

2320
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:00,400
yards and stuff and you would see the

2321
01:21:59,119 --> 01:22:02,880
big black mountains that have been

2322
01:22:00,399 --> 01:22:04,839
sitting there for a couple years yeah um

2323
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:06,719
and those aren't there anymore right you

2324
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:09,199
know they're the the raw material is

2325
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:12,399
moving much too fast um to keep

2326
01:22:09,198 --> 01:22:14,479
replenished and you know it's making a

2327
01:22:12,399 --> 01:22:16,559
hole somewhere in the ground yeah you

2328
01:22:14,479 --> 01:22:19,399
know so I think you know going forward

2329
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:21,239
there's going to be sustainability um

2330
01:22:19,399 --> 01:22:22,599
efficiencies I mean there's going to be

2331
01:22:21,238 --> 01:22:24,839
a lot of things that come into this

2332
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:27,840
industry and all of a sudden it's like

2333
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:29,639
you grew it for how much um and we'll

2334
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:33,039
all scratch our heads but you know we're

2335
01:22:29,639 --> 01:22:35,440
not there yet you know and I still you

2336
01:22:33,039 --> 01:22:36,840
know raise my hat to the craft Growers

2337
01:22:35,439 --> 01:22:38,678
yeah you know the craft guys are out

2338
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:41,159
there for a reason man they're generally

2339
01:22:38,679 --> 01:22:43,079
the old hippies and they're growing for

2340
01:22:41,158 --> 01:22:45,198
flavor and taste and and all the things

2341
01:22:43,079 --> 01:22:46,800
that we want you know it it's not an

2342
01:22:45,198 --> 01:22:50,719
issue of this is the only way I got to

2343
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:51,840
pay my bills right so bless them because

2344
01:22:50,719 --> 01:22:53,439
you they're still doing it because they

2345
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:55,279
love it and there will always be those

2346
01:22:53,439 --> 01:22:59,158
people I hope the grow this plant just

2347
01:22:55,279 --> 01:23:01,238
be out of love Yeah devotion differ love

2348
01:22:59,158 --> 01:23:03,319
and keep in mind the craft farmer is is

2349
01:23:01,238 --> 01:23:06,718
is having a child and and and he wants

2350
01:23:03,319 --> 01:23:08,158
to be you know grower like his dad so

2351
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:09,679
there's going to be that generational

2352
01:23:08,158 --> 01:23:12,599
grower that I think we're going to see

2353
01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:14,000
for a long time um but you know you're

2354
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:16,280
you see other entities pushing and

2355
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:19,279
shoving and you know changing the game a

2356
01:23:16,279 --> 01:23:20,679
little bit Everything Changes you know

2357
01:23:19,279 --> 01:23:22,359
you got to change with it that's what

2358
01:23:20,679 --> 01:23:24,600
I'm doing a guy from the 80s doing a

2359
01:23:22,359 --> 01:23:26,559
podcast you know you got to change with

2360
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:28,079
times this is great this has been a

2361
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:29,639
great podcast man thank you guys so much

2362
01:23:28,079 --> 01:23:32,000
for coming on you got it man it's been
