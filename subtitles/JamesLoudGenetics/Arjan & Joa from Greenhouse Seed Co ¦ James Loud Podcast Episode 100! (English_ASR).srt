00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:25,519
you guys did it from your house, and you

27
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:27,359
guys you guys woke up super early in the

28
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,200
morning. Yes, I remember. Yeah, that was

29
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,920
in 2020 or something. That was 2020.

30
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,879
Yeah. The lot's changed since 201, bro.

31
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,439
Yeah. So, you've been a mentor for me

32
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:40,640
since uh I won my first cannabis cup in

33
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:42,719
2012. You had 150 cups by then, and

34
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,239
you've kind of helped guide me in the

35
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,078
right direction. Sometimes I'm going

36
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:47,438
left or right, and you've given me some

37
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:49,679
good pointers over the years with

38
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:51,519
genetics, with branding, with a lot of

39
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,600
things. So, thank you for that. You're

40
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:56,239
most welcome. Happy to share the share

41
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:58,239
the knowledge and uh help the community.

42
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:59,679
Yeah. And then Yo's hospitality is bar

43
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:01,920
none the greatest hospitality in the

44
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,600
world. Whenever I go to Amsterdam, I'm

45
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,359
taken care of. You know, you guys have

46
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:08,159
an amazing apartment there and, you

47
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:10,478
know, amazing food. It's always epic

48
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,479
adventure. Yeah. Nice, man. Yeah. Well,

49
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,920
always nice to have you there. So, for

50
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,519
sure. Yeah. I mean, I love the city. I

51
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,318
love the city. Uh except for when it's

52
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,680
freezing cold out. Yeah. Almost always.

53
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:21,598
Yeah. Don't forget you guys here in San

54
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,959
Francisco have great food, too. We do.

55
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:24,079
We have amazing food. I would say San

56
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,560
Francisco has better food than

57
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,040
Amsterdam. I agree 100%. So, we have so

58
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,120
much diversity. So, with Amsterdam, they

59
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,959
have good food if you know where to go.

60
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,878
San Francisco just has amazing food all

61
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,800
over. Yeah. But like here, you know, we

62
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:38,479
went to a few nice restaurants. Any

63
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,920
restaurant could be nice. In Amsterdam,

64
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:41,039
you really have to hit a Michelin star

65
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:42,878
restaurant to make sure you're really

66
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,159
good. You know, the difference. Yeah.

67
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:46,959
So, I wanted to talk a little bit about

68
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:49,598
today how you guys met. Let's let's go

69
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,800
way back in history to the beginning. I

70
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:51,919
I want to hear this because I've never

71
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,879
actually heard it before. So, I thought

72
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:54,079
it would be a great starting point.

73
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:56,159
Well, let him tell the story because

74
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,360
it's quite funny. Yeah. Well Well, yeah.

75
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:02,158
He started already way before before I I

76
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,959
joined Greenhouse. So, 1985. No, started

77
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:08,399
with the seeds and stuff. 1992, the

78
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,000
first dispensary in Amsterdam. Uh I I

79
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,840
was still studying at that point, but

80
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,598
but smoking weed. I was not really an

81
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,719
alcohol guy. I would smoke weed, go to

82
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:19,439
the coffee shops a lot. And then in um I

83
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:22,239
went to university in San Diego at UCSD

84
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,919
for a year uh and coming from a weed

85
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,759
background and then going to the states

86
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:29,598
in those days 90 95 94 95 wasn't weed

87
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:32,199
everywhere right were no dispensaries

88
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:34,719
back in the day so I smoked Mexican

89
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:36,479
weed brick weed you know until I could

90
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:39,039
find some better ones through people

91
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:40,719
that I met from normal and uh funny

92
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:42,000
enough I learned more about greenhouse

93
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:45,120
because greenhouse was already a little

94
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,878
bit on the radar in America you know So

95
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,959
uh I heard about greenhouse in

96
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:51,120
California and then when I went back to

97
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,920
America uh to Amsterdam where I lived

98
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,920
all my life and I studied I had to do uh

99
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:58,399
at some point I had to get a job to pay

100
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:01,039
the rent right uh after university. So I

101
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,719
I I I got a job at the greenhouse I

102
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:04,479
applied for a job with ion

103
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:07,120
coincidentally now looking back it's

104
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:09,518
funny and then uh just went for a cup of

105
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,000
tea. They had a job interview. I I I I

106
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,080
joined the the the the people that were

107
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,720
there and then I started that greenhouse

108
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,439
and and uh yeah, but the short story is

109
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,320
I never left, you know, but I I enjoyed

110
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:25,120
it from the get- go and to be honest, I

111
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,879
was really I I I really like liked

112
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,199
cannabis much more than other stuff. And

113
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,519
I really see the benefits, you know,

114
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,319
like I always went with my friends, play

115
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:36,079
chess, play pool, never won fights,

116
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:37,839
never won. And I see other friends going

117
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:39,599
to bars and drinking and, you know,

118
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:41,039
getting into fights and stuff, trouble,

119
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,879
getting arrested, all that stuff, you

120
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,639
know. I was like, yeah, I was always the

121
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,478
more more chill guy. I do like parties

122
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,639
and everything, but but not really so

123
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,560
much of the alcohol. So when I started

124
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,560
at the greenhouse, I was just, you know,

125
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,720
went after a couple of months, first

126
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,800
High Times Cannabis Cup, I think 95 or

127
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:01,280
96, and that that was such a big event,

128
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,160
man. And I thought at that point Holland

129
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:06,000
was so far ahead actually looking back

130
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,000
at that point in time we were ahead of

131
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,918
the rest of the world. Right. Right now

132
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,918
it's a different story. We'll talk more

133
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:13,839
about it later. But uh I thought we were

134
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:15,680
going to legalize in two three years at

135
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:17,439
that moment in time. So you know I

136
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,600
thought okay we're going to do this and

137
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,439
blah blah blah. And then every year was

138
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,120
a different thing you know different

139
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,519
projects. We talk probably more about

140
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,759
some stuff but uh it's always been it's

141
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:29,279
been really interesting ride you know.

142
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,000
Yeah, it's always an adventure. And you

143
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:35,359
guys travel so much. Yeah. Yeah. The

144
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,560
travel is a getting an issue now. Yeah.

145
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,400
This year was I think the worst one cuz

146
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,120
we've been traveling up and down. Now we

147
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:45,679
have Argentina opening up in Brazil.

148
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,439
Yeah. Which before was not on the radar,

149
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,280
but we've been operating in Argentina

150
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:51,800
the last 10 years to our distributor,

151
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:54,319
Fran, who I used to work with in ITA in

152
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,000
Spain. And he moved back to to

153
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,079
Argentina. And he said, "Aran, it's

154
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,918
going to open in the future. Can I do

155
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:01,599
the distribution for your nutrients?"

156
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:03,439
Yeah, sure. Why not? No, nothing to lose

157
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,280
now. And we started that 10 years ago

158
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:06,800
and we got everything legalized as one

159
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:09,119
of the first ones and still one of the

160
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,439
few ones. Yeah. So, we control like 50

161
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,759
60% of the market with nutrients there

162
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:15,439
cuz you know our our product for for

163
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,600
private growers and also for commercial

164
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:19,759
growers is probably one of the best and

165
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,560
for sure the most easiest and best

166
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:25,520
priced one. So in a country like Brazil

167
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,519
and Argentina, Spain, this is a very

168
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:30,439
interesting, easy product, you know. So

169
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:33,439
we started with that. So we moved into

170
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:35,918
Argentina, now Brazil. So now, and we're

171
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:38,800
in Asia. So instead of being only in

172
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:40,478
Europe and a little in America, we went

173
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,478
and to the east and to the west from

174
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:45,279
Europe, you know. Yeah. which creates

175
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:49,279
like this crazy jet lag because now I

176
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:50,959
did in four weeks, Bonazeres, Rio, Sao

177
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:53,038
Paulo, then back to Bangkok and then

178
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:55,519
back to Vegas. Yeah. But you can imagine

179
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:57,680
the time difference is 15 hours. Yeah.

180
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:59,279
So it's ridiculous. We were him and me

181
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,280
were struggling here now this time, you

182
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:03,839
know, in Vegas with I think I slept 2

183
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,598
hours a day and then you're tired at

184
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:08,159
7:00 in the evening and you're awake at

185
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:12,478
11:00. For you it's a lot harder to come

186
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,479
here and then than it is to go back.

187
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,959
Yeah. Because if you arise in if you

188
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,399
arrive in LA or San Francisco, you go 9

189
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:20,719
hours back, right? But that's from

190
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:23,198
Amsterdam. That's not from Bangkok,

191
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,360
right? That's another 6 hours. Wow. And

192
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,598
even Yeah. And even then before you

193
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,479
worked in Africa a lot. So Africa is

194
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:32,159
down. So then the jet lag is is is

195
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:34,079
minimal. Well, most people know I'm from

196
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,400
Africa original, but if you have if you

197
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,918
take South Africa, Congo, from

198
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:39,679
Amsterdam, it's a line straight down.

199
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:41,279
It's the same time zone. Yeah. Yeah. So

200
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,519
there's maybe 1 or 2 hour difference in

201
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:45,519
some parts of Africa, but not a lot. So

202
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:48,159
that doesn't affect you. Bangkok is

203
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:49,758
quite easy. It's 4 or 5 hours. San

204
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,759
Francisco and LA is the worst, you know,

205
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,439
especially coming down here and then

206
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,639
getting into meetings, you know. Oh,

207
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,240
yeah. So you arrive here, it's

208
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,918
technically 9:00 in the evening and then

209
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,160
it's 12:00 again. Yeah. Mhm. And then

210
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:03,120
you have to work the whole day. At least

211
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,240
there's good food. It's good. The food

212
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,319
you have to be watched because you get

213
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,840
lazy when you eat too much. No. So, and

214
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,840
as everybody know, I'm quite a big

215
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:11,359
foodie as you. Yeah. So, I really

216
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,359
appreciate the food. I had some great

217
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,319
meals in San Francisco and in Las Vegas

218
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,240
again and like also in Sao Paulo and in

219
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,319
Brazil and in thing, you know, I don't

220
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,598
have time to train. So, that's the other

221
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,360
problem, you know, you gain like 3,

222
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:25,598
four, 5 kilos every four weeks, you

223
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,759
know, because no time to hit the gym or

224
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:29,120
too tired to hit the gym. Sure. Or, you

225
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,360
know, you do only half an hour instead

226
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,158
of a proper 50 minutes. So yeah, this

227
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,080
this this this jet lag with our seed

228
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:37,918
company and our fertilizer company, we

229
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,599
have to fine-tune this system how we're

230
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:41,679
going to do this because this year was

231
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,000
out of control. Yeah. And then I only

232
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:47,199
limit myself to a few fairs, you know.

233
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,080
We do Spanabis, we do Berlin, so

234
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,879
Barcelona, Berlin, Bangkok, Buenos Iris,

235
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,879
Sao Paulo, Las Vegas. Yeah. And then

236
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:57,120
here because you invited us, we did

237
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:59,519
Turmania this weekend which was a great

238
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,839
show. And then last night the ego clash.

239
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,159
But again we are home at 4:00 in the

240
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,760
morning, you know, right? That's the

241
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:08,079
industry for you in a nutshell. Yeah.

242
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:10,639
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's every

243
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,800
everybody think it's it's easy but it's

244
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:15,120
really really hard work, you know. I

245
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:16,719
think the rock rockstar lifestyle is a

246
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,720
hard lifestyle. I don't think people

247
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,240
give rock stars enough credit too. Like

248
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,759
the musician lifestyle, you know, they

249
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,039
go they go on tour and they hit it. I

250
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:24,958
mean, it's you guys are living that

251
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:26,399
similar life right now. Well, you know,

252
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,838
we're good friends with a lot of rock

253
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,519
stars. You probably saw the picture with

254
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,200
Dual Lipa last week. If you see her

255
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,039
travel thing, you know, it's like hard,

256
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,360
you know. Yeah. And then every night she

257
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,958
she's nearly two hours on stage. She

258
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,399
really works her ass off. One of the

259
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,159
nicest people in the industry, by the

260
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,799
way. And that's a rock star, you know.

261
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:44,639
You see with the DJs, but even a pilot

262
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:46,479
for an airline, you know. Oh, yeah. It's

263
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,480
horrible. I used to have I used to have

264
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,720
a hashtag, I don't use it anymore. More

265
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,720
miles than the pilot. And then Franco

266
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,160
took it over, you know. Sure. But we

267
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,519
have more miles than a pilot. We're just

268
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:58,480
looking at my mouse cuz you just

269
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,759
upgrade. I had 650,000 miles. Wow. And

270
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,600
this is just from a few months, you

271
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:04,240
know, because I use them sometimes. It's

272
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,920
ridiculous. Yeah. It's wild. Yeah. And

273
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,159
then every time you you're almost about

274
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:09,919
to go back, like now we we fly back

275
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:11,679
tomorrow and now we're used to this

276
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:13,039
schedule. So every time you're used to

277
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:15,919
it and then you go back and you start

278
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:17,919
from 3 4 days and mostly we are five,

279
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:19,199
six, seven days there. Yeah. So the

280
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:20,879
moment you land you, you know, you're

281
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,959
screwed again. Starting starting all

282
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:24,399
over again. Yeah. But now the holidays

283
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,838
nearly there. We have three more days in

284
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,600
Amsterdam. We have to do a lot of things

285
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,600
and then

286
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,440
take the plug out. So if you were to go

287
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,519
back from the beginning and look at how

288
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,600
it is right now, could have you imagined

289
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:40,839
it how it is? Yes, totally. But much

290
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:46,159
earlier when I I started growing

291
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:48,079
in 82, 83 when I was 16, 17, 18. It was

292
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:50,399
very illegal in Holland. Still totally

293
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:51,919
very legal by the way. Nothing changed.

294
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,799
I thought, you know what? And that was

295
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:57,278
at my time there. I'm I'm a great

296
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:59,278
mushroom fan. Yeah. In my private life,

297
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:00,720
I really like mushrooms. I do that a

298
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:02,000
lot. Also with my family, with my

299
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,759
children, with everybody, my friends

300
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,278
around me. I think it's one of the

301
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:07,039
nicest things to do. I think it opens

302
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:10,399
your mind. I think it makes you very

303
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:12,240
smart. It gives you a lot of um a lot of

304
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,839
new vision on things, you know,

305
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,360
perspective. Perspectives, that's the

306
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,839
good word. My English is not so good as

307
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,600
you guys know, but so good perspective.

308
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,120
So, at that time, I was like, okay, what

309
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,480
I'm going to do? I'm going to go in

310
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,120
marijuana or I'm going to go in

311
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,879
mushrooms. And I realized that mushrooms

312
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,159
also have for some people negative

313
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:30,078
effects because they take too much and

314
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:31,919
then they can jump down of a bridge or

315
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:36,239
do something stupid. Yeah. So I decided

316
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:40,240
to go with marijuana. This is 8283.

317
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:42,320
Then I opened my first shop in ' 87 with

318
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:46,000
two partners very small shop called

319
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:48,000
Tutti Frutti on the in Amsterdam and

320
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,600
they had no clue about business. Make a

321
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,200
long story short, after 6 months I

322
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,839
stepped out and then they continue with

323
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,720
it and they went broke and then in '92 I

324
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,880
started a real shop. So basically

325
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,320
uh 92 I opened to well you know the

326
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:03,039
place it's still there and I started

327
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:06,399
growing in 82 10 years before and the

328
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:08,399
only reason I opened the shop is that I

329
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,399
could not get rid of my weed anymore and

330
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,039
I was kind of the first sativa grower in

331
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,958
Holland. You know first of all I was the

332
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:17,919
first marijuana coffee shop in

333
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:19,239
Amsterdam. So you have to see if you're

334
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:23,278
talking about

335
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:26,320
92 90% of the menu was hashis mainly

336
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:29,759
Moro a little Afghanistan little India

337
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:32,160
you know charas and then 10% schwag like

338
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:34,159
some Jamaican some Nigerian stuff like

339
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:37,519
that you know like brick wheat kind of

340
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:39,838
stuff bad not good occasionally there

341
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,159
was some something nice there tie stick

342
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,760
maybe some tick or some lumps bread if

343
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:45,600
you were really lucky you could get your

344
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:48,639
hands on a kilo yeah wow

345
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,959
But before that, I I supplied Bulldog,

346
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,360
you know, Hank, good friend of my family

347
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:55,359
and a few other coffee shops. And then I

348
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,440
started growing this new stuff because I

349
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,000
was I'm I'm I come from a growers

350
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,079
family. And my mom used to grow, we were

351
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,159
living in Asia, she had 700 different

352
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:08,078
orchid things. And my mom comes from a

353
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:10,399
resistant family in the war, butter

354
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:13,278
smugglers, you know, against the against

355
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,200
the Nazi Nazi regime. And my grandmother

356
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:17,679
was butter smuggler. and they were all

357
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,040
doing that and she was a little on the

358
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:21,039
illegal side. I don't know if you know

359
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:24,000
the normal orchid growth but there's

360
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:25,759
some black orchids that cost $25,000 and

361
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,200
she was doing that kind of stuff which

362
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:28,799
intrigued me. She got very green

363
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,360
fingers. My mom is still alive. She's

364
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:32,799
nearly 90. Sometimes I post her garden

365
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,720
when it's in full flower. You don't know

366
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,319
what you see. So I got the green fingers

367
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,160
from her. But then I started growing

368
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,040
these sativas in these hes where I got

369
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:42,679
my hands on and I went back to the

370
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:44,958
coffee shops and the orange

371
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:47,159
said we don't know what to do with this.

372
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:50,399
I so I gave 2 kilos for

373
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:53,600
free. I was really young you know I was

374
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:56,000
in my 20s and I thought the owners were

375
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,399
in charge of their shops and not the

376
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,039
dealers. But then 2 months later I came

377
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,639
and I basically got my 2 kilos back and

378
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:04,000
they said it's cat piss. The Dutch

379
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,759
people don't like it. The tourists don't

380
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,639
like it. Nobody's buying it. We only

381
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:10,078
want skunk. Wow. And I Yeah. You know,

382
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,240
that was it. You know, I couldn't do

383
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:13,759
nothing with it. But at the same time, I

384
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,519
was a chef like you when you were young.

385
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,000
This is how I grew up, right? And I

386
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,240
thought, man, this is so good, you know.

387
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,159
And it's not only good for the taste,

388
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,759
but also how it how it is, you know,

389
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:26,000
like the workout, how you say that, you

390
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:28,159
know, like the the mental high, you

391
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
know, not like this couch look stoned,

392
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:31,439
you know, right? I thought, why don't

393
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,440
they like this, you know? So I started

394
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,079
going on with it until my wife said,

395
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,399
"Listen, if you're sure that this is

396
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:39,399
really good, open your own shop." So we

397
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,159
did that in

398
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:44,320
'92 and the first two years was a total

399
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:47,439
The first year was a total drama. Make a

400
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,199
long story short, uh Brendan Kennedy,

401
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,279
the owner of the High Times at that

402
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:53,679
time, Kennedy family, they had like a

403
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:55,439
consortium with 20 magazines and he

404
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:57,599
passed by in April and I never forget

405
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,600
this and I had no clue, bro. I didn't

406
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,240
know America. I didn't never heard of

407
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,240
High Times. And he said, "Listen, we're

408
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,759
going to do Thanksgiving, which is your

409
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,919
November, I think." No, we're going to

410
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:10,480
do a big competition. I'm going to get

411
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:13,599
500 or,000 people over and we going to

412
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,680
smoke this weed and blah blah blah. And

413
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,320
uh we're going to do an election and

414
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:20,000
blah blah blah, you know. But nobody

415
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,360
ever heard of High Times magazine. We

416
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,198
didn't even discuss it with the other

417
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,079
coffee shop owners. Everybody kind of

418
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:27,679
forgot about it until two days before

419
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:29,838
Thanksgiving. This guy calls me up.

420
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:31,439
We're coming tomorrow. Yeah. [ __ ] There

421
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,760
was 500 people in front of my door. I

422
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,760
had no clue. This was even before yo was

423
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,120
with me. Yeah. Yeah. So I called all my

424
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,600
friends, you know, come and help.

425
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,240
Luckily, I had my weed. Yeah. I had a

426
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,879
few kilos of that sativa weed, you know,

427
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,480
and um I had master kush at that time

428
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:51,759
and some with not even a

429
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:54,560
name. And um they came and they start

430
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,800
smoking it. And the first two Americans

431
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:58,399
and I I wish I see those guys back. They

432
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:00,078
said, "Arin, we've never smoked

433
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,078
something like this. This is so [ __ ]

434
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:03,439
good." And I knew I was on the right

435
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:05,439
track, you know. And another guy came

436
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,120
and another guy came and it was so And

437
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,560
then suddenly the next three, four days,

438
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,320
they were all sitting in my shop, you

439
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:11,679
know, like not in the other shops. You

440
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,839
feel the vibe, you know, going with the

441
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,799
cannabis cup. And I thought, "Okay, this

442
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,959
is really good." Now, make a long story

443
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:20,958
short, at that time, Hank had his hotel,

444
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:22,479
which he still has. And under there was

445
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:25,278
the Buddha Club. I don't know if you

446
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,839
remember that. Buddha disco Buddha

447
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:29,439
lounge and he gave the club to the guys

448
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,399
you know he was also competing of course

449
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,720
and then just don't forget you see five

450
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,480
cameras here but there were 40 like

451
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,040
every television station of the world

452
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,800
was there because was the first illegal

453
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:45,439
drugs cup yeah so CNN BBC Japanese

454
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:47,519
television everybody was there and all

455
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,880
my competitors we were all friends and

456
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,560
we're still friends you know I said oh

457
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:52,559
we have to be careful this going to fire

458
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:55,119
back in our face this is not good for

459
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:56,799
the industry we're going to go to jail,

460
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,959
you know, the staff [ __ ] their

461
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:00,559
pants, you know. Yeah. And I thought,

462
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:02,078
well, you know, we have nothing to lose.

463
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:04,240
We're illegal already anyway. You know,

464
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:06,480
what can happen, you know? Sure. And

465
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,160
then I don't know who was the first

466
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,240
year. We had some characters there with

467
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,400
Steve Hager. I think one of the first

468
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,720
few was with Gatwood Gail Brick. He was

469
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,400
running for governor of Kentucky. So

470
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,480
there is American comes with this big

471
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,160
cowboy hood, you know, which we were not

472
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,558
used to in Amsterdam because Amsterdam

473
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,640
is very very multicultural, you know.

474
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:26,399
like we're mixed from every like

475
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,160
everything. And I'll make a long story

476
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,240
short, there were six prizes and I won

477
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,759
five times the first prize, you know. I

478
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,440
went to the front and I picked up my

479
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,879
price and I did a camera from there. It

480
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,320
went like this, you know. Well, then you

481
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,799
were on the cover of High Times shortly

482
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:40,319
after that. Then 95 and 99. Yeah. I'm

483
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:41,839
the only guy who hit the front cover of

484
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:44,079
High Times two times, you know, and

485
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:45,839
three times more with Bud and Flour and

486
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:47,759
stuff like that. Yeah, that was a great

487
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:51,359
honor and helped us helped my company a

488
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:52,960
lot, our company. And uh yeah from there

489
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,959
on we were already of course working

490
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,960
with seeds. Then 95 we started the seed

491
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,319
company. Yeah. And the rest is history

492
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,200
you know you can see where we are

493
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:03,038
standing now. We grew

494
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:05,279
organically. So we never borrowed money.

495
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:08,079
We never wanted to be listed. We had so

496
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:10,558
many offers. We had so many private

497
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:12,558
planes flying in. We had a few few years

498
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:14,879
ago. You remember the Canadians like two

499
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:16,558
private planes. We have the most crazy

500
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,360
stories that we cannot even tell here.

501
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:21,200
Yeah. Yeah. But we said no to anyone.

502
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:23,599
Even like in Thailand now we're very

503
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:27,120
private with a private family, very good

504
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:28,879
friends of us and we do it our way and

505
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:30,639
that's the only way. We don't want to be

506
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,039
listed. We don't want to have investors.

507
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,038
We just grow organically and I think

508
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:37,599
that's why our company is quite

509
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:39,679
successful, very healthy, no depth.

510
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:41,359
Yeah. You know, and yeah, that's how we

511
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,038
do it. Well, yeah. And you've

512
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:44,639
transitioned all over. You were in

513
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:46,720
you're you still are in Spain in

514
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,240
Barcelona. You were in the Bass country

515
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:52,000
as well for a while and you were in the

516
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:54,798
Congo, you know, you've been all over.

517
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,798
Yeah. What I what I like to do is I like

518
00:18:54,798 --> 00:19:01,000
to go to new emerging markets where I

519
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:03,599
see options and you know um uh like

520
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,160
so we made a lot of Strain Hunter movies

521
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:08,159
as you probably know. So one on my radar

522
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,080
for very very long time was Congo. As

523
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,360
you know I grew up in Africa. My parents

524
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:15,199
lived there nearly 40 years. Um and

525
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:18,240
Congo was also on my radar. Look, you

526
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,960
have Africa and then you have Congo. We

527
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,200
call it the deep sea. And it's a huge

528
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,360
country. It's the size of Europe. And

529
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,798
you heard a lot of problems about Congo.

530
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:29,199
It's one of those countries that the

531
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:31,038
West has totally raped. Yeah. The

532
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,720
Americans, the Chinese, the Russians,

533
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:35,200
everybody's fighting for the resources

534
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,798
there, which gives it a really bad name,

535
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,480
you know. And you can see the diamond

536
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:40,720
mine. Well, in my movie, you can see one

537
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,759
of the diamond mines. I went in there.

538
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,319
So our partner is the back nephew of the

539
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:48,079
former president Joseph Kabila which

540
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:50,399
father far again was the president

541
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:53,439
before and got shot then he took over as

542
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,840
a 27 year old and 8 years ago he had to

543
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,480
now it's

544
00:19:54,839 --> 00:20:00,240
tidi so I had a contact through my South

545
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,000
African contact he said Arian we can get

546
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:06,240
a letter and we can travel free through

547
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,640
the country and we can shoot a movie so

548
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,160
and I know and as a matter of fact we

549
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,720
can still see that we still have to grow

550
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:14,400
there was still growing there. But if

551
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,038
you're on the equator in that part, your

552
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,200
side, your seeds become twice as big if

553
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:20,879
you grow them in full sunlight. So they

554
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,759
look really nice, you know, they have a

555
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:26,880
much much much let's say much better bag

556
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:28,960
appeal. Mhm. And I could do much more

557
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:33,200
there. So after make a long story short

558
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:35,120
after the movie we shot last day we were

559
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,279
sitting in the in the hotel in the VL

560
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:39,359
and uh that this whole group approached

561
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:40,879
us you know it was quite funny and come

562
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:43,759
can we have a talk yeah sure this and

563
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:46,799
that um we would like to grow in in our

564
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:48,879
country can you help us I said well I

565
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:51,038
think it's very illegal here no he said

566
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,640
yeah but we can get an R&amp;D license we're

567
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:54,720
connected to the president and we want

568
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,960
to get this industry going like Canada

569
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,480
and United States and can you help us

570
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,720
Yeah. I said, "Well, if you guys give me

571
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,120
a letter, I can grow here from

572
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,839
agriculture department or the justice

573
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:07,759
minister or the department of health or

574
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:09,918
whoever. We do it." And that's how we

575
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:12,558
started. And it was great for seeds, you

576
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,000
know, because we built 50 very well, you

577
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:16,558
probably saw it on Instagram. No. Oh,

578
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,640
yeah. We built very 50 very primitive

579
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:20,480
glass houses

580
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,200
for 18 hours cuz you're on the equator.

581
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,960
No. So, we work with LED lights. every 3

582
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,840
m we had a little LED light you know to

583
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,679
keep the photo period on 18 hours and

584
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:32,158
then we had seven big valleys where we

585
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:35,280
made we made hundreds of kilos of seeds

586
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,919
there so we learned a lot and that's

587
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:40,399
basically also where now the new base is

588
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,480
coming from so we did millions of plants

589
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:46,798
in those valleys so if you see now the

590
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:49,440
new the new full gas uh king's juice

591
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:51,599
lemon and orange many many of the

592
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,919
strains they they originate from there

593
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:56,480
that's where we did pre breeding work

594
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:59,120
until we finalized everything mostly

595
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:02,159
some in Spain with dust and mostly in in

596
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:03,918
in Thailand now. Wow. So yeah, and you

597
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,600
guys helped change policy in the Congo.

598
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,280
I mean it was more than just producing

599
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:09,199
seed. Yeah. So what what people don't

600
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:10,798
know you know cuz you know there's a lot

601
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,640
of talk about greenhouse and about us

602
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:14,558
and what are we all doing and you know

603
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,720
we're a McDonald's and all this [ __ ]

604
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:18,359
you know. So we have a quite a strong

605
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:23,558
core group.

606
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:27,199
So from 95 to

607
00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:30,079
2010 which is 15 years we set up in

608
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,080
Holland the cannabis retailers

609
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:34,639
association. I was a spokesman by the

610
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:38,558
way. Now Yoa is the spokesman the last

611
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:40,720
15 years. Yeah. So we had huge issues in

612
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:42,319
Holland and you have to understand how

613
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,759
this all goes. It's quite a long story

614
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:48,000
but I'll try to explain it a little bit

615
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:49,679
in a nutshell. Um, Holland has had the

616
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,519
dispensary model, the coffee shop model,

617
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,519
right? But we were on the scrutiny of

618
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:56,079
the United Nations, especially France,

619
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:58,400
Sweden, and America. It's really bad.

620
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:00,879
It's you're violating international law.

621
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,000
You have signed the convention of 1961

622
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,919
and 60. You cannot do this, blah, blah,

623
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,720
blah. So, we were under high pressure.

624
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,720
So in '95 we decided to start the base a

625
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,319
day which I became a spokesman of and

626
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,240
some strong other guys hang from the

627
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:16,639
bulldog and many of the big guys were in

628
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,159
there and we start fighting the system.

629
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,880
It's the same time that I created the

630
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:23,600
king of cannabis and nobody knows why I

631
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:26,000
created that but it was to create a king

632
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:28,399
so celebrities can come from America and

633
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,640
start helping advocate our case. And

634
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,798
that really worked out because guys like

635
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,759
Woody Harrison and Bill Maher and all

636
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:39,279
the big rappers be real. So many so many

637
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:41,440
people came to our shop because it was a

638
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:44,558
king suddenly, you know. So it was a

639
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,240
marketing strategic strategic idea for

640
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:47,599
me. Still the best bobbleheads in the

641
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,480
business. And the best bobbleheads in

642
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:49,759
the business. I still have my

643
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,599
bobbleheads. Yeah. Yeah. We have to make

644
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:53,200
them again. We went through. Remind me

645
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:54,798
later. I told you how funny your story

646
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,759
about the bobbleheads was cuz everybody

647
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:56,960
was laughing about the bobbleheads.

648
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:59,679
Yeah. They're classic. I still have mine

649
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,600
at the house. But I can confirm this

650
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:05,038
story because he was witness of it. He

651
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:06,558
arranged his story. Yeah. Anyway, so we

652
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:09,359
start fighting the whole system and make

653
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:11,278
a long story short, people like Debbie

654
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:13,439
Goldsbury, Berkeley Patient Group, Steve

655
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:15,278
D'Angelo, which I met last week with

656
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,798
Harborside. Yeah. They were all coming

657
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:18,319
to the cannabis cup, you know, and we

658
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:20,038
were promoting the cannabis cup. At that

659
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:22,079
time, I wrote the book How to Run a

660
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:24,079
Dispensary. And then we were in

661
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:27,519
politics. I spoke in the parliament a

662
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:29,199
few times to like make sure we we have

663
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:31,200
more leverage, you know, I said go back

664
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,798
to America and start working your

665
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,480
government. And at one point the

666
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:36,319
government the Dutch government also saw

667
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,599
okay Americans getting legal now we're

668
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:39,759
going to go illegal. It's a little bit

669
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:42,399
funny you know Americans telling us to

670
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:43,759
be illegal and themselves of course not

671
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,400
on a federal level but on the state

672
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:50,038
level we're legalizing. Yeah. So that

673
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:53,519
was the beginning of our politic being

674
00:24:50,038 --> 00:24:55,679
politic involved. Just very recently Yo

675
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:57,200
beat the mayor of Amsterdam after they

676
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,720
want to kick out the tourists again out

677
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,640
of the center of Amsterdam because he's

678
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,278
getting too busy. Yeah. And basically on

679
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,278
his own

680
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:09,840
he was much bigger. So in 2004 I went

681
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,080
back to the office and I said to the

682
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:14,000
guys listen if we want to survive in the

683
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:16,079
future and want to have a great brand we

684
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,679
should make sure that our message goes

685
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:20,798
all over the world you know and not only

686
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:23,038
in Holland in America. So I came up with

687
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:25,359
we were called in because I was making

688
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:26,558
king of cannabis with my greenhouse logo

689
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:28,558
and the lawyers and the mayor of

690
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:31,440
Amsterdam called me and said listen you

691
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:33,440
are violating the the laws of having a

692
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:37,360
dispensary in Holland. So there's five

693
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:40,080
laws. It's called A H O GJ J. A. No

694
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:42,399
advertisement, no hard rigs, no younger

695
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:44,639
people, no deals under five grams, uh

696
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,080
above five grams, and no disturbance in

697
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,080
the street. That's kind of what they you

698
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:49,918
have to oblige to the a of

699
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:51,839
advertisement. I was kind of violating.

700
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,360
They said cannot do anything on YouTube

701
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:55,278
anymore. Greenhouse, too much

702
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:57,839
greenhouse, cannabis cup, hager, we

703
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:59,038
going wild. Yeah, this is really And

704
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:00,480
they liked us because we were the

705
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:03,278
spokesman. said, "Listen, we're not

706
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,919
going to find you now. Let's stop." Wow.

707
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:08,400
So, I break my head, you know, and then

708
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:11,038
at one point I say, "Okay, I said to my

709
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,480
lawyer at that time, I came with this

710
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:14,558
one night. I just saw the light, you

711
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,120
know." I thought, "Okay, strain hunters,

712
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:19,759
me and Franco." So, I went to the

713
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:22,479
office, let's go back to Africa. Let's

714
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:24,720
start filming there, rough content, and

715
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,159
let's see how get everybody upset. We're

716
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,839
going to get killed. We're going to get

717
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,400
closed. We're going to go in prison.

718
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:32,480
This is a really bad idea. But when

719
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,000
everybody said that to me, I go the

720
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,960
other way. I think this is going to be a

721
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,240
really great idea because they're

722
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,519
already talking about it. You know, for

723
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,440
sure. The lawyers didn't know what to do

724
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:41,278
by the lawyers know what to do. And then

725
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,558
later the mayor said, "You really got us

726
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:43,839
there because you changed the name. What

727
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:45,359
can they do?" Yeah, it's the same face,

728
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:47,359
but it's not greenhouse, you know. It's

729
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:49,199
me, Strain Hunter. So, the first one

730
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:51,359
with Malawi was a direct success. We had

731
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,360
10 million hits and then National

732
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:55,119
Geographic came and then later Vice came

733
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:56,558
with Shane and everybody and well you

734
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:58,158
know the whole success about this

735
00:26:56,558 --> 00:27:01,200
straight out of the movie but the

736
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:02,960
message was to show how 200 people

737
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,440
around the equator are depending on

738
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,960
marijuana. So if you go to Africa what

739
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,038
many people don't understand where I'm

740
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,360
from is kids cannot go to school because

741
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:13,519
they have to guard the kettle.

742
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:15,839
So a poor African family would have

743
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:17,918
three fields one corn field or they call

744
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:19,759
it millie. So that's the food for the

745
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:22,240
cow and they have maybe one cow and two

746
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:25,119
goats. They have a vegetable field to

747
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,839
eat themselves and they have a marijuana

748
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:29,678
field to make a little money. Wow. To

749
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:30,639
survive and that's where the danger

750
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,880
comes. You know if they're going to take

751
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,799
that away with legalization also those

752
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,919
families have a problem. So I wanted to

753
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:39,599
show that and you know sometimes things

754
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:43,038
start going as a roller coaster. You

755
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:44,798
know like I made Malawi then I don't

756
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:46,240
know how many more we made but look at

757
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:48,000
where we went you know. Well, Sin

758
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,839
Vincent, you are there now? Yeah, I'm

759
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,880
there now. Yeah. So, I went there in

760
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:55,278
2012 because I already knew that the

761
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,039
volcano mountain of Sin Vincent supplies

762
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:59,038
the whole Caribbean. Weed is not coming

763
00:27:57,038 --> 00:28:00,798
from Jamaica. Weed is not coming from

764
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:02,640
Florida. Weed is not coming from

765
00:28:00,798 --> 00:28:04,639
Colombia. It's coming from St. Vincent

766
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,038
with the scarabs. Those guys are all in

767
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,640
my in my movie. Yeah. And in my private

768
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:09,839
life, I travel a lot. So, I met all

769
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,640
those guys. I said, "Okay, I'm going to

770
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:15,918
film that." Within 3 months after we put

771
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,360
that that uh film out. Yeah. the

772
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:19,520
president of the prime minister of

773
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:20,959
finins or the president I don't remember

774
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:22,639
went on national television you can

775
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,480
google it on BBC say okay the strain

776
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,000
hunters were here we're going to take

777
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,079
their advice we're not going to lock up

778
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,599
people anymore for less than an ounce or

779
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:31,038
for more you know they can if you're a

780
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:33,439
tourist you can come smoke on our

781
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:35,038
beaches so this is the kind of awareness

782
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,200
we wanted to create with those movies

783
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:39,119
you know so bring something extra to the

784
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,080
table where we can help the community

785
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:44,879
worldwide not only in our local humbled

786
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:47,278
area or San Francisco area or Amsterdam

787
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,360
area of Bangkok. No, like a broader

788
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:51,519
vision where politicians are standing up

789
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:53,278
say, "Okay, this is reasonable on a

790
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:56,319
global scale." On a global scale, we did

791
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:58,839
Morocco legalizing now. We did Colombia

792
00:28:56,319 --> 00:29:01,759
legalizing now. We did Thailand. We did

793
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:03,839
Swaziland. We did South Africa. We did

794
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:05,839
Congo. We changed because that was your

795
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:07,918
question. We changed the constitution of

796
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:09,759
Congo. Took us 5 years, but it went

797
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,960
through all the parliament. We spent

798
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:15,278
more than $300,000 from our own money to

799
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,798
change the constitution. And now other

800
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:19,119
people have the license there and we

801
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:20,798
don't mind. Yeah. And what and what said

802
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:22,798
is like what people don't see because

803
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:24,960
sometimes they see us in a certain way

804
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:27,519
they don't see the path that that is

805
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,480
before legalization. Right. So what says

806
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:33,119
in Congo to change the con constitution

807
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,759
what it took was when we when we started

808
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:37,759
there uh uh cannabis was in the

809
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:40,158
constitution as the the the devil's

810
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:42,398
herb. The devil's herb. So it's not like

811
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,559
you start legalization in America where

812
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:46,959
there is a cannabis culture already. You

813
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:49,759
start from zero. No, we started at minus

814
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:52,399
400, you know, so and then to legalize.

815
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:54,640
And then in 2017, for example, our team

816
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:58,319
went to Thailand. We're in in Thailand

817
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:00,640
since 2017 already. Uh our science guy

818
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:02,720
gave seminars, you know, to educate and

819
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,399
and inform the people. And then when

820
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,079
they said, "Hey guys, there's a chance,

821
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:07,599
you know, in Thailand, it's going to go

822
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:09,199
it's going to go the right direction."

823
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:10,959
and we were busy with other things. I

824
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,960
don't remember what, but we said, "Okay,

825
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,720
we we you went to prison for the for

826
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,480
your life if you were caught with

827
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,679
cannabis." So, we we said, "Okay, you

828
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,519
guys go ahead. It's never going to

829
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,919
happen in Thailand." And then at some

830
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:23,679
point it just they made the switch. But

831
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,360
what a lot of people don't see is they

832
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,440
they only see, of course, what they see

833
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:28,719
on Instagram and on online and and

834
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,000
everything, but they don't see the

835
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:34,278
process before. They don't see all the

836
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,880
hard days and nights. Exactly.

837
00:30:34,278 --> 00:30:38,720
journey even now as we as we speak the

838
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,799
people see what what is happening they

839
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,120
see Thailand they see Africa but now

840
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:45,038
we're also talking with other countries

841
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:47,199
around because because Thailand is the

842
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:48,798
first one in Asia but but you can

843
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,720
understand that the the countries around

844
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:53,038
are are watching they're looking

845
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,880
observing what's going on so they send

846
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:57,278
delegations to Thailand we speak with

847
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:00,559
the government also in Thailand is it's

848
00:30:57,278 --> 00:31:02,880
they started the legalization completely

849
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:04,720
basically opposite as Canada and Germany

850
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,278
Over there they started with, you know,

851
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:10,000
in Canada with a big book of regulation,

852
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:11,519
right? So many rules and made the

853
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,839
product very expensive. In Thailand,

854
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,519
they did the opposite. They said it's

855
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:17,119
legal from now on. So you say, okay,

856
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:19,038
what's the legal framework? What?

857
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:20,558
There's no legal framework. It's legal

858
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:22,398
now, you know. So they started with

859
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:24,480
zero. It was like black or white and now

860
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:26,479
we're writing the book. So the most

861
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,919
asked question to us is how's it going

862
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,679
in Thailand? I hear it's going to go

863
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,440
backward. No, it's not backward. It's

864
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,120
the dance, you know. It's the dance how

865
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,038
we're going to regulate. So, we started

866
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:36,959
with zero and now we're writing the

867
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:38,640
book, you know, now we're doing making

868
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,480
the regulations progress. It goes up, it

869
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,880
goes down. Yeah. And it doesn't make it

870
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,480
easy because, you know, uh again on

871
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,960
Instagram, everything's always nice,

872
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,240
parties and and and you know, well,

873
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,319
Instagram is part of the problem with

874
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,240
cannabis right now. I feel like people

875
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:53,918
are so excited about the way stuff looks

876
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,759
that it's gone away from how does it

877
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:58,320
make you feel? How does it taste also?

878
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:59,519
Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. Well, if

879
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:01,359
you look at Thailand, it's a good

880
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:05,038
example he gives. Yeah, like Thailand

881
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:07,759
League 2 years ago in June 2022.

882
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:09,200
In 2018, we got the phone call, can you

883
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,960
come and advise at university? There

884
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,919
will be some politicians and everything.

885
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,519
Yeah. And Haiko, who's the guy who is

886
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:17,840
behind all these papers and everything,

887
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,440
our partner. I said to him, don't go.

888
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:21,119
And Haiko is from Thailand. He had a

889
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,038
house in Kosamui, so he know Thailand

890
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:24,319
really well. He said, Arian, let me go.

891
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:26,960
I said, listen, we're going to spend

892
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:29,839
$50,000 on a pitch. We have to take two

893
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:33,440
professors, a doctor, follow up before

894
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:36,079
airplane tickets, hotels. I'm not going.

895
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:38,399
Never ever. It will be legal in Asia.

896
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:41,199
That was my idea. Yeah. Yeah. I was so

897
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:42,879
wrong. So, in the end, he convinced me

898
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,880
to go. I said, "Okay, you go. You spend

899
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,440
half the money, you take one guy and one

900
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,880
doctor and you go do your thing." Yeah.

901
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,240
He went, he said, "It was great." I

902
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,840
said, "What's the only advice you give

903
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,079
them there?" I said, "Don't make the

904
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:56,158
mistakes we made in Holland, in Canada,

905
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:59,558
and in the United States. with all your

906
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:02,080
bloody regulations, you know,

907
00:32:59,558 --> 00:33:05,200
over taxation. We can talk about that a

908
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:07,759
little bit later. Yeah. So, I told them

909
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,319
one thing. Don't make that mistake. In

910
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:12,558
2022, they called me. You can see, by

911
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:14,798
the way, in my uh in my Thai movie that

912
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:16,720
we launched in February, the deputy time

913
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:18,639
prime minister is in the movie. Can you

914
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,880
imagine a deputy prime minister or prime

915
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:23,519
minister of any western country in a pot

916
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,278
movie? Never. There they came because I

917
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,278
promised them 80 million tourists by

918
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:29,278
2013 and they're going to get it. Yeah.

919
00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:31,038
Yeah. So, we went already this year to

920
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:32,720
35 million and next year we go 40

921
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:34,000
million, then we got 50 million. Yeah.

922
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,919
As long as we're all on board in

923
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,759
Thailand. We're going to try to get the

924
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,519
F1 now in Thailand in Bangkok. We're

925
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:40,798
trying to legalize gambling maybe and

926
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:44,399
there's more things going going to

927
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:46,158
happen. Yeah. So, in 2022 they called us

928
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:47,199
and they said, "We're going to do it." I

929
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,919
said, "What are you going to do?" We're

930
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,919
going to legalize totally. I said, 'What

931
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,840
do you mean recreational and medicinal?

932
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:55,600
Just we're going to just let it go. It's

933
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:56,798
kind of medicinal and we'll see what

934
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:59,038
happens. And this is where we're

935
00:33:56,798 --> 00:34:01,359
standing now, you know. Yeah. So, and

936
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:04,000
and this is one of the one of the things

937
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:06,319
that we as a team bring to the table,

938
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,320
you know. So, if there's two other Asian

939
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:10,319
countries who are speaking right now, we

940
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,359
just had the two sons of one president

941
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,720
of an Asian country flying into Holland

942
00:34:13,358 --> 00:34:16,319
and Secret Service comes, they put

943
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,000
[ __ ] tape on the cameras and then we

944
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,359
speak. You know, this is how it really

945
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,918
goes. Wow.

946
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:23,519
And LA was just legalized medicinal

947
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:26,480
cannabis to the neighboring country of

948
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:28,320
Thailand. Amazing. And yeah, and this is

949
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,878
and we we are really proud of that, you

950
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,639
know, because Japan next year 25. Wow.

951
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:35,118
Medical. So, we're talking to the main

952
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:37,440
guys there. We're advising

953
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,119
Yeah. We we are very good friend of us.

954
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,838
Some few Japanese billionaires are

955
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,119
behind that push Tokyo University and

956
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:44,878
it's going to happen. It's going to go

957
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,639
slow in Japan cuz it's quite a

958
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:48,639
conservative country but it's a

959
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,800
beginning and every step helps you know

960
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:53,280
also like now in Germany also it's it's

961
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,519
it's limited it's with a lot of

962
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,879
restrictions but but it's a big step

963
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:58,480
because it's the biggest country in

964
00:34:56,878 --> 00:35:01,199
Europe and what about Middle East you

965
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,719
know if if technically you know I'm

966
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:04,480
quite in shock when I land in San

967
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:06,159
Francisco in LA in New York and I see

968
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,639
the airports you know same a little bit

969
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:10,639
in in Europe. Yeah. You go to Abu Dhabi

970
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:12,559
or Dubai or or Singapore or Hong Kong

971
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:15,920
you come in a new world. Yeah, they're

972
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:19,358
way ahead. Yeah. And in 9 January this

973
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:21,838
year, UAE, so Dubai and Abu Dhabi, the

974
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:25,279
punishment for smoking went from 30

975
00:35:21,838 --> 00:35:26,960
years to 3 months. That's a first big

976
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,440
step. That's a huge step. That's a huge

977
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,679
step. And nobody realizes this, but you

978
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,358
know, we're Haiko's been working very

979
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:35,759
extensive with the government there for

980
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:37,279
the last 3 years maybe. Yeah. You know,

981
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,960
it's difficult because you know, they

982
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,880
have all kinds of issues, you know,

983
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,920
there in the Middle East. Like in the

984
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:47,519
Middle East, like the Emirates is like

985
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,599
every religious group, every I'm not

986
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:51,599
allowed to say the names, every other

987
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:54,640
group, let's put it that way. Yeah. They

988
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:57,280
all say, "Okay, this stays out of the

989
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:59,519
conflict zone. This is where our wives

990
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,200
and our kids go to school. This is where

991
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:03,759
we have the holidays and this is where

992
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:05,759
we kind of try to figure out solutions."

993
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,760
Yeah. So this the place where we then

994
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,560
also can talk, you know, and see, okay,

995
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,320
how far can we go? So just to give you

996
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:13,838
an

997
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:15,760
example, there's a few big party areas

998
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:18,400
from Ibita that are now going to open in

999
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,640
Dubai, like for example, Ushay. Yeah.

1000
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,800
But there's other groups that I know

1001
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:26,319
really well that are not going that are

1002
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:29,440
also invited by the bosses. And then the

1003
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:31,599
conversation goes like, why are you

1004
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,159
turning down so much money doing the

1005
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:36,320
party here in Dubai or in Abu Dhabi? Cuz

1006
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:39,759
my people can't use drugs, so we're not

1007
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:41,680
coming. Interesting. So, okay. Well, and

1008
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,400
then the sons of the bosses say, "Okay,

1009
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:46,078
well, we'll be working on that." So,

1010
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,320
this is where we are standing now in the

1011
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:51,440
real world, you know, like, okay, who's

1012
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:53,760
making the next move? Brazil. Yeah. Very

1013
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,079
recently, you can have six plants now.

1014
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,720
Yeah. I I came from a fair was 30,000

1015
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:01,920
people. I think I did 10,000 autographs.

1016
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:03,919
So, Brazil, Argentina, Germany,

1017
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,358
Thailand. You see the movement going,

1018
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,519
you know, where we are involved. the

1019
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:11,119
momentum. The momentum, you know. Yeah.

1020
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:13,599
And then you see our countries like I

1021
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:15,599
see your bloody president Joe Biden

1022
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:17,920
pardoning two bloody turkeys. He's only

1023
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,559
president for another month. Okay. But

1024
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,800
he pardoned his son. He did and two

1025
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:24,719
turkeys. Yeah. And what about those

1026
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:29,039
20,000 innocent people sitting for

1027
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:32,959
cannabis in jail? Thailand 2022

1028
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:35,838
released on the same day 7,000 prisoners

1029
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:38,320
that were convicted for cannabis. Yeah.

1030
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:39,920
On the same day. 7,000 people out of

1031
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,599
prison, which is the way it should be.

1032
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,920
And not a single problem with one of

1033
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:45,440
them. And gave out how many clones? Was

1034
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,119
1 million. No. Oh yeah. And 1 million

1035
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,720
clones. Million. They gave out 1 million

1036
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:51,200
clones. It's more a symbolic thing,

1037
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:52,959
right? But still, it's pretty cool. The

1038
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:53,919
act of giving. Yeah. It's very symbolic.

1039
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,199
I think that's amazing. I don't think

1040
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,280
there's many presidents in the world

1041
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:58,719
that would do that, you know, million

1042
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,000
clones. It's not happening here. No,

1043
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:01,838
it's not happening in the US. Maybe

1044
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,039
Trump will do it, you know. Just you

1045
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:04,480
never know. You never know what's going

1046
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:05,838
to happen in the next four years. I

1047
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,280
mean, yeah. Yeah. Well, if Trump gives

1048
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:10,078
them out, at least their their biggest,

1049
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:12,160
the best, the most awesome that you'll

1050
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,480
ever ever see. The best clothes in the

1051
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:15,598
world, right? Yeah. But and you just

1052
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,559
never know what's going to happen. I

1053
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:20,559
think a lot of people are

1054
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:22,480
scared and a lot of people are excited

1055
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:24,320
about what could happen. And I think

1056
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:27,599
we've been going in the wrong trajectory

1057
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:29,039
for the last four years and for more

1058
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,280
than the last four years. It's been, you

1059
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:32,880
know, long time. It's a long time. But

1060
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,519
let's see now your American government.

1061
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,640
If I look around Trump now, Trump is the

1062
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:38,800
only one doesn't drink and doesn't

1063
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:42,400
smoke, but the rest does. If it's Joe

1064
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:44,960
Rogan or it's Alan Musk or whoever it

1065
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,200
is, they're all smokers. Yeah. So, let's

1066
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:49,599
see how this will influence him, you

1067
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:51,598
know, and and what kind of decisions

1068
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:53,760
would be made. Look, it can't go any

1069
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:55,519
worse. No, it can't go any worse. And I

1070
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,280
think the potential is really good for

1071
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:59,039
change, right? It's going to change one

1072
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,760
way or the other. Like, that's the only

1073
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:03,440
thing constant is change anyway, but uh

1074
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,000
yeah, we need change. We need change. I

1075
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,440
mean, the economy is in a bad place, you

1076
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,119
know? And then federal legalization.

1077
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,960
It's just it's silly that we don't have

1078
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:13,039
federal legalization for cannabis. It's

1079
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,639
on a federal level, yet we have more

1080
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:16,800
than half of the United States in

1081
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:18,000
support of cannabis. You know, we have

1082
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,400
more than half of the United States

1083
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
that's medical. It seems to me that we

1084
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,000
need to look at ourselves in the mirror

1085
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,760
a little bit differently and I think the

1086
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,358
younger generation is getting older now

1087
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,359
and they are starting to get into

1088
00:39:27,358 --> 00:39:31,598
politics and that's going to be the big

1089
00:39:29,358 --> 00:39:33,598
change. So in the next 10 years it's

1090
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:37,680
definitely going to change. I don't

1091
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:39,519
know. Look our our problem is a mult is

1092
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:42,559
a big problem. Yeah. Yeah. We have five

1093
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:44,719
enemies. We have pharma as an enemy. We

1094
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:46,639
have tobacco as enemy. We have alcohol

1095
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:48,799
as an enemy. And we have the religious

1096
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:52,358
people as an enemy. Yeah. four I

1097
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:55,039
probably forgot one maybe big egg yeah

1098
00:39:52,358 --> 00:39:57,358
then our governments now if you look at

1099
00:39:55,039 --> 00:40:00,000
Japan or Asia you look at Europe and you

1100
00:39:57,358 --> 00:40:03,400
look at America

1101
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:09,760
5% 4% obesus in

1102
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:12,320
Asia 25% in Europe 60% in America

1103
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:15,760
our politicians are killing us because

1104
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:18,079
they are responsible for this huge

1105
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,320
problem in America with fentinol and

1106
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:22,800
with wrong food. Most of the food you

1107
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:24,960
guys are eating is illegal in Europe or

1108
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,560
in Asia in most countries. In most

1109
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,320
countries, yeah, a lot of these

1110
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:30,078
addictives and all that kind of stuff

1111
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:32,480
you sue. So if you just take it from

1112
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:35,119
there, if the politicians are already

1113
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:37,440
willing to kill their own people, they

1114
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:40,000
don't give a [ __ ] about cannabis, right?

1115
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:43,639
Yeah. So here is huge problem for us.

1116
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:46,719
Yeah. If our politicians are not taking

1117
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:49,440
responsible responsibility to ban

1118
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:52,000
certain foods and certain chemicals that

1119
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,720
are used, why should they worry about

1120
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,559
marijuana? Mhm. This is the the the

1121
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:58,480
biggest problem, right? I think, you

1122
00:40:56,559 --> 00:41:00,239
know, so we are killing our own

1123
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,240
population and we don't give a [ __ ]

1124
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:04,159
Yeah. That's what's happening. Well, and

1125
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:05,679
I mean you you guys can both agree with

1126
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:09,118
me that cannabis makes the world a

1127
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:10,559
better place. And so looking at it any

1128
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,400
other way, it's like there's not people

1129
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:14,000
like like alcohol and tobacco are way

1130
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,440
worse, right? No matter how you look at

1131
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,960
it, you look at the statistics.

1132
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,039
Statistically, it's a lot worse. There's

1133
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,960
more deaths from alcohol and tobacco

1134
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:23,838
across the board, yet cannabis is still

1135
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:26,000
illegal. Mhm. But cannabis will always

1136
00:41:23,838 --> 00:41:27,759
have that stigma and and but it can

1137
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,440
change really quickly. You see that for

1138
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,119
example, I don't think it had the stigma

1139
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,000
200 years ago and I don't think a 100

1140
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,720
years from now it's going to have the

1141
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,639
same. No, but here is here is different

1142
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:38,559
from madness. No, but and and here is

1143
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:40,400
much more accepted and it's changed also

1144
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:42,239
with the kind of legalization, you know,

1145
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,838
even if it's on the state level. But in

1146
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:45,679
Thailand, for example, you see it as

1147
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:47,759
well. Like 2 years ago or four years

1148
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:49,679
ago, of course, it's not. I mean, you

1149
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,920
can't even roll up a a joint in in

1150
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:53,679
public. Now, if you go to a Michelin

1151
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,039
star rooftop restaurant, for example,

1152
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:56,879
you say, "Oh, can we smoke here?" Yeah,

1153
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:58,960
of course you can smoke. You go to the

1154
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,480
smoke area, you roll a joint, and and

1155
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,079
other people will ask you, "What are you

1156
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,760
smoking?" And they're interested in it

1157
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:06,480
and and everything. in in Holland you

1158
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:08,000
cannot even imagine that you know if you

1159
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,199
on the streets right now you can't even

1160
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,838
smoke on the streets you can't smoke in

1161
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:14,000
the streets no but cannabis there is

1162
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:15,279
pushed like last week I was giving an

1163
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,199
interview on television because there

1164
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,440
was a eightpage letter from the from the

1165
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:21,598
mayor about the uh the center of the

1166
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,760
city and there's one sentence on coffee

1167
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:25,599
shops and the media pick it out and they

1168
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,920
and they they talk about coffee shops I

1169
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:30,720
said we have such big problems in this

1170
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:34,880
neighborhood you know robberies gang

1171
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:36,719
wars uh drug drug uh abuse and and you

1172
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,480
pick out this one sentence, there's much

1173
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:41,118
bigger problems, but they keep always

1174
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,039
going back to the blame on the sometimes

1175
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:45,200
even I'm in Thailand and and we speak

1176
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:46,800
with the with the minister, I go on

1177
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:49,358
television in Thailand, speak about the

1178
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,839
policy, I fly back to Amsterdam, I go to

1179
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:54,559
the council to speak about not smoking a

1180
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:56,559
joint in public in in the the the

1181
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:59,039
contrast is sometimes so big, it's

1182
00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:00,960
unbelievable, you know, and then I mean,

1183
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:02,318
I'm born and raised in Amsterdam and I'm

1184
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,920
proud of the city, But sometimes

1185
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:05,759
nowadays I'm even a little bit

1186
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,280
embarrassed of this situation, you know,

1187
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,040
when people say, "Oh, you can't smoke in

1188
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,440
Amsterdam anymore." No, it's just on the

1189
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:13,279
street in certain areas. But they're

1190
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,639
pushing it in a certain direction. Well,

1191
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,200
they've cut down on the coffee shops,

1192
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:19,838
too, cuz there was a lot of coffee shop

1193
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:22,239
400 to 165. Yeah. And I don't want to

1194
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:24,400
cut even more back. And like the whole

1195
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:25,759
thing with tourists now, okay, all the

1196
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,440
tourists are coming for the coffee shop,

1197
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,319
which of totally [ __ ] of course,

1198
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,679
right? Yeah. And in the center or in the

1199
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:33,279
center they say, "Oh, it's so big." But

1200
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:35,519
in the in the red light area, there's 12

1201
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,200
coffee shops left. Yeah. Yeah. And the

1202
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:38,800
even the local people there are against

1203
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:40,078
us. They say, "Yeah, the Vistrad, which

1204
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,400
is a famous street, they used to have

1205
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:43,760
20. There's zero." And they still think

1206
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,318
there are 20 there and they live around

1207
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,160
the corner. Yeah. You know, and then the

1208
00:43:46,318 --> 00:43:50,000
mayor and and the mayor sitting there in

1209
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:51,920
council. Yeah. So, we're going to ban

1210
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,159
the tourists from the coffee shops, but

1211
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,760
then the most political parties that are

1212
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:56,879
smart enough to live there, too. Yeah.

1213
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,119
So, we're going to get a lot of street

1214
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,400
dealers now. Yeah. And guess what?

1215
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:03,838
Heroin and crack is back at the central

1216
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:06,960
station for the first time in bloody 20

1217
00:44:03,838 --> 00:44:09,519
years. Yeah. Because there's no cops.

1218
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,119
So, not only we don't have housing, we

1219
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:14,239
don't have nurses, we don't have

1220
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:15,599
doctors, schools in Amsterdam are going

1221
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:18,318
to four days because we don't have

1222
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:20,880
enough teachers. Yeah. Yeah. But you

1223
00:44:18,318 --> 00:44:23,440
know what what says this information the

1224
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:26,160
the council gets, they don't get it from

1225
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,760
anywhere but from us, you know, us as a

1226
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:30,159
community. I'm not talking about us in

1227
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:32,000
general. So even the people watching,

1228
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:33,639
you know, if you want to help

1229
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,400
legalization, if you want to help

1230
00:44:33,639 --> 00:44:38,239
normalizing cannabis, you have to speak

1231
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,079
with your local politicians, you know,

1232
00:44:38,239 --> 00:44:41,679
cuz there's a dance always there's new

1233
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:43,920
people coming in and out. If there's new

1234
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:45,838
people coming in the council, I go there

1235
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,838
because literally they don't know the

1236
00:44:45,838 --> 00:44:49,039
difference between hash and weed. So if

1237
00:44:47,838 --> 00:44:51,920
you don't know the difference, how can

1238
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:53,519
you make a policy about cannabis? You

1239
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:56,000
cannot because you don't know what you

1240
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:57,358
what you what you are you know what what

1241
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,039
you base your opinion on and then you're

1242
00:44:57,358 --> 00:45:00,960
influenced by the people around you that

1243
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:03,759
they likely don't underestimate that and

1244
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,358
if people are in in in councils or like

1245
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,280
municipalities where it's still a little

1246
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:10,159
bit you know gray area or whatever and

1247
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:12,000
you want to change go out and and talk

1248
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:13,440
with the people if I'm not in Amsterdam

1249
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,880
and there's something in the media I

1250
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,358
call around nobody wants to go on

1251
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:20,000
television I was like guys come on man

1252
00:45:17,358 --> 00:45:21,679
go with your you know tell your story

1253
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,760
because people need to know and I also

1254
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:26,318
tell people outside of the business. So

1255
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:28,880
people who produce glass houses and and

1256
00:45:26,318 --> 00:45:30,639
put them in Canada and in America, Dutch

1257
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,200
Dutch companies that are super

1258
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:34,719
successful in cannabis, please help me

1259
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:36,318
say this message. And then sometimes

1260
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:37,759
they do and that's helpful, you know,

1261
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:40,000
but people need to get the message

1262
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:42,560
across. That's why we do always podcast,

1263
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,119
we do seminars. If they invite us in

1264
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:47,358
Canada for a seminar, we go, you know, a

1265
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:49,920
TED talk. We do everything to always

1266
00:45:47,358 --> 00:45:52,318
keep talking and informing, educating.

1267
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,920
and he's much more diplomatic than me.

1268
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:55,679
So most of the time I let him do it

1269
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,280
because I hate them. I can't handle

1270
00:45:55,679 --> 00:45:59,838
them. Cuz I tell him straight in the

1271
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:02,160
face, your government is responsible for

1272
00:45:59,838 --> 00:46:04,159
losing a 100red billion Yeah. of

1273
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:06,399
economic prosperity in the last 5 years

1274
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:08,399
in the coming 5 years. You killed the

1275
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,639
glass house industry. You killed the

1276
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,960
light industry. Gavvita was a Dutch

1277
00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:15,118
company. It was they sold it for $240

1278
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,599
million to HTON. Friends of mine all

1279
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:20,559
Yeah. But they were scared. Yeah. Why

1280
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:22,559
are you selling such a viable good

1281
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:24,960
companies from Holland? You know, nutr

1282
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:27,199
companies all sold. They killed it in

1283
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:30,079
Holland. Yeah. This is the future. You

1284
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:31,279
know, one of the best things biggest

1285
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:33,280
things is going to be it's going to be

1286
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,800
bigger than porno and alcohol. Yeah.

1287
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,200
Smoking marijuana. You know, it's

1288
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:39,599
bigger. You kill it. Why are you killing

1289
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:41,598
the baby? And I'm just telling that, you

1290
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:44,480
know, and it's it's it's amazing. They

1291
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:47,519
have no clue. Only because of their own

1292
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:49,519
political agenda. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And

1293
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:51,920
every politician is sitting there

1294
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:53,920
because his own private agenda. There's

1295
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,318
not a politician sitting there like a

1296
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,480
Gandhi or a Nelson Mandela. We had

1297
00:46:56,318 --> 00:47:01,119
that's there for really for everybody in

1298
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:03,760
the community. You know, it's always

1299
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:06,800
like it's a Donald Trump or it's a Joe

1300
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:11,040
Biden with an agenda, right? Yeah. But

1301
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:14,800
is Joe Biden there for us? No. Is Donald

1302
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:17,759
Trump there for us? No. you know, is the

1303
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:19,760
Dutch prime minister there for us? No,

1304
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,280
it's very tough to be a politician. It's

1305
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:24,160
something that not a lot of people want

1306
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:26,640
to do. I'm sure it's like me. I'm not

1307
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:29,838
not I have no interest in politics. But,

1308
00:47:26,639 --> 00:47:32,239
uh, so as far as you guys are now in

1309
00:47:29,838 --> 00:47:33,599
Thailand and you are very vertically

1310
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:35,199
integrated, you're one of the most

1311
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:37,599
vertically integrated companies in the

1312
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:38,960
world. You guys go from not only seed to

1313
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:40,800
sale, but you grow your own that you

1314
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:43,199
sell at your own dispensaries. Plus

1315
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:45,839
you're also moving into GMP

1316
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:48,639
international export. Yeah. So how is

1317
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:50,759
that going? Well look look we're in

1318
00:47:48,639 --> 00:47:53,598
Holland and we also have been in Holland

1319
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:57,119
and there we are very very limited. You

1320
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:58,640
know since 2002 I'm not able to go to

1321
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:00,559
one grow room. If I'm being caught in a

1322
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:02,799
grow room and take away all our license

1323
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:04,799
so we can never control our menu. So

1324
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:07,599
some sometime people [ __ ] about our

1325
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:09,599
menu. Some stuff is not the best because

1326
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:11,519
Yeah. But we are depending on a very

1327
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:13,119
illegal market. You get caught with a

1328
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:16,480
little grow room, you go straight four

1329
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:18,160
years to prison. Yeah. No discussion. So

1330
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,920
it's very very difficult. So our dream

1331
00:48:18,159 --> 00:48:21,519
was to be vertically integrated

1332
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:23,358
somewhere where we can really show all

1333
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:25,280
our skills. Like we make great seeds.

1334
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:27,039
Yeah. But yeah, if you cannot show the

1335
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,599
flower, it's really bad, you know. Mhm.

1336
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:32,239
So in Thailand, we have the option now.

1337
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:34,559
We grow polyweed or glass wheat. We call

1338
00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:38,159
it premium glass. We grow indoor wheat.

1339
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:39,920
We grow even GMP wheat. We grow outdoor

1340
00:48:38,159 --> 00:48:43,118
and from all those products we can make

1341
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:45,440
dry sift, we can make rosen, we can make

1342
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:46,880
bubble hash. So basically from one

1343
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:49,440
variety you have five different things

1344
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:51,280
which is really really nice. And now in

1345
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:54,000
in our six dispensaries that we have

1346
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:55,760
five in Bangkok and one in Kosamu people

1347
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,960
can come there and they can have the

1348
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,319
whole experience. You want to have

1349
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,400
Rosen, you want to have this, you want

1350
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:02,239
to have that, it's all there. So that

1351
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,240
was part of our dream, you know, to to

1352
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:07,519
have that vertically integrated to the

1353
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:09,519
max and we are in northeast Thailand.

1354
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:10,800
You can probably compare the climate a

1355
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:12,719
little bit to North Kell, you know, end

1356
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,960
of the season, we get our humidity in

1357
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:16,719
the glass houses down to 35% which is

1358
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,079
great. Sure. You know, the night and the

1359
00:49:16,719 --> 00:49:20,078
day temperature is great, especially

1360
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:22,160
between August and March. So we can make

1361
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:24,559
there a great product. So the next step

1362
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:26,639
to us which was always our step is to

1363
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:28,800
make sure that your mom and my mom can

1364
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:30,159
have it in a pharmacy in a country where

1365
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,760
you cannot have it recreational where

1366
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:33,679
you have to go on the street like

1367
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:36,480
England, Germany a little bit,

1368
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:38,719
Australia. Yeah. So probably somewhere

1369
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,559
next year we will have our product on

1370
00:49:38,719 --> 00:49:43,039
the shelves there for a very reasonable

1371
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:44,880
price. So there you can obtain our great

1372
00:49:43,039 --> 00:49:47,599
lemon orange or full gas or super

1373
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:49,119
lemonades or nuri cake or king's kush.

1374
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:52,960
So yeah, that's the vertically

1375
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:55,039
integrated grid dream. But then 3.0 cuz

1376
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:57,760
now it's also GMP and we can make sure

1377
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:59,759
it's on the shelves and we are ourselves

1378
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:02,079
GMP. It's not like that somebody else

1379
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:04,160
has to do the back door or the front

1380
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:06,400
door where it's GMP packed and whatever,

1381
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:08,879
you know, we do that in our own house.

1382
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:11,680
So that's great. So this is the the next

1383
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:13,358
and actually final step of my dream to

1384
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:15,679
be like in different countries, you

1385
00:50:13,358 --> 00:50:18,239
know, like like a normal business. Yeah.

1386
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:20,239
like just it's pharma technically but

1387
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:22,399
it's still weed you know it's a great

1388
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:23,838
product and we can make sure that your

1389
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:27,358
grandmother and my grandmother and

1390
00:50:23,838 --> 00:50:30,239
whoever can obtain that that product in

1391
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:31,440
a safe way for a very reasonable price

1392
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:33,838
well it's beautiful because it's

1393
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:36,559
somewhere between pharma and a you know

1394
00:50:33,838 --> 00:50:38,318
I feel like it's not an absolute pharma

1395
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:40,400
product but it's not an absolute egg

1396
00:50:38,318 --> 00:50:42,558
product either it's somewhere in the

1397
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,639
middle is yeah look technically it's

1398
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:46,800
totally egg because we grow egg you know

1399
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:49,440
it's a glass also it's indoor you know

1400
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:51,359
it's only the GMP part so basically post

1401
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:54,000
harvest you know the packaging right you

1402
00:50:51,358 --> 00:50:56,719
know it's just just to re just to

1403
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,960
understand you know haiko and I do the

1404
00:50:56,719 --> 00:51:02,639
recreational part he has to do that part

1405
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:04,720
just the SOPs is one me 40 paper oh yeah

1406
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:08,639
paperwork yeah paper all the cgmp

1407
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:10,799
paperwork so it's horrible EUGMP is wild

1408
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:12,400
yeah and we are German EUGMP you know so

1409
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,920
that's the highest standard in the world

1410
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,318
because you have American GMP you have

1411
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:18,880
Dutch GMP You have Israelian GMP, you

1412
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:21,358
have Thai GMP, but the German one is the

1413
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:23,358
one most recognized. So also the audit

1414
00:51:21,358 --> 00:51:26,239
happens from Germany. So the group flies

1415
00:51:23,358 --> 00:51:29,759
in and audits our factory and and then

1416
00:51:26,239 --> 00:51:31,759
from there we can So we are now 80

1417
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:33,839
months in the process. So we just

1418
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,280
started there in 2022. We did a huge

1419
00:51:33,838 --> 00:51:38,400
pheno hunt, probably the biggest ever

1420
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:40,079
with 147,000 plants. Yeah. And we can

1421
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:44,318
speak a little bit about that later. And

1422
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:46,160
from there on uh I think mid of next

1423
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:48,079
year we will be in the shelves in

1424
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:50,239
Australia and in the UK or Germany.

1425
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:52,079
Let's see how it goes. Pretty amazing.

1426
00:51:50,239 --> 00:51:54,078
Yeah, it's it's a dream. It's really a

1427
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:55,359
dream. I still cannot believe it. So we

1428
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:56,720
don't speak too much about it, you know,

1429
00:51:55,358 --> 00:51:58,880
because we want to see it happening, you

1430
00:51:56,719 --> 00:52:01,118
know. I don't like to think talk about

1431
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:03,358
things that didn't happen yet. Sure. But

1432
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:04,960
yeah, everybody sees on us on the radar

1433
00:52:03,358 --> 00:52:08,960
and yeah, we can't hide it anymore.

1434
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:12,639
We've actually 20 to 23. We opened the

1435
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:14,400
first club June 23. Sean, the first year

1436
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:15,679
me and Dus were like with our captain,

1437
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,880
you know, in the airport, you know,

1438
00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:18,480
people seeing us, what are you guys

1439
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,838
doing here? You know, right? Because we

1440
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,280
want to have this little advantage

1441
00:52:19,838 --> 00:52:23,119
because we are refitting the factory

1442
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:26,240
that we took over in the north and

1443
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:27,760
adding the GMP part. So now, yeah, you

1444
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:29,279
know, now we're out in the opening and

1445
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,440
people are seeing it, you know. So we

1446
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:34,880
came out with it and it's happening.

1447
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:36,480
Nice. Yeah. Yeah. Really impressive. So,

1448
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,640
I wanted to go through some of the pheno

1449
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:40,240
hunt stuff. So, we went through 560

1450
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:44,078
different plants or we went through a

1451
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:47,598
part of 560 different plants. 420. 420.

1452
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:50,400
Exactly. What the [ __ ] It's 420. Yeah.

1453
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:52,800
Talk about Jesus. Is that on purpose or

1454
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,800
is that That one's just magic, right?

1455
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:57,760
That's just magic. I I have a sense for

1456
00:52:54,800 --> 00:53:03,680
it. So, this is the first time smoking

1457
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:05,760
this this uh cross. Which one is this?

1458
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:08,399
This is our drips. Oh, I like that one.

1459
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:11,359
It's the one I picked. Yeah.

1460
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:14,920
What cross is that?

1461
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:14,920
Extremely special.

1462
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:18,960
I feel like there's several

1463
00:53:16,679 --> 00:53:21,039
different uh expressions within the

1464
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:23,119
Progyny. Out of all the seeds we popped,

1465
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:26,159
there there's I wouldn't say there's

1466
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:27,920
super consistency, but there is with

1467
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:29,358
with uh there's maybe four or five

1468
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,358
different phenotypes that really stand

1469
00:53:29,358 --> 00:53:33,119
out in this one. in that. Yeah, in that

1470
00:53:31,358 --> 00:53:34,078
one. And I think that's one of them for

1471
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:35,838
sure. So, we have to do a little bit

1472
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:36,880
more selection on them. Yeah, I think

1473
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:38,000
there could be more selection. I mean,

1474
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,280
this one's really good. The one that we

1475
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,719
picked, I feel like that was the one

1476
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:42,559
that had the best nose and the best

1477
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:46,000
structure. How many seeds you had out of

1478
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:47,519
this one? We we popped uh 40 of those.

1479
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,760
So, we have 40 different five fenos in

1480
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:51,679
there. Yeah. And this is the one pheno.

1481
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:53,200
I think that's But see within that that

1482
00:53:51,679 --> 00:53:55,039
there's a couple different ones that

1483
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:57,199
like that's the nose, there's there's

1484
00:53:55,039 --> 00:53:59,358
the nose and then there's the structure

1485
00:53:57,199 --> 00:54:02,199
and then finding them. Cross those two

1486
00:53:59,358 --> 00:54:04,799
again. Exactly.

1487
00:54:02,199 --> 00:54:06,399
Exactly. The bud structure is nice.

1488
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,240
Yeah.

1489
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:10,318
It's not completely closed as far as the

1490
00:54:08,239 --> 00:54:12,639
bracks or completely open. It's It's got

1491
00:54:10,318 --> 00:54:14,239
good structure. Mhm.

1492
00:54:12,639 --> 00:54:16,318
I think the flavor is nice. That's

1493
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:18,479
garlic in it. I'm really liking the

1494
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:20,480
flush that we use on this, too. How many

1495
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,800
What do you flush? 10 days. We flush

1496
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:25,119
eight days in cocoa. So, seven or eight

1497
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,960
days. And it eight was perfect this

1498
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:28,640
time. Well, yeah. It's typical. And it's

1499
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:30,240
tough with a pheno hunt because you have

1500
00:54:28,639 --> 00:54:32,480
stuff that finishes at different times,

1501
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:34,318
right? So we have stuff that pull at day

1502
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:36,240
53 and then we have stuff by hand. No,

1503
00:54:34,318 --> 00:54:38,800
all the plants. All is Yeah, we hand

1504
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:41,679
water our entire flush. Yeah, we we hand

1505
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:43,280
water our entire growth. That's crazy. I

1506
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:45,279
know. That's a little crazy. I like

1507
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,519
irrigation except for the flush. I feel

1508
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:50,000
like we basically want to run it through

1509
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:51,759
each plant and we do we just do once a

1510
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,559
day cuz we do pulse feeding normally

1511
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:58,000
with cocoa. Uh so we multiple times a

1512
00:54:54,559 --> 00:55:00,079
day. We we feed like 16 times a day. Um

1513
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:03,519
and you feed 16 times a day. 16 times a

1514
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:05,519
day. Holy [ __ ] That's like every 50 40

1515
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:07,199
minutes or what? 50 minutes. I think

1516
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:08,639
every 50 minutes we're feeding on this

1517
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:10,000
on this one. Anyway, we we've

1518
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:11,440
experimented. So what we do is we do

1519
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,838
trials here. I mean we're a re research

1520
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:15,679
and development facility. So we'll try

1521
00:55:13,838 --> 00:55:17,440
different things to get optimal results.

1522
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:19,199
And I feel like we got pretty good

1523
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:21,119
results with this. And then with the

1524
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:22,639
flush we hand water and we make sure to

1525
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:23,760
get it flushed through. And and it's too

1526
00:55:22,639 --> 00:55:25,920
thick to run through the lines anyway.

1527
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:28,160
There's so much molasses in it that you

1528
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,838
could never get that through your drip

1529
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:32,920
system. No, not through the irrigation

1530
00:55:29,838 --> 00:55:37,639
at all. It's going to clog up then.

1531
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:40,159
Yeah. But flavor-wise, I think

1532
00:55:37,639 --> 00:55:42,318
what it's smooth. I expected a little

1533
00:55:40,159 --> 00:55:44,239
bit more of the flavor from the smell. I

1534
00:55:42,318 --> 00:55:45,838
had have to say. Yeah. I feel like

1535
00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:47,358
you're right. It could be even coming

1536
00:55:45,838 --> 00:55:50,639
down here. It's not quite as turppy as

1537
00:55:47,358 --> 00:55:53,519
the flower. No. Yeah.

1538
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:55,920
But that's why we're phen hunting. So

1539
00:55:53,519 --> 00:55:57,519
looking for those winners. Yeah. So in

1540
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,280
Thailand you guys are doing huge pheno

1541
00:55:57,519 --> 00:56:00,960
heads. How do you go through that many

1542
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:03,559
plants? Obviously you can't smoke every

1543
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:08,039
single one of them. No.

1544
00:56:03,559 --> 00:56:11,798
So um we have

1545
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:17,639
32 flowering uh flowering glass

1546
00:56:11,798 --> 00:56:22,079
houses. Everyone fits 1550 plants.

1547
00:56:17,639 --> 00:56:25,039
So, um, we try to limit it to one or two

1548
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:27,839
varieties. Yeah. So, we put out 1,500

1549
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:29,358
kind of 1500 plants. So, once 1500 seeds

1550
00:56:27,838 --> 00:56:31,960
Yeah.

1551
00:56:29,358 --> 00:56:35,798
So, that makes it already a little bit

1552
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:39,838
easier, you know. Mhm. So, from there

1553
00:56:35,798 --> 00:56:41,280
on, we pull out the 10 best, grow them

1554
00:56:39,838 --> 00:56:44,159
another time, and then also grow them

1555
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:47,760
indoor. Yeah. And then we keep five.

1556
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:51,039
Nice. Yeah. So because we saw in the

1557
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:54,240
past that sometimes in the let's say

1558
00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:57,119
third or fourth crop some hermy pops up

1559
00:56:54,239 --> 00:56:58,639
suddenly. Yeah that can happen that your

1560
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:01,200
first two crops nothing happened. Yeah

1561
00:56:58,639 --> 00:57:03,159
it's fine. And then sexual stability and

1562
00:57:01,199 --> 00:57:05,598
whatever that

1563
00:57:03,159 --> 00:57:07,199
her different time of the year maybe

1564
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:09,039
it's more hot in the room I don't know

1565
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:10,798
what but something happens and sometimes

1566
00:57:09,039 --> 00:57:13,279
that hap doesn't happen a lot but it

1567
00:57:10,798 --> 00:57:15,039
happens sometimes. Yeah. And then also

1568
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,400
for sharing clones, you know, we give

1569
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:18,719
number three or number four away,

1570
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,318
whatever. Yeah. And number one or two we

1571
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:21,759
keep in our library, you know, and then

1572
00:57:20,318 --> 00:57:24,000
number one, we make the weed for the

1573
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,760
dispensary, right? So that's kind kind

1574
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,519
of how we work. And then also with the

1575
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:29,920
number one or two or three depend on the

1576
00:57:27,519 --> 00:57:32,559
whatever we kept it for, we do the

1577
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:35,599
breeding, you know. Mhm. Or we cross

1578
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:37,680
them two or we self one as one, you

1579
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:40,798
know. It depends a lot on many things.

1580
00:57:37,679 --> 00:57:44,318
Yeah. But that's kind of how we work. We

1581
00:57:40,798 --> 00:57:49,000
would try to put a minimum of 200 seeds

1582
00:57:44,318 --> 00:57:49,000
out. Yeah. But preferable,500.

1583
00:57:49,039 --> 00:57:52,159
Yeah. For me, it's it's how well I know

1584
00:57:50,719 --> 00:57:53,598
the line. If there's stuff where I know

1585
00:57:52,159 --> 00:57:56,318
I'm looking for something specific that

1586
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:57,838
I know I can find it in 50 or 40. Sure.

1587
00:57:56,318 --> 00:57:59,279
You know, and then also I'm working in

1588
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:01,759
numbers. I'm limited with the amount of

1589
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:03,280
space that I have to. So, my model's a

1590
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,880
little bit different and I might I might

1591
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,798
pop 10 of something and not find

1592
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:08,318
anything that's worth revisiting. But

1593
00:58:06,798 --> 00:58:10,000
sometimes I'll just pop 10 to see if

1594
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:11,358
it's even worth exploring more cuz some

1595
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,280
of these crosses that we're making it's

1596
00:58:11,358 --> 00:58:15,199
like they have a lot of recessive traits

1597
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:17,359
and you're looking for the recessive

1598
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:19,759
traits and sometimes even within the

1599
00:58:17,358 --> 00:58:22,078
progeny you don't get any expression of

1600
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:23,920
really what you're looking for. So no

1601
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,440
but yeah but you understand America much

1602
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:28,159
better than me. But that's also a little

1603
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:30,159
bit the the the the bad luck you guys

1604
00:58:28,159 --> 00:58:31,598
have that you're limited to space. No.

1605
00:58:30,159 --> 00:58:33,279
And you see that with all the breeders

1606
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:35,519
and most of the grows are spreadsheet

1607
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:38,400
grows here in America. Yeah. So you have

1608
00:58:35,519 --> 00:58:40,000
to turn over whatever 60 grams of heat

1609
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:42,240
otherwise the investors get really

1610
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:45,519
angry. So you don't have any options and

1611
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:47,279
you know also in in egg technically find

1612
00:58:45,519 --> 00:58:50,159
something new like salad and corn they

1613
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,680
do 10,000 seats you know. Oh yeah. So

1614
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:53,519
but they don't have near the diversity

1615
00:58:51,679 --> 00:58:56,000
that we have in cannabis. No that's

1616
00:58:53,519 --> 00:58:57,679
true. No but that even says we should

1617
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,440
even put more. Yeah. That makes it more

1618
00:58:57,679 --> 00:59:01,519
difficult. You know what I mean? Like

1619
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:03,039
find something new. Yeah. I mean it's so

1620
00:59:01,519 --> 00:59:04,159
tough to find something new and you know

1621
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:06,318
we were going through a lot of stuff

1622
00:59:04,159 --> 00:59:07,920
where we we kept saying oh man this

1623
00:59:06,318 --> 00:59:10,079
reminds me of this or this reminds me of

1624
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:12,079
this stuff that's you know 20 years old.

1625
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:14,640
So you know we had the purple crosses

1626
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:16,720
and then even with the RS11 crosses it

1627
00:59:14,639 --> 00:59:19,039
has this interesting structure that

1628
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:21,118
reminds me of the Calio or some of these

1629
00:59:19,039 --> 00:59:22,960
old orange varieties. Yeah. But it was

1630
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:25,200
nice to see at Turbami in the weekend

1631
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:26,880
also that a lot of the hazes are back.

1632
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:27,480
You know that was the best thing ever.

1633
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:30,559
That

1634
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:32,480
was I've never seen hazes in California.

1635
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:34,960
Five guys came to me with three of them

1636
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:37,358
with Penos Silver has one with Hawaiian

1637
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,960
snow. Where do we grow this from? Yeah.

1638
00:59:37,358 --> 00:59:41,039
I don't know Hawaiian snow. I thought

1639
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:43,039
hey [ __ ] you know your thing. Yeah.

1640
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:44,239
That's that's funny to hear that. So we

1641
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:45,679
progressed in a lot of ways in

1642
00:59:44,239 --> 00:59:47,439
California and this is a lot of the guys

1643
00:59:45,679 --> 00:59:49,358
were coming from Humboldt and Menesino

1644
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:51,519
from the hills, right? So like those

1645
00:59:49,358 --> 00:59:54,759
guys are coming down with these

1646
00:59:51,519 --> 00:59:56,960
equatorial and sativa crosses hazes

1647
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:58,799
yesterdaying on the ego clash. There

1648
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:01,760
were a lot of those guys even more. Even

1649
00:59:58,798 --> 01:00:04,159
more I'm sure. The thing is that

1650
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:08,000
everything has to be six seven weeks.

1651
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:09,920
Yeah. Where really good weed is 10 11

1652
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,599
weeks. Yeah. You know those kind of

1653
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:13,680
varieties. You know there's so many

1654
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:15,200
amazing I agree. There's so many amazing

1655
01:00:13,679 --> 01:00:17,519
stuff. Dave from Budelera that had the

1656
01:00:15,199 --> 01:00:19,519
the pearls that was at Turban. He's on

1657
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:21,759
the podcast recently, but he only does

1658
01:00:19,519 --> 01:00:23,199
longer flowering varieties. And he's

1659
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:25,040
breeding for effect, right? At the end

1660
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:26,318
of the day, more so than anything, he's

1661
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:28,480
breeding for the effect. And the effect

1662
01:00:26,318 --> 01:00:30,719
of those is so different than the stuff

1663
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:32,079
that, you know, 7 weeks. Mhm. Yeah. The

1664
01:00:30,719 --> 01:00:34,879
stuff that's Yeah. We saw the Dr.

1665
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:36,880
Greenspoon like uh strain. Oh, yeah. It

1666
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:38,880
was a pheno different pheno of that. I

1667
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:40,559
think that that is even longer, right?

1668
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:42,400
You know, he's like one of the few guys

1669
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:44,359
that that wants to grow that. Actually,

1670
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:46,559
not a lot of people have very

1671
01:00:44,358 --> 01:00:48,480
attractive. It's spreadsheets. Yeah,

1672
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:50,079
it's people are under scrutiny of Wall

1673
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:52,960
Street guys. They have this big

1674
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:57,760
facility. There's 17 owners and they

1675
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:59,440
demand 6, seven, 70 g in 7 weeks, right?

1676
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:02,559
Six crops, whatever. You know, this is

1677
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:03,838
this is the main problem which kills the

1678
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:05,680
industry. You know, I think anyway

1679
01:01:03,838 --> 01:01:08,318
listed companies kill the industry,

1680
01:01:05,679 --> 01:01:09,759
right? You know, I'm I I I I don't see

1681
01:01:08,318 --> 01:01:12,960
any really good things coming out of

1682
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:15,119
there. If you look at Canada 2008 into

1683
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:17,199
20 2024 and as you know we were partners

1684
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:20,960
with Canopy you know how many money got

1685
01:01:17,199 --> 01:01:22,960
blown up a lot

1686
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:24,720
six years Canada how many money went

1687
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:26,838
into stock market how many hundreds of

1688
01:01:24,719 --> 01:01:29,919
millions big money

1689
01:01:26,838 --> 01:01:33,279
770 billion Canadian dollars wow which

1690
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:36,798
let's say 500 US 500 billion roughly 500

1691
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:40,079
500 billion just evaporated

1692
01:01:36,798 --> 01:01:42,798
and people losing two 300 million per

1693
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:43,839
quarter. Yeah. How in the hell is this

1694
01:01:42,798 --> 01:01:45,039
possible, guys? Well, they were just

1695
01:01:43,838 --> 01:01:46,558
talking about Jay-Z and his brand, how

1696
01:01:45,039 --> 01:01:49,199
it lost a whole bunch of He was in our

1697
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:51,280
shop last year and told him say, "This

1698
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:54,399
is not the way to do things, bro." Yeah.

1699
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:56,160
Get a guy like me.

1700
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:58,160
Yeah. There's no passion for cannabis

1701
01:01:56,159 --> 01:02:00,000
though in the No, they're not into

1702
01:01:58,159 --> 01:02:02,480
craft. They don't understand the craft

1703
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,798
model. And so, you know, I we both have

1704
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:06,559
experience in as far as you had

1705
01:02:04,798 --> 01:02:09,358
Heineken. I have Logan. I used to work

1706
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:11,359
with Logan. And they created a craft

1707
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:13,598
product from the beginning with the

1708
01:02:11,358 --> 01:02:15,039
intention to scale and to the scale to

1709
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:16,720
the point where they sold it to Heineken

1710
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:19,279
for a billion dollars. Half a billion

1711
01:02:16,719 --> 01:02:21,279
originally and then 880 million. Yeah.

1712
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:23,760
880 million. We were involved a little

1713
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:25,599
bit. Our friend did the deal. Y and then

1714
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:27,440
it came in the newspapers in Holland and

1715
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:30,000
then Heinek and CO said, "Oh, we didn't

1716
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:31,519
know it was CBD brand." Oh, really? You

1717
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,199
pay $1 billion, you don't know your

1718
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:34,960
[ __ ] bro. You should [ __ ] resign

1719
01:02:33,199 --> 01:02:37,199
immediately then. No. Totally. Yeah.

1720
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:39,519
They they know the high five, man. That

1721
01:02:37,199 --> 01:02:41,679
was such a joke, bro. That was crazy.

1722
01:02:39,519 --> 01:02:43,280
Oh, by by the way, I think Lanita is a

1723
01:02:41,679 --> 01:02:45,598
great brand. I really like that beer.

1724
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:47,680
It's one of my favorite IPAs to drink.

1725
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:49,920
Great people. They did a [ __ ] great

1726
01:02:47,679 --> 01:02:51,679
job. And then Heineken, it was just a

1727
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:53,440
bunch of idiots because And that is the

1728
01:02:51,679 --> 01:02:55,199
corporate thing that is against us, you

1729
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,559
know, because let me You want to hear a

1730
01:02:55,199 --> 01:02:59,919
really funny thing? I'm not going to say

1731
01:02:56,559 --> 01:03:02,880
it was Heineken. Yeah. Yeah. So, let's

1732
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:04,159
say it was a very big Dutch beer brewer,

1733
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:09,440
one of the biggest. There's a few of

1734
01:03:04,159 --> 01:03:10,639
them. And um suddenly in 989 one of the

1735
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:12,720
reasons we had to start the cannabis

1736
01:03:10,639 --> 01:03:14,798
retailers association. Yeah. In

1737
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:17,038
parliament questions were asked about

1738
01:03:14,798 --> 01:03:19,599
the mix of alcohol and cannabis in our

1739
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:22,400
shops. You remember we had so we had

1740
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:26,240
five dispensaries in Amsterdam. Yeah.

1741
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:28,480
With alcohol 20%. It was only 14

1742
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:30,558
Amsterdam. So we had 20% of the license

1743
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:32,240
in the country. And suddenly in

1744
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:36,000
parliament Christian parties were

1745
01:03:32,239 --> 01:03:40,399
popping up. Uh yeah, we want to discuss

1746
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:44,159
this. Poly drugs use. What the [ __ ]

1747
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:46,240
Poly drugs use. So multiple drugs. Yeah.

1748
01:03:44,159 --> 01:03:48,159
Cannabis and alcohol. Yeah. This is a

1749
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:50,558
really bad thing. We call it

1750
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:53,118
crossfading. But yeah, that's make a

1751
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:55,680
long story short, this started in 2000

1752
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:57,440
and we lost everything in 2007. Yeah. It

1753
01:03:55,679 --> 01:03:59,118
turned out really great for us. I'm not

1754
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:00,400
going to go into details. Sure. Cuz we

1755
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:02,318
were making much more money when the

1756
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:04,000
alcohol was out. So with no we were

1757
01:04:02,318 --> 01:04:06,239
panicking and then it was much better in

1758
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:11,119
the end of the day for us. Yeah. And

1759
01:04:06,239 --> 01:04:13,118
later in 2016 or 17 I was on a party.

1760
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:15,599
Yeah. And one of the main guys from this

1761
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:18,240
brewery came to me and he said, "Aran,

1762
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:21,240
we figured out that in a dispensary

1763
01:04:18,239 --> 01:04:24,479
there's 70% less consuming of

1764
01:04:21,239 --> 01:04:27,199
alcohol. So the only way to drink

1765
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:28,480
healthy way alcohol is to also smoke."

1766
01:04:27,199 --> 01:04:29,838
Because if you're with your friends, you

1767
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:31,440
drink eight or 10 beers and you have a

1768
01:04:29,838 --> 01:04:33,119
great night. Yeah. If you smoke one

1769
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:35,519
joint, you're only going to drink three.

1770
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:37,920
Correct. So, it is the best combination

1771
01:04:35,519 --> 01:04:40,798
in the world. It's the opposite what the

1772
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:43,680
Christian parties made us do in Holland.

1773
01:04:40,798 --> 01:04:45,679
Ben, a really good idea. It's for me,

1774
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:47,118
it's only good if I smoke before I

1775
01:04:45,679 --> 01:04:48,399
drink. If I'm really if I've been

1776
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:50,079
drinking and then you smoke, it's all

1777
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:53,440
bad. But as long as you do it first,

1778
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:56,318
it's the best way to do both. Didn't did

1779
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:59,280
the alcohol use go less than than uh the

1780
01:04:56,318 --> 01:05:02,000
marijuana use increased and o over

1781
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:04,400
alcohol use I think in in America

1782
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,719
definitely definitely in America so far

1783
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:09,680
well I remember already when I was with

1784
01:05:06,719 --> 01:05:12,399
a party six seven years ago that I

1785
01:05:09,679 --> 01:05:13,919
walked into parties there was no alcohol

1786
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:15,760
there was one guy drinking a bottle of

1787
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:18,079
red wine and everybody was smoking and

1788
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:20,720
there was a Nobel Prize winner there's a

1789
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:23,119
professor from university you know the

1790
01:05:20,719 --> 01:05:25,038
diff it's changing but It's funny now

1791
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:26,400
that the political party who is a

1792
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:28,640
Christian party, so they have another

1793
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:31,440
agenda. Yeah. And raising this in

1794
01:05:28,639 --> 01:05:33,519
parliament, making it happen that we

1795
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:36,079
lose all our license. And then the end

1796
01:05:33,519 --> 01:05:37,920
of the day, it's a really bad decision

1797
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:40,240
they made because it's much healthier to

1798
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:42,519
drink and smoke at the same time. Right.

1799
01:05:40,239 --> 01:05:44,879
Which one is this?

1800
01:05:42,519 --> 01:05:47,440
Or double le This is our double lemon

1801
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:48,760
cherry. This is the breeder. This is the

1802
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:51,599
the one that

1803
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:54,000
uh I really like. It's It's like a lemon

1804
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:56,160
cherry gelato. It's a runt S1. Yeah. But

1805
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,239
it yields It's a really good yielder and

1806
01:05:56,159 --> 01:06:00,078
it has really high turpps. And so that

1807
01:05:58,239 --> 01:06:02,558
combination that has the structure, it's

1808
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:04,240
it's rare. Yeah. And it definitely

1809
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:06,480
passes on the structure with the turpps

1810
01:06:04,239 --> 01:06:09,439
to a lot of Yeah. the things we breed it

1811
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:10,639
to. And and uh if I can ask you, what

1812
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:13,039
what are you looking for? You're looking

1813
01:06:10,639 --> 01:06:15,358
for more for more turpps or higher THC?

1814
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:16,880
What do you look for also commercially?

1815
01:06:15,358 --> 01:06:18,960
We look for stuff I mean I think

1816
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:21,000
commercial viability is super important

1817
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:23,280
these days. Yeah. But at the end of the

1818
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:25,119
day, I went back to the drawing board

1819
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:27,599
after 420 when my friend died. He used

1820
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:29,200
to only breed for a fact. He still is

1821
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:31,680
totally right. If you're a craft brand

1822
01:06:29,199 --> 01:06:33,838
like and we are and you are, of course,

1823
01:06:31,679 --> 01:06:37,598
everything is high THC. People want 28

1824
01:06:33,838 --> 01:06:41,199
32. Yeah. But your 33 here in America is

1825
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:45,838
not a real 33. I think maximum 25 is our

1826
01:06:41,199 --> 01:06:48,558
25. And our 23 sativas get you more high

1827
01:06:45,838 --> 01:06:51,119
than the 32 American couch lock one.

1828
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:53,359
Right. you know because of the flavvenos

1829
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:55,920
of the turpin profile there's there's a

1830
01:06:53,358 --> 01:06:59,679
reason to explain that but the sativas

1831
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:02,639
that are early 20s are by far stone is

1832
01:06:59,679 --> 01:07:04,879
higher than than the 30s in America

1833
01:07:02,639 --> 01:07:06,920
effect is much stronger yeah longer

1834
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:10,240
longer also

1835
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:13,280
like hit you really hard and then you

1836
01:07:10,239 --> 01:07:14,879
come down and I I also find it much more

1837
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:16,880
pleasant

1838
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:18,480
you know it's it's less paranoia on the

1839
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:19,838
end you know well and I think but a lot

1840
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:22,480
of people in the states because they

1841
01:07:19,838 --> 01:07:24,719
haven't experienced sativas or really

1842
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:26,159
good hazes. They think of the sativas as

1843
01:07:24,719 --> 01:07:27,919
the ones that make your heart beat out

1844
01:07:26,159 --> 01:07:30,239
of your chest that give you paranoia

1845
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:32,240
that that's that's fentinyl. No. Yeah.

1846
01:07:30,239 --> 01:07:34,798
Well, no. I mean, but some of the hazes

1847
01:07:32,239 --> 01:07:36,798
you get some of the strong super strong

1848
01:07:34,798 --> 01:07:38,880
hazes. They will do that, but they're

1849
01:07:36,798 --> 01:07:40,559
not really strong. No, but you also have

1850
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:41,838
that with strong indicas. Yeah. Yeah,

1851
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:43,599
you do. Well, with strong ended because

1852
01:07:41,838 --> 01:07:45,759
they have this narcotic effect where you

1853
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:47,440
just feel super tired or and you see

1854
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:49,119
more people getting more slightly to the

1855
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,798
paranoia side if you smoke too much of

1856
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:52,400
that, you know? Right. You heard that

1857
01:07:50,798 --> 01:07:53,679
much more than with the sativas. Well,

1858
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,039
then there's the feel-good weed, which

1859
01:07:53,679 --> 01:07:56,558
is what I like that no matter how much

1860
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:58,400
you smoke it, you just feel really good.

1861
01:07:56,559 --> 01:07:59,839
And I think we So, so the guy that

1862
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:01,519
passed away, his name was Dave Mesford.

1863
01:07:59,838 --> 01:08:02,639
He we did a podcast the week before he

1864
01:08:01,519 --> 01:08:04,239
passed and he was one of my good

1865
01:08:02,639 --> 01:08:05,920
friends, photographer. He gifted me a

1866
01:08:04,239 --> 01:08:07,519
seed collection, but he really was

1867
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:09,920
breeding for effect, right, at the end

1868
01:08:07,519 --> 01:08:11,519
of the day. also flavor, but his

1869
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:13,039
priority was how does it make you feel?

1870
01:08:11,519 --> 01:08:15,280
And he was, you know, he worked with

1871
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:16,960
some Nigerian hazes,

1872
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:19,199
some really wild stuff, you know, that

1873
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:21,198
were pheno hunting that So, what was his

1874
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:23,198
percentage of THC according to him?

1875
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:27,838
What's the range that Oh, he was more

1876
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:30,960
into the mild THC like 15 to 22. I would

1877
01:08:27,838 --> 01:08:32,640
say 15 to Yeah. 20 maybe even 15 to 20

1878
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:34,239
to 20. Yeah, that range. But like that,

1879
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:38,159
I think that's the best range for a

1880
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:41,358
perfect workout and and a a turpin

1881
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:43,198
profile, right? Cuz the higher you get,

1882
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:45,520
the more tur the turbs get more

1883
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:47,599
complicated to have this really nice uh

1884
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:48,960
uh Yeah. And flavor, you know, flavor.

1885
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:51,838
Yeah. Yeah. There's a trade-off. The

1886
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:53,198
flavor gets not better, you know. Mhm. I

1887
01:08:51,838 --> 01:08:54,238
don't know how to explain that. Well, I

1888
01:08:53,198 --> 01:08:55,678
think there's a trade-off. So, the

1889
01:08:54,238 --> 01:08:58,718
higher the canabonoids get, there's only

1890
01:08:55,679 --> 01:09:00,480
so much room on the plant for for

1891
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:01,679
chemical compounds, right? So when

1892
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:03,278
you're looking at it like that then the

1893
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:04,719
turppines a lot of times are less. It's

1894
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:06,719
very rare that you have something that

1895
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:08,880
tests in the 30s like truly tests in the

1896
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:11,679
30s that has super high turppins. Yeah.

1897
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:14,560
So so so tell me now this perception

1898
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:17,039
here like

1899
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:18,560
if we we both chefs yeah in the past and

1900
01:09:17,039 --> 01:09:21,920
we love to cook together. We did that

1901
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:24,239
many times. How is it possible that

1902
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:26,239
everybody is smoking this hydro weed

1903
01:09:24,238 --> 01:09:28,718
even the cocoa weed which we're smoking

1904
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:31,119
now? Cuz I only grow organic. I try to

1905
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:34,079
grow on soil. Yeah. Mostly on soil.

1906
01:09:31,119 --> 01:09:35,679
Yeah. If we go to a restaurant and we

1907
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:37,519
would get organic food, we would never

1908
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:39,279
come back. You and me, right? The

1909
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:41,120
tomatoes taste like water. The cucumber

1910
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:43,359
doesn't taste nice. The salad is not

1911
01:09:41,119 --> 01:09:45,838
good. Here in North California, you have

1912
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:48,400
great food. It's all organic. Yeah. And

1913
01:09:45,838 --> 01:09:50,158
then you go to dispensary and all those

1914
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:54,399
big guys, they're all growing rockolar

1915
01:09:50,158 --> 01:09:55,759
and cocoa. Why Why is everybody smoking

1916
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:57,119
that? Because it's ridiculous. Well,

1917
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:58,640
it's because of the way it looks. So

1918
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:00,079
people have gone away for the bag

1919
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:03,199
appeal, right? They don't give a [ __ ]

1920
01:10:00,079 --> 01:10:04,559
They're about the taste. Well, I think

1921
01:10:03,198 --> 01:10:07,359
it's it's something that we have to

1922
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:09,280
reintroduce to the people unfortunately

1923
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:10,319
that there's a lot of new smokers and so

1924
01:10:09,279 --> 01:10:13,920
they don't know the difference. So

1925
01:10:10,319 --> 01:10:16,399
they're they're educated on cannabis by

1926
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:18,000
Instagram and social media and the hype.

1927
01:10:16,399 --> 01:10:19,679
And so that it's so important that your

1928
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,520
stuff looks good on Instagram, right?

1929
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:23,119
And that's what I love about the

1930
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:24,320
pre-rolls and the hand rolls like what

1931
01:10:23,119 --> 01:10:25,679
we have right here, you know, because

1932
01:10:24,319 --> 01:10:28,319
then you don't have to look at it. you

1933
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:30,000
smoke it if you can. I would love to be

1934
01:10:28,319 --> 01:10:31,119
able to have a product where people

1935
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,399
didn't care what it looked like. I could

1936
01:10:31,119 --> 01:10:33,439
give them that and they trusted my brand

1937
01:10:32,399 --> 01:10:34,639
so much that they bought it and they

1938
01:10:33,439 --> 01:10:36,000
were like, "That's amazing. I don't even

1939
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:37,280
care what the flower looks like." Yeah.

1940
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,198
Cuz at the end of the day, it's all

1941
01:10:37,279 --> 01:10:41,599
about effect and flavor. Like those two

1942
01:10:39,198 --> 01:10:44,238
things are so important. But social

1943
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:46,159
media has gone in this direction where I

1944
01:10:44,238 --> 01:10:48,079
think there's a there's a good side to

1945
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:49,920
social media, a bad side. But definitely

1946
01:10:48,079 --> 01:10:51,920
with the cannabis, it's like about how

1947
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:53,279
it looks, right? So it has to look a

1948
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:55,039
certain way. But then there's things

1949
01:10:53,279 --> 01:10:56,559
like Oreos that have no turpps.

1950
01:10:55,039 --> 01:10:58,158
whatsoever. They look amazing and it's

1951
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:59,360
nothing I would ever want to smoke and

1952
01:10:58,158 --> 01:11:02,079
there's a lot of stuff like that. But

1953
01:10:59,359 --> 01:11:04,639
back to your point about the hydro, I

1954
01:11:02,079 --> 01:11:06,719
feel like if you're going in rockwool,

1955
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:07,920
you can grow okay stuff. There's the

1956
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:09,920
guys that are doing it the best, they

1957
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:12,800
grow okay. That's exactly what you say,

1958
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:14,800
okay stuff, but it's not special. Yeah.

1959
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:16,640
Well, sometimes the genetics, they work

1960
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:18,400
okay for that. They work good for that,

1961
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:20,320
right? But I would say cocoa is the

1962
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:22,399
happy medium because you get the yield

1963
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:24,960
and the consistency. Okay. Now, okay,

1964
01:11:22,399 --> 01:11:29,279
let's say we agree on that. Mhm. Next

1965
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:31,520
next issue. Yeah. Is it healthy?

1966
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:34,719
I don't know. I feel like smoking soil

1967
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:36,360
is better on my lungs, but that's just

1968
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:38,319
But

1969
01:11:36,359 --> 01:11:40,960
this is better in your lungs. It's a

1970
01:11:38,319 --> 01:11:42,799
non-chemical if you use organics. Even

1971
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:44,719
if you put a mineral through soil, you

1972
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:47,520
know, then you get away with. But the

1973
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:50,000
real liquid chemicals that American

1974
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:53,360
fertilizer companies throw on the

1975
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:55,039
[ __ ] hydro. Yeah. and we are all oh

1976
01:11:53,359 --> 01:11:56,399
we're all so green we're all marijuana

1977
01:11:55,039 --> 01:11:58,960
we're all cannabis we're all smoking

1978
01:11:56,399 --> 01:12:01,198
this what's going on I don't think it's

1979
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:02,960
a good thing but we won't know for you

1980
01:12:01,198 --> 01:12:04,879
can argue about yeah okay this and that

1981
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:08,480
but this is again spreadsheets guys this

1982
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:11,600
is the same people yeah that made

1983
01:12:08,479 --> 01:12:14,399
America and Europe obese yeah and

1984
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:16,159
killing us with the wrong nutrients

1985
01:12:14,399 --> 01:12:18,158
well but and all those kids are going

1986
01:12:16,158 --> 01:12:20,238
with the baggie oh this is great bag

1987
01:12:18,158 --> 01:12:23,198
appeal is fantastic yeah the bag appeal

1988
01:12:20,238 --> 01:12:25,119
and hydro is fantastic Yeah, bet. But

1989
01:12:23,198 --> 01:12:26,639
now they're smoking a chemical turping

1990
01:12:25,119 --> 01:12:28,158
their weed, too. You've seen that they

1991
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:30,320
had the turpp pouches next to us. That

1992
01:12:28,158 --> 01:12:32,158
was real. Those were real cannabis

1993
01:12:30,319 --> 01:12:35,198
turpps. But there are the fake turpps

1994
01:12:32,158 --> 01:12:36,799
where they have uh nonannabis turpps and

1995
01:12:35,198 --> 01:12:38,319
they're adding that. What are you doing,

1996
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:40,719
bro? But that's just like McDonald's,

1997
01:12:38,319 --> 01:12:41,920
right? So, but that's nothing I enjoy. I

1998
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:44,560
think unfortunately there's something

1999
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:46,158
for everybody. No, but it's like testing

2000
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:49,679
in America. You know, you're selling a

2001
01:12:46,158 --> 01:12:51,039
product is 35% but they're spraying THCA

2002
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:52,719
on it and that's it. And then they send

2003
01:12:51,039 --> 01:12:54,560
it to the testing facility. You remember

2004
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:56,000
in the beginning you guys had here with

2005
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:58,280
it was a bit of a hype but you had the

2006
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,719
PGR nugs, you know

2007
01:12:58,279 --> 01:13:03,439
very Yeah. Yeah. And then at some point

2008
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:05,359
everybody does they're away from PGR.

2009
01:13:03,439 --> 01:13:07,198
But still it's illegal. It's illegal in

2010
01:13:05,359 --> 01:13:09,039
California. PGRs are now Yeah. But it

2011
01:13:07,198 --> 01:13:10,799
doesn't mean they don't use it, right?

2012
01:13:09,039 --> 01:13:13,439
Yeah. Cuz you still have it. It's still

2013
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:15,920
around. But and uh but but but people

2014
01:13:13,439 --> 01:13:17,678
still want those really tight nugs, you

2015
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:20,719
know, even after they know it's illegal

2016
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:22,319
and it's bad for you. Well, I think PGRs

2017
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:24,399
help people get bigger yields and that's

2018
01:13:22,319 --> 01:13:26,319
why they want them. But it's nothing.

2019
01:13:24,399 --> 01:13:27,279
It's not only PGRs that are a problem. I

2020
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:29,599
don't know what else is in those

2021
01:13:27,279 --> 01:13:32,238
nutrients. But look, um, this coughing

2022
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:34,239
disease. Yeah. You heard about it? This

2023
01:13:32,238 --> 01:13:35,919
this really bad coughing and puking.

2024
01:13:34,238 --> 01:13:37,359
It's puking what everybody has. I don't

2025
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:39,119
know the name. What's the name of it?

2026
01:13:37,359 --> 01:13:40,319
Uh, I can't think of it right off the

2027
01:13:39,119 --> 01:13:41,920
top of my head, but it's the one with

2028
01:13:40,319 --> 01:13:43,198
the cannabis that basically makes you

2029
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:45,520
sick and you make makes you want to

2030
01:13:43,198 --> 01:13:48,479
throw and really sick. Yeah. Yeah. So,

2031
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:51,120
and my son-in-law Mhm. and my son have

2032
01:13:48,479 --> 01:13:52,879
it by huge coincidence. So we did

2033
01:13:51,119 --> 01:13:54,800
extensive test the last three years. So

2034
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:57,359
my son-in-law have it a long time. He's

2035
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:59,520
rushed into hospital a few times. Yeah.

2036
01:13:57,359 --> 01:14:02,000
And there we find the medicine that

2037
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:05,920
stops the puking in half an hour. Yeah.

2038
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:07,600
But the puke doesn't stop. You still

2039
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:09,840
have the dry heaves or whatever. And you

2040
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:11,520
hear you hear this really funny puke

2041
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:13,840
where you know when people have nothing

2042
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:16,400
in in them anymore, this high tone puke,

2043
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:17,840
right? And we had to save him last year

2044
01:14:16,399 --> 01:14:19,198
in Rolling Loud in the middle of night.

2045
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:20,560
Had to rush him to the hospital because

2046
01:14:19,198 --> 01:14:22,399
we didn't have the medicine with us and

2047
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:24,239
we were smoking it all day. He got the

2048
01:14:22,399 --> 01:14:27,158
attack.

2049
01:14:24,238 --> 01:14:29,599
And he already figured out when he

2050
01:14:27,158 --> 01:14:31,839
smokes Dutch grown weed, he doesn't have

2051
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:35,920
it. And when he smokes Kali weed with

2052
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:38,079
hydro, he gets it. Huh. My son now

2053
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:40,119
exactly the same. Interesting. So I

2054
01:14:38,079 --> 01:14:43,439
catch him one night puking. Yeah. He's

2055
01:14:40,119 --> 01:14:45,439
18. And I heard a sound and I say, "Hey,

2056
01:14:43,439 --> 01:14:46,960
you have the same as ego, man." So, we

2057
01:14:45,439 --> 01:14:50,559
went to the hospital, got the medicine,

2058
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:52,480
gone. Yeah. And he was smoking kiwi.

2059
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:55,440
Interesting. So, I don't know what's

2060
01:14:52,479 --> 01:14:58,959
going on there, but there is there is a

2061
01:14:55,439 --> 01:15:00,719
there is I So, we have the cure for this

2062
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:03,039
because I saw some people talking in the

2063
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:06,399
press. It's quite new this this this

2064
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:10,079
puking disease. Mhm. And uh I know the

2065
01:15:06,399 --> 01:15:12,238
cure and I think I also think it has

2066
01:15:10,079 --> 01:15:14,479
it's related to kaliweed. You think to

2067
01:15:12,238 --> 01:15:16,238
the salts there must be something in the

2068
01:15:14,479 --> 01:15:18,238
nutrients. But you you have a nutrient

2069
01:15:16,238 --> 01:15:20,879
company too with your powder feeding. In

2070
01:15:18,238 --> 01:15:22,079
fact you are the innovator of powder

2071
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:23,840
feeding to a degree. I'm sure they had

2072
01:15:22,079 --> 01:15:25,840
it in big a before you guys had it. But

2073
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:27,520
you really kind of reintroduced it to

2074
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:29,520
the cannabis market and now a lot of

2075
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:31,520
companies have followed suit. Well, I we

2076
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:34,880
started it 10 years ago and it's not our

2077
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:36,320
core business, but uh I felt that all

2078
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:38,319
the nutrients we're doing these big

2079
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:41,359
liquid stuff. Yeah. Was going in the

2080
01:15:38,319 --> 01:15:43,759
wrong direction and I knew it was

2081
01:15:41,359 --> 01:15:45,439
possible, you know, but I was good

2082
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:47,520
friends with Lario always general

2083
01:15:45,439 --> 01:15:49,439
hydroponic arian not possible. We tried

2084
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:51,840
everything. Can't have a one component,

2085
01:15:49,439 --> 01:15:53,599
you know. Yeah. Okay. So, we kept

2086
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:55,840
working and working and working until we

2087
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:57,920
figured it out. No. So, I think the

2088
01:15:55,840 --> 01:16:00,800
organic one we have is the best one in

2089
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:03,399
the world with the soil and and then we

2090
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:06,320
have, of course, also the mineral line,

2091
01:16:03,399 --> 01:16:08,879
but we made it for a very reasonable

2092
01:16:06,319 --> 01:16:10,238
price. Yeah. And very easy access.

2093
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,520
People love it, you know, because you

2094
01:16:10,238 --> 01:16:12,959
mix it through the soil and you walk

2095
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:15,280
away. Well, you have a buffer in there

2096
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:16,800
and everything. Yeah, of course. So of

2097
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:19,039
and with of course with the salts with

2098
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:20,960
the minerals you add uh if the water is

2099
01:16:19,039 --> 01:16:22,560
not good you add some calcium you know

2100
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:24,319
and with a booster and stuff like that

2101
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:27,360
but it's still one component you know

2102
01:16:24,319 --> 01:16:30,238
and it's very easy to to use but it's a

2103
01:16:27,359 --> 01:16:32,719
very fair product you know everybody who

2104
01:16:30,238 --> 01:16:34,879
starts it doesn't go away from it

2105
01:16:32,719 --> 01:16:36,480
anymore well and low carbon footprint I

2106
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:38,480
think that's the big takeaway for a lot

2107
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:40,479
of places like the Caribbean I think

2108
01:16:38,479 --> 01:16:42,479
it's super important to not transport

2109
01:16:40,479 --> 01:16:45,439
extra water to a place like the

2110
01:16:42,479 --> 01:16:46,879
Caribbean look You remember Jamie Oliver

2111
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:48,960
going to the schools in England showing

2112
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:50,880
the kids? You remember that thing? You

2113
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:52,640
remember with the kid with McNuggets how

2114
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:54,319
he did that? So I took the whole bloody

2115
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:56,000
chicken, put it in a [ __ ] blender and

2116
01:16:54,319 --> 01:16:57,519
all that [ __ ] and kids were freaking

2117
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,920
out. Yeah. So that's what you're eating.

2118
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:03,280
They all stopped. Yeah. I think if you

2119
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:05,679
can like go to a big grow and show them

2120
01:17:03,279 --> 01:17:07,920
like real soil and the grandmother is

2121
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:09,600
there how she make a real pasta with a

2122
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:11,679
good brand with real tomatoes from

2123
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:15,120
outside, you know, tastes so much

2124
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:17,039
better. Mhm. Or you show them the indoor

2125
01:17:15,119 --> 01:17:19,039
with the hydro with all these chemicals

2126
01:17:17,039 --> 01:17:21,439
and that goes through your lungs. This

2127
01:17:19,039 --> 01:17:23,679
is the reality. Totally. You know, and

2128
01:17:21,439 --> 01:17:26,158
for me, I want to smoke this really nice

2129
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:27,760
indoor. And if you look now, I wish I

2130
01:17:26,158 --> 01:17:29,839
could do a large scale living soil

2131
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:31,520
because I see all my little friends.

2132
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:33,679
Yeah. With their closet grows doing the

2133
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:35,760
living farmers out there for [ __ ]

2134
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:37,359
tastes amazing. Yeah. You know, all the

2135
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:39,520
stuff we've had in the last 3 days, you

2136
01:17:37,359 --> 01:17:41,279
know, four days. All living soil, bro.

2137
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:43,120
[ __ ] worms and everything. It tastes

2138
01:17:41,279 --> 01:17:44,719
amazing. That's what you want to eat and

2139
01:17:43,119 --> 01:17:47,359
that's what you want to smoke. I would

2140
01:17:44,719 --> 01:17:49,600
already be scared to smoke every day all

2141
01:17:47,359 --> 01:17:51,439
this hydro, you know, cuz I would think

2142
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:53,600
I'm going to get sick at one day. Right.

2143
01:17:51,439 --> 01:17:57,119
Well, so my next question for you would

2144
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:58,960
be from hydro to indoor grows. Where do

2145
01:17:57,119 --> 01:18:00,479
you see the future of cultivation?

2146
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:02,158
Because I know you believe in the

2147
01:18:00,479 --> 01:18:04,238
greenhouse model being Dutch and also

2148
01:18:02,158 --> 01:18:06,000
doing your thing in in Thailand. Do you

2149
01:18:04,238 --> 01:18:07,279
see the hybrid model as being the future

2150
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,600
for the industry especially in the

2151
01:18:07,279 --> 01:18:11,119
United States? Well, it depends a lot in

2152
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:12,239
what country we are for the climate.

2153
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:13,679
Sure. Because you know if you're going

2154
01:18:12,238 --> 01:18:15,119
to need if you're in North Canada and

2155
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:16,319
you have to heat up that glass house,

2156
01:18:15,119 --> 01:18:18,158
you're going to lose a lot of

2157
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:19,840
electricity costs. Yeah. It also depends

2158
01:18:18,158 --> 01:18:22,319
on your electricity bill which country

2159
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:24,719
are like in North Europe it's 25 cents

2160
01:18:22,319 --> 01:18:27,679
and in Argentina it's 5 cents. Yeah. So

2161
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:29,359
already that you know is is what are you

2162
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:31,119
going to do? I think for both is

2163
01:18:29,359 --> 01:18:34,079
something well for all say something to

2164
01:18:31,119 --> 01:18:36,000
say. I think outdoor wheat is great for

2165
01:18:34,079 --> 01:18:37,679
attraction. If you can do that why

2166
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,439
should you not grow outdoor? Mhm.

2167
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:42,000
Nobody's going to see the flower and you

2168
01:18:39,439 --> 01:18:43,519
have a great turpin profile. Yeah.

2169
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,719
Especially here in North Kell where you

2170
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:46,159
probably have the best climate in the

2171
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:48,079
world, you know, like where I'm in North

2172
01:18:46,158 --> 01:18:50,000
Thailand. But then you have the glass

2173
01:18:48,079 --> 01:18:51,679
house which could be hybrid. Like my

2174
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,760
glass houses have no light because I'm

2175
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:55,039
on the equator. Yeah. So I don't even I

2176
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:59,199
don't need light depth. You don't have

2177
01:18:55,039 --> 01:19:02,319
any assistance. I only have uh three big

2178
01:18:59,198 --> 01:19:04,000
exhaust fans blowing in and three big X

2179
01:19:02,319 --> 01:19:05,840
fan blowing out and one in the middle to

2180
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,600
help out, you know. Yeah. And I have

2181
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:09,920
great sun when you don't need to

2182
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:13,120
dehumidify or humidify. No, because

2183
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:15,440
between October and March, I'll be under

2184
01:19:13,119 --> 01:19:17,119
50. Yeah. So, I'm fine, you know. And

2185
01:19:15,439 --> 01:19:18,960
then you have, of course, the indoor.

2186
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:22,960
Sure. You know, you could be in very

2187
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:25,359
complicated areas like in north Canada.

2188
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:27,198
Yeah. Or in Patagonia in the south of

2189
01:19:25,359 --> 01:19:29,359
the planet or wherever and you need a

2190
01:19:27,198 --> 01:19:31,119
lot of electricity, but there's no other

2191
01:19:29,359 --> 01:19:33,439
way, you know, right? In some areas you

2192
01:19:31,119 --> 01:19:37,519
can't grow. So and then you of course

2193
01:19:33,439 --> 01:19:41,439
you have the GMP story right like where

2194
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:44,080
it gets technically difficult is glass

2195
01:19:41,439 --> 01:19:45,519
house of course is less stable than

2196
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:48,719
indoor

2197
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:50,159
so for us is to finetune that we are the

2198
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:53,279
first in the world to go through that

2199
01:19:50,158 --> 01:19:55,519
process you know can we do that you know

2200
01:19:53,279 --> 01:19:57,039
because every crop you can imagine is a

2201
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:59,760
little bit different for sure because

2202
01:19:57,039 --> 01:20:01,920
sometimes we have 7 weeks of sun but

2203
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:03,640
sometimes we have five and a when the

2204
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:06,560
light intensity changes throughout the

2205
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:08,320
year clouds and this means your profile

2206
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:11,760
changes a little bit. Now we have a

2207
01:20:08,319 --> 01:20:13,759
leverage of 20% in a GMP. Wow. So you

2208
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:15,760
know if it's 20 it can be 18 but you

2209
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:17,600
can't go to 17 because then the batch is

2210
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:19,920
disregarded you know. Yeah. And then

2211
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:22,239
also time of the year you have like in

2212
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:24,079
Thailand you have a few seasons right?

2213
01:20:22,238 --> 01:20:25,519
Like in Europe we have four seasons you

2214
01:20:24,079 --> 01:20:28,079
have four seasons here too I assume.

2215
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:29,600
Autumn. So if you have four seasons in a

2216
01:20:28,079 --> 01:20:31,600
glass house and you have supplemental

2217
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:32,880
light. Yeah. But the third profile will

2218
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:35,039
be different because of the sunlight,

2219
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:37,359
you know. Sure. So, how far can you play

2220
01:20:35,039 --> 01:20:39,359
with that? And how far Oh, with spectrum

2221
01:20:37,359 --> 01:20:40,960
tuning now, I mean, I think there's new

2222
01:20:39,359 --> 01:20:41,920
possibilities, but yeah, it's still

2223
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:43,520
you're still going to get a different

2224
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:46,000
chemical profile because there's so many

2225
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:47,760
micro variables that change. Uh, you

2226
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:50,000
know, but your best bet is with a Venlo

2227
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:53,440
or with these glass green houses. Yeah.

2228
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:56,158
But then it's also our duty as as a or

2229
01:20:53,439 --> 01:20:58,079
as a community, right, to make sure that

2230
01:20:56,158 --> 01:21:01,119
we have certain kind of leverage in the

2231
01:20:58,079 --> 01:21:02,880
GMP. Sure. where we all accept that you

2232
01:21:01,119 --> 01:21:03,920
know the turpins this time of the year

2233
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:06,000
are a little bit less than the other

2234
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:08,239
time of year but it still qualifies as a

2235
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:11,198
medicine. Yeah. And the only time this

2236
01:21:08,238 --> 01:21:13,599
comes into a you know it can be a major

2237
01:21:11,198 --> 01:21:15,119
issue is with cheotyping when you're

2238
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:17,600
looking for that exact chemical profile

2239
01:21:15,119 --> 01:21:18,800
for like drug discovery or for medicine

2240
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:21,679
but they can do a lot of stuff with

2241
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:23,760
extraction as well. So I think Israel

2242
01:21:21,679 --> 01:21:25,840
has gone through a lot of you know of

2243
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:27,760
that over the past like 15 years. Steady

2244
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:29,119
Murray, I talked to him a couple times

2245
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:30,960
and trying to get him on the podcast,

2246
01:21:29,119 --> 01:21:32,000
but uh you know the drug discovery and

2247
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:34,158
stuff they're doing over there and

2248
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:36,079
trying to keep the chemical profile the

2249
01:21:34,158 --> 01:21:37,839
same in green houses or even just in the

2250
01:21:36,079 --> 01:21:39,840
same environment because the plant can

2251
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:42,480
change over time. And what's your

2252
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:44,719
thoughts on Israel as far let's let's

2253
01:21:42,479 --> 01:21:46,319
not talk about

2254
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:49,560
Well, I was there two years ago. I was

2255
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:52,000
invited by a few different factories.

2256
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:53,520
Um but for me personally and for our

2257
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,719
company, long story short, we will never

2258
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:59,040
go back. Yeah. No, we do not agree on

2259
01:21:56,719 --> 01:22:01,520
their policy. I think it's too harsh for

2260
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:03,519
us. Yeah. And that's that's, you know,

2261
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:05,520
like it's just a very complicated

2262
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:08,360
country. Very complicated. They have a

2263
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:11,600
different vision than most of other

2264
01:22:08,359 --> 01:22:13,279
people. And for me, it's a no-go. So,

2265
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:14,719
what other countries do you guys have on

2266
01:22:13,279 --> 01:22:17,599
the horizon that you guys are thinking

2267
01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:19,119
about? Well, we're going to shoot a few

2268
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:22,719
movies in a few very interesting

2269
01:22:19,119 --> 01:22:24,399
countries. Yeah. We never look what I

2270
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:26,399
can say a little bit but for security

2271
01:22:24,399 --> 01:22:29,359
reasons we don't say where we go cuz

2272
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:32,638
some countries are very illegal. So uh

2273
01:22:29,359 --> 01:22:34,238
we go in as a National Geographic team

2274
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:36,239
with cameras and we're going to shoot

2275
01:22:34,238 --> 01:22:38,079
some whatever deer or bird you know

2276
01:22:36,238 --> 01:22:39,439
right we play that game sometimes. It

2277
01:22:38,079 --> 01:22:41,569
depends a little bit where it was you

2278
01:22:39,439 --> 01:22:43,439
know Russia.

2279
01:22:41,569 --> 01:22:45,359
[Laughter]

2280
01:22:43,439 --> 01:22:47,919
It is close to Russia. Nice. That's

2281
01:22:45,359 --> 01:22:50,479
good. There's going to be on horses. Oh

2282
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:52,480
wow. I can't say where. That sounds

2283
01:22:50,479 --> 01:22:54,638
exciting. It's very exciting. So, that

2284
01:22:52,479 --> 01:22:56,399
one is uh that one is on the radar and

2285
01:22:54,639 --> 01:22:58,400
there's three more on the radar. I want

2286
01:22:56,399 --> 01:23:00,000
to speed it up the process. I've been

2287
01:22:58,399 --> 01:23:01,839
already fooling around with a camera,

2288
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:05,198
you know, with with my camera guy to do

2289
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:06,639
quicker things like 5 days things, but I

2290
01:23:05,198 --> 01:23:09,279
really like to make a documentary, you

2291
01:23:06,639 --> 01:23:12,079
know. Yeah. And that a documentary cost

2292
01:23:09,279 --> 01:23:14,679
time and a lot of money. Yeah. So it

2293
01:23:12,079 --> 01:23:17,519
cost you know

2294
01:23:14,679 --> 01:23:19,679
preparing preferably going the season

2295
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:22,239
before to really see how it is. Yeah.

2296
01:23:19,679 --> 01:23:23,840
And then come back the season after or

2297
01:23:22,238 --> 01:23:25,759
have really good fixes in the country

2298
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:27,760
which we mostly have because the

2299
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:29,920
surprise is also really nice which what

2300
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:31,760
we used to do with vice you know. So

2301
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:33,440
like really surprisingly going to a

2302
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:35,520
country where you don't know what's

2303
01:23:33,439 --> 01:23:37,439
going to happen and and everything and

2304
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:38,960
everything happens. Yeah. Luckily in my

2305
01:23:37,439 --> 01:23:40,638
case, I always have a laptop with me

2306
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:44,158
with my movies on because people can be

2307
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:46,319
very skeptical. Mhm. But one way or the

2308
01:23:44,158 --> 01:23:48,479
other, they love to be in the film.

2309
01:23:46,319 --> 01:23:49,840
Yeah. Suddenly, I don't know, you know,

2310
01:23:48,479 --> 01:23:51,839
and of course there's always a few

2311
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:53,679
exceptions. We protect everybody. You

2312
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:55,920
can see my Swaziland movie. People are

2313
01:23:53,679 --> 01:23:57,760
all blurred in their faces so nobody can

2314
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:59,279
see that or I do the interview from

2315
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:00,880
behind, you know, so they speak this way

2316
01:23:59,279 --> 01:24:03,039
and I'm sitting there, you know, it

2317
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:05,279
depends a little bit on situation. We we

2318
01:24:03,039 --> 01:24:06,960
learned a lot. I changed my group. Now

2319
01:24:05,279 --> 01:24:08,639
again, I have a new group. I have all

2320
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:10,158
the camera guys from the rappers in

2321
01:24:08,639 --> 01:24:12,719
Holland. So, we're trying something new.

2322
01:24:10,158 --> 01:24:14,879
Turned out really nice in Taiwan. Um,

2323
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:16,560
different angles and whatever. But there

2324
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:18,560
was quite easy because it was a legal

2325
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:21,280
country. But for example, the first time

2326
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:23,199
we had a prank's uncle who won the film

2327
01:24:21,279 --> 01:24:25,119
festival of Venice as a camera guy.

2328
01:24:23,198 --> 01:24:27,759
Yeah. And he came with the big boom, you

2329
01:24:25,119 --> 01:24:29,760
know, in Africa. People freaking out,

2330
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:31,280
bro. Yeah. Yeah. That didn't work, you

2331
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:34,159
know. They said the boom is out, you

2332
01:24:31,279 --> 01:24:36,880
know, do whatever with mics and stuff.

2333
01:24:34,158 --> 01:24:39,359
Luckily, the cameras got much better,

2334
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:41,119
you know, and what totally changed

2335
01:24:39,359 --> 01:24:42,960
everything is the drones. Yeah,

2336
01:24:41,119 --> 01:24:44,800
especially with marijuana. Oh, I bet.

2337
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:47,439
You see, you see the South African one

2338
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:48,880
we making that river. So, we did 100ks

2339
01:24:47,439 --> 01:24:52,000
and this was amazing. You know, the

2340
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:54,159
South African one. So, I called this uh

2341
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:57,198
I want to do South Africa cuz this is an

2342
01:24:54,158 --> 01:24:59,119
area where um besides the political

2343
01:24:57,198 --> 01:25:00,399
thing we're talking about, we also

2344
01:24:59,119 --> 01:25:02,479
helped a lot of communities in this

2345
01:25:00,399 --> 01:25:04,238
world and we can tell one is trans guy.

2346
01:25:02,479 --> 01:25:06,158
Yeah, there's millions of plants growing

2347
01:25:04,238 --> 01:25:09,039
from us. That's only full gas. Yeah,

2348
01:25:06,158 --> 01:25:11,599
actually times sherbet grows amazing

2349
01:25:09,039 --> 01:25:13,840
there. Franco's kids were born there in

2350
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:16,719
the early 2000 when we worked there. And

2351
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:18,639
the trans guy was the poorest country in

2352
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:21,880
the world. One of the three like Sudan,

2353
01:25:18,639 --> 01:25:25,600
you know. Yeah. 60%

2354
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:26,800
PBC, 40% HIV. Wow. And we were sleeping

2355
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:29,079
in the tents with these people, you

2356
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:31,360
know. It was quite tricky there, you

2357
01:25:29,079 --> 01:25:33,600
know, growing a lot of seeds. So well

2358
01:25:31,359 --> 01:25:35,119
make a long story short 20 years later I

2359
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:37,560
said listen I need want to make that

2360
01:25:35,119 --> 01:25:39,519
movie there because also the American

2361
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:40,719
helicopters the South African pilots

2362
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:42,480
would teach like what they do in

2363
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:46,239
Colombia spraying over the fields

2364
01:25:42,479 --> 01:25:49,559
spraying on the people oh wow very bad

2365
01:25:46,238 --> 01:25:52,238
so the people run to a big

2366
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:54,239
river the helicopters it's very steep so

2367
01:25:52,238 --> 01:25:56,158
the helicopters cannot reach that you

2368
01:25:54,238 --> 01:25:58,559
know so they moved all there and start

2369
01:25:56,158 --> 01:26:00,879
growing and I know that story and it was

2370
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:02,400
2021 and we're all quite bored with

2371
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:04,000
doing all our shops in Amsterdam and I

2372
01:26:02,399 --> 01:26:07,519
wanted to do a movie. It was everything

2373
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:09,119
was impossible. But one way or the other

2374
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:11,679
through a friend of mine who's still a

2375
01:26:09,119 --> 01:26:14,079
friend of us, but he said, "Listen, call

2376
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:16,399
this guy in Joberg. He's got a rafting

2377
01:26:14,079 --> 01:26:19,119
company. Maybe he wants to do it cuz we

2378
01:26:16,399 --> 01:26:20,960
had to do 100ks of rafting on a river

2379
01:26:19,119 --> 01:26:22,559
that has never been rafted before."

2380
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:25,600
Yeah. And this is not two guys in a

2381
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:29,360
raft. With big rafts with 300 kilo of of

2382
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:32,000
of supply on the raft, 10 rafts. Yeah.

2383
01:26:29,359 --> 01:26:34,719
We have four actors, supporting boats,

2384
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:37,439
chef, you know, the whole lot. Yeah. So,

2385
01:26:34,719 --> 01:26:39,520
I called a guy and he said, "Aron, I've

2386
01:26:37,439 --> 01:26:41,519
never been on a river. You guys are not

2387
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:43,280
professional rafters. I can't take the

2388
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:45,520
risk. People going to die." Blah, blah,

2389
01:26:43,279 --> 01:26:47,679
blah. You know, right? So, we kept

2390
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:49,679
talking and at one point I was talking

2391
01:26:47,679 --> 01:26:51,199
again, but you know, like, you know, we

2392
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:53,920
are quite cool guys, you know, we can

2393
01:26:51,198 --> 01:26:55,839
handle a problem, you know. Yeah. And we

2394
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:57,279
start talking. I showed him my movies a

2395
01:26:55,840 --> 01:27:00,319
little bit more, you know. You know, we

2396
01:26:57,279 --> 01:27:01,759
train hard, we're very fit. You know, he

2397
01:27:00,319 --> 01:27:05,039
said, "Okay, Arian, would you are you

2398
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:07,920
willing to sign a non-liable, how do you

2399
01:27:05,039 --> 01:27:09,439
say that?" Waiver waiver.

2400
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:11,359
Yeah. I said, "Yeah, of course. No

2401
01:27:09,439 --> 01:27:13,279
problem, bro." He said, "I'm going not

2402
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:15,198
going to lie to you. If you pay me, you

2403
01:27:13,279 --> 01:27:17,920
will also save my company because it was

2404
01:27:15,198 --> 01:27:19,439
corona." Oh, he was losing his money.

2405
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:21,359
So, make a long story short. I said,

2406
01:27:19,439 --> 01:27:23,359
"Listen, I do all these things under one

2407
01:27:21,359 --> 01:27:24,799
condition. I want to have the best food

2408
01:27:23,359 --> 01:27:26,639
in the world on the trip this time."

2409
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:29,199
Yeah. Cuz his wife was a chef and I knew

2410
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:30,800
that. Oh, wow. So I said, "Okay, let's

2411
01:27:29,198 --> 01:27:33,519
do it." I'll make a long story short, we

2412
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:36,560
went there and the first day was 12

2413
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:38,639
hours in this canoe in his raft. And

2414
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:41,120
then we came and then on the side of the

2415
01:27:38,639 --> 01:27:43,359
river on the islands, we put tents up.

2416
01:27:41,119 --> 01:27:45,519
Yeah. So we sleep in tents, you know, we

2417
01:27:43,359 --> 01:27:49,839
do barbecue. We went 8 days on that

2418
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:52,320
river. We did uh 200ks. Amazing. From

2419
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:54,079
the mountains, cold water. Yeah. To the

2420
01:27:52,319 --> 01:27:55,359
where the ocean starts. You go any

2421
01:27:54,079 --> 01:27:56,719
rapids or anything like that? Yeah.

2422
01:27:55,359 --> 01:27:58,319
Yeah. Many rapids. You can see them in

2423
01:27:56,719 --> 01:28:00,239
the movie. Oh Yeah, we went upside down

2424
01:27:58,319 --> 01:28:02,158
a few times. But where are we talking

2425
01:28:00,238 --> 01:28:04,319
about the drone? Yeah, that's why I'm

2426
01:28:02,158 --> 01:28:05,920
explaining this situation. And there we

2427
01:28:04,319 --> 01:28:07,759
and I said, "Listen guys, I want two

2428
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:10,639
drones with us, you know, and and but

2429
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:12,560
yeah, this and that." But he did um

2430
01:28:10,639 --> 01:28:14,159
Oscar winning movie with Mel Street that

2431
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:16,560
was made in South Africa. He was a drone

2432
01:28:14,158 --> 01:28:17,920
pilot. Wow. Some Oscar movie. Maybe it

2433
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:19,920
was not Merryill Street, but one of

2434
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:21,679
those, you know, Gorillas in the Mist or

2435
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:23,760
one of those. Well, anyway, he was a

2436
01:28:21,679 --> 01:28:25,039
drone pilot. He said, "Aran, I can do

2437
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:26,480
it." I said, "We're going to do the

2438
01:28:25,039 --> 01:28:28,639
river raft in Cambridge and there's

2439
01:28:26,479 --> 01:28:30,479
drone there and then you go over the

2440
01:28:28,639 --> 01:28:32,239
raft and then you see the fields on the

2441
01:28:30,479 --> 01:28:34,238
side, right? That is a million dollar

2442
01:28:32,238 --> 01:28:35,519
shot." No, he said, "Let's do it." And

2443
01:28:34,238 --> 01:28:37,198
it turned out perfectly, you know, and

2444
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:39,920
that we did in 21, you know, with the

2445
01:28:37,198 --> 01:28:42,719
drones. Wow. So there the perception of

2446
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:44,639
making the uh film changing, you know,

2447
01:28:42,719 --> 01:28:46,079
also like not anymore with all these big

2448
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:48,000
things, you know, like it's not

2449
01:28:46,079 --> 01:28:50,479
necessary, you know, you can make as

2450
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:52,560
much and we have the 360 and the GoPros,

2451
01:28:50,479 --> 01:28:55,039
you know. Yeah. A lot. They're really

2452
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:56,800
great. Yeah. Still sometimes a challenge

2453
01:28:55,039 --> 01:28:58,319
to get all the equipment in all the

2454
01:28:56,800 --> 01:29:00,639
drones and stuff. The drones is an

2455
01:28:58,319 --> 01:29:02,880
issue. Yeah. Yeah. So, I'd love to talk

2456
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:05,840
about Franco for a minute if if you if

2457
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:07,760
that's okay. But yeah, so my book was

2458
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:09,119
dedicated to Franco and he was one of my

2459
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:13,440
friends, but he was your best friend.

2460
01:29:09,119 --> 01:29:14,800
Yeah. And as far as his legacy, uh, you

2461
01:29:13,439 --> 01:29:16,399
want to talk about his legacy a little

2462
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:18,880
bit? I know there's the Francoha

2463
01:29:16,399 --> 01:29:21,920
Foundation and I mean all the videos you

2464
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:25,199
do. Yeah. Well, I started working with

2465
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:27,520
Franco early 2000. So, we were 15 years

2466
01:29:25,198 --> 01:29:30,599
together. It was amazing guy. He was

2467
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:33,760
really crazy. And I think in

2468
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:36,159
2001, we got the first license in the

2469
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:37,520
world, medical license. This was in Nwag

2470
01:29:36,158 --> 01:29:38,638
with an American guy called James

2471
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:41,760
Burton. I don't know if you know the

2472
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:43,760
story. We him is in the newspapers, but

2473
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:45,360
of course, it was my place. Mhm. But no,

2474
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:48,320
we were not allowed to say that because

2475
01:29:45,359 --> 01:29:50,238
the first medical marijuana license was

2476
01:29:48,319 --> 01:29:52,679
very legal to be affiliated to a coffee

2477
01:29:50,238 --> 01:29:55,519
shop guy. Yeah. So we financed

2478
01:29:52,679 --> 01:29:58,800
everything and then he was working from

2479
01:29:55,520 --> 01:30:00,159
99 to 2001 in my coffee shop and Vatlau

2480
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:02,480
plant the little one. You remember

2481
01:30:00,158 --> 01:30:04,238
upstairs I was living and at one point

2482
01:30:02,479 --> 01:30:06,718
my wife said I said I need more growers.

2483
01:30:04,238 --> 01:30:08,479
I need more growers. He said go speak to

2484
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:10,239
this Italian guy that's working in a

2485
01:30:08,479 --> 01:30:12,000
vatlo planter two years. He's very

2486
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:15,439
passionate. I think he would love to

2487
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:17,399
grow for us. So I go there, you know, he

2488
01:30:15,439 --> 01:30:19,678
just finished his hotel school in

2489
01:30:17,399 --> 01:30:21,839
Lelayw. I said, "It's my dream to work

2490
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:24,800
for you. It's my dream," he said. So I

2491
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:26,639
took him and then we start growing on a

2492
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:28,880
small scale in Amsterdam. We were

2493
01:30:26,639 --> 01:30:31,520
growing, but he I put him in the sea

2494
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:32,880
tents, you know, like the small two,

2495
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:35,440
three light things, you know. Right.

2496
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:37,600
Right. And suddenly James Burton came

2497
01:30:35,439 --> 01:30:39,638
who was already supplying me. He said,

2498
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:41,840
"I can get a license for medical

2499
01:30:39,639 --> 01:30:43,920
marijuana." What? Didn't know it was

2500
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:45,440
existing. No. Said, "Yeah, but we need a

2501
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:47,840
guy in and we have to put a lot of

2502
01:30:45,439 --> 01:30:49,599
money." Blah, blah, blah. And I don't

2503
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:52,319
know how it went, but Franco became that

2504
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:53,920
guy. He said, "Listen, he's still

2505
01:30:52,319 --> 01:30:55,279
showing the pictures. We still have the

2506
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:57,039
pictures, everything." He said, "Listen,

2507
01:30:55,279 --> 01:30:58,238
I have something really crazy now." And

2508
01:30:57,039 --> 01:30:59,760
you are the guy going to do you want to

2509
01:30:58,238 --> 01:31:01,198
do it? Of course, I'm going to do it.

2510
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:04,400
So, you're going to be three years in a

2511
01:31:01,198 --> 01:31:07,359
glass house. It's 50° C inside, which is

2512
01:31:04,399 --> 01:31:08,638
130, 140. Yeah. in the summer and we're

2513
01:31:07,359 --> 01:31:10,399
going to grow medical weed and we're

2514
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:13,920
going to sell it to patients. So that's

2515
01:31:10,399 --> 01:31:15,839
how the whole thing started. Wow. So I

2516
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:18,279
teach him all the growing and how to do

2517
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:20,960
everything, you know, and then in

2518
01:31:18,279 --> 01:31:22,559
2005 he became such a character with me

2519

of them. Navy Seals. He was with them.

2545
01:32:17,039 --> 01:32:21,119
Yeah. But then the

2546
01:32:18,679 --> 01:32:22,800
Italian version. The Italian version.

2547
01:32:21,119 --> 01:32:26,479
Probably the crazy Italian version.

2548
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:28,560
Yeah. Yeah. So yeah. So we had great fun

2549
01:32:26,479 --> 01:32:31,198
you know and um he had a little bit the

2550
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:32,800
same set mind as me you know go to more

2551
01:32:31,198 --> 01:32:36,000
difficult countries so that's how we

2552
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:37,840
also winded up in uh in Africa in 2004

2553
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:40,238
we didn't started in 2000 we started

2554
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:42,560
there I think in 2005 and then went

2555
01:32:40,238 --> 01:32:44,479
Congo of course and that's where in the

2556
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:47,440
beginning India and there and then Congo

2557
01:32:44,479 --> 01:32:51,759
the disaster happened you know Franco

2558
01:32:47,439 --> 01:32:54,238
was wild and uh I sent him a few times

2559
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:56,400
to the doctor when he came back and he

2560
01:32:54,238 --> 01:33:00,439
said he went but He didn't. And the

2561
01:32:56,399 --> 01:33:04,158
doctors told him he didn't have malaria.

2562
01:33:00,439 --> 01:33:06,879
And they made that conclusion because he

2563
01:33:04,158 --> 01:33:09,439
didn't have fever. But in his family,

2564
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:11,600
people get sick without fever, which is

2565
01:33:09,439 --> 01:33:14,238
a quite rare disease. Yeah. And the

2566
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:17,440
doctor ignored that, you know, and then

2567
01:33:14,238 --> 01:33:18,959
Yeah. Then [ __ ] happened. Yeah. But he

2568
01:33:17,439 --> 01:33:20,799
was a great guy. I had [ __ ] so much

2569
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:22,319
fun with that guy, bro. He loved weed

2570
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:24,800
more than anybody there. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

2571
01:33:22,319 --> 01:33:26,960

01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:13,440
seen a guy jump so quickly out of his

2618
01:35:10,238 --> 01:35:15,839
bed to close the curtain of the tent. I

2619
01:35:13,439 --> 01:35:17,279
had I had so many but we had serious

2620
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:18,960
situations too you know with shooting

2621
01:35:17,279 --> 01:35:21,519
with soldiers and you know we went for

2622
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:24,000
it you know getting chased in Colombia

2623
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:25,760
bro we were in we were in I can't say on

2624
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,600
this this part I can't say you know the

2625
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:30,560
part. Yeah. Yeah. So we were in a rough

2626
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:32,400
part. We were the only people white

2627
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:35,520
people going in and out of that area you

2628
01:35:32,399 --> 01:35:37,039
know for many years. Wild times. Funny

2629
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:39,520
thing. Yeah. You've had some adventures.

2630
01:35:37,039 --> 01:35:42,960
Yeah. Great ones. Yeah. But he was a

2631
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:45,560
great guy. Unfortunately, he left.

2632
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:48,000
Yeah. What to do?

2633
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:50,880
Yeah. Some of the some of the best ones

2634
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:54,158
die young. Well, we buried our partner

2635
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:55,920
just uh two months ago in Thailand. I

2636
01:35:54,158 --> 01:35:57,759
buried my best friend seven years ago. I

2637
01:35:55,920 --> 01:35:59,760
buried five friends in the last seven

2638
01:35:57,760 --> 01:36:01,199
years. Yeah. But this happen when you

2639
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:02,880
get a little bit older and when you are

2640
01:36:01,198 --> 01:36:05,119
in Yeah. I don't know, you know. Yeah. I

2641
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:07,520
feel like you you get to 40 and then you

2642
01:36:05,119 --> 01:36:09,840
start losing friends and it just gets be

2643
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:11,040
more and more every year. Yeah. Yeah. I

2644
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:13,199
guess that's why we got to appreciate

2645
01:36:11,039 --> 01:36:14,800
each moment. I think it's the most

2646
01:36:13,198 --> 01:36:17,119
healthy thing, you know, appreciate

2647
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:19,520
life. Yeah. Make sure your children

2648
01:36:17,119 --> 01:36:20,800
always come home. Yeah. The moment you

2649
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:23,199
know your children don't come home

2650
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:24,960
anymore, then you did something wrong.

2651
01:36:23,198 --> 01:36:28,638
Yeah. Now my parents come home. It's

2652
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:31,679
great. Yeah. So, if you had one piece of

2653
01:36:28,639 --> 01:36:32,760
advice for younger people coming into

2654
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:34,800
this

2655
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:36,880
industry, I'm going to ask both of you

2656
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:38,400
guys this question from your own

2657
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:40,800
perspectives, but what would that one

2658
01:36:38,399 --> 01:36:43,599
piece of advice be? Well, the the

2659
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:46,000
industry is quite broad, you know. Yeah.

2660
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:49,920
If you want to become a grower, I would

2661
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:52,560
be a organic grower. let it be normal

2662
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:54,158
organic or living soil and make a craft

2663
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:57,440
brand like I think then you have the

2664
01:36:54,158 --> 01:36:59,759
most chance in a few and and have a

2665
01:36:57,439 --> 01:37:01,519
dispensary like that you are vertically

2666
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:03,360
integrated so you can build up your own

2667
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:06,760
community I think that's our strong

2668
01:37:03,359 --> 01:37:09,599
point and in Amsterdam and in

2669
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:11,199
Thailand this is us this is where we

2670
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:13,280
grow and this you can smoke you like it

2671
01:37:11,198 --> 01:37:14,719
or you don't like it but you know and

2672
01:37:13,279 --> 01:37:16,960
there's nothing in the middle there

2673
01:37:14,719 --> 01:37:18,399
right that's how it should be you know

2674
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:19,760
basically like you see really good

2675
01:37:18,399 --> 01:37:21,039
Michelin star restaurants. They have

2676
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:22,880
their own grow. Yeah, they have their

2677
01:37:21,039 --> 01:37:24,399
own farms. Their own farms. They go pick

2678
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:25,920
up their [ __ ] in the morning and they

2679
01:37:24,399 --> 01:37:28,000
make the best food in the night. Even

2680
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:31,520
the ones that don't have contracts with

2681
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:32,960
specific farms and farmers also people

2682
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:35,199
that grow specific animals. How

2683
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:36,719
successful any Michelin star restaurant

2684
01:37:35,198 --> 01:37:38,479
is successful in the world. Yeah. Cuz

2685
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:40,480
there's a limited amount. And why are

2686
01:37:38,479 --> 01:37:42,959
they successful? Because they grow the

2687
01:37:40,479 --> 01:37:45,039
best organic food. And the only ones

2688
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:47,198
that are healthy. Yeah. And that's why I

2689
01:37:45,039 --> 01:37:49,760
think my advice would be grow organic.

2690
01:37:47,198 --> 01:37:52,319
Yeah. Or at least on soil. Yeah. You

2691
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:54,719
know, make a good product and see how

2692
01:37:52,319 --> 01:37:56,399
close you can stay to your customer by

2693
01:37:54,719 --> 01:37:58,399
selling it in your own dispensary, you

2694
01:37:56,399 --> 01:38:00,319
know. Or make sure it's marketed well

2695
01:37:58,399 --> 01:38:02,399
and then put on the shelf in another

2696
01:38:00,319 --> 01:38:05,118
dispensary really well, you know. Mhm.

2697
01:38:02,399 --> 01:38:07,198
But I think I think if you are small,

2698
01:38:05,118 --> 01:38:08,479
then you don't depend on investors, you

2699
01:38:07,198 --> 01:38:10,559
know, you can do your own thing. I think

2700
01:38:08,479 --> 01:38:13,439
that's the best advice I can give you.

2701
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:15,280
Yeah. And then what would your one piece

2702
01:38:13,439 --> 01:38:17,359
of advice be for younger people coming

2703
01:38:15,279 --> 01:38:19,840
in the industry? uh well for any

2704
01:38:17,359 --> 01:38:21,839
industry or just in life basically cuz I

2705
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:24,639
have two older sons as well going into

2706
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:26,159
life you know and uh going into doing

2707
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:28,880
some kind of business you know where

2708
01:38:26,158 --> 01:38:30,960
they can make a living is it's so cliche

2709
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:33,199
but I'll explain a bit more is doing

2710
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:34,800
what you really like they say you don't

2711
01:38:33,198 --> 01:38:37,439
work a day in your life if you do what

2712
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:39,840
you love right but the people see for

2713
01:38:37,439 --> 01:38:41,759
for us is the whole package because

2714
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:43,360
there's such a misconception sometimes

2715
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:45,760
because what the people see on our

2716
01:38:43,359 --> 01:38:47,759
Instagram we get so many comments of of

2717
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:49,600
course of almost everybody. I love your

2718
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:51,520
life. I would, you know, like your life

2719
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:53,600
is so fantastic. But that people have no

2720
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:55,920
idea that for every nice thing you see

2721
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:59,119
on Instagram, this is a message. There's

2722
01:38:55,920 --> 01:39:01,600
at least 10 or 20 huge big [ __ ]

2723
01:38:59,118 --> 01:39:03,839
problems that we have to solve and the

2724
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:05,920
[ __ ] that we get every day and from from

2725
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:07,679
a lot of different sides, right? But

2726
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:10,800
because we have the whole thing and and

2727
01:39:07,679 --> 01:39:12,319
and uh we have these really nice things,

2728
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:15,679
the whole package, I wouldn't do

2729
01:39:12,319 --> 01:39:17,359
anything different, you know? And um

2730
01:39:15,679 --> 01:39:18,880
that's what I said to my son too. He's

2731
01:39:17,359 --> 01:39:20,319
in business. He said, "Dad, I have to

2732
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:22,079
solve so much [ __ ] every day." I said,

2733
01:39:20,319 --> 01:39:24,079
"Yeah, basically that's your job now."

2734
01:39:22,079 --> 01:39:25,600
You know, you're just a problem solver.

2735
01:39:24,079 --> 01:39:28,479
And at the end of the day, you have to

2736
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:30,960
switch off and do nice things and make

2737
01:39:28,479 --> 01:39:33,039
it worth your while. Basically, that's

2738
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:36,000
that's what I would advise. Do what you

2739
01:39:33,039 --> 01:39:38,158
love, but do it with a big passion, you

2740
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:40,238
know. Nice. Yeah.

2741
01:39:38,158 --> 01:39:41,599
Yeah. Passion is you need passion.

2742
01:39:40,238 --> 01:39:42,718
Passion is everything. If you don't have

2743
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:44,800
a passion, then nothing's going to

2744
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:46,880
happen, you So, circling back to Franco,

2745
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:48,639
passion for the sacred plant. That

2746
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:51,279
hashtag that I used to use originally

2747
01:39:48,639 --> 01:39:53,118
and that I still use today. I started

2748
01:39:51,279 --> 01:39:55,359
with Franco like we were smoking and

2749
01:39:53,118 --> 01:39:57,679
that came out of that. Yeah. Passion for

2750
01:39:55,359 --> 01:39:58,960
the sacred plant. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2751
01:39:57,679 --> 01:40:01,118
That started with Franco a long time

2752
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:04,079
ago. And then Full Gas is your one. So,

2753
01:40:01,118 --> 01:40:05,759
yeah. That that that'll live on those

2754
01:40:04,079 --> 01:40:07,359
Full Gas. That's, you know, he always

2755
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:08,960
liked that, you know. So, that's why we

2756
01:40:07,359 --> 01:40:10,880
named it after him. And he always used

2757
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:14,239
Full Gas. Yeah. Yeah. He never had he

2758
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:16,480
never he didn't had a break, right?

2759
01:40:14,238 --> 01:40:18,079
Yeah. When he met Unfortunately, that's

2760
01:40:16,479 --> 01:40:20,399
also why he passed away, you know. It's

2761
01:40:18,079 --> 01:40:22,319
the reality of life, you know, like he

2762
01:40:20,399 --> 01:40:25,279
was too wild, you know. That's his life

2763
01:40:22,319 --> 01:40:27,198
motto was full gas, you know. We go for

2764
01:40:25,279 --> 01:40:29,519
all the for the for the hard stuff, for

2765
01:40:27,198 --> 01:40:31,759
the for the good stuff, we go full I

2766
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:33,360
think if he never I think if he would

2767
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:36,079
not be with me, he would have died like

2768
01:40:33,359 --> 01:40:40,238
three times earlier already. Wow. We had

2769
01:40:36,079 --> 01:40:42,399
some crazy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah,

2770
01:40:40,238 --> 01:40:44,158
you know, sometimes you have to follow a

2771
01:40:42,399 --> 01:40:46,158
little bit the middle way, you know.

2772
01:40:44,158 --> 01:40:48,799
Yeah, some countries are quite

2773
01:40:46,158 --> 01:40:51,599
dangerous, you know. For me, for me that

2774
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:53,360
day that uh because I don't know if a

2775
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:55,600
lot of people know, but he first was a

2776
01:40:53,359 --> 01:40:57,279
few days in coma, right? So on the day

2777
01:40:55,600 --> 01:41:00,560
that

2778
01:40:57,279 --> 01:41:03,118
uh my my youngest kid was born, that was

2779
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:05,119
the end of December uh 30 December. I

2780
01:41:03,118 --> 01:41:07,439
walk out of the hospital with my my

2781
01:41:05,118 --> 01:41:09,279
newborn baby and I call him up to tell

2782
01:41:07,439 --> 01:41:12,158
him the good news. Then Franco just went

2783
01:41:09,279 --> 01:41:14,479
into hospital uh in coma. So I traveled

2784
01:41:12,158 --> 01:41:17,439
to Barcelona also and a couple of days

2785
01:41:14,479 --> 01:41:19,519
later he died. So it was very bizarre

2786
01:41:17,439 --> 01:41:21,559
period always and basically it's also a

2787
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:24,159
metaphor for life. No. Yeah. You know

2788
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:26,000
somebody realize how prestige life is,

2789
01:41:24,158 --> 01:41:27,719
you know. Yeah. You know and then you

2790
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:31,039
wonder, you know, why are the

2791
01:41:27,719 --> 01:41:34,000
politicians killing our own population?

2792
01:41:31,039 --> 01:41:36,000
Why are we smoking hydro? Yeah. Did it

2793
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:38,719
go so far that we just [ __ ] up

2794
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:40,560
everything now? And yes, because we are

2795
01:41:38,719 --> 01:41:42,800
all killing our own population with the

2796
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:44,639
wrong foods, you know, all the seed oils

2797
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:46,719
we are eating which are super bad for

2798
01:41:44,639 --> 01:41:48,480
your body, you know. Yeah. And all these

2799
01:41:46,719 --> 01:41:51,439
chemicals that are using, you know, and

2800
01:41:48,479 --> 01:41:53,039
like the overtone of sugar and gallons,

2801
01:41:51,439 --> 01:41:55,759
especially sugar, that's worse. That's

2802
01:41:53,039 --> 01:41:58,000
the worst one. Fuel for tumors and bad

2803
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:59,520
cells, right? You know, it's the worst

2804
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:02,158
product on this world. You know, that's

2805
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:05,040
the it's it's worse than the drugs.

2806
01:42:02,158 --> 01:42:07,759
There's more people got killed through

2807
01:42:05,039 --> 01:42:09,840
sugar than through all the diseases and

2808
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:12,480
all the wars together. Do the math on

2809
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:15,520
that. Yeah. So more people got killed.

2810
01:42:12,479 --> 01:42:18,079
Yeah. From sugar than from anything

2811
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:20,639
else. Yeah. It's wild. And we just let

2812
01:42:18,079 --> 01:42:23,519
it all happen. Yeah. Look at the

2813
01:42:20,639 --> 01:42:25,840
supermarkets. How how supermarkets are

2814
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:29,199
made. So you walk into a supermarket,

2815
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:31,520
which is a genius idea, but it's not a

2816
01:42:29,198 --> 01:42:33,359
good idea. Mhm. So you come in, you see

2817
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:34,880
only beautiful colors. Yeah. Of the

2818
01:42:33,359 --> 01:42:36,960
vegetables and the fruits to make you

2819
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:40,760
happy, right? But it stimulates your

2820
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:43,118
eye. Then you walk and you smell the

2821
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:45,600
bread. And then you wind up at the till

2822
01:42:43,118 --> 01:42:47,118
with your little kids with a candy or an

2823
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:48,639
eye height, you know, the right one for

2824
01:42:47,118 --> 01:42:50,000
them, you know, and then you fill up

2825
01:42:48,639 --> 01:42:51,679
everything and you take only the [ __ ]

2826
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:54,880
with you, right? Yeah. Bread is for

2827
01:42:51,679 --> 01:42:57,440
nothing. Candy is for nothing, you know.

2828
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:59,039
Yeah. It's the bad calories.

2829
01:42:57,439 --> 01:43:01,198
Well, we have to fight the stigma though

2830
01:42:59,039 --> 01:43:02,880
because the association of the of the

2831
01:43:01,198 --> 01:43:05,118
retailers association, we got a letter

2832
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:06,719
from one of the biggest sugar candy

2833
01:43:05,118 --> 01:43:08,319
companies, Haribo, don't know if you

2834
01:43:06,719 --> 01:43:10,319
know. Oh, yeah. And they and some

2835
01:43:08,319 --> 01:43:13,118
companies were making fake edibles, you

2836
01:43:10,319 --> 01:43:15,840
know, with their logo and stuff. So, in

2837
01:43:13,118 --> 01:43:17,118
the in the letter it it mentioned, of

2838
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:18,880
course, we don't want to be associated

2839
01:43:17,118 --> 01:43:20,719
with, you know, this is cannabis. This

2840
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:22,719
is a drug. So if you look at that

2841
01:43:20,719 --> 01:43:24,000
letter, you think but the problem in our

2842
01:43:22,719 --> 01:43:26,560
industry and that's why we're all

2843
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:28,800
fighting is 99% of all people agree with

2844
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:30,800
Haribo. Yeah. You know, and they don't

2845
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:33,119
see the ridiculousness of that letter

2846
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:35,199
saying, you know, cannabis is bad and

2847
01:43:33,118 --> 01:43:37,198
you know, we have to protect our deer

2848
01:43:35,198 --> 01:43:39,919
product. And also, you know, our own

2849
01:43:37,198 --> 01:43:41,678
communities are not within our groups.

2850
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:43,840
We are not protected well enough. You

2851
01:43:41,679 --> 01:43:46,079
know, look in America, everybody's suing

2852
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:47,520
each other in cannabis lawsuits every

2853
01:43:46,079 --> 01:43:49,760
lawsuits all over. I don't know anything

2854
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:51,280
about those. I know only about lawyers.

2855
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:53,440
We definitely don't want to support the

2856
01:43:51,279 --> 01:43:57,079
lawyers. We never had They're the only

2857
01:43:53,439 --> 01:44:00,479
ones that win in lawsuits. We can say

2858
01:43:57,079 --> 01:44:02,880
proudly we have avoided maybe 15

2859
01:44:00,479 --> 01:44:04,638
lawsuits that we all settled outside the

2860
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:07,039
room really quickly with idiots mostly

2861
01:44:04,639 --> 01:44:09,679
with staff and stupid things. Yeah, we

2862
01:44:07,039 --> 01:44:11,359
always try to stay away. This is a big

2863
01:44:09,679 --> 01:44:13,840
problem of our industry, you know. And

2864
01:44:11,359 --> 01:44:15,519
then on the top of that all the listed

2865
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:17,440
companies come in and blow the money of

2866
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:20,239
the investors pop some mom's money you

2867
01:44:17,439 --> 01:44:23,839
know right and that is why also we are

2868
01:44:20,238 --> 01:44:25,678
not strong enough as like the NHL will

2869
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:27,760
be or the baseball league or the ice

2870
01:44:25,679 --> 01:44:29,679
hockey league or whatever you know cuz

2871
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:32,320
they're smarter together and all have

2872
01:44:29,679 --> 01:44:34,319
one goal. Yeah. In our industry there's

2873
01:44:32,319 --> 01:44:36,158
a few people who want to eat the rest.

2874
01:44:34,319 --> 01:44:38,158
Yeah. You know like the big corpse that

2875
01:44:36,158 --> 01:44:40,238
are coming in. Yeah. And then there's a

2876
01:44:38,158 --> 01:44:42,638
small crafted grow that's been pushed

2877
01:44:40,238 --> 01:44:44,638
out. You see the guys in North Cal

2878
01:44:42,639 --> 01:44:47,118
everywhere that's the worst. In humble

2879
01:44:44,639 --> 01:44:50,239
is the worst, you know. So, and that's

2880
01:44:47,118 --> 01:44:52,319
why there's also not enough unity in our

2881
01:44:50,238 --> 01:44:54,158
world. Yeah. To make that we are

2882
01:44:52,319 --> 01:44:56,000
stronger and we can fight as a big

2883
01:44:54,158 --> 01:44:58,960
group, you know, cuz there's so many

2884
01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:02,238
diversity and issues and politics and

2885
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:04,239
whatever, you know, right? Whereas in

2886
01:45:02,238 --> 01:45:06,799
pharma and in sugar, they protect each

2887
01:45:04,238 --> 01:45:08,559
other really well. For sure. Well, those

2888
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:10,560
are really long established industries,

2889
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:12,159
too. So, I think we'll get there.

2890
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:13,600
Hopefully in the right direction. Yeah.

2891
01:45:12,158 --> 01:45:15,279
Yeah. I think I think in a lot of ways

2892
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:17,119
we are going in the right direction. I

2893
01:45:15,279 --> 01:45:19,920
just think some of this takes a lot of

2894
01:45:17,118 --> 01:45:23,839
time to stabilize. Let's finish positive

2895
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:26,158
this podcast. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly.

2896
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:29,199
You know, so if people are interested in

01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:41,118
think Thailand, let me say one more

2903
01:45:39,439 --> 01:45:43,519
thing because I would like to end really

2904
01:45:41,118 --> 01:45:45,759
positive about Thailand. I've been in

2905
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:48,080
103 countries I've lived in. This is

2906
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:50,239
number 10. Me and Yo, we have a really

logistics, zero crime, great schools.

2911
01:45:59,118 --> 01:46:02,238
One of the best, maybe the best country.

2912
01:46:00,639 --> 01:46:03,600
If you look everything together, it's

2913
01:46:02,238 --> 01:46:05,279
maybe the best country in the world.

2914
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:07,840
Wow. You can eat a great soup on the

2915
01:46:05,279 --> 01:46:09,439
street for $2. Even 150 him and me and

2916
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:11,840
like a proper soup. There's a line of

2917
01:46:09,439 --> 01:46:13,519
people waiting. Yeah. Amazing. So that

2918
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:15,199
is your next holiday destination.

2919
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:16,400
Literally my next holiday destination is

2920
01:46:15,198 --> 01:46:18,319
one of them. For sure. And you can fly

2921

to the islands everything with your bag

2922
01:46:18,319 --> 01:46:22,319
full with weed. Absolutely no problem.

2923
01:46:20,399 --> 01:46:24,559
You can open for security and then you

2924
01:46:22,319 --> 01:46:26,479
know and there you can smoke all our

2925

everybody in this world to come and see

2930
01:46:34,238 --> 01:46:37,919
Thailand, you know, especially of out of

2931
01:46:36,079 --> 01:46:39,519
our industry like there's not enough

2932
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:41,199
space for everybody because it's it's

2933
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:42,639
already a little bit like Cali. There's

2934
01:46:41,198 --> 01:46:44,799
too many coffee shops, there's too many

2935
01:46:42,639 --> 01:46:46,560
growers. So there will be a natural way

2936
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:50,239

in Humboldt and Menoscina we could make

2975
