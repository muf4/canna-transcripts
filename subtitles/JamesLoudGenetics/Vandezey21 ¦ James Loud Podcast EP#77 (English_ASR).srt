[Â __Â ] this guy you do something that's so

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,200
different and so wild and I feel like I

17
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:47,000
have

18
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,359
105,000 followers on Instagram because I

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,558
did something different I was shaking

20
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:53,159
male plants and the pollen was flying

21
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:55,839
and that got me elevated but then I see

22
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:57,358
this guy laying splitting and he's like

23
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,440
singing along to all these different

24
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:02,120
songs and it's like you know my

25
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:03,558
experience with with riding bikes is I

26
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:07,319
I've laid a couple bikes down and I

27
00:01:03,558 --> 00:01:10,000
would never in my mind in my right mind

28
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:11,679
go go through traffic like that at those

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,438
speeds and then be able to record it and

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,479
dial it all in and I'm like there must

31
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:17,599
be something going on here you know we

32
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:20,039
green screen what is he doing and it's

33
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,438
like it it it almost doesn't make sense

34
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,600
to your eyes when you're watching it if

35
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:25,438
you really start understanding and

36
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:28,039
looking at how fast you're going through

37
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,359
these you know these these videos it's

38
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,720
like and what kind of speeds are you

39
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:34,319
doing through it's definitely not

40
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:36,959
slow you're not looking at this either

41
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:38,959
it's definitely not slow let Mikey tell

42
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:42,359
you he he showed me everything I know so

43
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:45,039
you know how that is but uh no man it's

44
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:47,319
uh it's crazy to me that everybody

45
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,880
thinks it's so crazy like I never

46
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:50,519
thought I swear to God today was the

47
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:52,839
first day I was at work and I was

48
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:56,078
watching one of my videos I was like you

49
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:58,439
know this is pretty wild like I never I

50
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:59,639
like but to me it's just something I do

51
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:01,519
I like I've been riding motorcycles

52
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,200
since I was 2 years old so like

53
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:05,840
everything I do is just to the fullest

54
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,680
like I was a wakeboarder i Tred to do it

55
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,000
to the fullest snowboard do it to the

56
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,959
fullest like when I go down the mountain

57
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,400
I just we just want to go fast I'm like

58
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,640
Ricky Bobby man you're not first you're

59
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,039
last you know what I mean so it's crazy

60
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:18,919
to me but like it's crazy that you know

61
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,199
that everybody thinks it's crazy but uh

62
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:23,238
well and creatively unique right so like

63
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:25,039
it's not just crazy but it's creatively

64
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:27,360
unique to where no I've never seen

65
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:30,239
anybody else do it like that so how it

66
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,680
all happen is uh I usually I've been

67
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,800
riding like that like ever since I got

68
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,800
my bike so since I got my first Harley I

69
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,200
just I've been riding fast splitting

70
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,800
lanes and dancing like I dance in the

71
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:41,560
car I dance everywhere like I'm just

72
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,560
kind of a person that I'm always trying

73
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,479
to have a good time I love music it's my

74
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,920
favorite thing in the world and like one

75
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:48,598
day I was on the way home from work and

76
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:50,958

84
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,599

talked me into like just doing it and I

88
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:13,400
did it for fun and I was like uh this is

89
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:15,480
kind of lame but whatever you know what

90
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,560
I mean I'm not really in it for the

91
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:18,798
clout or anything like that I'm just

92
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,000
it's just me I just ride it's just

93
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:23,040
authentic it comes across that way too

94
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,878
yeah I could like I could personally I

95
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,798
hate to say this I could care less if

96
00:03:25,878 --> 00:03:29,359
people like it or not you like it or you

97
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:30,959
don't I'm not going to do something

98
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,040
different you hate it good for you don't

99
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,039
watch it then like what do you want me

100
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:34,840
to tell you you know and that's the

101
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:36,239
authentic side that just comes across

102
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,640
and it's like I don't think you could do

103
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,319
it any other way yeah yeah I mean for

104
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:41,839
one thing it's freaking dangerous it's

105
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,719
very dangerous you know what's crazy

106
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,039
though like I never felt any type of

107
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:48,199
danger I don't feel unsafe like I've

108
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:49,959
never personally thought it was

109
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:51,958
dangerous and then I'm telling you today

110
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:53,079
was the first time I've actually watched

111
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:56,000
a video and be

112
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:58,280
like all right that's a little wild like

113
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,318
but to me when I'm riding I just I just

114
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,719
don't think about anything like I'm just

115
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:04,518
well you're so tuned in I'm just

116
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:05,799
listening to music and people like you

117
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:07,680
need to pay attention to watch the road

118
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:09,319
I'm like I'm watching the road why you

119
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,760
think I'm going like this back and forth

120
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:13,199
because I'm just I'm just listening to

121
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:14,479
music and I'm just so focused that like

122
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:16,478
I don't have those thoughts you know

123
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,000
when you're tuned in like that there is

124
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,000
no fear right because you're tuned in

125
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,680
and you know what's going on and I think

126
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,120
your awareness is heightened uh you know

127
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,600
I just yeah I'm not that guy and so and

128
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,840
so it's impressive seeing other people

129
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,800
do it I'm telling you I've been thrill

130
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:32,319
chasing my whole life so it's kind of

131
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,960
just another thing for me it's just like

132
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:35,719
you ever go like really fast in a car

133
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:37,719
and you just get tunnel vision well I

134
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,080
feel like it's like a version of tunnel

135
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,840
vision cuz like my I can see everything

136
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:43,599
still but I just don't care that it's

137
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:45,319
there unless it's going to affect me you

138
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,280
know it's like I just ride to where I

139
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:49,240
can predict your guys' next move that's

140
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:51,198
really my whole goal is just yeah I

141
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,478
remember early 2000s the fastest I ever

142
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,280
went in the earliest 2000s was like 180

143
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:58,360
and a Supra and we were down in San Jose

144
00:04:56,279 --> 00:05:01,000
at night and it was dark going going on

145
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,560
the freeway and that was that was fast

146
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,038
that was fast it's like you do get

147
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,720
tunnel vision from that oh yeah the

148
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:08,199
fastest I've got split Lanes nobody

149
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,440
believes me I got up to 110 splitting

150
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:12,199
lanes and like everybody on a sport bike

151
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:14,120
like it's not fast I do 150 split in

152
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:15,840
Lanes it's like yeah you'll do it when

153
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,560
the cars are going on the freeway and

154
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,679
you'll go in and out of them but they're

155
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,478
basically stopped and you never know

156
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,319
when somebody's just got to get over at

157
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:25,959
that last second and if they do it's

158
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:27,639
it's lights out so yeah it's kind of but

159
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:28,719
it's kind of what I look at it it's it's

160
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:30,400
kind of what you sign up for when you

161
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,319
get on a motorcycle you get on a

162
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,279
motorcycle and you're riding this little

163
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:36,919
machine with a big motor between your

164
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:38,279
legs people can't see you they're one

165
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:40,240
not looking for you at all because

166
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:41,679
they're barely paying attention either

167
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,120
they're on their phone adjusting the

168
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,038
radio they're doing something they're

169
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,600
not paying or they could have had a bad

170
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:48,639
day and they don't even care they're not

171
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,879
even paying attention so like right well

172
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,680
there's so many people that don't pay

173
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:53,800
attention yeah you know what I mean so

174
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,000
like if you get on two wheels you got to

175
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,439
know what you're signing up for it's

176
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,959
like joining the military man if you

177
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:00,439
join the military you literally sign a

178
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,959
piece of paper that says I might not

179
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:04,639
make it back home you know what I mean

180
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:05,839
so it's kind of like something it comes

181
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,000
with you know the way I look at it

182
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:08,598
though I could have a heart attack right

183
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,639
now and die or get hit by a bus or

184
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:12,719
something you know who knows people die

185
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,478
from cancer every day and that sucks you

186
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,319
know so it's just however you're

187
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:18,000
supposed to go out tell and cancer

188
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,160
happen every day every day you know so

189
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,879
it's kind of just like and if it's not

190
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,880
on your bike it could be in a car could

191
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:25,000
be an airplane you know I could I do uh

192
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:27,360
so I do uh underground construction for

193
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,680
work right and uh when you get to we dig

194
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,080
those big holes out and if you're down

195
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,918
there like 8 ft the balls would fallen

196
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:33,359
and kill you you know so it's just like

197
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:35,079
you could die I could die at work every

198
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,639
day so what's the difference you know I

199
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:37,839
hate to say things like that cuz people

200
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,360
like oh he doesn't care about his life

201
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:42,839
it's like it's not that I just love to

202
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,960
enjoy my life while I still have one you

203
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:45,719

204
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:46,918

207
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:52,960

208
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:54,360

hyped up on it because I have another

227
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,120
video of me jumping off somebody's roof

228
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,360

238

double takes and then you're checking

239
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,560

00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:26,759
thing with messages I just there's so

252

bigger folling than I do but it's like I

254
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:33,278

everybody yeah there's like a there's

256
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:36,399
just like cuz they separate it now into

257
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:38,319
like two different folders I'm sure you

258
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,719
have that too right so like if I go

259
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,919
through the request folder it's just

260
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,920
nonstop and it's like every like 30

261
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:46,159
seconds 45 seconds it's just refresh

262
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:47,278
there someone saying hey and then

263
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:49,439
there's someone reaching out like they

264
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:51,480
know you and you get a little mix of all

265
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,200
of it you so it's kind of like it

266
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,959
doesn't suck like I hate to say that cuz

267
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,360
I sound like a like kind of an [Â __Â ]

268
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:58,359
no it doesn't suck it doesn't suck it

269
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,839
doesn't suck but it's like a it's a

270
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:03,159
second job that one I didn't want and

271
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:04,399
two now it's like if I don't sit there

272
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:05,919
because I don't have anybody for this

273
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,679
stuff right so I personally got to do it

274
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:09,599
so I'll go to work all day come home and

275
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:11,278
I'll have to sit there and just scroll

276
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,639
on my phone because what I've learned is

277
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:15,759
if I don't check a lot of those messages

278
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:17,120

293

goodbye fall off yeah 15 seconds of Fame

299
00:09:55,639 --> 00:10:01,559
15 seconds of Fame right and it's

300
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:04,838
like I don't think I actually like got

301
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:07,039
excited until

302
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:08,920
uh the million the million follower

303
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:11,599
thing was cool I got excited for that I

304
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:14,199
had a little party for that but when I

305
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,079
really got the most excited was probably

306
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,560
about a month ago is when I really

307
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:19,759
actually felt like I made it somewhere

308
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:21,919
is when Jerry Rice added me on Instagram

309
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:23,360
I was like you know what Dad I might

310
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:25,759
have made

311
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,560
iter I was like Jerry Rice man come on

312
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:29,679
I'm a Raider fan I still love Jerry Rice

313
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:30,919
I was like tot God man I was like I told

314
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:33,159
my dad and he was that's like the

315
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:34,838
happiest I've ever seen him I was like I

316
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:37,278
made it that's when I was like I'm doing

317
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:39,360
something you know so it's fun well and

318
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:41,559
I think a lot of people don't understand

319
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,600
what kind of doors it opens up when you

320
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:46,479
start getting over a 100,000 followers

321
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,360
right potential and then once you get to

322
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,920
a million you you're in a whole another

323
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,079
category right and then you're at 1.7

324
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:55,159
right now and it's like so the potential

325
00:10:53,078 --> 00:10:57,838
for sponsorship and endorsements and

326
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:59,439
people that want to put their brand and

327
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,399
Associate it with you because the

328
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,519
potential for advertisement oh it's

329
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:05,480
that's 100% it's the advertisement game

330
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,919
on Instagram I've realized that it's

331
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,360
it's good and bad because there's a lot

332
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:10,439
of people that kind of just want to use

333
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,000
you basically then there's a lot of

334
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,279
people that actually do care about you

335
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,839
and want to see you do good things and

336
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:19,399
it's hard to kind of separate those

337
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,920
people in a way but I've kind of I've

338
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:22,519
found out a good way to do it and I've

339
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:25,439
I've kind of locked in with a couple

340
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:27,159
people that I really started like

341
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,959
getting good with and it's been working

342
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:31,958
for me so that's good I like it

343
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:34,039
yeah Instagram is a trip and then you

344
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:36,159
know it's like understanding these

345
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:38,078
things and how the algorithm works it's

346
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:39,919
like it's it's not straight forward at

347
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:41,599
all you know cuz like I've seen some of

348
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:44,199
the most amazing videos of yours that

349
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,159
don't get the views right and then some

350
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,519
of the other ones that just go crazy and

351
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:49,519
sometimes it's the music sometimes it's

352
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,278
the timing I've learned a lot it's the

353
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,360
music it's whatever song is kind of like

354
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:56,439
doing well but then at the same time

355
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:59,278
I've like posted songs from like the

356
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,880
'90s that were bangers back then yeah

357
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:02,639
nobody listens to anymore and then like

358
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:03,679
that one will do well I'm like hm cuz

359
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,879
like I

360
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:08,559
posted on what's today Friday I posted

361
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:09,879
Wednesday There's this song that's like

362
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:11,679
I forgot the name of the song but it's

363
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:15,240
like super popular it's got 8 million

364
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:17,759

365
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,120
Tuesday that's like kind of like a newer

366
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:21,159
song but it's not getting that much

367
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,480
attention it's got like 300,000 views

368
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:25,639
I'm like how'd you go from 300,000 to 8

369
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,199
million you know what I mean I was like

370
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:28,919
the algorithm on Instagram is hard to

371
00:12:27,198 --> 00:12:30,759
work with it's wild yeah it's wild it's

372
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:34,000
very unpredictable and there's so many

373
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:36,000
pieces and components to it um do you

374
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,799
tag the artist too like what you do yeah

375
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,799
I

376
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:43,078
so I've yeah I tag the artists mostly

377
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:46,599
sometimes I'll collaborate with them but

378
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:50,000
I do like a lot of paid promotion videos

379
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:52,600
too so on those ones I'd have to tag the

380
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,240
artist kind of kind of have to but I try

381
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,199

that's the way I look at there's just

419
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:09,919
especially in 2024 where everyone

420

basically makes music these days is kind

421
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:14,159
of like there will be something for you

422
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,440
out there you can't just judge it

423

00:16:00,318 --> 00:16:05,159
growing being a kid growing up just just

480
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,360
with social media being like in

481
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:09,600
Instagram thing it's got to be like a

482
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,318
not a rough life but definitely a very

483
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,399
different one than how I grew up without

484
00:16:11,318 --> 00:16:15,479
social media you know it's like a

485
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:18,519
different world for sure how old are you

486
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,920
I'm 30 yeah so I caught the cusp of

487
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:22,959
getting to play outside with all my

488
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:25,278
friends to watching the first like phone

489
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:27,000
you could text on and now it's just

490
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:29,278
iPhones and everything nobody goes out

491
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,120
the house anymore so totally I that

492
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:34,078
perfect little '90s window to 2000s and

493
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,919
yeah it's right with the like invention

494
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:38,919
of the internet when it started becoming

495
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:41,599
popular I remember the whole dial up the

496
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:43,159
whole all of that so it's kind of for me

497
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,879
it was fun but now it's just like

498
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:48,679
thinking back to not getting to witness

499
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:50,240
like just to even care like you don't

500
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:52,559
care like when you were that young not

501
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,000
even like these young kids now they care

502
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:56,000
about social media like they all want to

503
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,078
be an influencer but when I was young I

504
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
just wanted to go outside and play

505
00:16:57,078 --> 00:17:00,719
baseball like you know it's like you

506
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,360
don't get that no more so I'm just like

507
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,519
it's a weird these kids have it

508
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,679
different these days not worse it's not

509
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:09,199
that it's a bad thing it's just a

510
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,480
different thing and it's you got the

511
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,519
Jake Paul's you know these Jake Paul

512
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:16,679
guys that are out there and you know

513
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:19,240
believe it or not I I mean I respect

514
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:21,559
what he's done to a degree he's

515
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,078
monetized it right definely no matter

516
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:25,199
how much you hate on him or think he's

517
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:26,759
an idiot or whatever the dude monetized

518
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,200
it and made millions and millions and

519
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:31,000
millions of dollars boxing and setting

520
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,519
up whether you think it's fixed or it's

521
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,160
real I mean I don't even care but the

522
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:37,960
fact is is like freaking he maneuvered

523
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,120
in a way that he was able to monetize it

524
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,720
and I can respect that side of it he

525
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:44,879
created his entire own lane you know so

526
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,440
it's what you got to do these days if

527
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,760
you want to make it I guess yeah I mean

528
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,600
I think like thinking outside the box

529
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:51,798
and Paving yeah go going through and

530
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:53,719
doing something a little bit differently

531
00:17:51,798 --> 00:17:56,240
whether it's you know shaking a male

532
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:59,960
plan I'm in the Cannabis space to lane

533
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:02,079
splitting to you know rigging fights and

534
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,440
but if like it's it's especially with

535
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:05,960
the Jake Paul thing people want to see

536
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,400
him get beat up so bad they want so

537
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,960
that's why they keep they hate him and

538
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,720
then they watch it you know they gotta

539
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,000
watch it and him and Tyson it's it's

540
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,519
really interesting because you know it's

541
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,519
like him fighting Tyson it's like CU

542
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:18,519
Tyson that's that's my hero that's my

543
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:20,400
that's the guy who I grew up with you

544
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:22,079
know and it's like Tyson's such a beast

545
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,880
and he's such a nice guy I've met him a

546
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,240
handful of times just really genuine and

547
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,440
when I think of the greatest fighters of

548
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,599
all time especially in my lifetime oh

549
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,200
definitely think Mike Tyson he was the

550
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:35,240
scariest you know it's like I was like

551
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,558
man I like Jake Paul looks like a good

552
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,599
fighter he's a big dude like even if the

553
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:41,399
fights are rigged I still wouldn't want

554
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:44,119
to get hit in the face by Mike Tyson

555
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:47,038
would want get no like that that right

556
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:48,599
hook there man I just ah no and in the

557
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:50,519
real world it's like those punches from

558
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:52,879
Mike Tyson he's dangerous yeah and his

559
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:54,639
head movement I mean he he's a different

people can do that though right it's

577
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:29,879
like they don't take life so damn

578
00:19:27,558 --> 00:19:31,558
serious it's just like relax a little

579
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,039
bit sometimes we all just need to take a

580
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:34,599
step back and relax a little just relax

581
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:37,440
that's all it is man I tell people that

582
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:38,879
every day just got to chill yeah so

583
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,360
let's talk about weed for a little bit

584
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,360
you used to smoke I used to smoke weed I

585
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:45,079
used to smoke a lot of weed and I got in

586
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:47,639
trouble for smoking a lot of weed by my

587
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:50,079
mom but then then I had to quit and I

588
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:53,080
started again but can't now because I

589
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:54,439
have a class A so yeah and so that's got

590
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:56,199
to change in California they allow you

591
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,080
to drink with a Class A but like you

592
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,919
can't test positive for cannabis which

593
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:03,240
makes absolutely no sense in my book

594
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:06,000
right cuz I can get off of work right

595
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,519
now and go pound six tall boys yeah and

596
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,640
then go to work tomorrow like nothing

597
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:11,599
happened but totally smoking weed to go

598
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:14,440
to bed because I struggle at sleeping at

599
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:16,519
nighttime is oh my god oh that's a no no

600

take license yeah oh I get take away my

601
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:20,879
license get fired all kinds of stuff so

602
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:22,400
it's like it's just there's got to be

603
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,840
some ground to where they got to fix

604
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:27,840
that it has to change it's legal

605
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:29,279
everywhere the NBA MLB football like you

606
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:31,519
got three of the biggest Sports in our

607
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:33,319
country it's legal in but yeah someone

608
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:36,079
that when you can't bring it across

609
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:37,839
state lines yeah it's really strange you

610
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:40,000
know we're in this strange time where

611
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:42,319
it's not stabilized like across the

612
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,640
board California Market's kind of

613
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:47,519
suffering oh yeah and there's a mix of

614
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,600
lot of mediocre product on the market

615
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:51,119
yeah Instagram is also at fault for that

616
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:53,279
it definitely is that's all I see all

617
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:54,759
day long on there is just different oh

618
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:56,158
you got to have this one oh you got to

619
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:57,519
have this one I'm like dude I don't even

620
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,120
know what those are those probably sound

621
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:01,440
they're probably fake you know it's kind

622
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:03,279
of it's a oversaturated market is

623
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,798
marketing has played such a huge role

624
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:08,038
and so people see it on Instagram like I

625
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:09,158
want that and it looks the best but that

626
00:21:08,038 --> 00:21:10,798
doesn't mean it's the best it doesn't

627
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:12,919
mean it has the best effect it doesn't

628
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:15,119
mean it have the best taste yeah you

629
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:16,679
know and and so and then they're they

630
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:18,639
get hyped up on Brands you know it's

631
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:22,480
like cookies is everywhere I mean

632
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:24,080

633
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,278
especially being from the Bay Area I

634
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:28,119
knew cookies was huge when I saw a

635
00:21:26,278 --> 00:21:30,558
little 5-year-old kid walking around the

636
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:32,479
mall with the cookies t-shirt I'm like

637
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:34,278

638
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,759
really done it they made it yeah for

639
00:21:34,278 --> 00:21:38,519
sure they're big their clothing is huge

640
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:40,599
yeah and that whole that rapper what

641
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:43,359
burner I think it was was like a big

642
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:45,558
Forerunner in rapping about the cookies

643
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:48,000
game and I think that helped a lot too

644
00:21:45,558 --> 00:21:50,639
cuz well his brand revolved around you

645
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,440
know the burner as the cookies brand

646
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,559
he's synonymous with cookies he was one

647
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,798
of the original cookies you know he's

648
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:58,879
the founder of cookies with a handful of

649
00:21:56,798 --> 00:22:01,599
guys yeah so Burn yeah I mean he's the

650
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,400
one who founded cookies with uh a bunch

651
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:06,879
of guys from San Francisco we got

652
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:11,080
shinsky and we got [Â __Â ] and okay we got

653
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:13,080
flux oh no uh yeah I know day yeah we

654
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:14,678
yeah it's wild like these guys did it

655
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:17,439
and and you know they built this brand

656
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:19,798
around it and it wasn't just a cannabis

657
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,320
brand it was a Lifestyle brand yeah

658
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:22,679
right and so that's how you build the

659
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:23,879
best Brands right yeah it's like when

660
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:24,919
you don't pigeon hole yourself we were

661
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,600
kind of talking about it earlier about

662
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:29,080
not pigeon hoing yourself into one thing

663
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:31,599
it's like when you can really open up

664
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:32,798
and you have this platform now and you

665
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:35,918
also have the

666
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:40,440
diversity uh with the consumer it's not

667
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:42,240

822
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,519
second but I got real tired and then

823
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:57,879
fell real hard and I was like I was like

824
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:58,679
oh I can't walk anymore so I was like

825
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,840
yeah

826
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:01,720
yeah especially if you're trying to

827
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:03,398
launch off the Wake oh yeah I got

828
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,519
friends that like are still professional

829
00:28:03,398 --> 00:28:06,918
wakeboarders and I see them pop up on

830
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:10,599
like my Instagram feed and they're like

831
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:11,880
doing double flips like 1080s and stuff

832
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:14,558
I'm like God I remember when you were

833
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,840
like this big now you're just it's it's

834
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:17,079
it's a whole different world now it's

835
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:18,398
like snowboarding if you can't double

836
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:20,839
flip you're just not you're not going to

837
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:22,798
make it you yeah but 10 years ago it

838
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:24,918
wasn't the same oh no 10 years ago it

839
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:26,679
was a whole different story I know cuz I

840
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:28,759
had a wakeboard coach back in the day

841
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:30,640
and he was the pro of his time and you

842
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:32,759
go watch his videos then when he was

843
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:36,159
like one of the best in the world to to

844
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:37,879
now it's like oh this is just wait just

845
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,360
two different eras you know yeah I mean

846
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,760
it just keeps getting more competitive

847
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:42,038
and people keep getting better and

848
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:43,599
better but there's people that kind of

849
00:28:42,038 --> 00:28:46,000
set the bounds for that stuff and so

850
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:47,759
like what you've done is g to it's going

851
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,679
to evolve into something else too I hope

852
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:52,240
so I really hope so I it seems to be

853
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:55,759
going that way but I just I like that I

854
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:59,359
made my mark in my world right like I I

855
00:28:55,759 --> 00:29:01,558
like that I can honestly say that I did

856
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:03,038
something that will like that I'm

857
00:29:01,558 --> 00:29:04,918
pleased with you know what I mean not a

858
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:06,960
lot of people get say oral you know what

859
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:08,799
I mean yeah you made your mark yeah

860
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,640
exactly like and not a lot of people can

861
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:12,839
say that usually people just live their

862
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,320
life and just try to make it you know

863
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:16,199
what I mean or even just struggle with

864
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:17,599
life in general and like I feel like

865
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,080
I've done something to where I could be

866
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:21,839
like you know what like when I'm 80 if I

867
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:24,199
make it to 80 I could look back and be

868
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:26,199
like even if it does nothing for me I'm

869
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,759
like I did something back then like when

870
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,159
I was I could show my grand kid check

871
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:31,720
when I was younger you know but yeah

872
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:35,200
it's kind of well there is some peace

873
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:37,159
and some happiness that goes along with

874
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,960
finding what you were meant to do on

875
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:42,760
this planet this existence like I think

876
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:45,600
a lot of people are still lost even

877
00:29:42,759 --> 00:29:47,519
older people like I feel blessed to know

878
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:49,278
I feel like I know my purpose in life

879
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:52,640
right and

880
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:54,359
and I I contributed to this much bigger

881
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,519
thing we have this existence I

882
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:57,719
contributed in a positive way yeah you

883
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:59,079
know CU I think a lot of people were

884
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,319
like they don't know why they're here or

885
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:02,000
they think we're just I think we're all

886
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:03,599
here for a reason yeah we all are here

887
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,079
to serve a purpose definitely I don't

888
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:07,240
know what that purpose is you know we

889
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:08,599
talk about non-player characters oh yeah

890
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,038
all the time you know and there are a

891
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:11,918
lot of non-player characters out there

892
00:30:10,038 --> 00:30:14,240
but I believe we all have a purpose yeah

893
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,679
me too and that's kind of where I was at

894
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,399
with the the whole bike thing man I just

895
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:20,640
I hope one day it works out to where I

896
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:22,959
could just literally ride my bike every

897
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,000
day for a living that's just that's my

898
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,200
end goal right there if I can do that

899
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,679

900
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,038
personal purpose to put smiles on

not even thinking about nothing you're

938
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:54,079

939
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:56,278
energy and you not you can't really

940
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:58,199
think in those typ really honestly man I

941
00:31:56,278 --> 00:32:00,319

942
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,360
about cuz like I'm really just it's

943

945
00:32:04,278 --> 00:32:11,038
it's literally like the only place in my

946
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:13,359
life to where I can just there's nothing

947
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:15,158
here just finally this just I'm not

948
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:17,558
thinking about work I'm not thinking

949
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:19,120
about any problem I have going on the

950
00:32:17,558 --> 00:32:21,720
moment just living in the moment it's

951
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:23,759
just if you can find that place that's

952
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,798
like that's that's another thing that's

953
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:29,278
hard for people to find is just a space

954
00:32:25,798 --> 00:32:30,720
that where you are just truly like happy

955
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:32,079
you know what I mean and that that's my

956
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,240

963
00:32:48,038 --> 00:32:51,158
that's really fast on bike it was really

964
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,038
fast that was on my old bike but yeah

965
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:54,960
that was that was really fast that bike

966
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:57,359
was no joke that bike was fast but I got

967
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,919
another one and we're going to see if we

968
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:01,798
can make that just as fast we'll see I

969
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,679
gu it's slow right now but it'll it'll

970
00:33:01,798 --> 00:33:06,158
get there it'll get there but it's F I

971
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:08,320
mean I what I cruise at and what I got

972
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,679
get I cruise at about a 100 that's yeah

973
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:12,359
if I'm myund is cruising for me if I'm

974
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:13,960
going anything below that it just feels

975
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:15,319
slow and if you have a good bike it

976
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,480
doesn't feel like you're going to 100 no

977
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:17,599
yeah it really doesn't people like I

978
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,919
can't believe you ride that fast I'm

979
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:21,439
like ride it like I I tell people all

980
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,360
the time ride it check it out you you

981
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,159
once you ride it and you're doing 100

982
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:27,479
you'll feel like you're going like 65

983
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:29,320
it's like you ever done a 100 in like

984
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:31,519
like a big lifted truck you feel like

985
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:33,678
you're flying and you go do 100 and like

986
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,480
a beamer and you're like oh I'm doing

987
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:38,159
100 you know it's kind of like 100 in

988
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:40,440
the rain yeah okay you know it's it

989
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:42,399
doesn't even feel bad like a Mercedes or

990
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,880
a BMW you feel you don't even know it

991
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:46,079
you know but yeah you have some sort of

992
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:48,039
lifted truck and you're going 80

993
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:49,599
sometimes you feel like you're flying

994
00:33:48,038 --> 00:33:51,519
know or you drive a car from the 80s

995
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:54,480
like I had a Subaru and we got that over

996
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:56,720
100 that it just shakes Shing rattling

997
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,399
yeah it's just you get a nice bike and

998
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,038
you won't that's why you get a sport

999
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:03,278
bike with a stabilizer on it and that

1000
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:04,960
thing is as smooth as butter 200 mph on

1001
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:06,759
those things and it don't it don't feel

1002
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,840
like it you know wild it's wild those

1003
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:09,320
things are fast that's why I'm not

1004
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:11,519
allowed to have one everybody tells me

1005
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,559
so like you definitely can't have one of

1006
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:15,039
those you're going to kill yourself on

1007
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:18,398
that seriously yeah so on a bike that's

1008
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:21,440
so fast yeah those things I know some

1009
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:22,918
people on those things that go just I

1010
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,720
think it's too fast and that's saying

1011
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:26,358
something if I think it's too fast but

1012
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:28,838
it's they're wild wild I got a friend

1013
00:34:26,358 --> 00:34:32,119
who has a Ferrari and and he goes like

1014

1018
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:44,639
laughing a little bit in the M you know

1019
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:47,599
having a great time wild uhhuh uh-huh uh

1020
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:49,440
yeah so what's your uh biggest video

1021
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,440
you've had I think you're up over 20

1022
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,358
million views on some my biggest video

1023
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,398
got deleted by Instagram because they

1024
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:58,199
delete my stuff all the time but never

1025
00:34:55,398 --> 00:34:59,639
notify me about it and I know why it

1026
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:02,399
happens all the time like I don't know

1027
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:05,039
if it's cuz if they're having trouble

1028
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,240
with the song like they're however they

1029
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:08,759
work it out the licing yeah that's what

1030
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:11,799
I'm thinking right it might be they

1031
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:14,160
might have to pay the artist per view

1032
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:16,720
liing 20 million and we got to pay 50

1033
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:18,559
cents whatever it is yeah so it was a

1034
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:20,799
song by Jack harlo I can't remember the

1035
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:23,920
song but it had before it got deleted

1036
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:26,599
had 49 million views which is a lot like

1037
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,480
that's pretty crazy but I think the next

1038
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:30,320
highest I got

1039
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,280
I think there there there's a lot in

1040
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:36,000
like the I think the 30 Millions I think

1041
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:38,359
I got one that's 35 million uh 20

1042
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,440
millions they got a bunch in there it's

1043
00:35:38,358 --> 00:35:43,319
just for a minute like the views of that

1044
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,079
they haven't slowed down they just

1045
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:48,240
slowed down to where it's not all

1046
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,519
hitting at one time right CU there was a

1047
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:52,199
point to where every any no any video I

1048
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:54,000

1049
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:56,000
getting 2 million views within two days

1050
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,440
it was just kind of like I could promise

1051
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,440
you promotion if you million views here

1052
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,480
let me just post anything and it's

1053
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,838
sitting a million views right CU it

1054
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,440
tells you on Instagram

1055
00:36:04,838 --> 00:36:09,920
um like how many people you've reached

1056
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,838
in the last month it was consistently

1057
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:15,720
stuck at like 109 million it was it's

1058
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:18,318
insane right it's insane to me that hit

1059
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:20,559
109 million and I only got 1.7 million

1060
00:36:18,318 --> 00:36:23,480
followers right but yeah when mine was

1061
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:25,000
his Peak I was at 5 million yeah my

1062
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,599
Instagram I was reaching 5 million a

1063
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,119
month and I see some of these guys that

1064
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:30,880
have 10 or 15 or 20 I follow some

1065
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:33,000
Jiu-Jitsu guys that they have they have

1066
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,800
really big followings and it's pretty

1067
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,519
wild but yeah 100 million in a month

1068
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,880
that's so it was like that consistently

1069
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:42,039
for like five months like it was like it

1070
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:44,920
never went down like everything on my

1071
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:46,318
Instagram was broken like the like the

1072
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:48,159
like where it shows you where people

1073
00:36:46,318 --> 00:36:50,960
like it broke it was broken it it

1074
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:53,480
wouldn't work like when it shows like um

1075
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,440
what's it called it's like like a it's

1076
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,920
like professional request or something

1077
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,400
like that wouldn't even pop up with

1078
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,760
anything like

1079
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,760
my uh the like when it show it's funny

1080
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:05,119
too cuz like my girlfriend started or my

1081
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,480
fiance started to break too cuz like her

1082
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,440
following because people started

1083
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,318
following her too she's on private

1084
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:13,358
though so now it's like it's broken at

1085
00:37:10,318 --> 00:37:15,199
like I think it's at like 900 it's like

1086
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:17,000
just broken there but I know it's Wow

1087
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:18,559
way more than it's got I bet she hit

1088
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,159
approved right now she'd probably have

1089
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:24,119
like 30,000 followers easy 100% but it's

1090
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:25,960
it's it's wild it's it was a it was a

1091
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:28,480
culture shock for me cuz like I don't

1092
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:31,079
really before that I never really use

1093
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,960
social media like I kind of I had one to

1094
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:36,200
have one everybody's got one right I had

1095
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,760
Facebook had that yeah and then it's I

1096
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:39,879
would all to my boy man he told me to

1097
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,000
start recording and I did it and I hated

1098
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,599
it and then it worked out so I kept

1099
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,039
doing it right you know what I mean it

1100
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:46,559
was just it didn't really cost me

1101
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:47,880
anything to do it right I do it on my

1102

00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:05,838
know that freeway if anybody's going to

1113
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,880
use a green screen it definitely

1114
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:10,880
wouldn't be that place that's for sure

1115
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:12,838
yeah the 680 definitely not well yeah I

1116
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,240
mean I think a lot of people probably

1117
00:38:12,838 --> 00:38:16,358
think you speed it up but then it's like

1118
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:18,479
how do your lips sink up with the music

1119
00:38:16,358 --> 00:38:20,199
like not it's not possible even my own

1120
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,519
friends are like that's got to be sped

1121
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:22,679
up I'm like what do you mean it's got to

1122
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:24,599
be SP it feels like it when you're

1123
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:26,639
watching well you got to have it must be

1124
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:28,119
the wide angle then I'm like oh okay

1125
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:30,039
come ride with me my buddy from work

1126
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:31,920
he's like all right cool after work one

1127
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:33,599
day we rode I swear he almost died

1128
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,559
trying to keep up with me he's like okay

1129
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:38,800
it's not fake I'm sorry I take it back

1130
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:40,599
like it's it's just it's funny to me

1131
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,318
that when you see people on Instagram

1132
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:45,359
that are not a part of this lifestyle

1133
00:38:43,318 --> 00:38:47,639
yeah they think it's wild it's got to be

1134
00:38:45,358 --> 00:38:49,119
fake nobody would ever do that but then

1135
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:50,679
when I talk to people like from the

1136
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,039
motorcycle world they're like oh yeah I

1137
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:53,239
used to do that all the time or I do

1138
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:55,159
that all the time now and you go and

1139
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:56,239
ride with them they're crazier than I am

1140
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:57,598
you know what I mean they just don't

1141
00:38:56,239 --> 00:39:00,358
record it I'm the only dummy that

1142
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:02,160
started recording it y so it's just it's

1143
00:39:00,358 --> 00:39:03,639
a culture shock for me definitely well

1144
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:05,598
you give people you know they have

1145
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:07,960
enough information to know enough about

1146
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:09,838
it to be dangerous but not to really

1147
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,559
know about it and so they want to assume

1148
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:14,239
that they're an expert on it so many

1149
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:16,159
people are now you know internet experts

1150
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:17,759
God internet experts is the worst let me

1151
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:19,879
tell you like they always like that's so

1152
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,720
illegal you can't do that and then I go

1153
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,160
I send them a screenshot the California

1154
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:25,239
state law that says that the cars have

1155
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:28,239
to get out of my way basically because

1156
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:30,078
it's like we're like I think it's either

1157
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:31,519
us in one other state or it's just us

1158
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:32,720
we're the only one you can Lane split in

1159
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:35,838
so it's like do you know why lane

1160
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:36,598
splitting is legal no you I mean I don't

1161
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:39,318
even

1162
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:41,400
really there's a reason I had no idea

1163
00:39:39,318 --> 00:39:44,719
and uh yeah so the reason is is because

1164
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:47,440
the bikes back in the day would overheat

1165
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:49,838
and so if you had to sit in traffic your

1166
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:52,039
bike would overheat so that's why lane

1167
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:53,199
splitting is legal no well at least my

1168
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:55,279
father my father told me that when I was

1169
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:56,598
a kid I can see it because I have an 03

1170
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,359
now and that thing likes to try to

1171
00:39:56,599 --> 00:39:59,800
overheat all the time because it's like

1172
00:39:58,358 --> 00:40:02,119
if you sit out a light oh those things

1173
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,318
get so hot it's ridiculous I'm I'm

1174
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:05,720
someone in the chat's going to jump in

1175
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:07,279
and explain it perfectly like why the

1176
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:10,078
engine's overheat but yeah back in the

1177
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:12,119
50s and 60s I'm sure I can see that for

1178
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:14,318
sure yeah so yeah it's great though it's

1179
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:15,599
a great law and I like it so yeah CU

1180
00:40:14,318 --> 00:40:17,159
it's like everybody's like oh someone

1181
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,760
needs to open their door on you and like

1182
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:22,480
and they'll go to jail for manslaughter

1183
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:24,280
so yeah it's fine I'm not tripping so so

1184
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,519
uh let's talk about protocols when

1185
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:28,720
you're a when you're a driver in a car

1186
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:31,599
and there's a motorcycle cycle coming in

1187
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:34,598
usually you guys go to the the one over

1188
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:36,280
from the fast lane yes right typically I

1189
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:38,359
would say typically that's where you

1190
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:40,720
should ride right I see a lot of people

1191
00:40:38,358 --> 00:40:44,598
splitting Lanes like in the middle Lan

1192
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:46,959
yeah it's just people I think in

1193
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:48,680
California they're trained right so in

1194
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,559
California if you're splitting in the

1195
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:52,799
fast lane there'll be times when that

1196
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:54,480
right car will get over for you even if

1197
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,920
they don't see you they'll hear you so

1198
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,039
if they hear you and they get over it's

1199
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,680
happened to me while I was trying to get

1200
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:00,480
to exit they heard me but they didn't

1201
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:01,879
see me so they started getting over but

1202
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,679
I was on their right side and I was like

1203
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:06,160
oh and they were like oh I'm sorry you

1204
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:08,000
know but it's kind of like you got to be

1205
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:10,199
try to stay in that far left lane and

1206
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,159
yeah and I mean good etiquette if if you

1207
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:13,838
like bikers good etiquette is to if

1208
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:15,279
you're in the fast lane to like give

1209
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:17,440
them a little bit of room yeah just a

1210
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,160
little bit you know the worst is though

1211
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,760
like for me I don't really care if you

1212
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:23,920
get over or not I'm still going to cuz

1213
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,079
my bike's small right I'm going P you

1214
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,119
regardless right but what bothers me is

1215
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:30,200
the people that have their to Mir out

1216
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:31,640
that aren't towing anything they are

1217
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:33,199
like well but those are the people that

1218
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:34,598
don't even know their tow mirrors right

1219
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:36,519
so that's the other thing is you got

1220
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:38,079
guys that have no idea that those mirors

1221
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:39,318
actually can go in you know they're the

1222
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:41,960
worst too because like when you're

1223
00:41:39,318 --> 00:41:44,559
splitting a lane they're like right here

1224
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:46,240
I got to duck under them every time if

1225
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:48,159
they don't get over yeah I got to go CL

1226
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:50,199
line by that would be the worst they'd

1227
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:52,358
be the worst I'd be right off that bike

1228
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:54,519
but other than that they everybody yeah

1229
00:41:52,358 --> 00:41:56,000
if like when I'm driving if I see a bike

1230
00:41:54,519 --> 00:41:58,559
I I try to get all the way over some

1231
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:02,400
people that ride will tell you don't do

1232
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:04,920
that because uh if the car gets all the

1233
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,440
way over like into the basically where

1234
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:10,480
you pull out it shoots up a lot of

1235
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,920
like and just whatever is over there and

1236
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,480
you can it'll start hitting you all in

1237
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:17,200
the face and stuff so let somebody else

1238
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:19,280
tell you but uh a lot of motorcycles

1239
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:21,039
don't like it I like it if you get over

1240
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,160
cool great if you don't it is what it is

1241
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:25,119
but me personally driving I get I try to

1242
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:26,838
get all the way over but yeah some

1243
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:28,358
people hate it though I see I hear it

1244
00:42:26,838 --> 00:42:30,199
all the time time just just get over a

1245
00:42:28,358 --> 00:42:31,639
little bit I'm like yeah come on man

1246
00:42:30,199 --> 00:42:33,480
they're doing you a favor don't why you

1247
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:34,679
can't have your cake and eat it too you

1248
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,240
know what I mean they already don't want

1249
00:42:34,679 --> 00:42:37,679
to get over they get all the way over

1250
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:40,159
and then you're mad about it so it's

1251
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:41,719
kind of that motorcycle where you think

1252
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:43,440
share the road at the end of the day if

1253
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:45,000
you're a car share the road and be aware

1254
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,880
awareness is just such a huge thing not

1255
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
even just driving but in life just be

1256
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,480
aware everybody's just so on the I just

1257
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,199
split in Lanes I I I watch right and you

1258
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:56,000
just see especially in traffic right

1259
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:58,439
after work it's bumper to bumper It's

1260
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,679
just uh rolling scrolling nobody's

1261
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,679
paying atten so many people just on

1262
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:03,879
their phones yeah all the time which I

1263
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:06,358
I'm guilty too so I can't hate too much

1264
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:08,160
but I try not to I don't go on social

1265
00:43:06,358 --> 00:43:09,838
media when I'm driving yeah definitely

1266
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:11,358
especially not on a freeway you know

1267
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:13,318
what I mean well most cars now if you

1268
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:15,838
have a modern car you know you get the

1269
00:43:13,318 --> 00:43:17,599
messages on your your screen you can

1270
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:19,078
answer the phone from the screen you

1271
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:21,599
know they make these cars can drive

1272
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:23,160
themselves anyway so you know but it's

1273
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,200
the future it's the future that's where

1274
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:25,279
they're all coming to pretty soon

1275
00:43:24,199 --> 00:43:28,039
they're going to make motorcycles that

1276
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:30,920
drive themselves so seriously how shitty

1277
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:33,039
would that be more that's that's the

1278
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,680
worst that's the worst like I got the

1279
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:36,800
motorcycle that self drivve the Tesla

1280
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:38,719
motorcycle self driving oh yeah I heard

1281
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,920
that in a couple years I don't know when

1282
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:42,759
but they're apparently supposed to be

1283
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,639
putting like uh limiters on motorcycles

1284
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:46,319
like the new ones to they're set to like

1285
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:48,719
speed limits as they change so you can't

1286
00:43:46,318 --> 00:43:51,358
go over them I was like silly I was like

1287
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:53,199
it I get it we ride too fast I'm

1288
00:43:51,358 --> 00:43:56,318
personally ride way too fast but it's

1289
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:57,598
like you need that sometimes you need

1290
00:43:56,318 --> 00:43:59,079
that extra little

1291
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:01,200
to get out of there but there's

1292
00:43:59,079 --> 00:44:02,960
consequences right so like I mean there

1293
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:05,239
there are consequences for speeding we

1294
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:08,400
already you go over the speed limit used

1295
00:44:05,239 --> 00:44:09,919
to be 65 now technically it's 70 yeah MH

1296
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,800
I think there's a five mile it's like it

1297
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,838
gives you like a 5 to 10 Mile grace

1298
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:15,800
period type thing on there yeah I mean I

1299
00:44:13,838 --> 00:44:17,599
think they can they will ticket you any

1300
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:20,359
you know they can ticket you anything

1301
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:22,160
above 70 right anything yeah and so you

1302
00:44:20,358 --> 00:44:24,078
know and there's consequences you do it

1303
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:25,480
you get a ticket you pay your ticket

1304
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:27,640
just like you get in a car accident your

1305
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:29,358
insurance goes up yep

1306
00:44:27,639 --> 00:44:31,759
all that stuff your insurance goes up

1307
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:33,880
there's consequences for it so it's on

1308
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:36,960
you I mean reckless driving is another

1309
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:39,200
thing but that's that's all subjective

1310
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,240
to the individual what's really Reckless

1311
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:43,159
can you drive 85 and not be Reckless I

1312
00:44:41,239 --> 00:44:45,479
think so exactly you know but I also

1313
00:44:43,159 --> 00:44:47,399
think you can drive Reckless at 70 miles

1314
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,760
hour true and it's crazy because people

1315
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,760
always tell me I'm reckless driving

1316
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,079
because I don't have my hands on the

1317
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,160
wheel and I'm taking them off and doing

1318
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:55,240
all this stuff there's no law that says

1319
00:44:53,159 --> 00:44:57,639
you are required to have your hands I

1320
00:44:55,239 --> 00:44:59,959
think Reckless on the bars for theor

1321
00:44:57,639 --> 00:45:02,318
it should be controlled you

1322
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:04,039
control yeah exactly there's no are you

1323
00:45:02,318 --> 00:45:06,119
putting people in danger right exactly

1324
00:45:04,039 --> 00:45:07,599
there's nothing that says that I can't

1325
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:09,000
ride with one hand there's nothing that

1326
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:10,800
says you have to have both on there

1327
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,480
there for the car I don't know if that's

1328
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,800
a law or not but I know you take your

1329
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,159
test you supposed to be 10 and two but

1330
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,280
there's nothing that says that for a

1331
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:20,239
motorcycle so it's like totally

1332
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:22,040
everybody thinks they just they know so

1333
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:23,799
I just kind of roll with it these days

1334
00:45:22,039 --> 00:45:25,440
so we're going to look at some weed and

1335
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:27,640

important okay so when we're popping a

1584
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:19,159
bunch of plants and we're looking for

1585
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:22,039
that next winner right I give people

1586
00:55:19,159 --> 00:55:23,318
joints I smoke joints and it's like I

1587
00:55:22,039 --> 00:55:25,039
know what the weed looks like but I want

1588
00:55:23,318 --> 00:55:27,480
to know from you how does it make you

1589
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:29,119
feel yeah and how does it taste yeah

1590
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:30,920
those are the two and how does it burn

1591
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:33,640
is it burning even did we cure it

1592
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:35,599
correctly all that stuff but those are

1593
00:55:33,639 --> 00:55:38,318
things that can be adjusted a little bit

1594
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:41,079
whereas like that nice Ash on there and

1595
00:55:38,318 --> 00:55:42,679
stuff yeah mhm but then the effect can

1596
00:55:41,079 --> 00:55:44,160
come down to what day it was harvested

1597
00:55:42,679 --> 00:55:45,598
on some stuff we might grow at one time

1598
00:55:44,159 --> 00:55:48,118
and we're like oh we need to harvest it

1599
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:49,680
on day 56 and not on day 6 oh so that

1600
00:55:48,119 --> 00:55:51,519
stuff makes like a big difference a huge

1601
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:53,759
difference oh really see I I don't know

1602
00:55:51,519 --> 00:55:55,960
too much about growing it but I I know

1603
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:57,480
from from people I know but I've learned

1604
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:59,440
some things we got some mutual friends

1605
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:01,280
to go yeah you know like I know how but

1606
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:03,119
I just kind of I didn't know like it

1607
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,760
just it's such a science to me like when

1608
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:06,000
I hear people who like really really

1609
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:07,480
really know what they're talking about

1610
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,159
I'm like yeah bro you sound like you

1611
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:11,240
work at the Berkeley lab right now like

1612
00:56:09,159 --> 00:56:14,239
I'm like you know you are like one of

1613
00:56:11,239 --> 00:56:15,838
the smartest people person whatever that

1614
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:17,519
I've ever met when they talk about that

1615
00:56:15,838 --> 00:56:20,119
stuff I'm like it's literally a science

1616
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:22,000
like you guys got it down well day 53 if

1617
00:56:20,119 --> 00:56:26,400
you wanted more candy for like Skittles

1618
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:28,318
you harvest the day 52 to day 54

1619
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,119
want something that's more gassy and

1620
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:32,519
stronger like stronger effect wise you

1621
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:33,720
can go to day 60 63 it might yield a

1622
00:56:32,519 --> 00:56:36,079
little bit more but then you lose the

1623
00:56:33,719 --> 00:56:37,838
candy and there's all kinds of little

1624
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:40,039
things you learn how to grow that one

1625
00:56:37,838 --> 00:56:41,599
specific plant got and sometimes you

1626
00:56:40,039 --> 00:56:43,599
learn right away and other times there's

1627
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:44,920
a learning curve some stuff like blue

1628
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:46,920
dream is the easiest thing in the world

1629
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:49,440
to grow oh yeah that stuff was

1630
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:52,440
everywhere for a long time it's easy to

1631
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:54,599
grow but also you can get better better

1632
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:56,960
and better by improving really like I

1633
00:56:54,599 --> 00:56:58,880
think making small adjustments over time

1634
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:00,519
if you grow it over and over you can you

1635
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:02,838
can grow it better than you did the the

1636
00:57:00,519 --> 00:57:04,838
previous run yeah most stuff is like

1637
00:57:02,838 --> 00:57:06,199
that I think like lane splitting in the

1638
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:08,318
beginning like the first time you do it

1639
00:57:06,199 --> 00:57:10,318
compared to as you learn how to do it it

1640
00:57:08,318 --> 00:57:11,920
was crazy about the the which is right

1641
00:57:10,318 --> 00:57:14,400
because when I first got my

1642
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:15,880
motorcycle I wouldn't say I was scared

1643
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,639
to go on the freeway because I've had

1644
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:19,798
motorcycles and been on the freeway a

1645
00:57:17,639 --> 00:57:22,038
lot just it was brand new and I was kind

1646
00:57:19,798 --> 00:57:24,358
of just so nervous and then kind of just

1647
00:57:22,039 --> 00:57:25,920
over time you just you learn like with

1648
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:28,400
say with the one strand right you kind

1649
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:29,838
of perfect That One Thing Once I I rode

1650
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,519
this bike every day so I kind of just

1651
00:57:29,838 --> 00:57:33,400
became one with it I just figured it out

1652
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:34,960
you know kind of just and now just

1653
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:36,838
that's why it's so good I guess you know

1654
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:38,720
you just you figure it out so I guess I

1655
00:57:36,838 --> 00:57:40,038
guess it's the same thing cuz you I

1656
00:57:38,719 --> 00:57:41,838
didn't know there was so much into it

1657
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:44,359
like that though just from day to day it

1658
00:57:41,838 --> 00:57:46,639
can change oh yeah you have too much

1659
00:57:44,358 --> 00:57:48,598
humidity for part of your cycle or like

1660
00:57:46,639 --> 00:57:51,078
a small part of it or too much heat from

1661
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:53,359
the summer your water temps get too hot

1662
00:57:51,079 --> 00:57:54,760
or too cold really see I heard that

1663
00:57:53,358 --> 00:57:57,159
earlier today something about the like

1664
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:58,680
the higher water temps I definely had no

1665
00:57:57,159 --> 00:58:00,960
idea about that you have a mutual friend

1666
00:57:58,679 --> 00:58:02,759
that's been having problems for years

1667
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:05,280
and it's because his water temps are too

1668
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:07,119
warm and that can cause problems see and

1669
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,839
it's just the like I guess it's the

1670
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:10,720
little things right trial and well and

1671
00:58:08,838 --> 00:58:12,639
it's it's understanding and awareness

1672
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:14,199
right of of what's going on because

1673
00:58:12,639 --> 00:58:16,199
there's all these little details and the

1674
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:18,439
better you understand them the better

1675
00:58:16,199 --> 00:58:20,159
results you can get yeah yeah yeah yeah

1676
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:22,400
which is crazy I just learned not too

1677
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:23,838
long ago cuz like cloning is a thing now

1678
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:26,798
that was not a thing when I was growing

1679
00:58:23,838 --> 00:58:28,599
up like that's a thing I'm so dumb I

1680
00:58:26,798 --> 00:58:31,119
didn't know you could do that with all

1681
00:58:28,599 --> 00:58:32,559
plants like you do all plants but most

1682
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:34,160
you could do like an orange tree and

1683
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:36,039
stuff like that you know what I mean

1684
00:58:34,159 --> 00:58:37,480
like a lime tree clone I didn't know

1685
00:58:36,039 --> 00:58:39,400
it's this like the same process

1686
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:40,880
basically Mikey likes to clone all kinds

1687
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:43,119
of stuff that's who I learned most of my

1688
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,880
knowledge from shout out Mikey cuz you

1689
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:46,720
know he teaches me a lot but yeah yeah

1690
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,480
yeah so if we were to put all these

1691
00:58:46,719 --> 00:58:49,159
things in order from the ones that you

1692
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,159
just

1693
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:53,399
smelled you didn't get to taste them

1694
00:58:51,159 --> 00:58:56,598
unfortunately un you get to look at them

1695
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:59,119
and smell them uh what would be your top

1696
00:58:56,599 --> 00:59:01,280
three so my my favorite would be that

1697
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:03,119
sour you showed me down there but I

1698
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:06,280
would say the one in the tin can that

1699
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:08,640
thing smelled amazing that is something

1700
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:11,720
I'd want to try the the Kush face is one

1701
00:59:08,639 --> 00:59:13,879
I'd want to try that one's cool I don't

1702
00:59:11,719 --> 00:59:15,679
know if that one would be my favorite

1703
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:18,440
but uh the the one of the first one in

1704
00:59:15,679 --> 00:59:22,480
the purple bag that one would be I would

1705
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:25,639
put the per probably if I had to if

1706
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:27,679
see I would put the one that was dark

1707
00:59:25,639 --> 00:59:29,318
purple up there just cuz I'd want to try

1708
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:31,719
it just cuz purple some of my favorite

1709
00:59:29,318 --> 00:59:33,599
right but I don't really know if

1710
00:59:31,719 --> 00:59:37,038
personally it would

1711
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:38,720
be like right the in like in my top

1712
00:59:37,039 --> 00:59:40,640
three right but it would be something

1713
00:59:38,719 --> 00:59:42,078
I'd definitely like put up there because

1714
00:59:40,639 --> 00:59:43,879
I feel like I'd want it you know what I

1715
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:46,519
mean but yeah

1716
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:47,960
definitely I think uh the one in the 10

1717
00:59:46,519 --> 00:59:51,038
had would have probably been my favorite

1718
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:52,960
if I got to try it than that yeah that's

1719
00:59:51,039 --> 00:59:54,920
good stuff and hit you right in the nose

1720
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:56,240
man ites and it hits you right in the

1721
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:58,440
nose kind of like it hits you in the

1722
00:59:56,239 --> 01:00:00,879
head it's so there's like some that are

1723
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:02,440
narcotic and and tight behind the eyes

1724
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:04,599
and make you hungry and then there's

1725
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:07,318
stuff like that where it's that stuff is

1726
01:00:04,599 --> 01:00:09,559
a stimulant uhhuh and so I I got another

1727
01:00:07,318 --> 01:00:11,440
one to show you yeah see I was a big

1728
01:00:09,559 --> 01:00:13,319
like head high person too like the ones

1729
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:15,559
that give you like the body type high

1730
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:18,239
like I was not that would that would

1731
01:00:15,559 --> 01:00:20,400
just make me so lazy and tired and stuff

1732
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:23,959
like that and I just so this kind of has

1733
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:27,039
that same lime to it it's a haze it has

1734
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:28,960
that trolene nose smells like turpentine

1735
01:00:27,039 --> 01:00:30,920
a little bit yeah yeah yeah yeah smells

1736
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:32,480
good and so it's it's hazy it doesn't

1737
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:35,280
look the most beautiful but that is some

1738
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:38,240
organic it's grown in medino oh really

1739
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:42,400
yep it feels way more kind of like

1740
01:00:38,239 --> 01:00:44,118
organico yeah Dave Dave from butero it's

1741
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:45,599
definitely like more fluffy like not as

1742
01:00:44,119 --> 01:00:48,200
dense definitely a little bit more

1743
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:49,798
fluffy it's kind of like the effect yeah

1744
01:00:48,199 --> 01:00:51,719
and see like it's it's weird to me

1745
01:00:49,798 --> 01:00:53,838
because like everybody kind of like that

1746
01:00:51,719 --> 01:00:56,598
I know personally now that smoke it's

1747
01:00:53,838 --> 01:00:58,920
like they want like super dense we super

1748
01:00:56,599 --> 01:01:00,559
like it's got to be like frosted over

1749
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:02,000
and stuff like that and then I see stuff

1750
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:03,680
like this I'm like man that's probably

1751
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,079
fire like you guys are sleeping on it

1752
01:01:03,679 --> 01:01:07,318
like you don't when it smells like that

1753
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:08,920
you know what I mean if it smells like

1754
01:01:07,318 --> 01:01:11,079
gelato and it looks like that we got a

1755
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:12,960
problem right yeah yeah yeah yeah see

1756
01:01:11,079 --> 01:01:14,480
when it's like yeah that's that would be

1757
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,000
up in probably my top three right there

1758
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:18,679
see that's the type of stuff I used to

1759
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,519
like right and I kind of I don't know

1760
01:01:18,679 --> 01:01:22,598
like the whole weed game to me is like a

1761
01:01:20,519 --> 01:01:24,559
it's a new it's it's changed drastically

1762
01:01:22,599 --> 01:01:27,079
from when I stopped smoking right it's

1763
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:29,400
like it seemed like it was overnight

1764
01:01:27,079 --> 01:01:31,880
it's like there's everybody's got a new

1765
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:33,400
thing that's kind of came out but it's

1766
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:34,960
to me it kind of seems like the same

1767
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:36,599
thing as the last thing it's just kind

1768
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:39,039
of got a little bit different Twist on

1769
01:01:36,599 --> 01:01:40,640
it it's kind of like you know then when

1770
01:01:39,039 --> 01:01:41,880
I see stuff like that I'm like see

1771
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:43,400
that's what I'm talk that's that's what

1772
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:44,720
I need that's what I'm talking about

1773
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:47,119
sometimes people don't even know what

1774
01:01:44,719 --> 01:01:48,318
they want till you show it to them and

1775
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:49,640
they think they know what they want in

1776
01:01:48,318 --> 01:01:50,960
their head and then they get to

1777
01:01:49,639 --> 01:01:53,639
experience it and they're like oh this

1778
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:54,760
is cool or oh I don't like that

1779
01:01:53,639 --> 01:01:56,598
sometimes it can go either way it's so

1780
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:58,319
subjective to the individual yeah some

1781
01:01:56,599 --> 01:01:59,880
people like stimulants and some people

1782
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:01,639
like it's like some people like alcohol

1783
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:03,920
and some people like

1784
01:02:01,639 --> 01:02:06,639
cocaine we can be all over that you can

1785
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:09,440
have the the narcotic alcohol effect

1786
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:11,038
where it like makes you tired or you can

1787
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:13,240
have the uplifting one where you're like

1788
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:15,160
I'm ready to rock way to go party yeah

1789
01:02:13,239 --> 01:02:17,439
straight up that's the beauty

1790
01:02:15,159 --> 01:02:18,960
of It kind of just feels like that's

1791
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:20,639
what I learned too is like you got to

1792
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:23,318
find what works for you definitely you

1793
01:02:20,639 --> 01:02:25,358
got to do a lot of trying to figure out

1794
01:02:23,318 --> 01:02:28,480
you can't just and that's what I don't

1795
01:02:25,358 --> 01:02:30,558
get with some people just I would say

1796
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:32,000
here but probably all over is like they

1797
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:33,680
think it's so bad because they've tried

1798
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,798
it one time and it made them all

1799
01:02:33,679 --> 01:02:37,519
paranoid and they started freaking out

1800
01:02:35,798 --> 01:02:39,440
or something it's like maybe you just

1801
01:02:37,519 --> 01:02:40,920
need to try a different strand or you

1802
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:43,159
didn't smoke with James you know what

1803
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:45,440
I'm saying like come on now you smoke

1804
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:47,639
with James you you would have been just

1805
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:49,200
fine yeah and I think there's a lot of

1806
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:50,639
Truth to that that somebody eats a bunch

1807
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:53,078
of Edibles and so they're like oh weed

1808
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:54,480
is bad you had a really bad trip right

1809
01:02:53,079 --> 01:02:57,278
yeah you ate five Edibles and they all

1810
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:59,719
hit you at one time 4 Hour one edible

1811
01:02:57,278 --> 01:03:02,880
that was equivalent to 10 yeah I've been

1812
01:02:59,719 --> 01:03:04,959
there and paranoid so when you eat the

1813
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:06,559
two and wait like 45 minutes it doesn't

1814
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:08,000
hit you so you eat two more then all of

1815
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:09,798
a sudden you can't get off the couch

1816
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,519
yeah been there lots of times you're

1817
01:03:09,798 --> 01:03:12,400
done for like eight hours 10 hours and

1818
01:03:11,519 --> 01:03:15,559
you're like I need to go get in the

1819
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:16,838
shower try to so up oh drink milk it's

1820
01:03:15,559 --> 01:03:18,519
like there's a certain point where

1821
01:03:16,838 --> 01:03:20,199
there's not much you can do just you

1822
01:03:18,519 --> 01:03:22,358
just got to ride it out yeah that's yeah

1823
01:03:20,199 --> 01:03:24,519
and not call the cops not call the cops

1824
01:03:22,358 --> 01:03:27,078
on yourself I'm going to die you're not

1825
01:03:24,519 --> 01:03:29,239
going die you're be f I promise I think

1826
01:03:27,079 --> 01:03:31,119
I'm dying I think I'm dying yeah I mean

1827
01:03:29,239 --> 01:03:34,118
there's people that do that there was a

1828
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:36,480
cop in valo speaking of which that stole

1829
01:03:34,119 --> 01:03:38,599
evidence from the evidence locker and

1830
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:40,599
him and his wife ended up eating the

1831
01:03:38,599 --> 01:03:43,240
Edibles and they called the cops on

1832
01:03:40,599 --> 01:03:45,039
themselves they called 911 on themselves

1833
01:03:43,239 --> 01:03:48,239
uh we'll have to post the news article

1834
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:50,599
up from from years ago so shitty but but

1835
01:03:48,239 --> 01:03:52,639
uh cannabis is it's a powerful drug it

1836
01:03:50,599 --> 01:03:54,400
is it can be mild but it can also be

1837
01:03:52,639 --> 01:03:56,558
extremely powerful in large quantities

1838
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:58,318
definitely I personally think it cancer

1839
01:03:56,559 --> 01:04:01,400
because I've seen people with cancer and

1840
01:03:58,318 --> 01:04:03,639
they'll start like never smoked cannabis

1841
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:05,000
day in their life they used to hate it

1842
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:07,278
and then they started doing it and I

1843
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,639
swear like they start eating again and

1844
01:04:07,278 --> 01:04:10,599
they just seem like a whole another

1845
01:04:08,639 --> 01:04:12,159
person and like one the person I know

1846
01:04:10,599 --> 01:04:13,838
ended up beating cancer I was like Small

1847
01:04:12,159 --> 01:04:16,000
Miracles I was like see man you just

1848
01:04:13,838 --> 01:04:18,318
need to not even that it cures it but it

1849
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,760
just makes you to relax so you don't

1850
01:04:18,318 --> 01:04:22,400
have that

1851
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:25,278
stress we have studies that shown that

1852
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:28,880
cannabis can cure cancer it's not the

1853
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:31,239
end off be solution but but it can I

1854
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:33,480
mean certain types of cancer yeah skin

1855
01:04:31,239 --> 01:04:34,838
cancer definitely Rick Simpson Oil I

1856
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:36,318
mean there there's all kind kinds of

1857
01:04:34,838 --> 01:04:38,278
things that they've shown that it's

1858
01:04:36,318 --> 01:04:39,480
worked for you know certain instances

1859
01:04:38,278 --> 01:04:41,480
like I just don't think it's going to

1860
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:42,920
make it any worse like I just don't you

1861
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:44,240
know makes the world a better place you

1862
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:46,000
know what I mean like come on man Snoop

1863
01:04:44,239 --> 01:04:48,159
Dogg's been smoking for how long now and

1864
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,838
he's perfectly fine like it's like he's

1865
01:04:48,159 --> 01:04:51,078
one of the most sucessful thep you know

1866
01:04:49,838 --> 01:04:53,038
what I mean like he's one of the most

1867
01:04:51,079 --> 01:04:55,160
successful people in this world it's

1868
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:57,278
like it obviously can't be that bad and

1869
01:04:55,159 --> 01:04:58,759
that's why like these laws got to change

1870
01:04:57,278 --> 01:05:01,119
they have to it's yeah we need to stop

1871
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:02,760
putting people in prison yeah just for

1872
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:04,640
yeah come on there's it's just there's

so many more people out there doing way

1874
01:05:04,639 --> 01:05:08,879
worse things that this is probably not

1875
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:11,039
the the thing you should be worried

1876
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:12,358

01:05:56,079 --> 01:06:02,519
wild right I I never thought it would be

1897
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:04,720
that wild like I just but I was watching

1898
01:06:02,519 --> 01:06:07,159
it back and I'm like I really did just

1899
01:06:04,719 --> 01:06:10,239
turn almost completely sideways with one

1900
01:06:07,159 --> 01:06:11,960
hand just kind of not in the world like

1901
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:14,358
smashing I was going like 95 in that

1902
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:16,519
video like and it's just like I don't

1903
01:06:14,358 --> 01:06:18,598
realize it like I I I watched them all

1904
01:06:16,519 --> 01:06:20,440
like I just don't really guess I never

1905
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:21,960
like realized it until today or

1906
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:24,920
yesterday or whatever but I was just

1907
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:26,798
like it is a little wild it is wild so I

1908
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:28,079
got a few years on you and I've been

1909
01:06:26,798 --> 01:06:31,199
thinking about this question a lot and

1910
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:33,839
it's one thing I ask all my guests but

1911
01:06:31,199 --> 01:06:35,879
if you were able to meet your younger s

1912
01:06:33,838 --> 01:06:38,119
and give them one piece of

1913
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:41,720
advice what would that piece of advice

1914
01:06:38,119 --> 01:06:43,318
be stay in school seriously I didn't not

1915
01:06:41,719 --> 01:06:45,719
stay in school like I graduated high

1916
01:06:43,318 --> 01:06:47,880
school but go to college definitely like

1917
01:06:45,719 --> 01:06:51,000
I know I have a really good job now but

1918
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:52,640
it's I don't I I love my job don't get

1919
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,559
me wrong but like I work instruction I

1920
01:06:52,639 --> 01:06:57,278
work manual labor right so like it's

1921
01:06:54,559 --> 01:07:00,278
rough on my body and like I really like

1922
01:06:57,278 --> 01:07:03,838
it but I know when I'm like

1923
01:07:00,278 --> 01:07:06,199
6570 it's going to be rough for me right

1924
01:07:03,838 --> 01:07:09,519
so it's like I wish I could tell myself

1925
01:07:06,199 --> 01:07:11,278
to just still have fun don't like don't

1926
01:07:09,519 --> 01:07:13,559
do as many dumb things as I did but

1927
01:07:11,278 --> 01:07:17,679
definitely like go to college try to get

1928
01:07:13,559 --> 01:07:20,680
a degree and try to do something where

1929
01:07:17,679 --> 01:07:22,318
you're not killing yourself every day

1930
01:07:20,679 --> 01:07:24,000
really you know what I mean like I but

1931
01:07:22,318 --> 01:07:25,880
don't get me wrong I love my job right

1932
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:29,278
it's a great it's a great place to work

1933
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:31,079
it's a great job but I think like

1934
01:07:29,278 --> 01:07:33,639
especially now like seeing like

1935
01:07:31,079 --> 01:07:36,440
everybody wants to be like an influencer

1936
01:07:33,639 --> 01:07:37,798
they nobody wants to do construction

1937
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:39,599
nobody wants to do construction nobody

1938
01:07:37,798 --> 01:07:41,000
wants to go to college nobody wants to

1939
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:43,480
they either want to go to college play

1940
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:45,760
in the NFL like play a sport in college

1941
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:47,240
or like go be a doctor or something that

1942
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:50,359
like I wish I would have went to school

1943
01:07:47,239 --> 01:07:52,159
and actually did something like not like

1944
01:07:50,358 --> 01:07:53,679
to say that matters but like that

1945
01:07:52,159 --> 01:07:55,719
matters you know what I mean like what I

1946
01:07:53,679 --> 01:07:58,199
do matters right because people wouldn't

1947
01:07:55,719 --> 01:07:59,598
like I I work in water right so people

1948
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:01,558
wouldn't be able to drink without me

1949
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:04,359
fixing their water right it's a big

1950
01:08:01,559 --> 01:08:06,440
thing like if everything hits the fan

1951
01:08:04,358 --> 01:08:07,719
like it's it's a necessity at the end of

1952
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:09,119
the day you have to have it imagine if

1953
01:08:07,719 --> 01:08:11,078
you didn't have water yeah oh you have

1954
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:13,160
to have it right so it's like you need

1955
01:08:11,079 --> 01:08:14,640
me but at the same time like there's a

1956
01:08:13,159 --> 01:08:16,000
lot of cool people that do a lot of cool

1957
01:08:14,639 --> 01:08:17,599
stuff out there like even if you go to

1958
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,359
college like for film you know what I

1959
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:20,960
mean like even like setting up this

1960
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:22,520
whole podcast type thing you know what I

1961
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:24,158
mean to be the guy behind the screens

1962
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:26,159
like shout out the people behind the

1963
01:08:24,158 --> 01:08:28,158
screens running the whole our producer

1964
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:30,079
went to college yeah yeah you know what

1965
01:08:28,158 --> 01:08:31,838
I mean like shout out those people like

1966
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:34,318
that can go and you you know the people

1967
01:08:31,838 --> 01:08:36,399
like you'd get to meet like even if you

1968
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:38,199
like say just for producing right or

1969
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:39,920
just for editing the people's stuff you

1970
01:08:38,198 --> 01:08:42,039
get to work on the stuff the people you

1971
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:43,798
get to meet even if it was music like

1972
01:08:42,039 --> 01:08:45,399
the songs you get to be a part of it's

1973
01:08:43,798 --> 01:08:46,759
like to do stuff like that would have

1974
01:08:45,399 --> 01:08:49,679
been cool that's what I would have told

1975
01:08:46,759 --> 01:08:50,920
myself is go to school and figure it out

1976
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:52,920
because when I was young man I had no

1977
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:54,399
idea what I wanted to do I was partying

1978
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:56,239
all the time and how just having fun

1979
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:57,479
living life kind of nothing's changed as

1980
01:08:56,238 --> 01:08:59,798
you can tell I'm still just Full

1981
01:08:57,479 --> 01:09:00,879
Throttle all the time so but that'd

1982
01:08:59,798 --> 01:09:03,719
probably be a thing for me I know it

1983
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:05,880
sounds super cliche because you know but

1984
01:09:03,719 --> 01:09:07,640
it is it is something like me personally

1985
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:09,400
I still might go back to college and

1986
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:10,719
you're young you still go back to you

1987
01:09:09,399 --> 01:09:12,198
know what I mean like I still want to go

1988
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:13,679
back to college and get a degree and

1989
01:09:12,198 --> 01:09:16,119
stuff you never know maybe a career

1990
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:18,158
change I changed careers a bunch and I

1991
01:09:16,119 --> 01:09:21,479
think there it's never too late to start

1992
01:09:18,158 --> 01:09:23,879
over MH uh it's it's never late to show

1993
01:09:21,479 --> 01:09:26,198
up on time yeah oh that's where a live

1994
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:28,159
by right there yeah you ain't

1995
01:09:26,198 --> 01:09:31,119
but yeah that would that'd be it for me

1996
01:09:28,158 --> 01:09:32,599
definitely for sure mhm well if people

1997
01:09:31,119 --> 01:09:34,960
are looking to find out about you you

1998
