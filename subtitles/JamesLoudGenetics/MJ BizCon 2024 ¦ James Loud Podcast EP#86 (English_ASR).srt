82
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:43,680
yeah and so you seem to keep selling out

83
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,000
of the the lights the uvcs yes it's we

84
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,239
just keep on making more and shipping

85
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,759
them every single month and it's just

86
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,519
been going we've been really really busy

87
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:50,919
and it's been really making a big

88
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,719
difference for a lot of people they're

89
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:54,919
actually really easy to install I I

90
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:56,919
really like I like the concept I feel

91
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:58,158
like if you can limit the amount of

92
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:00,199
spray you put on your PL you're going to

93
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:01,560
get a better product to the end anything

94
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:03,560
I can do to minimize the amount of

95
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,598
spraying we do especially in flour I

96
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,479
think it's great I truly believe in two

97
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:09,878
years from now like they will be like

98
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:11,479
more and more commercial Growers and

99
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:13,158
like in a few years all will be using

100
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:15,238
itow cuz it's just such a disadvantage

101
00:04:13,158 --> 00:04:16,719
not to have it yeah I believe it'll be

102
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,199
an industry standard to I mean I don't

103
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,000
see why people wouldn't want to switch

104
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,199
and transition exactly like as time is

105
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,040
going we're actually getting more and

106
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,560
more s so for fighting different bugs

107
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,879
like we weren't advertising that it's

108
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,000
really effective against rud AIDS

109
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:31,800
originally but now we got data showing

110
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,600
that rud aits are attracted to it and

111
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,800
they land right on it and get nuked it's

112
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,160
all the flying one so it's uh things are

113
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,280

further Ado James loud and Arian so

193
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,920
we're here to talk about vertical

194
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,278
integration and international scaling

195
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:16,439
today with Arian rosam for Greenhouse

196
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:20,240
seed campy Strain Hunters powder

197
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:23,360
feeding uh he's he's uh the most awarded

198
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,399
cannabis company in history known for

199
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,759
strains like super silver haze Super

200
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:30,480
Lemon Haze Flower Bomb cush White Widow

201
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:33,200
you know and the list goes on and on and

202
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,000
on he's a big inspiration for me you met

203
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,278
in

204
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,799
2012 and you know I think if there's

205
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:41,559
anyone that knows vertical integration

206
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:43,479
and international scal it's Aon so we're

207
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:45,359
going to talk about Thailand since

208
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,360
that's the latest project so how's

209
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,560
everything going in Thailand it's going

210
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,839
really well yeah we're

211
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:54,559
happy yeah yeah so you went from

212
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:57,560
Amsterdam in the Netherlands with a

213
00:10:54,559 --> 00:11:00,319
coffee shot model and then you expanded

214
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:03,078
into parts of Spain yeah well we went

215
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,160
first to Canada with can a while that

216
00:11:03,078 --> 00:11:07,078
didn't work out because they had other

217
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:10,559
priorities and then we're still in

218
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:12,879
Africa small but also we're still

219
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:15,278
waiting there for export license so it's

220
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:17,159
quite complicated which is it like

221
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:18,919
everywhere you know it was also 5 years

222
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:20,838
ago impossible in Canada when everything

223
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:22,559
just started from America it's still

224
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:24,880
impossible cuz you guys are not federal

225
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:27,239
years so it's only possible from

226
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:29,879
countries like Colombia Macedonia

227
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,519
Portugal and now Thailand

228
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:36,360
and there's only four countries really

229
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:41,200
legal which is uh Canada Malta Uruguay

230
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:44,560
and Thailand so as I'm in like last 40

231
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:47,000
years in Thailand a lot hio also read

232
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:48,078
there and uh yeah we know the country

233
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,200
quite good we have some great

234
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:54,838
connections there we decided to uh build

235
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:59,360
our infrastructure there looking at the

236
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:02,360
future of cost price of marijuana and um

237
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:06,000
possible to expand without too many

238
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:08,159
issues as where America Holland and

239
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,039
Canada all totally [ __ ] up their

240
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:15,278
system so we decided to uh find an

241
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:17,679
easier way that's why we went to time it

242
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:19,679
nice and so the landscape is changing

243
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:21,679
over there as well seems like their

244
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:24,919
political landscape changes from month

245
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:26,359
to month and then with the new election

246
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:28,799
how is that going to change

247
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:31,519
everybody well look it's it's kind of

248
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:34,559
medical call you know Growers should be

249
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:37,078
GCT uh that's Trum where it's going to

250
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:40,278
go that was the plan from the

251
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:43,000
beginning so let's see you know it's

252
00:12:40,278 --> 00:12:47,759
Thailand um I'm the

253
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:50,839
spokesman uh for many things there so

254
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:53,039
uh can't say too much which directions

255
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:56,120
going right now you know it's the same

256
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:59,799
line there but uh yeah it's uh we love

257
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:02,679
the country I think um for me lived this

258
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:05,278
is my 10th country where I live I live

259
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:09,359
there now like 2 years with high cor

260
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:11,198
mostly and if you look at the country

261
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,199
itself you know you look at beaches you

262
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:15,439
look at uh

263
00:13:13,198 --> 00:13:18,719
food uh public

264
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:21,279
transport of prices crime there's hardly

265
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,160
any crime in the whole country and how

266
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:24,320
nice and kind of people are is probably

267
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:26,958
one of the best countries in the world

268
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,000
to live you know so that's also a big

269
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:32,518
part of the reason we thought okay you

270
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:36,240
know know let's settle there um also in

271
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:38,519
the north part where we are climate is

272
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,839
probably maybe the best in the world

273
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:44,679
between August and March like now the

274
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,360
nights are between 50 and 20 celsus the

275
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:49,719
days are 25 to

276
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:52,159
30 and um we have a range of options

277
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,399
there you probably know know so even in

278
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:55,600
the glass ners so we get humidity down

279
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,720
to

280
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:01,199
35% so which is great to grow a medical

281
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,560
product because you know everything has

282
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:05,838
to be really really clean and uh you

283
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:07,359
know it's certain very important

284
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,360
pharmaceutical standards otherwise you

285
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,360
can not

286
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,320
export yeah and you guys are doing some

287
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,399
really large fenal hunts there as well

288
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,240
you want to touch on that yeah yeah it

289
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,198
was great look we had the we had the

290
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,320
option as nowhere before when we're

291
00:14:18,198 --> 00:14:23,799
working in cono and South Africa uh we

292
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:26,920
have a lot of vales in Congo and that

293
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:30,879
myself and dust we had so much seeds and

294
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:33,559
then when um Tha came up we were able

295
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:37,120
together with the Tha FDA to import 300

296
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:39,039
strains a lot of uh stuff so when we

297
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,360
arrived in uh Thailand the first thing

298
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:43,879
is we did two three big rounds in total

299
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,800
147,000

300
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:51,360
Clans and I think we went down from to

301
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:53,359
140 to 80 Keepers and now is a

302
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,879
consistent flow of new stuff coming you

303
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,959
know there's the only place in the world

304
00:14:54,879 --> 00:15:00,000
where you can on a really large scale

305
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:02,399
like Africa Asia you can do your stuff

306
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,639
you know like if you're breeder you need

307
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,120
space you know like it's nice if you do

308
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,799
something at home and you can grow 100

309
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,639
seeds but you know that doesn't really

310
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:13,838
bring you somewhere you know you need to

311
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:16,720
put at least 5 or 10,000 out you know to

312
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:19,240
find some crazy stuff so we had that

313
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:22,800
opportunity and this is where new lines

314
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:24,278
are coming from so lemon orange you know

315
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:27,679
the full

316
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:29,799
gas uh strawberry norri cake now all

317
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:31,799
these new varieties that are followup of

318
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:34,198
Super Lemon and all those varieties so

319
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:36,159
yeah super blessed to have these options

320
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:38,359
you know these high turbin profile plant

321
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:41,198
now and with these plans now we're going

322
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:43,278
to conquer other markets you know in in

323
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:46,439
the world very

324
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:47,958
nice so as far as climate out there are

325
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,480
you finding some of the genetics that

326
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:53,719
you have traditionally grow really well

327
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:57,278
out there well uh yes or

328
00:15:53,720 --> 00:16:00,160
no look you're on the Equator so the big

329
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:03,278
Advantage is that you don't need any uh

330
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:05,240
what do you call this to make your no

331
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:07,759
darkness no dark you don't need these

332
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:10,519
curtains you know because we're 66 there

333
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:12,079
which is great but under if you grow

334
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:15,919
outside you have to preow your plant

335
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:18,799
unless you put sativas you know so uh so

336
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:21,599
we grow mainly for the medical Market a

337
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:23,359
bunch indoor so and we are trying out

338
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,519
you probably saw that the last year we

339
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,039
hooked up one room with fluence one room

340
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:32,600
with sunlight and one room with DLI and

341
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:36,958
then we still have H PS bad um you can

342
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:38,639
see uh that from all the plans that we

343
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,119
lately did we didn't yet publish

344
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,759
anything yet because we want to do like

345
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:45,440
10 CR to be sure you know but you can

346
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:48,159
already see that under HPS much more

347
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,680
varieties Drive properly than on the LED

348
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:52,639
some do better on the LED but from the

349
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:56,599
20 there's only like three you know it's

350
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:58,959
say kind of 5 to 10% you know so it's

351
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,759
very low compared both of them you know

352
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:03,119
and turf wise it's a little bit

353
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:06,038
different but it's not better it's just

354
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,880
different I found out the same you know

355
00:17:06,038 --> 00:17:10,519
it's it's nice turs and but you also

356
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:13,039
have nice turbs on HPS you know but the

357
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:14,879
rest of the facility we are we we we

358
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:18,038
keep going with HPS we're not going to

359
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,280
move into L you're not really into L for

360
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:21,359
now no so his power is so cheap for

361
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:23,838
wearing

362
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:26,279
there quality is

363
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:28,198
better you know quality is just better

364
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:29,639
you know there a few few varities do

365
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:31,720
really well

366
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:36,080
but if you look at the buying cost of

367
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:38,600
your LED and the results you know the HP

368
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:41,000
is still King nice in in the United

369
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:43,719
States we are so concerned with color

370
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,240
right now as far as color cage people

371
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:48,640
want purple people feel about purple and

372
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,120
tinely look these Vibes go all around

373
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,559
the world but they take a year and then

374
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:54,558
it's over again and then something else

375
00:17:51,558 --> 00:17:56,000
comes soon so yeah it's just a trendy

376
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:58,240
thing you know suddenly everybody want

377
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,919
dle and everybody want this and then

378
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,679
everybody want that you know Candy Candy

379
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:05,559
yes so we brought out that candy one

380
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,840
with super L I'm going to live that way

381
00:18:05,558 --> 00:18:08,918
on the fow where we're going to be

382
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:14,359
together next week or next week or this

383
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:16,440
week no this the Saturday Sun yeah yeah

384
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:18,759
no it's nice it's the better is so many

385
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,320
would we now the thing is what I

386
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:22,640
personally have a big problem with is

387
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:25,079
all the hyro I think we should all run

388
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:28,400
soil you know I really have a big

389
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:32,918
problem with that I think uh you know

390
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:34,919
taste wise nothing can beat soil and um

391
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:37,960
but also healthwise you know like what

392
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:40,038
are we putting in there and uh you know

393
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,759
you see this uh this coughing disease

394
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:45,558
now that's coming up so including my son

395
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:47,038
and my son-in-law have it quite bad and

396
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:48,319
they only have it when they smoke C

397
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:50,079
wheat they don't have it when they smoke

398
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:51,158
European wheat you know so it all has to

399
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:53,558
do with the

400
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:55,320
nutrients uh with is hydro and if we

401
00:18:53,558 --> 00:18:57,079
look at our populations right now you

402
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:59,000
know like it's not really good in

403
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:59,918
European and American countries to the

404
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,279
health

405
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,640
situation and if we go to a restaurant

406
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:05,480
well we're both chefs by huge

407
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:08,038
coincidence probably only knows that but

408
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,759
we all come from the background as Chef

409
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:11,359
we in other restaurants where you eat

410
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:13,400
you want to eat organic food yeah it

411
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:15,678
tastes much better so why are we all

412
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:18,320
smoking Hydro especially in America I

413
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,759
every dispensary I walk in is hydro well

414
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:22,119
I think part of it is cuz people eat

415
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:24,919
with their eyes you know and so with

416
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:27,158
carabis the bag appeal in Instagram and

417
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:29,400
the social media which you social media

418
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:31,720
is a bu going to Cru but I feel like it

419
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,519
has had negative impact on the Cannabis

420
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:36,000
industry because people so concerned

421
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:37,960
with how it looks they forgot about the

422
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,159
effect of it and the taste right CU I

423
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,798
think those are the two most important

424
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:43,000
things to get over lip Alon is effect

425
00:19:41,798 --> 00:19:44,879
especially like how does it make you

426
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,720
feel cuz really we're all here for the

427
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,200
effect yeah but I think that's part of

428
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,440
the problem I totally agree with you

429
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,880
there but I think the bigger problem is

430
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,279
the spread sheets of of Wall Street so

431
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,039
all these investors are that are

432
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:58,839
involved you know I think and all those

433
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:01,038
Growers should push back on that they

434
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:03,038
can't you know because they need all 70

435
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:04,879
G or 60 G of feet otherwise it's not

436
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:06,919
good you know and you can only reach

437
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,960
that on Rocko you can't reach that on

438
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:12,840
soy that you know I don't know you I

439
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,919
would never go to a hydro

440
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:17,879
restaurant that's for

441
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:20,280
sure so circling back to Thailand what

442
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,960
are some of the challenges you faced

443
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:25,480
since you started working in Thailand

444
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,200
well I work with 200 people n of them

445
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,240
speaks

446
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:33,240
English that's the of the biggest

447
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:36,240
challenge and then uh I think and uh

448
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,839
yeah just a lot you know look here we

449
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,279
have an industry and in Europe we have

450
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:43,079
some kind of industry but there there

451
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:45,678
was no industry that luckily uh I'm in

452
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:47,319
the north so I in the agriculture area

453
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,559
so most of the women come from the rice

454
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:50,599
fields and they have some kind of

455
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:54,200
background and they're hard workers you

456
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:56,639
know so but still it's a challenge

457
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,960
and sometimes you have to explain six

458
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,400
seven eight nine times the same thing

459
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,919
which we don't have in Europe or in

460
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,240
America but lately we figured out you

461
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:07,280
know we make a little video they put it

462
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:12,960
on the phone and then they figure that

463
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:15,798
so video Sops video Sops yeah end of

464
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,798
discussion yes so yeah and so you have a

465
00:21:15,798 --> 00:21:20,158
verly integrated model which is pretty

466
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:22,079
impressive because you do the

467
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:25,360
cultivation and then you also have

468
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:27,240
dispensaries yeah so um yeah we opened

469
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:29,639
six spr well next week we opening the

470
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:33,519
last one six there's five in Bangkok and

471
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:35,759
one in Sao and uh we really did that to

472
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:37,960
yeah to sponsor our own growth of course

473
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:41,119
and create brand awareness in Thailand

474
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:42,319
you people really like it and uh yeah

475
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:43,879
it's like you know we have five in

476

478
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,440
good for our brand and uh we like to

black guy and a yellow guy smoking a joy

492
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:25,000
so it's very important for the

493
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:27,798
integration in Amsterdam you know and uh

494
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,640
it's just a social it's a very well

495
00:22:27,798 --> 00:22:32,119
social aspect place you know where

496
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,278
people integrate to each other so I

497
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:36,239
think com chop system is maybe the best

498
00:22:34,278 --> 00:22:37,640
system in the world unfortunately it's

499
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,679
still only in Holland and now we have it

500
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,240
a little bit in

501
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:43,720
Thailand and uh in Thailand also we got

502
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:46,359
the bo back in we got the champagne and

503
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:49,919
the Cocktails so that's quite nice next

504
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:51,439
week we're opening Co sunroad and yeah I

505
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,679
grew up as a young boy there when I was

506
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,880
17 18 19 grown to thaan with a rosac and

507
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:59,559
now in that same street I have a hotel

508
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,080
and a coffee ship this B through so it's

509
00:22:59,558 --> 00:23:04,319
quite funny we just came from there me

510
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:06,720
and Y was nice H so we're opening uh I

511
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:09,558
think 10 days

512
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,159
whereever so as far as brand awareness

513
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:13,879
out there how do how do consumers

514
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,159
purchase cameras is it based on like

515
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,799
you're they looking for specific

516
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:20,960
genetics or are they just looking to eye

517
00:23:17,798 --> 00:23:22,639
or well look there's a big big culture

518
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,278
there in Asia you know this gold

519
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,720
triangle yeah so TI sticks in 60s and

520
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:30,038
70s to America there's a famous Tai guy

521
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,798
was in who was 15 years in a federal

522
00:23:30,038 --> 00:23:34,079
prison here later became minister in

523
00:23:31,798 --> 00:23:38,240
Thailand so there is

524
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:40,119
like quite awareness about local strains

525
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,519
and also some of the important ones the

526
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:44,558
American strains European strains but

527
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:48,240
yeah this is all new also for them you

528
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:50,399
know there's a range of genetics and the

529
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,440
people come in there of course there's

530
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,320
po parts that cannot afford $10 a gram

531
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,798
you know there's $5 Gams there's all

532
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:59,240
kinds of stuff but and there is huge

533
00:23:57,798 --> 00:24:02,359
tourist in the hisory of course this

534
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:04,240
year we will hit 35 million tourists and

535
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:07,000
the promise we made to the government

536
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:10,599
that by 2030 we will have 80 million

537
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:14,119
tourists so we have uh 45 million to

538
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:16,519
go amazing yeah yeah so what are your

539
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:18,719
thoughts on Germany in the New Market in

540
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:19,960
Germany I know for seats you guys have

541
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,200
did really well in Germany yeah we're

542
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,558
doing really well in Germany and as a

543
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,159
matter of fact it's one of the first

544
00:24:23,558 --> 00:24:29,678
countries we're going to export our Wei

545
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:32,679
to next year so uh we all SE company in

546
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:35,399
a Tha company and uh probably somewhere

547
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:39,320
May June July next year we we're going

548
00:24:35,398 --> 00:24:41,199
to export to Germany so and then uh the

549
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:43,000
reason also we're in Thailand is we can

550
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,360
keep our costs really low you

551
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,839
know so we can compete with the whole

552
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:49,519
world and have the great products and we

553
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:52,558
can have it in a

554
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:55,519
pharmac uh where it's for a very

555
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:58,440
reasonable price where it can meet the

556
00:24:55,519 --> 00:25:00,119
prices of the streets so where you

557
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,000
mother my mother you know if they need

558
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:04,199
medical cannabis can walk in and feel

559
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,159
safe and get it for a very reasonable

560
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,679
price you know like for 789 a graph

561
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:10,960
which is great you know which is even

562
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:14,519
cheaper as in my shop for something

563
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:16,798
right yeah nice so you also do you see

564
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:18,240
production at Thailand and and how has

565
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:20,558
that impacted the

566
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,720
company well we just finished that

567
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:25,240
because we worked in we worked in stages

568
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,640
so we build the first uh huge Thai

569
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,720
indoor for to supply the Thai market we

570
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:32,880
Supply like 200

571
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:35,120
dispensers then we finalized the GMP

572
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:38,679
which we are now

573
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:43,278
finalizing um and then we just build

574
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:46,320
also the SE company with 26 rooms where

575
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:49,000
we can produce between 100 and 200 kg of

576
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:53,038
flour well we got some projects going on

577
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,640
together so um yeah we'll see next year

578
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:57,599
you know we did the first crop just came

579
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,240
out with seeds I published it last week

580
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:01,519
but flag on Instagram by to wait for

581
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:04,798
that first of course what's

582
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:06,879
new yeah yeah social media is just such

583
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:09,079
a blessing in it curse oh man far well

584
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,520
that's M it's absolutely necessary that

585
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:12,960
they make it really difficult for people

586
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:14,398
in the industry and you guys have

587
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,000
navigated fairly well you had a huge

588
00:26:14,398 --> 00:26:21,798
falling in Instagram and social media

589
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,759
yeah we have uh well we we lost a lot um

590
00:26:21,798 --> 00:26:26,440
we used to have like three 400 million

591
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:30,200
hits with all my grow DVDs they to that

592
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:32,960
all off so hio had a big fight with

593
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:35,000
Google in the end he was able to get all

594
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,399
the documentaries back you know as

595
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,640
documentary but we lost all the other

596
00:26:37,398 --> 00:26:41,319
views and then the other Instagram we

597
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,520
lost a few times big time but if you

598
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:45,240
look now I made some pictures you

599
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:47,639
probably saw the picture of us with du

600
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:50,120
Lia last week in bco even that AFF

601
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:52,200
flaged so people are reporting you know

602
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:53,678
like me and and dualipa you know there

603
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:57,679
nothing to do with marijuana there's not

604
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:59,640
even a a a butt or a joint or a flower

605
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,200
behind us you know and they're flagging

606
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,640
that kind of things but it has probably

607
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,679
to do I talkish a lot about testine you

608
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:08,360
know but kids only kids and uh you know

609
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:11,080
he get we [ __ ] for

610
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:13,599
that yeah that'll happen trust now

611
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:16,639
that's it is that's how it is and so how

612
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:18,398
do you feel about the United States and

613
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,880
the the markets in the United States so

614
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:23,079
they feel like we're a we're a

615
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,000
Powerhouse obviously in the Cannabis

616
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:28,839
space and then as far as coffee shops of

617
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,759
the future yeah well look it

618
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:33,278
totally surprising that it's I think

619
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:34,798
there's there's smokers areas now but

620
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:36,960
there's no dispensers where you can live

621
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:38,839
the smoke like amster now they don't

622
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,558
exist yet I think that would be the

623
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:42,678
perfect thing you know

624
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:44,599
unfortunately um things are going in the

625
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:46,919
wrong direction and in Canada and in

626
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:49,599
America with all these listed companies

627
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:51,640
I think the listed companies is a huge

628
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:56,359
problem I was just going through the

629
00:27:51,640 --> 00:28:00,080
figures with hio in Canada and since

630
00:27:56,359 --> 00:28:04,558
five what is it 2018 20 9

631
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:07,639
$770 billion got evaporated and this is

632
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:09,759
all mom and tops investing in in listed

633
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:12,759
companies you know I think it's a huge

634
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:14,319
Scandal you know it's really corrup ISM

635
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:17,398
to the max you know and saying for the

636
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:19,079
American listed companies you see people

637
00:28:17,398 --> 00:28:21,879
losing $300

638
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:23,798
million in three months you know like

639
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:27,039
where is it should be like in know why

640
00:28:23,798 --> 00:28:29,079
you know um there should be few small

641
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:30,640
craft families

642
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:32,240
with their own coffee shop where you

643
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,759
feel comfortable and you go buy it

644
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:37,919
instead of you going to the big chains

645
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:40,440
that grow Hydro wheat and you know are

646
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,799
listed and making hundreds and millions

647
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:45,919
of lot you know I think it's the wrong

648
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:47,558
direction but yeah this is how it is

649
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,038
Unfortunately they

650
00:28:47,558 --> 00:28:51,398
there yeah we always have time to change

651
00:28:50,038 --> 00:28:54,000
I think California starting to get

652
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:56,879
smoking uh loues that just got approved

653
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,440
recently so by 2025 you should start

654
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,559
seeing smoking consumption anales a in

655
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,038
California but with the dispenser where

656
00:29:01,558 --> 00:29:06,440
you can buy it yeah they do well San

657
00:29:04,038 --> 00:29:08,038
Francisco they already have that so Bary

658
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,320
Coast there's a couple places but it's

659
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:12,599
going to be a lot larger you know I

660
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:14,319
think the personally my opinion about

661
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:15,839
California is they need to the farmy

662
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:18,038
table model where you can actually go

663
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:21,000
purchase yes from the farms you could

664
00:29:18,038 --> 00:29:22,558
purchase the farm places like coule you

665
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,278
know these places are suffering because

666
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:28,440
of the industry and Taxation it' be much

667
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:30,359
easier and you go get a firm tour taste

668
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,759
the product have a whole day of it watch

669
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:34,959
the processing watch the coast Harvest

670
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:37,038
to the coast Harvest I mean I think that

671
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,159
will change the bottle C and you you can

672
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:40,960
do that over Thailand yeah I do that in

673
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:42,600
Holland kind well not in Holland because

674
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,240
there the farm is not I'm not allowed to

675
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:47,639
come but in Thailand yes or from Farm to

676
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,798
Table and not only that we grow Poli

677
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,480
wheed we grow indoor wheat and then from

678
00:29:49,798 --> 00:29:52,798
the varieties like lemon and orange we

679
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,798
have the dry shift with have the

680
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:57,240
pollinator with have the bubble has with

681
00:29:54,798 --> 00:29:58,798
have the Rosen so you can have it in six

682
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,880
different ways for example which is

683
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:02,879
quite unique you know and I think if you

684
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,200
would adapt a situation like that in

685
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,159
California or in Canada where there's a

686
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,519
farm and where we can buy so you have

687
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:11,519
the whole experience you know people

688
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:15,278
will feel more motivated and have a

689
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:17,399
better connection to the uh specific

690
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:19,880
dispensary cuz the same family is

691
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:22,000
growing in whatever organic way bringing

692
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:24,278
to the dispensary where you can buy it

693
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,798
and we can use it on site and have a

694
00:30:24,278 --> 00:30:29,599
great time I think that will make a big

695
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:31,398
difference then you can win from chains

696
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:33,038
like MC chains big chains like

697
00:30:31,398 --> 00:30:34,959
McDonald's and Burger Kings that you

698
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:36,798
also have when to have in the marijuana

699
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,159
thing you know where you lose contact

700
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:41,359
where only yeah sorry to say but where

701
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:45,080
only idiot go to eat you know it's not a

702
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:47,678
real hamburger you know eating paper

703
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:49,079
it's a real shitty Hammer but yeah and

704
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,440
the funny thing is it's like it's just

705
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:52,119
like the Cannabis IND isue though I

706
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,679
think there's something for everybody so

707
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:55,000
there's some people that just don't care

708
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,840
and then there's other people that want

709
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,599
want to cons you best but they'll tell

710
00:30:56,839 --> 00:31:01,199
you to why do big yeah well you know

711

00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:31,079
that if we eat it it should be great

723
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,558
great certainly back to Thailand again

724
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:34,879

a few months we're GMP which we're

729
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:48,678
finalizing now so it's going to take

730
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:50,558
another three months and then next year

731
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:52,919
our whole focus is on export and getting

732
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:54,638
our stuff on the shelves on the on the

733
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:56,880
right places with the right people

734
00:31:54,638 --> 00:31:58,359
there's the good distribution Partners

735
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,639
you know which is key

736
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:03,918
and um yeah and then make more movies

737
00:32:01,638 --> 00:32:06,079
start branding you know yeah so The

738
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:09,480
Strain Hunters where are you guys going

739
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:11,158
next I have a great one coming up but as

740
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,798
you know we never reveal where we go

741
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:14,919
because of security this one is quite

742
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:16,200
tricky the only thing I can say is we're

743
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:18,639
going to go through the mountains on

744
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:21,919
horses somewhere very interesting we

745
00:32:18,638 --> 00:32:26,638
have three of them lined up and uh yeah

746
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:28,559
trainer this came uh 20 years ago 2004

747
00:32:26,638 --> 00:32:30,918
yeah 2004 5

748
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:32,879
I was called in by the mayor and our

749
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:34,679
lawyers and they were panicking because

750
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,679
in Holland probably the same in America

751
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:40,278
in Canada you're not allot to appetize

752
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:41,840
for drugs so then Greenhouse was in the

753
00:32:40,278 --> 00:32:44,319
movies and everybody said they're going

754
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:47,240
to take away our license blah blah blah

755
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:48,599
so you know was breaking my my head H

756
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:52,159
going to sold this problem came up with

757
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:54,959
a new name so where now I can

758
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,720
basically promote us and show the world

759
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,798
around the equator what is going on you

760
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,679
know so there's 200 million poor Farmers

761
00:32:59,798 --> 00:33:03,679
depending on marijuana around the

762
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,278
equator which many people don't know you

763
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:08,320
know for example Africa where I'm from

764
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:09,919
and IO they the kids cannot go to school

765
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,960
because they don't have money to buy Fen

766
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:13,519
for the C Kettle and if they don't watch

767
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,360
The Kettle they eat the vegetable field

768
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:17,960
and whole [ __ ] family dies yet so

769
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:20,798
it's quite sad so we try to show this

770
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:24,038
kind of stuff how important that is and

771
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:26,440
in the same time we we create awareness

772
00:33:24,038 --> 00:33:28,558
for cannabis you know so after we did

773
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,720
Colombia Colombia legal

774
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:32,480
with it in Vincent and the Grenadines

775
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,319
the prime minister went on television

776
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,079
and basically said I'm not going to

777
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:37,638
arrest people anymore when answer weed

778
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:40,558
while American Canada are legal right

779
00:33:37,638 --> 00:33:42,918
now doesn't make sense Thailand you know

780
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:47,000
now is legal we AO has been working very

781
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:48,880
hard since 201822 they legalized cono we

782
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:53,038
changed the constitution in cono with

783
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:55,320
our team and now uh Meo Marana is is

784
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:58,679
legal you can obtain a license still

785
00:33:55,319 --> 00:34:01,200
very difficult we're getting there s

786
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:03,840
Morocco uh swasiland

787
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,679
Malawi all these countries are legalized

788
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:08,960
now which is great and we be working a

789
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:11,559
lot in Argentina too with the government

790
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,559
there and but yeah our main priority of

791
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:15,199
course is which train that's why we do

792
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:17,239
show to mov in Thailand is of course

793
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:20,918
Thailand because the government there

794
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:23,078
was very very helpful and understands us

795
00:34:20,918 --> 00:34:27,358
you know and and the business and wants

796
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:29,560
to go forward with us and yeah so that's

797
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:32,199
what we try to create with strains you

798
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:34,398
know the awareness and and making sure

799
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:36,918
that people understand what it's all

800
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:39,159
about so how do you feel about some of

801
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:41,440
these Canadian LPS and large

802
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:43,960
corporations going to places like sa

803
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:48,000
Vincent and the grenadians or to the

804
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:49,240
cargo uh to produce biomass and other

805
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,320
things to

806
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:53,519
exper yeah well they're only losing

807
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:56,200
money that's all I can say I don't think

808
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:58,559
this one is company making money if we

809
00:34:56,199 --> 00:35:01,039
look at the figures even of these year

810
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:02,559
they all lose between 300 and $900

811
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:05,000
million I don't know who's paying the

812
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:08,719
bill but it's ridiculous we call it

813
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,760
Corum ISM you know and uh that yeah Moms

814
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:13,679
and Pops are apparently keep pushing

815
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:14,720
money into the listed companies so what

816
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:17,480
do you

817
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:18,959
think the optimal way for these

818
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:21,679
communities and countries around the

819
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:24,320
world that are looking to uh Infuse

820
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:26,039
money into their countries you know for

821
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,519
their people what what do you think the

822
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:31,000
best modern FS I think best model is you

823
00:35:28,519 --> 00:35:32,519
have if you have a really good group of

824
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,559
people or family that is a really good

825
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:39,920
grower find that financer or one person

826
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:41,960
who wants to join the team and not 20

827
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,000
and make a really good business plan

828
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:46,240
that stretches from 5 to 10 years where

829
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,400
you want to be but certain milestones in

830
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:51,318
work like that so I have a private

831
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,240
private Finance instead of something out

832
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:54,679
of the Capital Market where you get

833
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:56,279
pushed in the wrong direction and make

834
00:35:54,679 --> 00:35:58,480
the wrong decisions because you have no

835
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,839
choice so I I think that is the only way

836
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,639
for the future you see that in many

837
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:05,358
Industries you see that in the wine

838
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:08,159
industry and most of those successful

839
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:09,920
small entrepreneurs have moved on like

840
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:11,239
that you know with one or two guys as a

841
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,519
backup you know I think that's a much

842
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:16,598
better approach if you want to grow in

843
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:19,358
our cases you know I started growing in

844
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:22,519
83 opened my first Club in '

845
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:24,799
92 we never had nobody fining so we

846
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:26,159
financed everything out of ourselves so

847
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,039
every time we had a little money we

848
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:29,598
opened something again you know same as

849
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:31,838
we do in Thailand we just grow

850
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:33,680
organically so we have no loans from

851
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:35,759
Banks or from other people you know we

852
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:37,559
just put our own money in so we're not

853
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,640
depending on any pressure you know so

854
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:42,639
things go wrong yeah you know there's

855
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:45,639
bad months but it is not a bad time you

856
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:47,118
know so do you think these countries

857
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:49,078
around the world in these places and

858
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:52,240
people that want to get their piece of

859
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:53,680
the Cannabis pie should be focusing on

860
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:56,439
things like biomass or do you think they

861
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:59,039
should be focusing on things like uh the

862
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:00,559
GRS that have an identity in places that

863
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:02,199
yeah exporting stuff that has an

864
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:05,119
identity more so than

865
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:06,919
biomass well look if you look at the

866
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,519
wine industry you for example in

867
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,039
Australia a big company called West

868
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:12,519
corve and they have a lot of different

869
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:14,119
ones so there there is going to be space

870
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:16,199
for everybody there's going to be huge

871
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:18,440
companies that sell let's say

872
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:20,719
Supermarket weed you know you will have

873
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,679
those guys and then you will have the

874
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:25,318
the craft families you know that sell a

875
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:27,078
great product I think those will be in

876
00:37:25,318 --> 00:37:29,279
the future the strongest one you can see

877
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:31,280
that in the why to you know if it's good

878
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,599
people you know we know few of them they

879
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,400
will survive you know you need a great

880
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,720
brand you need to be great grower you

881
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,559
know you have to have everything in

882
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:41,959
place but that's for everything you want

883
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:43,599
to be a an indie car driver or you want

884
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:46,039
to go to Olympics you have to be great

885
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:47,800
too you know and it's not so easy

886
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:50,440
anymore because you know our comp

887
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:53,240
there's a lot of people in this uh grow

888
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:55,200
week yeah I think in Oregon there are

889
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:57,199
more people there are more vies than

890
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:59,199
there are people you know you see that

891
00:37:57,199 --> 00:38:01,719
some like that I heard it's like crazy

892
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:03,679
it's like one on three or something yeah

893
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:05,639
what can you expect you know well yeah

894
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:08,039
and then it just tanks the whole Market

895
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:10,118
it's a race to the bottom so that's the

896
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:11,400
one thing that I think a lot of Dr avoid

897
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:13,079
yeah so then you have to be a great

898
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,039
brand and a good grower you come with

899
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:17,160
something new you know that's why I said

900
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:18,759
if you have your own dispensary and you

901
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:20,399
you announce and you film you know what

902
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:23,160
we also always did we filmed all our

903
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,480
stuff you know we are one of the few few

904
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:28,239
people that film what we do and like now

905
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:30,838
we're dropping super laminat times RS 11

906
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:33,519
we're dropping super L times GMO and

907
00:38:30,838 --> 00:38:36,318
times pink candy you know every time we

908
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:38,119
come with new stuff you know new tastes

909
00:38:36,318 --> 00:38:40,719
and I think that's that's good for any

910
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:42,240
any respectable brand well then you

911
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:44,759
still up your Staples right so you're a

912
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:47,118
super 11 Haze he's always here staple

913
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:48,920
yeah well super l ha is probably the

914
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,318
plant used the most in the world for

915
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:53,119
breeding and for everything you know so

916
00:38:51,318 --> 00:38:56,159
yeah we we are that's one of our

917
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:58,440
Flagship varieties but now you see the

918
00:38:56,159 --> 00:39:00,239
lemon orange and the full gas coming

919
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,838
also Kings us you know for hash is

920
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:04,118
probably the number one extraction plant

921
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:07,119
in the world and if you find a good feno

922
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:09,920
we flower it off indoor in 6 weeks and 2

923
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:12,920
days which is like really fast really

924
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:15,519
fast you know and uh yeah it's just that

925
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:17,960
one looks a little blue Rish just you

926
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:19,440
know we had that discussion before so

927
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:22,079
yeah lot of

928
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,480
options so if somebody is trying to

929
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:27,800
beain Quality as they scale what are

930
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:31,119
some recommendations that you can make

931
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:33,119
uh I think uh where everybody goes wrong

932
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:35,480
post Harvest grying

933
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:37,240
curing that's where everybody fails

934
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:40,760
nearly you know you really need to nail

935
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:43,679
that down like everything under 14 days

936
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:45,920
doesn't work you can dream doing 7 Days

937
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:48,118
in 9 days 11 days you have a good

938
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,960
product but you don't have the best so

939
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:52,280
you need 14 days you have to play the

940
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:54,880
last four days with the humidity and the

941
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:57,960
temperature and then Mr way how are you

942
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:01,039
going to box it you know like

943
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:03,000
um unfortunately I can't do it for GMP

944
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:06,239
but for the tie Market I do everything

945
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,159
on cardboard boxes so not plastic

946
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:11,759
everybody goes in plastic the cardboard

947
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:13,399
breeds and you know so I think I think

948
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,720
that's why our weed is better than the

949
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:17,440
rest and then we cure it a few weeks

950
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:19,399
before we take it out of the boxes and

951
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,440
and manicure and and store it and

952
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:24,160
everything keeps under the same uh under

953
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:26,679
the same temperature humidity so the

954
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:29,000
whole GMP line we have all the way

955
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:31,519
through the way through yes even the car

956
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,760
that drives to Bankok because yeah then

957
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:34,480
you don't lose the quality you know

958
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,119
that's the only way and that's it's

959
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,719
quite complicated and you know it's

960
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:39,680
easier if you have 10 lights and it gets

961
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:41,598
more difficult when you have 50 and it

962
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:44,239
gets nearly impossible when you have 500

963
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:45,960
lights you know so and then again it's a

964
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:48,679
spreadsheets you know it's like every

965
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:51,440
room like should have a dry room behind

966
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:53,039
you know because you cannot hang stuff

967
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,159
from other rules 3 days later in the

968
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:57,759
same rule which everybody does but we

969
00:40:56,159 --> 00:41:00,000
refuse you know like

970
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,319
it that's one of the main things so it's

971
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,800
post Harvest where

972
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:06,880
99% of the stuff goes wrong with with

973
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,560
grows and it's not always the fault of

974
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:12,318
the grow it's just lack of financial

975
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:14,559
issues you know like it's we can't build

976
00:41:12,318 --> 00:41:16,480
too many dry rooms because we already uh

977
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:19,159
you know spend too much money in the

978
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,760
overhead there or whatever or no space

979
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:23,078
or no Spa well that's the other big

980
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:25,880
problem you know you see vertical grow

981
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:27,599
yeah which yeah I understand I think it

982
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,760
came from the system in California where

983
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,760
you pay for square feet tax and not if

984
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,599
you go

985
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:35,480
up yeah I think it was adapted from the

986
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:37,160
lettuce industry yeah they took it from

987
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,119
the lettuce industry some of these five

988
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:42,960
stack yeah but lettuce industry is not

989
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:45,039
flow it's fifia for sure yeah and I mean

990
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:47,280
I think there's challenges and I think

991
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:48,960
for some people it works well it works

992
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,160
for the bulk industry that you can never

993
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,920
get the perfect

994
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:55,519
product yeah and then what are your

995
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:58,119
thoughts on other canopy whites I have

996
00:41:55,519 --> 00:42:00,480
no uh experience with that I was with as

997
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:02,400
some aliens last year two years ago they

998
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,480
were just trying it out I remember good

999
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:09,318
things about it I don't know if it's

1000
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:10,639
necessary you know um but yeah it of

1001
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:12,759
course it's one of the many things we're

1002
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:16,039
looking at yeah I I think they really

1003
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:20,240
great Cur we use them we use faven I'm a

1004
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:23,318
huge fan of faven at the increase in

1005
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:24,959
years got to love VII bags she's been on

1006
00:42:23,318 --> 00:42:28,358
the

1007
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:29,960
podcast yeah I heard 2025 % more but

1008
00:42:28,358 --> 00:42:32,000
then okay you have you're going to need

1009
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:34,039
more air conditioning more DM of course

1010
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,800
you're going to put more eight well

1011
00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:38,960
again in depending on the environment if

1012
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:40,359
you have a greenhouse that has low ppfd

1013
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,318
in the winter and you can't do winner

1014
00:42:40,358 --> 00:42:44,358
runs you can use just under I have a

1015
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:46,400
friend using just under can be lights in

1016
00:42:44,358 --> 00:42:47,960
his Greenhouse during the winter and now

1017
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,880
getting a yield he's able to do seed

1018
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:52,318
draft so I think there's a time and a

1019
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,599
place for everything there's a time in a

1020
00:42:52,318 --> 00:42:56,800
place for double Stacks you know that's

1021
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:58,760
if your REM model to out yeah there's a

1022
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:03,079
Time P for all those kind of things but

1023
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:04,599
they're not ideal great you if you don't

1024
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:07,440
if you have cheap real estate why should

1025
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:09,960
you stack you know yeah for sure it's

1026
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,400
like you know if you really look at the

1027
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,240
situation in the end of the day we all

1028
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:15,039
become potato farers I said that 20

1029
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:17,318
years ago on all the on all the things

1030
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:19,400
that went on you know and you just tell

1031
00:43:17,318 --> 00:43:22,920
me which potato

1032
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:26,559
farmer Farms potatoes in the

1033
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:27,960
city no so why are we with our grows in

1034
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:30,640
the city

1035
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:32,720
cuz we been pushed there by the cops

1036
00:43:30,639 --> 00:43:34,679
that's the only reason we are there but

1037
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:37,318
it's it's silly why you want to grow

1038
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:38,598
marijuana in the city there's no trees

1039
00:43:37,318 --> 00:43:40,159
growing there's no tomatoes growing

1040
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:42,680
there's no grapes growing why are we

1041
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,679
growing in the

1042
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,519
city honestly I don't know well I mean

1043
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:49,760
so

1044
00:43:46,519 --> 00:43:51,400
it's go with the Cs no but but it

1045
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,800
started in the 70s with the police you

1046
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,318
know I think that's what got the only

1047
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,880
reource that's why I grew illegal in

1048
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:58,039
amram in the city because they couldn't

1049
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:00,280
find us right

1050
00:43:58,039 --> 00:44:02,039
and so it doesn't make sense no well and

1051
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:04,359
so there's this this difference in

1052
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:06,639
Christ between indoor and outdoor and I

1053
00:44:04,358 --> 00:44:08,400
think outdoor in some ways is superior

1054
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:10,078
product you know if you look on social

1055
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,800
media obviously the indoor products

1056
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:16,000
could be better but as far as effect no

1057
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:18,519
I mean I think I've refocused my my

1058
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,838
greeting on to effect greasy one of my

1059
00:44:18,519 --> 00:44:22,358
friends passed away of 420 this year and

1060
00:44:20,838 --> 00:44:24,920
he was all about breeding for effect and

1061
00:44:22,358 --> 00:44:27,199
he gifted me his seed library on about

1062
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:29,639
70,000 seeds that he was breeding for

1063
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:31,639
effect and so that got me thinking like

1064
00:44:29,639 --> 00:44:33,480
what are we doing this for I mean social

1065
00:44:31,639 --> 00:44:35,838
media has us trying to go step that

1066
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:38,000
looks a certain way and I think that you

1067
00:44:35,838 --> 00:44:41,078
know there's commercial viability some

1068
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,280
for but again we're we're we smoke cuz

1069
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:44,559
we like the way it makes feel you like

1070
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,680
the it

1071
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:49,240
tastes yeah I totally agree I think I

1072
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:51,159
think we underestimate a lot there you

1073
00:44:49,239 --> 00:44:53,039
know we grow basically for Turin for the

1074
00:44:51,159 --> 00:44:55,759
taste I think that's much more important

1075
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:57,558
like food in the restaurant so you see

1076
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,119
like the really good tur Clans you know

1077
00:44:57,559 --> 00:45:03,280
like lemon orange and all those guys

1078
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:05,760
they all go 24 26 27 we technically

1079
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,960
score lower than you guys in America but

1080
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,359
that's because your your testing in

1081
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:12,119
America is pure fraud I was going to say

1082
00:45:10,358 --> 00:45:17,039
it's straightforward everything is

1083
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:22,720
pumped up yeah so where is where is your

1084
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:24,199
32 is the same as our twin C kind of but

1085
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:25,519
I think it's like Five Points different

1086
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:27,558
but it's the same it's just a different

1087
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:29,000
with method of testing oh the problem in

1088
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:31,280
the United States is depending on what

1089
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,400
lab you go to it could be there could be

1090
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:36,079
a 10% difference in testing right Canon

1091
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,119
ords it's just all over the place

1092
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,880
because it's incentivized now I I'm not

1093
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:42,200
big on government oversight in the

1094
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:44,400
Cannabis industry but I do think we need

1095
00:45:42,199 --> 00:45:46,039
more oversight with testing I feel like

1096
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,519
that's well biggest problem the question

1097
00:45:46,039 --> 00:45:50,719
is more you know like I think weat

1098
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:54,599
that's between 24 and 28 or let's say

1099
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:56,679
between 20 and 28 taste 27 maybe taste

1100
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:58,559
much better than we both there you know

1101
00:45:56,679 --> 00:46:00,838
but also if you take sativas you know

1102
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:04,160
take my one sow super super Sil R if

1103
00:46:00,838 --> 00:46:05,119
they're 23 24 we get much higher than

1104
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:07,440
one from

1105
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:09,720
30 yeah because the combination of

1106
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,119
flavenoids and turpens and it's much

1107
00:46:09,719 --> 00:46:13,598
higher effect you know it's like a

1108
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:16,160
mental eye compared to this body couch

1109
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:17,800
Lo Stones you know for sure so it

1110
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:20,558
doesn't always say that if you're high

1111
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:23,039
in th then it's better you know it's

1112
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:24,880
like go to this or you can eat

1113
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:26,679
restaurant well so how do you think

1114
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,760
that's going to change for the future

1115
00:46:26,679 --> 00:46:31,239
because because I feel like the canb

1116
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:33,200
noise especially THC is how people buy

1117
00:46:31,239 --> 00:46:36,598
weed but is that how they buy weed in

1118
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:38,318
Thailand as well or some the biggest

1119
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:40,359
example was Las Vegas you know when it

1120
00:46:38,318 --> 00:46:43,119
started here everybody want have 30% you

1121
00:46:40,358 --> 00:46:44,480
know um but you see shifting also in

1122
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:47,640
Amsterdam you don't see that anymore you

1123
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:51,000
know 45% that's the

1124
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:53,159
you yeah but I think really technically

1125
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,679
I think there's no science behind that

1126
00:46:53,159 --> 00:46:58,519
technically you could go until 36 I

1127
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:59,960
think that is absolute Max you could

1128
00:46:58,519 --> 00:47:03,318
have in a plan because yeah you also

1129
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:05,119
have sticks and leaves no sure it's well

1130
00:47:03,318 --> 00:47:07,000
no it's wild but because there's no

1131
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:08,960
oversight there's incentives for these

1132
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,280
labs and also these companies to have

1133
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:13,440
higher test results so when you you do

1134
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:16,960
that basically you're incentivizing all

1135
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:19,039
these people to get higher lab results

1136
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,199
which basically screws up the whole

1137
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:22,318
system and I think there needs to be

1138
00:47:20,199 --> 00:47:23,358
more standardization here it's just one

1139
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:25,000
of the flawed things in the United

1140
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:26,400
States well you know people should just

1141
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,679
make up their mind what they like you

1142
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,800
know as think the the the people in our

1143
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:33,000
industry are smart enough to see what

1144
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,440
they smoke you know and yeah

1145
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,880
unfortunately there's a lot of people

1146
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:38,679
who go to the wrong places but you know

1147
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,800
it's just creating awareness over time

1148
00:47:38,679 --> 00:47:42,679
being people will understand you know

1149
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:45,000
yeah I think a more educated Market will

1150
00:47:42,679 --> 00:47:46,879
have uh brand trust they'll trust

1151
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,280
different brands you know and once

1152
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,880
you're more educated on stuff you're

1153
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:52,119
going to go for things to like

1154
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:53,519
specifically I think genetic names like

1155
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:56,720
Skittles people know what they're going

1156
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:59,039
to get EX so yeah exactly that's what

1157
00:47:56,719 --> 00:48:00,919
the you won't so people will get more

1158
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:02,480
awareness and it's also the people

1159
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:05,240
behind the brand who Market the brand

1160
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:07,480
you know that that people will go there

1161
00:48:05,239 --> 00:48:09,239
yeah in in in California some of the

1162
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,800
celebrity brands that came on R had

1163
00:48:09,239 --> 00:48:12,439
really bad quality products that they

1164
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,720
were B basically banking on the fact

1165
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:17,079
that we had this celebrity behind the

1166
00:48:14,719 --> 00:48:19,000
it's and the thing is is that that that

1167
00:48:17,079 --> 00:48:20,400
end up not being successful I could need

1168
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,559
five or six different bands that came

1169
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:25,559
out with big celebrities where they now

1170
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:27,760
call to F you know in their educated

1171
00:48:25,559 --> 00:48:29,440
markets now but as soon as the the

1172
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,200
market becomes more educated we going

1173
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,480
want better quality products you might

1174
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:34,679
get them once but you're not going to

1175
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:36,240
get them for a second sale no well we

1176
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:38,279
had the experience in Canada I know

1177
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:40,439
where we are going to make St dog and

1178
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:44,400
Drake and much cheers and then they turn

1179
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:47,318
on us and was making to Jers he was in

1180
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:49,440
our shop yesterday now it was 700

1181
00:48:47,318 --> 00:48:51,199
million and I told you the approach was

1182
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:55,079
not good you said we'll figure it out to

1183
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:57,558
gu also you know like a little T L 700 M

1184
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:59,760
later on about one years so how the hell

1185
00:48:57,559 --> 00:49:03,720
you do 700 million in one

1186
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:06,359
year I it's that work I have no

1187
00:49:03,719 --> 00:49:08,759
idea an American candidate you guys ose

1188
00:49:06,358 --> 00:49:10,798
billions in one year how's that work

1189
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:14,079
plug into the camera you know I

1190
00:49:10,798 --> 00:49:15,719
think so it's money from St market and

1191
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:18,519
they all blow it up on celeries and

1192
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:22,039
crazy stuff you know yeah lawyers

1193
00:49:18,519 --> 00:49:26,358
lawyers yeah but I see kids that are 24

1194
00:49:22,039 --> 00:49:28,239
25 getting uh they are uh Master Road

1195
00:49:26,358 --> 00:49:30,000
they call the near in America we ever

1196
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:31,798
sign on we don't work with Master

1197
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,760
Growers but yeah I mean that's the

1198
00:49:31,798 --> 00:49:37,239
biggest we had 400 95 they get $200,000

1199
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:40,920
how high is not possible so of course

1200
00:49:37,239 --> 00:49:44,078
you're going to go broke right shoes but

1201
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:45,639
I think I think time based on everything

1202
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:47,680
too like there are people that will

1203
00:49:45,639 --> 00:49:51,239
probably let back out yeah but not if

1204
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:53,239
you're 24 bro well yeah four years

1205
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:55,519
experience or 5 years yeah or one and a

1206
00:49:53,239 --> 00:49:57,639
half or the resume says 20 years

1207
00:49:55,519 --> 00:49:59,400
experience but but yeah the term Master

1208
00:49:57,639 --> 00:50:01,239
grer to me is a big red flag so where

1209
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:04,358
people call themselves Master gr I see a

1210
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:06,479
resume with fter girl big red flag it

1211
00:50:04,358 --> 00:50:08,000
typically there many good there's many

1212
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:10,679
good Growers you

1213
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,199
know so you have tie Growers and then

1214
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:18,039
you guys when well it's basically me and

1215
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:19,879
dust and then now we have two Canadians

1216
00:50:18,039 --> 00:50:23,199
one half Dutch half Canadian and another

1217
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:25,920
Canadian guy sings only 3 months but

1218
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:27,679
that's because of the GMP part like you

1219
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,798
know the the you know our facility is

1220
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:32,118
quite big this year we're going to

1221
00:50:28,798 --> 00:50:35,960
produce 2700 kilo so what's that 5,000

1222
00:50:32,119 --> 00:50:39,960
lb so we need a lot of people and

1223
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:41,440
um when IO is taking care of the GMP I

1224
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:43,798
can't do that because I'm too busy and

1225
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:46,440
it's really a lot of work I think the

1226
00:50:43,798 --> 00:50:50,719
amount of paperwork is 1 m 40 which is

1227
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:53,358
at 6 6 ft yeah of Sops and I hate

1228
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:56,199
reading I'm not going to do it so we

1229
00:50:53,358 --> 00:50:57,440
took two experienced guys to help us out

1230
00:50:56,199 --> 00:50:59,838
there you know are they going to do that

1231
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:02,838
part we do the growing but you know if

1232
00:50:59,838 --> 00:51:05,719
it's Pharma it has to have uh an amazing

1233
00:51:02,838 --> 00:51:08,358
amazing amount of Trace abilities and a

1234
00:51:05,719 --> 00:51:10,439
million Sops so that's actually already

1235
00:51:08,358 --> 00:51:12,880
too but the first two years uh me and we

1236
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:14,400
want to have a an advantage above the

1237
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,760
rest of the world so nobody really knew

1238
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,240
we were there you know so we went

1239
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:20,079
straight from the Bangkok Airport to the

1240
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:22,279
other little airport and play to the

1241
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:23,920
north you know but at one point

1242
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:26,319
everybody will start recognizing us and

1243
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:28,000
then we opened May last year we opened

1244
00:51:26,318 --> 00:51:29,639
um

1245
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,000
the first shop so then we came out in

1246
00:51:29,639 --> 00:51:35,318
the open and we were there you know yeah

1247
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,079
so as far as Thailand how do Tre rolls

1248
00:51:35,318 --> 00:51:38,519
and carts do what are your thoughts on

1249
00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:40,119
PR rolls and carts for the future we

1250
00:51:38,519 --> 00:51:42,559
sell pre-rolls now we don't know what

1251
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:46,318
the future is going to bring because we

1252
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:47,640
have uh 27 license uh we have we are

1253
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:49,440
there's only two people with instruction

1254
00:51:47,639 --> 00:51:52,000
license I'm not really sure where it's

1255
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:54,960
going but because we are GMP we're going

1256
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:57,679
to export it's in our portfolio now so

1257
00:51:54,960 --> 00:52:00,838
now we only make uh Dy safe bubble has

1258
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:02,960
Rosen and three rolls but where that is

1259
00:52:00,838 --> 00:52:06,039
going in the future I'm not really sure

1260
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:08,880
yet no idea I I think it's going in the

1261
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:11,639
direction of hand rolls and pre-rolls

1262
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:14,000
and extracted carts just because of you

1263
00:52:11,639 --> 00:52:16,199
mean in general in general oh it's

1264
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,798
General too all along well look you know

1265
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:19,759
there's always a person who comes up by

1266
00:52:17,798 --> 00:52:21,400
the flower and is in a rush and wants to

1267
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,480
smoke a joint in a car takes a joint

1268
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:25,680
with her yeah and then there is the

1269
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:28,519
people who I I I can never figure that

1270
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:31,199
out because even my kid you know I I

1271
00:52:28,519 --> 00:52:34,239
they say I make the worst joints yeah

1272
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:36,919
but I make my yeah more people agree on

1273
00:52:34,239 --> 00:52:38,239
that but listen I work 18 hours a day I

1274
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,960
don't have time to make a joint so I

1275
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:41,959
roll really quickly and I put it in my

1276
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:43,720
paper I smoke it right but then you have

1277
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:45,679
the guy who's going to take all the

1278
00:52:43,719 --> 00:52:48,358
little branches out and the eaves and

1279
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:49,879
he's takes 25 minutes before he's done

1280
00:52:48,358 --> 00:52:51,519
and then he also takes the rose and I

1281
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:53,599
make the little snake in there and then

1282
00:52:51,519 --> 00:52:56,880
that same yeah but there the guys got

1283
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:58,960
ours free every day so I we don't have

1284
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,240
that unfortunately but you know for

1285
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:04,079
everything there is something but I

1286
00:53:00,239 --> 00:53:06,519
think the hash will be more and more if

1287
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:08,920
you see our bubble has is really amazing

1288
00:53:06,519 --> 00:53:10,400
Rosen of course will never go away

1289
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:13,079
anymore because it tastes amazing you

1290
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,519
know live Rosen so that will stay then

1291
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:17,519
you have the cheaper versions like the

1292
00:53:14,519 --> 00:53:20,000
dry zift pollinator oh yeah these these

1293
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:22,000
static extractors I mean just the whole

1294
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,639
Statics thing now you know yeah going to

1295
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,798
Morocco with static machines it's pretty

1296
00:53:23,639 --> 00:53:27,719
wild yeah so yeah yeah there's for

1297
00:53:25,798 --> 00:53:29,480
everything there's a Market you know

1298
00:53:27,719 --> 00:53:30,959
especially for the nice brands that you

1299
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:32,838
know like you can be a little bit

1300
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,960
different because the build guys are not

1301
00:53:32,838 --> 00:53:36,519
going to go into that it's way too

1302
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:37,679
complicated for them you know right so

1303
00:53:36,519 --> 00:53:39,280
yeah there you can make a difference

1304
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:41,879
with your with your

1305
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:43,119
varieties yeah I think people were going

1306
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:45,079
I feel like we're going this direction

1307
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:46,760
of convenience people want everything

1308
00:53:45,079 --> 00:53:48,200
handed to the you know I think we live

1309
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:50,960
in a world of convenience so in my

1310
00:53:48,199 --> 00:53:52,039
opinion the hand rolls the the I like

1311
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,559
the hand rolls better but I think

1312
00:53:52,039 --> 00:53:56,079
quality is going to dictate a lot of it

1313
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:57,519
yeah look that's a little bit the the

1314
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:58,960
problem with the hand rolls I don't know

1315
00:53:57,519 --> 00:54:00,559
if you saw how we did in Thailand we

1316
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,760
work with these cans you know these tuna

1317
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:04,000
cans that are sealed and without

1318
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:06,000
nitrogen by the way we don't put

1319
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,239
nitrogen because the the the climate

1320
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
there is quite complicated with the

1321
00:54:07,239 --> 00:54:10,798
humidity so we're going to try to keep

1322
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,280
that good but you see that everywhere we

1323
00:54:10,798 --> 00:54:14,679
have the same problem in Amsterdam you

1324
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:16,480
know joints you have to crush them and

1325
00:54:14,679 --> 00:54:18,440
you can only keep them certain amount so

1326
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:21,199
we try to we make them like every week

1327
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:22,599
fresh you know so it is a it's a problem

1328
00:54:21,199 --> 00:54:24,598
product let's call it that way it's not

1329
00:54:22,599 --> 00:54:26,640
like you have a kilo in a bag and you

1330
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:28,798
can open it two two months later no this

1331
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:30,639
joint at one point has to be spoke you

1332
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:32,759
know because always dries out you know

1333
00:54:30,639 --> 00:54:34,838
especially in like here like in Las

1334
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:36,319
Vegas in Colorado you know all my

1335
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:40,318
friends that they have grossed like it's

1336
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:42,159
painting yes or no as far as uh I guess

1337
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:44,000
we touched on Strain Hunters how about

1338
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:45,279
powder feeding you know we didn't really

1339
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,400
touch on Powder feeding because you're

1340
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:49,280
also a nutrient company owner you guys

1341
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:51,079
ship internationally yeah we ship

1342
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:52,839
internationally worldwide we're like for

1343
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:55,400
example in South America we control like

1344
00:54:52,838 --> 00:54:57,119
60% of the market I think it's

1345
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:58,680
organically it's the number one product

1346
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:00,960
in the world it's very easy you know

1347
00:54:58,679 --> 00:55:02,679
it's a one component of course if your

1348
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:04,880
water is not so good you have to add

1349
00:55:02,679 --> 00:55:07,000
calcium and you can add a booster but

1350
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:09,640
it's a one component which everybody 10

1351
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,960
years ago said is not not possible but

1352
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:13,519
slowly you see all people using

1353
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:15,039
especially people in the house you know

1354
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:17,440
and so many other brands are now copying

1355
00:55:15,039 --> 00:55:19,079
your model yeah now everybody is getting

1356
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:22,240
the powder you know technically if you

1357
00:55:19,079 --> 00:55:23,599
think about all the liquid uh guys it

1358
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:26,439
doesn't make sense you know you're

1359
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:29,000
bringing water to the ocean yeah and big

1360
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:30,318
fopr you know it's just it's that simple

1361
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,920
so for us you know especially in

1362
00:55:30,318 --> 00:55:33,759
countries where it's more complicated

1363
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:36,440
like 1 kilo of this powerder is 1,000

1364
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:39,839
lit nearly and you you put it through

1365
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:41,838
your soil and uh and and it's good and

1366
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:45,078
then every 3 weeks you add a little so

1367
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:47,038
it's it's super easy and you see nearly

1368
00:55:45,079 --> 00:55:49,920
every hobby grower in Germany and

1369
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:53,640
Switzerland and Spain using it you know

1370
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:55,480
big big uh Big Grow operations don't use

1371
00:55:53,639 --> 00:55:57,078
it because they're all liquids they make

1372
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:59,599
them own or they buy them from some

1373
00:55:57,079 --> 00:56:01,280
certain companies but you know yeah I I

1374
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:03,440
like to propagate you know

1375
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:05,039
sustainability so that's why we sell the

1376
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,920
organic product and we sell it also in

1377
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:09,160
Mineral form for the guys who want to do

1378
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:12,639
rockco or cocoa or whatever you know

1379
00:56:09,159 --> 00:56:16,440
yeah I think pricewise and easy wise not

1380
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:18,679
17 bottles you know and if you try our

1381
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:20,400
organic stuff there's nothing better

1382
00:56:18,679 --> 00:56:23,558
taste better than that

1383
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:25,639
stuff so if you have one piece of advice

1384
00:56:23,559 --> 00:56:28,200
to some someone coming into the industry

1385
00:56:25,639 --> 00:56:30,838
or into the space what would that one

1386
00:56:28,199 --> 00:56:32,038
piece in the Bice be well it's very

1387
00:56:30,838 --> 00:56:35,078
difficult now I'm not going to lie about

1388
00:56:32,039 --> 00:56:37,319
that you know uh yeah find a good group

1389
00:56:35,079 --> 00:56:39,920
that you can work with and if your dream

1390
00:56:37,318 --> 00:56:41,599
is to start for yourself one day the

1391
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:43,720
only thing I can tell you is going to be

1392
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:46,480
a really hard work and you have to work

1393
00:56:43,719 --> 00:56:49,798
like 15 to 18 hours a day create your

1394
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:52,199
own brand you know grow organically

1395
00:56:49,798 --> 00:56:54,079
don't invest too much other people and

1396
00:56:52,199 --> 00:56:56,480
always always make sure you keep the

1397
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:59,280
majority in your own company so so

1398
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:00,519
nobody can run away with whatever that's

1399
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,720
