from legal you know and I can't even

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,320
imagine to be honest that's it's wild

17
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:42,878
that it it went through what it went

18
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,558
through especially because you had a

19
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:47,439
legal dispensary it's not like you were

20
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:48,759
breaking the law and you had some spot

21
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:50,439
in New York where you were selling

22
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:53,599
everything out of your you know your

23
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:55,119
BEDA yeah big tra you you were trying to

24
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,198
do it by the books and you're trying to

25
00:00:55,119 --> 00:01:00,078
do it the right way and uh it's a little

26
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:01,518
ridiculous yeah it was one of the the

27
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,399
reasons why we didn't think we were

28
00:01:01,518 --> 00:01:05,798
going to get that much time even when

29
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:08,560
after it all happened right is we were

30
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:10,080
like okay it's it's a cannabis case we

31
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,879
like we're following state law we are

32
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:15,079
paying our taxes we uh you know

33
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,719
everything was above board completely

34
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:17,759
legal in the state so we're like you

35
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:21,078
know what what are we going to get

36
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,478
probation a few years right no the

37
00:01:21,078 --> 00:01:24,679
federal government doesn't give out

38
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:26,599
probation or a few years yeah they

39
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,920
decided to throw the book at you oh yeah

40
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:31,519
oh yeah 22 years is what you originally

41
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,359
were sentenced for too yeah yeah it was

42
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:35,879
21 years 10 months is how the the FED

43
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:37,840
sentenced you in months right so when

44
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:41,000
you get when you get in you walk into

45
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,960
sentencing and the judge sentenced you

46
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,319
he goes you know scarm Masa we're

47
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,919
sentencing you to 262 months so now you

48
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:49,158
got to like sit there and do math right

49
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,840
you're like I'm like 262 month 26 and

50
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:53,200
I'm like whoa wait that's like 20

51
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,439
something years yeah so I didn't really

52
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,118
even get the exact number it was when he

53
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:58,798
when he initially said it because it was

54
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:00,560
I just was like well it's 20s something

55
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,200
years that's already already way more

56
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,640
than anyone any one of us could have

57
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,118
fathomed and then the the real fight

58
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,520
began after that the 14-year fight the

59
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:13,400
14-year fight that was a whole different

60
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,680
battle Yeah so we uh we met thanks to

67
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,439
dive back into where you got your start

68
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:34,560
with cannabis cuz Okay that was a while

69
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:36,199
back yeah I kind of I did like a Quinton

70
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,878
Tarantino to you right I started at the

71
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:40,639
end of the movie

72
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:42,039
right um so my star in cannabis was

73
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:43,479
really when I was born I guess if I

74
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:46,479
really back it all the way up my dad

75
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:48,079
grew cannabis um since I can remember it

76
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:49,759
I've been around cannabis in my

77
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,840
neighborhood our neighbors grew cannabis

78
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:54,840
like I grew up in California in the 90s

79
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,560
me Modesto in Modesto yeah so you know

80
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,000
every it was all around us you know so

81
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,360
we were immersed in the culture um I

82
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,120
grew my first cycle at 15 I think yeah

83
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,519
so I was like a sophomore in high school

84
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,719
and uh the the F the very it was an nl5

85
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,719
yeah and I didn't even get to I got it

86
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:14,878
to flower but right when I was about to

87
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:17,239
pull it my mom found it yanked it said

88
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:19,598
she said said she threw it away I think

89
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:21,319
my dad ended up burning it down but

90
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:22,798
whatever but that was my first that was

91
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:26,518
my first grow and I was in love with it

92
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:28,000
ever since then and um and then just

93
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:29,719
continued to kind of like you know back

94
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,199
then it was you were growing on the

95
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:33,919
Outlaw you know we were growing in

96
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,878
houses and you know renting houses out

97
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:37,839
and kind of Staggering them and doing

98
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:39,959
and then just kind of doing whatever we

99
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,920
could to keep certain genetics that we

100
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:45,360
wanted and uh then it all changed when

101
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,359
we started getting the medical cannabis

102
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,439
laws in California and then we kind of

103
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,480
saw like a different side of things and

104
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:54,438
you know in 96 it passed early but there

105
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:57,078
wasn't a whole lot going on early on no

106
00:03:54,438 --> 00:04:00,078
it was it was very gray area at best it

107
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:02,120
was very gray area and there wasn't like

108
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:04,239
there was no real real like legal legal

109
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,158
shops that you could go to the Bay had

110
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,120
like Dennis prone had some of the you

111
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:11,000
know the early you know a patients um

112
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,519
clubs that they had and collectives

113
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,039
really really early on but some of your

114
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:16,639
legal shops really didn't start coming

115
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:19,039
around until like the early 2000s right

116
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,560
and in around

117
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,400
2003 um I'm going to get legal on you

118
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,879
real quick but the the r decision comes

119
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:28,758
down on the ninth circuit and it

120
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:30,680
basically barred the DEA from raiding

121
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:34,000
anybody in California that was following

122
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,879
medical cannabis laws so now we we kind

123
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,120
of the the medical cannabis laws were

124
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:38,839
always there while we were growing

125
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,240
Outlaw and doing our thing right but we

126
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:41,799
were always everybody was always kind of

127
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,199
leery of them because the feds could

128
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,960
always come in and Trump state law right

129
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,840
and they did and they did many times

130
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:52,198
yeah many times so when that decision

131
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:56,638
came barring them or is an injunction I

132
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:59,038
think back then um with Angel re um

133
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,280
going against the federal government for

134
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:03,519
or the de EA and they got the injunction

135
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:05,319
and then so we we sat down and we were

136
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:07,120
like wow now this opens an opportunity

137
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:10,038
for us now if we can open it's like an

138
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,240
easy transition it's like in a field I

139
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:14,240
already have a degree in now they're now

140
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,519
they're offering a a position to in an

141
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:21,360
emerging market right right so we sat

142
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:24,478
down uh my partner Ricardo Montes um

143
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,479
shout out Ricardo he's a big fan too man

144
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:29,560
um and you know we sat down and we

145
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:31,599
initially were like okay like let's

146
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,519
let's explore opening a store so I

147
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,520
talked to one of my friends he's he's

148
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:40,120
kind of working at a doctor's office in

149
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:41,680
the Bay Area and it was in a building

150
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,439
where they they had to they had the

151
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,439

152
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:46,918

00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:22,560
expect right so you're like walking in

171
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:26,079
there I walk up the stairs and when I

172
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:29,199
get to the top of the stairs it looked

173
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:31,879
like like a mom and pop spot like a like

174
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,240
a like a old coffee shop but on the

175
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:37,038
board behind them it's not beans it's

176
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,319
cannabis all behind them and there and I

177
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:40,279
sat there and like they had like a

178
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,960
little like seating area where you could

179
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:43,799
consume and smoke and everything it was

180
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:45,159
dope it was like the setup was was cool

181
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,160
and then on the left they had all these

182
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,120
like clones and and all the genetics

183
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,000
that they were selling and all the

184
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,959
cultivars that they had going on so I

185
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,639
sat down at the table and just kind of

186
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:56,318
sat back and just wanted to watch it and

187
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,439
so I sat there for like an hour and

188
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,879
watched this spot just go through people

189
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:04,000
and and people walk out happy and and

190
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:06,039
the atmosphere was like really eclectic

191
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,598
there was like people from all walks of

192
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:10,560
life yeah everybody everybody it was

193
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:11,918
crazy it was a mix of everybody like

194
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,360
anyone you could think of from the

195
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:16,918
skater to the rock guy to the football

196
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,280
player to the whatever you know what I'm

197
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:21,918
saying it was everything um so I got

198
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:24,399
back I talked to my partner and I said

199
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:26,439
hey we got to do this man like this is

200
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:29,038
our dream like this this is it right

201
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:30,240
here like this we we we we can really do

202
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:32,719
this

203
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,840
so he's like all right where do you want

204
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,360
to do it at so I'm like the Central

205
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:39,399
Valley those of you that don't know the

206
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,120
Central Valley the Central Valley is

207
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:42,598
like the California is a blue state

208
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,800
right the Central Valley is like the

209
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:47,918
pocket of really high conservatism very

210
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,158
red very red yeah like it's like the

211
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:52,719
only counties that voted for Trump like

212
00:07:50,158 --> 00:07:54,839
consistently and they do it's always

213
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,280
been like that it's it's changing a

214
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:58,198
little bit now it's changing a little

215
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:59,478
bit now and I and I will give give them

216
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:02,240
credit there are a lot of people that

217
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:05,439
are working hard to to to to make the

218
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,000
policies there that um uh more inclusive

219
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:09,000
and make it to where it's Justice for

220
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,319
everybody right that's what we want so

221
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,478
shout out to the people that are working

222
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,520
in Modesto to to to make the pendulum

223
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:19,240
swing the other way but at that time it

224
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:21,439
was really conservative yeah so we we

225
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,800
sit down and we say hey where are we

226
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:25,519
going to open this up at so we decide on

227
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,879
Stockton because Stockton is in the

228
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:28,598
Central Valley but Stockton's a little

229
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,800
bit more liberal it's like we're like

230
00:08:28,598 --> 00:08:30,878
okay

231
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,479
it's a little rougher it's a little

232
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,240
looser right we might can go into

233
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,519
Stockton and maybe like they'll want

234
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,278
some business there right we're going to

235
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:40,479
give them tax dollars like maybe they'll

236
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:42,599
be open to it we go into the city

237
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:46,560
council meeting to meet with the mayor

238
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:49,278
and the city council and within like I

239
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:51,439
don't think we got four words out before

240
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:54,559
they were like no not in our

241
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,959
city and now we're like well that didn't

242
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:57,838
go exactly how we thought it was going

243
00:08:55,958 --> 00:09:00,599
to go like we were kind of expecting

244
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,800
some negotiation Maybe and like hey you

245
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,278
this is where we want you at it was like

246
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:06,958
a dead

247
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:09,439
no so we go back to the drawing board we

248
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:11,399
go back to our attorney at the time and

249
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,600
we say hey this is what they said and

250
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:15,879
he's he he he was very knowledgeable

251
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,759
about the cannabis laws back then and he

252
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:21,799
says you don't have to ask the city to

253
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:23,360
open he said it's a state law he said as

254
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:25,599
long as they don't have like any banss

255
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,159
or anything in place already you don't

256
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,560
have to get the city's permission to

257
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:31,319
open a dispensary you just have to make

258
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:33,078
sure that you go through all the correct

259
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,240
processes and get the correct licenses

260
00:09:33,078 --> 00:09:38,039
and everything so we're like all right

261
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,919
cool why don't we just open it in

262
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:42,480
Modesto then that's our home city right

263
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:43,958
and that's where we have the most love

264
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,519
the biggest support the biggest network

265
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:49,399
of Growers everything so we decided to

266
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:52,278
open Modesto

267
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:53,559
and man it was it was a hard decision

268
00:09:52,278 --> 00:09:56,200
right

269
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:57,799
because it almost felt like the people

270
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,278
who were signing their names to the

271
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:02,639
Declaration of Independence right it was

272
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:05,919
like here we

273
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:08,838
are we're openly

274
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:12,120
defying what you got defying your your

275
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:14,279
federal laws we openly defying the

276
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,759
community Norms

277
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:20,039
right and we're on the main strip in the

278
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:24,039
city yeah right out there right out

279
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:27,278
there yeah big Target big Target yeah I

280
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:29,278
mean what people don't understand is if

281
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:31,720
you didn't do it and people like you did

282
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:34,000
do it it wouldn't be that way this day

283
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:36,399
today you know I

284
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,799
think you know there's sacrifices that

285
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,039
people had to make for us to have

286
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:42,519
legalization and people tend to forget

287
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:44,639
the past or they they they remember what

288
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:47,320
they want yeah but not necessarily the

289
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:51,159
important parts well the memory is short

290
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:52,920
right yeah so it's like especially like

291
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:55,039
my daughter's generation I always use

292
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:58,639
her as example Jasmine I love you I know

293
00:10:55,039 --> 00:11:01,120
you're probably tuning in so it my bad

294
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:02,919
for putting on the spot here but it's

295
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,360
the other like the her generation she's

296
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:07,958
21 right they grew up knowing nothing

297
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,759
but legalization really right right they

298
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,958
grew up knowing all the stores on the

299
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,078
corners and everything so they don't

300
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:14,759
really even understand like she does of

301
00:11:13,078 --> 00:11:16,479
course because she went through it but

302
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:19,319
you know that generation doesn't

303
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,000
understand like what it took to get here

304
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,560
right like even the bud tender your bud

305
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,799
tender that you walk into a dispensary

306
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:27,399
right now is what like 21 through 30 you

307
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:31,078
know what I'm saying that main age

308
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:32,639
bracket and and don't know so it's it's

309
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:34,319
interesting when I go in there and I get

310
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,000
to like talk to to some of the bud

311
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,519
tenders or some of that generation and

312
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,278
and just kind of talk to them like yo

313
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:42,560
like to get to where we're at today like

314
00:11:40,278 --> 00:11:44,838
we had to do like we had we showed up to

315
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:46,838
work every day not

316
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:50,440
knowing if we were going to go to jail

317
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:53,120
or not yeah or get murdered or get shot

318
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:55,120
or robbed or anything yeah it was crazy

319
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,560
man it was a totally different time yeah

320
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,480
and the people and the Pioneers at that

321
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:02,039
time that really put it out there my hat

322
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:05,360
goes off to them because they took the

323
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:06,919
risks their families took the risks and

324
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,120
you know what the crazy thing is James

325
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:10,838
is a lot of them are still in there yeah

326
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,000
a lot of them are still in there a lot

327
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:14,160
of them

328
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,039
yeah yeah it's pretty

329
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:19,958
wild pretty wild that we can operate to

330
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:23,078
the extent we can operate legally and

331
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:25,399
there's still people locked up for it

332
00:12:23,078 --> 00:12:26,719
it's just yeah there's a lot of things

333
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:27,958
that are counterintuitive and that's

334
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,278
definitely one of them it just doesn't

335
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:32,799
make sense on any level it was one of

336
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:35,120
the frustrating things to me as I was

337
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:36,439
sitting in prison during that 14 years

338
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,159
right and

339
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:42,399
watching the industry grow because like

340
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:44,879
I love the plant I'm a huge fan I'm

341
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,120
passionate about the plant so I'm like

342
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:47,838
watching this progress like as a

343
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,600
cheerleader like yeah let's go you know

344
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,680
what I'm saying but at the same time I'm

345
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,278
watching corporations and governments

346
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:56,359
Bank millions of dollars yeah on the

347
00:12:54,278 --> 00:12:59,278
same thing I'm sitting in a sale for

348
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:01,639
right and the same thing a few 2,000

349
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:03,320
other people are sitting in a Cell for

350
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:04,919
so it was really it was like I had mixed

351
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:07,079
emotions on it right because I'm like

352
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:08,919
sitting there like really champion and

353
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:11,638
on the industry and the growth because I

354
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:14,120
know that as it grows it becomes more

355
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:15,879
accepted be we we see the more people

356
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:19,679
see the benefits of the

357
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:22,559
plant so you know it was it was a tough

358
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:25,120
one but yeah yeah and then so you went

359
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:28,198
through the appeal process yeah and that

360
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:31,360
was that was a fight as well yeah yeah

361
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:35,039
so we open the dispensary for like we

362
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:37,278
run it for two years MH

363
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:39,639
great and then the city begins to do

364
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:42,559
like a litigation against us they don't

365
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:46,360
want us there right and they

366
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:48,719
go all right look what we need you to do

367
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,720
is tell us what it would take to recoup

368
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,278
your costs and then some and the amount

369
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,278
of time and we'll give you that amount

370
00:13:52,278 --> 00:13:57,240
of time unharassed to be able to you

371
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:59,360
know continue to do business but after

372
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,039
that we have to agree on a date and it

373
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,720
wasn't I was like that's not that

374
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,159
doesn't even sound agreeable to me like

375
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,440
what do you mean like just recoup our

376
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:10,319
money and like tuck our tails and and

377
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,079
get on our way like the communities out

378
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,278
here like supporting us tremendously

379
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:14,519
we're going to these City Council

380
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:16,480
meetings and you know like a city

381
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:17,839
council meeting has like 20 people at it

382
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,320
these City Council meetings have like

383
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,720
400 people at them so much that there's

384
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,120
people in like the Overflow outside like

385
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,120
watching on the monitors when we're

386
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,000
having like anything cannabis a lot of

387
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,198
supporters yeah there like tremendous it

388
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,919
was huge

389
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:34,078
so the city wants us out of there and

390
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:36,599
then what they end up

391
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:39,000
doing is they realize that they're going

392
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,759
to lose in the litigation they realized

393
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,159
that we have really solid case law

394
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:44,879
behind us we were we were doing business

395
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:48,519
before any of their banss or

396
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:49,799
moratoriums and they basically decided

397
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:52,198
hey if we can't get these guys out of

398
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:56,120
here we're going to call the fans wow

399
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:57,439
yep so on my daughter's birthday in 2006

400
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,679
on Jasmine's

401
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,360
birthday uh the feds raid us in the

402
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:05,039
morning at like 6:00 a.m. with machine

403
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:07,800
guns coming in kicking in doors it was

404
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:11,439
like if you watch like a documentary

405
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:12,879
raid in like um fua or Iraq or something

406
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,199
that's how that's how it was done they

407
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:16,480
all black tactic and the crazy thing is

408
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:19,159
they knew I was there by

409
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,360
myself it was it was it was it was total

410
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:22,879
Overkill

411
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,959
overreach but it it it was typical of

412
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:27,480
the time right that's how dispensary

413
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:29,000
owners and operators were treated like

414
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,639
they were families would would they

415
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,559
would kick your door in they take your

416
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,079
family out into the front lawn and stuff

417
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:38,159
like that and it was it was crazy it was

418
00:15:35,078 --> 00:15:41,758
a crazy time and then yeah we we went

419
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:43,799
through and we found guilty in trial

420
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,879
because we couldn't prevent present a

421
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:48,240
defense really you can't say the words

422
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:50,759
medical marijuana you can't say state

423
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,519
law we couldn't bring any of our tax

424
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:55,680
documents in so the government on one

425
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,120
hand gets to or the prosecution on one

426
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:59,879
hand gets to paint us as these huge like

427
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,440
drug kingpins that are flooding the

428
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:05,360
community with weed and we have to like

429
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:08,199
try to sneak in like language here and

430
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,560
there of oh no we were paying taxes and

431
00:16:08,198 --> 00:16:12,399
we had a license and you know and they

432
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:15,239
would object and strike the record it

433
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:17,958
was it was it was a kangaroo court yeah

434
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:20,799
so not surprisingly we were found guilty

435
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:23,758
sentenced to 22 years and or 21 years 10

436
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:26,240
months and 20 years for my my brother

437
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:31,120
Ricardo and then like I said the fight

438
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:33,919
began then our first appeal was dead in

439
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,240
2011 that was our direct appeal that one

440
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:37,240
was really like the shot through the

441
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,399
heart because that's when you really

442
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,240
like you think okay there's a chance I

443
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:42,879
had this one judge and maybe he didn't

444
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,440
see it the way I wanted him to but this

445
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:47,039
is going to a three-judge panel in the

446
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,600
ninth circuit which is one of the most

447
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:50,919
liberal circuits in the country so we're

448
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,680
like oh we're going to get a good Shake

449
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:56,360
nobody gives any a a 20e sentence to a

450
00:16:53,679 --> 00:17:00,318
dispensary operator like that's unheard

451
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:03,278
of yeah

452
00:17:00,318 --> 00:17:04,480
denied right they gave it to me and they

453
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:07,240
said you're going to keep it and you're

454
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,279
going to do it

455
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,838
wow so then like for for for the

456
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,720
listeners that are familiar with the

457
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:17,078
legal process forgive me but for those

458
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:18,880
that aren't it's a Byzantine Maze of

459
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:20,519
like motions and stuff once you lose

460
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,559
your direct appeal and you go off on

461
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:24,400
your own now now there's no legal help

462
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:26,879
anymore now you're just in prison and

463
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,880
you either learn the law or you

464
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,320
hopefully you got your parents or people

465
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,720
got money to be able to get a lawyer

466
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:33,879
that knows the law for you because

467
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,400
there's there's no court obligation for

468
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,360
you anymore like when you go through

469
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,960
trial they got to provide an attorney

470
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:42,000
for you once you're convicted it's game

471
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,480
over

472
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,200
so I had to spend like the first like

473
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:50,919
five years in prison in the law library

474
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:54,360
wow just learning the law because I was

475
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:57,320
like man like I was still like dumb

476
00:17:54,359 --> 00:18:00,199
enough to be like this isn't right like

477
00:17:57,319 --> 00:18:01,158
they can't do this to me mhm you know

478
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,120
the

479
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:05,520
irrational convictions of Youth right it

480
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:07,119
made me sit down and learn law and I had

481
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:10,240
to do it the oldfashioned way like not

482
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:11,719
with computers it was books like you got

483
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,240
you got to a book and then you got to

484
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,798
one part of the case and then it said go

485
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,359
see this other case and you had to set

486
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:18,639
that book down and then you had to go

487
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:19,918
back into the library and find that book

488
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,960
and then that might have only been like

489
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:26,559
a couple sentences you needed yeah right

490
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:28,440
so it was it was crazy but I learned

491
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:31,000
like I really learned it like that you

492
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,679
know I learned it the hard way so I

493
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,679
learned how to file my habus Corpus

494
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:37,559
motion

495
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:40,200
2255 I learned to file 22 41s and these

496
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:42,960
unique motions to try to just challenge

497
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,919
anything right none of it worked yeah

498
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,960
like I got man I got shot down so many

499
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:48,480
times like it was crazy at first at the

500
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,880
beginning I was like real hopeful I

501
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,038
would call home and be like yo I got

502
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,320
this in there man I'm hopeful maybe you

503
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:58,480
know something might shake and it would

504
00:18:55,319 --> 00:19:00,839
get denied or it would get you know shot

505
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,798
back and then I'd have to call back home

506
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:04,279
and be

507
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:06,519
like didn't

508
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:09,440
work

509
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:14,079
and after a few times doing

510
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,080
that I stopped telling them about

511
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:27,240
[ __ ]

512
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:30,240
because you you have so many letdowns

513
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
right

514
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,400
you have so many letdowns

515
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:42,119
and like I can take them

516
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:42,119
yeah

517
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:46,280
but I didn't want to keep giving them to

518
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:49,440
my

519
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:49,440
family thank

520
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:57,038
you I didn't want to keep giving them to

521
00:19:52,279 --> 00:20:00,599
my family so it got to a point

522
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:01,879
where I I would just like kind of do my

523
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,918
thing you know what I mean I'd file

524
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,679
these

525
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:07,240
motions study the law and hopefully find

526
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,960
something man that where I could

527
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:11,519
something to where a judge would

528
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,798
recognize the Injustice of my

529
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:16,599
sentence and that was it right it was

530
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:19,359
like I'm sitting there like in this

531
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:22,359
situation and I'm like I have to find a

532
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:25,759
way like to argue this in a compelling

533
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:27,759
way that a judge will say cuz you can't

534
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:29,558
just go in and say oh weed's legal in

535
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,759
the state let me out the feds don't care

536
00:20:29,558 --> 00:20:34,038
about that they don't it doesn't matter

537
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:37,079
how many states legalize if you're in

538
00:20:34,038 --> 00:20:38,919
federal prison it doesn't matter so I

539
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:41,918
had to find a way to make a judge

540
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:45,159
realize that the case my case was an

541
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:47,280
injustice on the on its surface just

542
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:49,480
because I was following state law and

543
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:51,798
because of the changing legal landscape

544
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,720
of all of cannabis even in the federal

545
00:20:51,798 --> 00:20:57,079
government the federal government has

546
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:58,679
evolved tremendously from 2008 where

547
00:20:57,079 --> 00:21:02,759
they were initially

548
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:05,840
right so in 2014 Obama launches What's

549
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:08,400
called the clemency Project 2014 and

550
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:10,519
it's seeking out people who have

551
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,798
outdated sentences from non-violent drug

552
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:15,079
offenses that if they came before the

553
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:17,000
court today would get a lesser sentence

554
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:19,839
right we were like perfect me and

555
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,119
Ricardo were like C perfect candidates

556
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:24,079
poster children for this right so we

557
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:26,158
were like okay cool I wrote The Motions

558
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:28,798
up I studied how to do it I got with my

559
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:31,760
boy Wen Angelo we had linked up a little

560
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:34,440
bit before won had 55e sentence for

561
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:36,278
cannabis um really knowledgeable about

562
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:38,480
the law shout out to wen Angelos and

563
00:21:36,278 --> 00:21:39,839
reform brand he he launched reform brand

564
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,720
which is a dope brand check it out

565
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:45,439
support him so I got with Welden we

566
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,400
wrote These petitions they're identical

567
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,000
they B they basically had the name

568
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,720
changed on them you know because our

569
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,720
case we were tried together our case

570
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,038
conduct was the same right we file these

571
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,400
petitions and we wait and we wait and

572
00:21:56,038 --> 00:22:00,679
we're like man we got a really good

573
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:02,880
chance in January of 17 the the

574
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:04,400
beginning like the 6th or the 7th I get

575
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,400
I get called into the office and they

576
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,080
sayhe sit down I'm like oh man this is

577
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,640
crazy like I think I might have got it

578
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:14,000
like I might have I might have got

579
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,360
clemency because we were just we were

580
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,599
we're great candidates we had

581
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:20,000
non-violent cannabis offense following

582
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:22,119
state law had a license paid or like you

583
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,319
know the list just keeps going so I'm

584
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:26,079
like we perfect for this legalization

585
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:29,359
was going on everything was going on at

586
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:31,678
this time Obama was was was doing

587
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:33,399
interviews and throwing language out

588
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:37,360
there that sounded like real supportive

589
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:38,840
of cannabis and things like that so we

590
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:41,038
were really hopeful I get called into

591
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:42,558
the office I sit down and they say hey

592
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:44,640
uh this just came in from the pardon

593
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:47,558
attorney I'm like yeah what is it and

594
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:50,919
they slide it over to me is a

595
00:22:47,558 --> 00:22:50,918
denial and I'm

596
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:57,039
like so it don't they don't tell you why

597
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:58,319
you're denied it just says executive

598
00:22:57,038 --> 00:22:59,640
privilege they don't need to tell

599
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:02,399
anybody you just denied you could

600
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:05,000
reapply in a year I call call home and

601
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,840
tell him I got denied I tell him to let

602
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,240
Ricardo know just so that he would you

603
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:11,839
know kind of not not I was still hopeful

604
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,319
for him so it wasn't like brace for

605
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:15,558
something bad but just know hey mine

606
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:18,918
already came through you know this it

607
00:23:15,558 --> 00:23:23,119
didn't work out and then on the 19th of

608
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:26,240
January the day before Trump took

609
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:28,558
office uh Ricardo gets granted clemency

610
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:32,120
wow yeah it was it was one of Obama's

611
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:33,599
last acts and he called Ricardo sentence

612
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:36,399
uh unfair and

613
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:39,439
outdated but not yours but not

614
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,600
mine I wrote I wrote the petitions they

615
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,798
were yeah they literally just had the

616
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:48,480
name changed on the top of

617
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:51,879
them so I don't know whatever like it

618
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:54,079
goes through a crazy process that

619
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,039
hopefully the justice department and

620
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:57,359
everybody over there can get streamlined

621
00:23:56,038 --> 00:23:59,400
but it's kind of a mess right now it's

622
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:02,359
like a seven layer process it's super

623
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:05,519
bureaucratic MH it can end up on any

624
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:09,158
kind of career Prosecutor's desk and get

625
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:14,278
denied at any one of those stages wow so

626
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:19,600
yeah it it that was like oh so in

627
00:24:14,278 --> 00:24:21,519
2018 bear with me in 2018 um Trump

628
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:23,639
passes a prison reform bill called the

629
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:25,839
first step act I say Trump passed it but

630
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,520
it was a bipartisan thing and and the

631
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:30,759
Dems have been working on it for a long

632
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:34,398
time as well but it was it was passed

633
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:36,879
with everybody coming together and

634
00:24:34,398 --> 00:24:40,199
buried like in this legislation is this

635
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:44,120
like unknown statute called

636
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:45,960
3582 right and this and this guy sends

637
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:49,038
it to me is he's an attorney on the

638
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:51,480
street he says Luke I think there might

639
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:53,640
be like a back door in this like piece

640
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:56,880
of legislation that they passed that

641
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:58,480
allows prisoners to directly petition

642
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,919
the court

643
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,278
because otherwise you don't have a way

644
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:04,080
to get in once you go through your

645
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:05,880
direct appeal and your habius Corpus the

646
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:07,519
court doesn't hear you anymore you can't

647
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,440
send them anything you can't just keep

648
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:12,278
saying hey let me out like once you've

649
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,558
exhausted your appeals it's done you

650
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:15,278
know what I mean there's the court you

651
00:25:13,558 --> 00:25:17,558
have no what they say is you have no

652
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:21,798
vehicle to come in back into court with

653
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:25,639
right so this was that vehicle and now

654
00:25:21,798 --> 00:25:29,359
in 2018 after California has their recck

655
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:32,080
laws going and we have you know multiple

656
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:34,000
years of the Roar Barker bar

657
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:36,359
Appropriations Amendment that's barring

658
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,398
the DEA and and the or the Department of

659
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:40,599
Justice from using their funds in states

660
00:25:38,398 --> 00:25:43,079
where cannabis is legal so we we have a

661
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:44,359
series of things that have happened in

662
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:47,798
over the course of the last few years

663
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:49,959
that's making it to where I think now if

664
00:25:47,798 --> 00:25:51,519
I present it before a judge and I do it

665
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,360
in the right way like I said in a

666
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:55,759
compelling way where I don't necessarily

667
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:58,439
only argue cannabis but argue it in a

668
00:25:55,759 --> 00:26:00,640
way where the Cannabis is the main

669
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:04,360
Foundation of this Injustice because of

670
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:07,159
what's going on in the whole us today

671
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:09,759
right I had a I had multiple people help

672
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:12,840
me Ed lman over at Emerald Law Group

673
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:15,720
helped um filed excellent motion on my

674
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:19,240
behalf I filed the initial motion um Ed

675
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:22,120
filed Ed filed a motion um and then

676
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:25,000
we're kind of waiting and a huge law

677
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:27,959
firm called King and spaling contacts me

678
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,720
and they asked to come on to to to help

679
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:32,240
out and it was like a godsend and they

680
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:34,798
send this lady to come on and help me

681
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,640
named Carrie Dent shout out to Carrie

682
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:40,798
Dent the sweetest looking lady you would

683
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:45,038
ever meet right but when it comes to the

684
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:47,319
law she is vicious I mean she went in

685
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:49,640
and demolished the government like I've

686
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:52,798
never seen like such a one-sided like

687
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:54,880
battle in motions before seeing how

688
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:57,278
Carrie like just went in just like kind

689
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,960
of just dismantled like every like point

690
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:01,759
that the government was using to keep me

691
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:05,079
in there lo and behold after she came on

692
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:07,720
um to make a long story short brother it

693
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:09,798
in February 3rd of this year I was

694
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:11,600
released from prison because of Carrie

695
00:27:09,798 --> 00:27:15,519
Dent because of king of Spalding because

696
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:18,038
of Ed lman because of Freedom grow

697

00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,919
beard Bros because of everybody because

700
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,519
the the entire

701
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,038
community and and iies for anybody I

702
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:31,119
miss I know I miss a tremendous amount

703
00:27:30,038 --> 00:27:33,720
of people I could probably do your whole

704
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:36,119
show thinking people I'm serious like no

705
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,960
no lie but because of the community that

706
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:40,278
came came behind me I was able to get

707
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:42,159
out it wasn't just because I found that

708
00:27:40,278 --> 00:27:44,679
motion somebody shot that to me right

709
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,760
and then I I filed it and then the

710
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:48,360
community got behind me and attorneys

711
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:51,558
got behind me and they were able to get

712
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:55,199
me out and it was the greatest feeling

713
00:27:51,558 --> 00:27:57,918
in the world man like when I got to hug

714
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,919
my daughter like on that night like I

715
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:03,200
flew they I was in I was in a prison in

716
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:05,399
Mississippi a place called yazu

717
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,919
Mississippi yazu City

718
00:28:05,398 --> 00:28:10,839
Mississippi it's like it sounds like

719
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:14,000
what it is I'll just say that it's like

720
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:17,158
50 years in a Time Warp wow you know

721
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,720
what I mean and it's like small

722
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:22,080
Southern

723
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:24,079
um like the way they incarcerate people

724
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:25,519
is different in the South it's just a

725
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:29,398
different culture and a different

726
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:31,120
mentality right so I say that to say

727
00:28:29,398 --> 00:28:33,239
this I was ready to leave when they said

728
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:36,038
it was time to go so they put me on a

729
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:38,919
plane I fly back to California I fly

730
00:28:36,038 --> 00:28:41,319
into Sacramento Airport I meet my

731
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:44,320
daughter at a Denny's that was my first

732
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:46,398
my first time seeing her in so long man

733
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:47,398
I mean I had she she came she was one of

734
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:50,119
my biggest

735
00:28:47,398 --> 00:28:51,798
supporters I love her to death she came

736
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:53,439
up and visited me you know throughout

737
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:54,960
all those years but then covid happened

738
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,679
and then I got shipped out of state and

739
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,600
then I got shipped to Louisiana and then

740
00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:00,840
to Mississippi

741
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:01,918
so by the time I actually ended up

742
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:05,599
seeing

743
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:08,600
her it was like 5 years since last time

744
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:10,839
I had saw her wow so it was a really

745
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:14,278
emotional moment but like I said the

746
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:19,558
best feeling in the world man I bet

747
00:29:14,278 --> 00:29:21,640
yeah wow so let's let's talk about uh Co

748
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:24,119
because I think Co was pival in a lot of

749
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:26,000
ways in the book I mean yeah I read some

750
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:28,839
really interesting things in your book

751
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,278
yeah you know how you wrote the book you

752
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:31,558
know I think that that's pretty

753
00:29:30,278 --> 00:29:32,960
impressive if you want to go into that

754
00:29:31,558 --> 00:29:36,558
how you got the

755
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:39,558
paper it's like that that's actually a

756
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:41,960
really interesting story um so I end up

757
00:29:39,558 --> 00:29:44,480
in solitary a lot during my 14-year

758
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:46,440
period and you can end up in solitary

759
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,278
for anything like solit they'll put you

760
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:50,600
in solitary confinement for anything a

761
00:29:48,278 --> 00:29:53,960
few times was for a dirty dirty weed

762
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:57,038
test and I did like my my first dirty

763
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:59,679
weed test in prison was in long pooke

764
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:02,519
and I think I did like 75 days they call

765
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:05,480
it the shoe it stands it's an acronym

766
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:06,798
Shu and secure housing unit is what they

767
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,319
call it but it's solitary confinement

768
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:12,359
they throw you back in a sale you don't

769
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:14,759
see anybody your food comes in a slot uh

770
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:16,479
if you want to go out of your cell you

771
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:18,480
get one hour of recreation but

772
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,720
Recreation is in like a dog kennel it's

773
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,360
like a really small like cage like down

774
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,159
the hall from your cell so you don't

775
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:27,439
really ever get to go out wow and

776
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:29,000
there's no like sunlight or anything I

777
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,320
mean they have a window but it's painted

778
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,599
over um it's artificial light so it's a

779
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:36,918
rough existence torture and I don't

780
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:40,759
think I think in 50 years from now like

781
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:42,960
they will deem it Torture right but

782
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:45,519
so I had always wanted to write the

783
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,600
story high price like it was always in

784
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:49,159
the Forefront of my mind but I got

785
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:51,398
frustrated when I would have to try to

786
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:53,440
write like a 10-page essay like I'd be

787
00:30:51,398 --> 00:30:54,918
like dude I don't want to write this so

788
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,000
I'm like how am I going to sit down and

789
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:58,480
write like this book like this story

790
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,880
like cuz to sit down and write this

791
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,480
story I knew it was going to take a

792
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,679
lot

793
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:09,079
so I you know try to sit try to force

794
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:12,320
myself to sit down a few times and I got

795
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:13,960
like 10 pages done I think and then I

796
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:16,480
end up going back into

797
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:20,120
solitary and this time it was for like

798
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,759
seven months so I'm sitting in my my

799
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:24,199
cell in

800
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:26,440
solitary and you like books are your

801
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,000
Lifeline in there like if you have books

802
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:30,200
you're pretty cool like you can sit

803
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,599
there and read maybe like work out for a

804
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,080
couple hours write a letter read some

805
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:35,519
more like it kind of makes it to where

806
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:37,158
you can break your day up a little bit

807
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,960
right but I run out of I run out of

808
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:41,440
books

809
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,200
and if you don't catch the guard coming

810
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,480
through with the book cart which they

811
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,840
come whenever they want to really then

812
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,639
there's no way to get it other than the

813
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:49,959
mail and sometimes they play with the

814
00:31:48,638 --> 00:31:51,798
mail back there too so you're not

815
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:55,639
getting mail for like a week or two

816
00:31:51,798 --> 00:31:57,480
weeks or three weeks at a time W so I

817
00:31:55,638 --> 00:32:00,119
run out of books and now I'm like all

818
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,839
right I got to figure something out like

819
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:04,239
something to occupy my

820
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:06,240
time so I said man I wanted to write

821
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,200

822
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,798
I'm sitting down in here I I just like I

823
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:13,159
felt this like it might sound crazy but

824
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:15,440
I felt like this presence that just

825
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:17,320
saying like yo this is for this like

826
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,480
this is why you are in here like to sit

827
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:20,638
here and do

828
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,159
this so I'm like all right this is what

829
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:23,959
I'm GNA I'm going to make the agreement

830
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:26,278
with myself I'm going make a deal with

831
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:29,038
myself I'm going to I'm I'm going to say

832
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:30,839
I'm going to write for Pages a day and

833
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:32,440
that's it I'm not gonna get I don't care

834
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:34,240
even how they come out I'm just going to

835
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,558
sit down I'm gonna force myself to sit

836
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,359
down I'm gonna write four pages a day

837
00:32:35,558 --> 00:32:40,000
and just see what happen so I do it and

838
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:43,000
then like after

839
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,798
like you know two weeks I got like 40 or

840
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,398
50 pages sitting on the side of me and

841
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:49,398
I'm like looking over there I'm like I

842
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:51,719
have something now it's like something

843
00:32:49,398 --> 00:32:54,079
real now so now I'm kind of getting like

844
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:56,038
a little excited now at my my writing

845
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:59,000
time it was like 1 to like

846
00:32:56,038 --> 00:33:01,319
4:00 I'm getting excited now I'm like

847
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,319
okay hold on so I saw I just keep

848
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:07,558
writing I keep writing and after

849
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:10,918
like few months back there I I finished

850
00:33:07,558 --> 00:33:12,240
and I was like okay like well hold on

851
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:14,200
let me back up though you're right hold

852
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,200
on I I skipped one of the most important

853
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:19,120
parts so that first day I figure okay

854
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,159
I'm gonna write this right so I write my

855
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:23,439
four pages well there's a reason that I

856
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:26,760
say I'm going to write four

857
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:29,000
pages it's cuz that's all they give you

858
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:30,759
you only get four pages of paper back

859
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,119
there so I didn't think it all the way

860
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:33,240
through at that time I'm like yeah I'm

861
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:35,558
going to get these I'm going to start

862
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:37,599
writing my book and get these four pages

863
00:33:35,558 --> 00:33:40,519
out a day well you only get four pages a

864
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:43,278
week and you get two envelopes and you

865
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:45,399
get one little Flex pen like a little

866
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:46,839
half like clear pen that you know bends

867
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:49,079
so that you can't kill anybody with it

868
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:51,199
or something I guess I run into the

869
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:53,519
immediate problem that I'm gonna be a

870
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,960
out of paper really fast and then B out

871
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:58,759
of ink like shortly after

872
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:00,639
that so the way you get paper back there

873
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:02,638
is like the orderly comes behind the

874
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:04,719
officer that's giving trays out and he

875
00:34:02,638 --> 00:34:07,798
like pushes a cart like once a week and

876
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:10,000
gives you like some supplies soap pens

877
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:12,358
you know writing paper things like

878
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,639
that so like I slide a note to the

879
00:34:12,358 --> 00:34:17,398
orderly and the note says basically like

880
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:19,599
hey I need more pens and paper in this

881
00:34:17,398 --> 00:34:21,960
sale and I'll pay you for it like just

882
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,838
let me know whatever you want so he's

883
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,960
like everything is everything is for

884
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:27,878
sale in prison everything like if you

885
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:29,000
have money doesn't matter what it is

886
00:34:27,878 --> 00:34:30,679
somebody's going to try to make it

887
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,280
happen

888
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:35,878
right so he says he sends me back in a

889
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,599
cut what we call him kites right so he

890
00:34:35,878 --> 00:34:42,000
sends me back a kite and it says on it

891
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:44,399
yeah for two lunch trays and one dinner

892
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,918
tray I will give

893
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:47,878
you however many however much paper and

894
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:50,480
pens you

895
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:53,118
want so I'm

896
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,320
like bet I mean I don't really have a

897
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:57,280
choice right it's going to hurt to not

898
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:59,240
have two two lunches and one one dinner

899
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,640
in a week right because that's all the

900
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:03,879
food you get like you're and it's not a

901
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:05,559
lot like they're giving you really the

902
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:09,160
food is crap so everything you heard

903
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:10,759
about prison is true it sucks right but

904
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:13,358
it's not a lot either so you're like I

905
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:15,320
was I was hungry on those days but I now

906
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:16,960
I had the plug on the paper so he would

907
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:19,119
come by like on the times when he was

908
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,599
supposed to give like me only four pages

909
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,440
he'd slide like a whole notebook under

910
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:25,119
there wow and then like a whole handful

911
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:27,880
of pens so then I would just like keep

912
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:29,519
stacking them up so that's how I got the

913
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,809
the material to even write the P I had

914
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:32,480
to trade my food for

915
00:35:30,809 --> 00:35:36,199
[Laughter]

916
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:38,240
it but yeah I mean so high price like

917
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:40,358
trust me like I want to give it to you

918
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:42,879
as I want to give it to you free but it

919
00:35:40,358 --> 00:35:48,159
cost a lot to to write that thing

920
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:50,480
seriously 420 Pages yeah amazing yeah so

921
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:52,480
yeah man and then but the end my my last

922
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,400
problem was once I finished writing I

923
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:57,159
had to figure a way how to get the pages

924
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,920
out yeah because you you you're not

925
00:35:57,159 --> 00:36:01,159
supposed to have like an excess amount

926
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,960
of material in solitary like they come

927
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:05,279
through and they'll do cell inspections

928
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,559
and they're they're supposed to take it

929
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:10,400
so I was real worried about like somehow

930
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:12,039
losing this manuscript now that I had so

931
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,838
I wouldn't even go out to like the

932
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:15,358
little Recreation cage like when it was

933
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,639
time to go out because that was usually

934
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:18,960
the time they would come in and shake

935
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:20,838
your cell down oh wow so I wasn't going

936
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,599
out to wreck and now I'm like Folding It

937

1016
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,480
activist bestseller list I know that's

1017
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,440
kind of like subcategory of a

1018
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:33,000
subcategory but listen I'm climbing up

1019
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:34,280
there right you're doing it I'm doing it

1020
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,039
when you're doing all I mean this is

1021
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:39,079
just one of the things yeah yeah it's

1022
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:41,719
just it's it's one of the it's one of

1023
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:44,519
the things that we're doing and it's an

1024
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:47,078
important story yeah like

1025
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:49,239
honestly and this might this may sound

1026
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:52,400
ingenuine to people or crazy or whatever

1027
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:54,799
right but if I could if if I could make

1028
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:57,920
10 million people read this story and

1029
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,839
not make a dollar from it I would yeah

1030
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,838
like because it's it's that important of

1031
00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:04,119
a story to me and it's not because I'm

1032
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:05,799
in it or because it's part like I'm the

1033
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:08,358
character or anything like that it's

1034
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:10,680
because it's it's from an era that we

1035
00:40:08,358 --> 00:40:13,679
need to make sure that we don't forget

1036
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:16,159
for sure and it's reality I A lot of

1037
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:17,598
times these days people are afraid of

1038
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:19,358
reality for one thing but but it's

1039
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:21,720
really important to look at reality and

1040
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:23,078
to understand what reality is because

1041
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:25,439
there's a lot of different perspectives

1042
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:27,760
out there on these other things and it's

1043
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,639
like the is what can happen to you even

1044
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,160
in a legal system where it can on a

1045
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:34,358
state level it can be legal they can go

1046
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:36,799
in and the FEDS can take everything away

1047
00:40:34,358 --> 00:40:39,400
from you yeah this is this is America

1048
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:41,318
right like we don't grow up in our like

1049
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:43,880
Elementary School saying hey look if you

1050
00:40:41,318 --> 00:40:45,279
follow state law and you pay your taxes

1051
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:48,480
you're going to go to prison for 20

1052
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:50,960
years yeah like it just it doesn't jive

1053
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:54,639
right and so like even when I'm sitting

1054
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:57,000
in there in prison and um they we have

1055
00:40:54,639 --> 00:41:00,039
the Britney grinder situation

1056
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,559
and she's finally freed thank God and

1057
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:03,318
then but the whole time the

1058
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:07,000
administration is sitting there calling

1059
00:41:03,318 --> 00:41:11,079
her um unjustly detained right and I'm

1060
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:13,199
like you got like 2700 people unjustly

1061
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:17,400
obtained here in the

1062
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:19,679
US like my my actual sentence or my my

1063
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:23,599
the length of my sentence was dictated

1064
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:26,118
by the 1988 crime abuse or drug abuse

1065
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:27,800
act who guess who like the chief sponsor

1066
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:30,079
was

1067
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:33,720
Biden oh

1068
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:36,880
wow so it's like yeah that's why I was

1069
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:38,919
so hopeful with Biden because I was like

1070
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,760
he wasn't my first pick of course I

1071
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,680
don't think he was anybody's first pick

1072
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:45,560
right I don't even know if I would have

1073
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:47,440
picked any of them but my point was like

1074
00:41:45,559 --> 00:41:49,279
when when Biden took office I was

1075
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,200
hopeful in the sense that because he was

1076
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,760
a part of that wave of mass

1077
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:55,279
incarceration and the the you know crime

1078
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,520
bills and all those things that were

1079
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,680
passed you know during that time that he

1080
00:41:57,519 --> 00:42:02,719
was uniquely positioned to be able to

1081
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:04,679
say hey look we got it wrong here I was

1082
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:06,279
one of the chief sponsors of it let's

1083
00:42:04,679 --> 00:42:09,078
let's fix it

1084
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:11,839
yeah it just hasn't happened yet well I

1085
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:15,599
mean I think Obama had a chance to

1086
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:17,358
change it on a federal level Trump had a

1087
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,440
chance to change it and now Biden has a

1088
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:20,199
chance to change it and nobody's

1089
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,920
changing it no they all as far as

1090
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:23,960
president you know I think there's

1091
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,920
people pushing for it

1092
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:28,639
but there's a lot of people pushing

1093
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,280
against it which is is really you know

1094
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:31,519
and it doesn't make sense either if you

1095
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:35,079
look at it nobody should be in prisoned

1096
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:37,400
for cannabis yeah nobody it it's

1097
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:40,119
just it's both sides of the aisle agree

1098
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:42,200
about that right like you could take the

1099
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:44,000
most conservative like take a a very

1100
00:42:42,199 --> 00:42:46,000
conservative Republican like Mike Lee

1101
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,440
Senator Mike Lee tea party conservative

1102
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:53,519
out of Utah yeah and then take Corey

1103
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:56,838
Booker a a liberal Democrat out of New

1104
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:59,159
Jersey both of them agree that people

1105
00:42:56,838 --> 00:43:02,599
shouldn't be in prison for cannabis yeah

1106
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:04,000
like so when you have Synergy on that on

1107
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:06,680
both sides of the aisle like that it

1108
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,079
becomes like a no-brainer right but

1109
00:43:06,679 --> 00:43:10,759
think but for some reason yeah like it

1110
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:13,240
just keeps getting kicked down the down

1111
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:15,040
the road and the whole time it's getting

1112
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:17,639
kicked down the road there's kids that

1113
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:19,119
are going to visiting rooms on Christmas

1114
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:21,318
and the whole time it's getting kicked

1115
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:22,960
down the road there's other people's

1116
00:43:21,318 --> 00:43:24,000
doors that are getting kicked in and

1117
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,199
there's other people that are being

1118
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,760
pulled over and sent to jail that day

1119
00:43:26,199 --> 00:43:31,078
and losing their jobs and just

1120
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:33,280
like when are we going to stop that

1121
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:35,359
suffering when when is that madness part

1122
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,440
going to stop because we we can figure

1123
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:40,119
out all the other stuff the regulations

1124
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:42,400
the taxes the you know interstate

1125
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:44,000
commerce and federal you know all that

1126
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,519
we can figure out all the rest of the

1127
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,358
stuff right but the we already all agree

1128
00:43:46,519 --> 00:43:52,400
on this part well and it's for something

1129
00:43:49,358 --> 00:43:54,759
that is a lot healthier than tobacco and

1130
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,760
alcohol which are totally legal they're

1131
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:59,640
you know they're they're not scheduled

1132
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,240
they're controll they're controlled

1133
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:04,400
substances and they're a lot more

1134
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:08,639
dangerous they're a lot more

1135
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:11,240
unhealthy than cannbis yeah I mean like

1136
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:15,118
night and day like yeah like night and

1137
00:44:11,239 --> 00:44:17,279
day you know and nobody ever like goes

1138
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:19,640
out smokes a joint and comes home and

1139
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,519
beats their wife like that's not the

1140
00:44:19,639 --> 00:44:23,719
scenario right but the scenario is they

1141
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:27,519
go drink a bottle of whis a bottle of

1142
00:44:23,719 --> 00:44:29,959
whiskey right and and happens right or

1143
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:31,800
or somebody drives and kills somebody or

1144
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:33,159
whatever the plethora of things and then

1145
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:36,119
don't let's not even get into the health

1146
00:44:33,159 --> 00:44:37,399
issues of tobacco and empa and all they

1147
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:38,559
might beat up some cheeseburgers you

1148
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:42,440
might beat up some cheeseburgers for

1149
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:44,760
sure you be or a taco truck totally but

1150
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:46,480
yeah you know whatever we're fighting to

1151
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,800
get it right right we're fighting to get

1152
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,599
it right and I mean I feel like if you

1153
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,760
look 100 years in the future 100 years

1154
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:52,039
in the past they'd say we're pretty

1155
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:55,480
crazy right now and we're doing things

1156
00:44:52,039 --> 00:44:57,199
the wrong way yeah so but you know every

1157
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:59,159
day is a new opportunity to make a

1158
00:44:57,199 --> 00:45:01,558
difference that's right and to change

1159
00:44:59,159 --> 00:45:03,679
that's right and that's what it's about

1160
00:45:01,559 --> 00:45:05,680
right it's about like being that change

1161
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:08,759
like for example back then it's it it

1162
00:45:05,679 --> 00:45:12,239
was easy to like say I'm an activist and

1163
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:14,400
like post a picture on my my Facebook

1164
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:16,519
and say oh look look at my plants or

1165
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:19,000
this and that and then that's it right

1166
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:22,199
right it's harder to go out there and

1167
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,199
grow the whole field off the highway 20

1168
00:45:22,199 --> 00:45:27,399
like Eddie LEP did yeah you know what

1169
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:31,000
I'm saying it's harder to go open a

1170
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:32,920
dispensary down in Bakersfield like

1171
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,159
Ramirez brothers did you know it's

1172
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:37,280
harder to go down in in some of these

1173
00:45:35,159 --> 00:45:38,920
other spots where you have to go out on

1174
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,359
Front Street right you have to put

1175
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:42,240
yourself out there put yourself out

1176
00:45:40,358 --> 00:45:44,759
there the risk to in order to move the

1177
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:47,679
needle forward yeah so that we can be

1178
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:49,839
where we're at to where everybody isn't

1179
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:53,279
in fear of that prosecution anymore and

1180
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:55,318
it's like it's disobeying unjust laws

1181
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:58,319
yeah straight up well the younger people

1182
00:45:55,318 --> 00:46:00,480
are getting older and the laws hopefully

1183
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:02,679
will change yeah that's what I I'm

1184
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,920
really hopeful about that actually

1185
00:46:02,679 --> 00:46:07,039
because you see that stigma that like

1186
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:09,318
when we were young right that dare

1187
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:12,558
program and turn your parents in if

1188
00:46:09,318 --> 00:46:14,960
they're smoking weed exactly that that

1189
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:17,400
stigma isn't around for this generation

1190
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:19,720
that's coming in to be legislators and

1191
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:22,000
city council people and things like that

1192
00:46:19,719 --> 00:46:23,799
right so we're starting to see a whole

1193
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,559
new generation and a new way of thinking

1194
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:28,880
and a new way of like how how how do we

1195
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:31,839
handle cannabis like how do we how how

1196
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:34,160
does this work in society yeah I mean we

1197
00:46:31,838 --> 00:46:35,719
have professional athletes that are very

1198
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:37,078
much in support and then there's ones

1199
00:46:35,719 --> 00:46:38,558
that don't talk about it but a lot of

1200
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:41,920
professional athletes use cannabis Nick

1201
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:44,720
Diaz got a twoyear sentence 209 shout

1202
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:47,000
out Nick Diaz yeah big up to Nick Diaz

1203
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:48,639
uh you know he he basically lost two

1204
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,559
years of his career for Canabis and now

1205
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:53,199
it's legal in the UFC yeah and then on

1206
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:55,240
420 they put his you know that's pretty

1207
00:46:53,199 --> 00:46:58,239
it's crazy right like that you know he

1208
00:46:55,239 --> 00:47:00,519
couldn't fight for two years yeah but

1209
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:03,199
like shout out to Nick too yeah because

1210
00:47:00,519 --> 00:47:05,559
of that because because of what he put

1211
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:07,159
it on the line and and and went out

1212
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:11,119
there right and said hey yeah yeah this

1213
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:13,399
is what it is yeah uh now he's on 420

1214
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:15,318
doing that and now he and he deserves

1215
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:17,599
everything he gets going forward from

1216
00:47:15,318 --> 00:47:20,920
that because because he came out and

1217
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:22,880
said hey look as an athlete cannabis use

1218
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:25,079
is something that's part of my regimen

1219
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,400
yeah and that's okay it's not Taboo it's

1220
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:28,480
not crazy

1221
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,680
yeah you know I mean and so the more

1222
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:33,280
athletes do that you know the more we

1223
00:47:30,679 --> 00:47:34,679
can get LeBron James or somebody like

1224
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,760
that you know I mean one of the bigger

1225
00:47:34,679 --> 00:47:38,318
athletes to come out here you know I

1226
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,800
think we're further down the road on

1227
00:47:38,318 --> 00:47:41,239
that of course but yeah they need to

1228
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,960
stop talking about cold plunging and

1229
00:47:41,239 --> 00:47:45,358
start talking about how they smoke weed

1230
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:47,920
yeah exactly exactly especially for at

1231
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:49,598
least the recovery part right for sure I

1232
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:53,000
feel like almost everybody can agree

1233
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:54,800
like loading up your an athletes body

1234
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,760
with Pharmaceuticals versus using a

1235
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,480
natural plant medicine I mean just on

1236
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:00,440
the surface sounds better

1237
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:03,960
anti-inflammatory I mean the properties

1238
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:06,480
are so much better yeah Y and that's the

1239
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:09,000
part that's the exciting part of like

1240
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:13,039
wreck now right is that if I take you

1241
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:14,920
back to 2008 and I go in and I pull my

1242
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:16,838
dispensary crew together for like a team

1243
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:19,720
meeting and I tell them hey guys we're

1244
00:48:16,838 --> 00:48:22,440
getting in a flower today that has thcv

1245
00:48:19,719 --> 00:48:24,279
in it and and we got one that has CBN in

1246
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:26,559
it and they would all look at me like I

1247
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:29,160
was speaking Chinese right because we

1248
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:31,920
didn't know about isolating any of those

1249
00:48:29,159 --> 00:48:33,838
M like we didn't have any idea what we

1250
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:36,440
knew like of course we knew the

1251
00:48:33,838 --> 00:48:38,838
Entourage effect we knew certain strands

1252
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:40,720
worked well for us and certain ones were

1253
00:48:38,838 --> 00:48:42,838
better in certain situations some of

1254
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:44,799
them made your heart R exactly some of

1255
00:48:42,838 --> 00:48:46,679
them made you tired and behind yeah

1256
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:49,119
exactly so you knew kind of how to how

1257
00:48:46,679 --> 00:48:51,239
to balance it right just on because you

1258
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:52,680
were you know using cannabis that often

1259
00:48:51,239 --> 00:48:54,479
and you were a connoisseur you said okay

1260
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:56,358
like that's my nighttime that's my

1261
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,679
nighttime joint right there that one

1262
00:48:56,358 --> 00:49:00,199
right there I can function on all day

1263
00:48:58,679 --> 00:49:03,318
well testing screwed up a whole bunch of

1264
00:49:00,199 --> 00:49:04,960
stuff oh manc percentage do not get me

1265
00:49:03,318 --> 00:49:09,519
bro it's

1266
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:12,720
wild stop buying weed from THC

1267
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:15,119
percentages please it's like the biggest

1268
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:17,358
heartbreak to me as I got out like I

1269
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:20,318
started seeing like none of the old

1270
00:49:17,358 --> 00:49:21,960
cultivars around that I used to like you

1271
00:49:20,318 --> 00:49:24,400
know what I'm saying so I know listen I

1272
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:26,039
know they take 12 weeks to grow I know I

1273
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:29,079
know that but they're special and they

1274
00:49:26,039 --> 00:49:31,079
were different you know what I mean so I

1275
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:34,000
know the market is what it is right we

1276
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:35,519
have to like people like what they like

1277
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,159
and so you have to kind of feed the

1278
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:40,239
machine and do your do your thing but

1279
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:42,199
some of those old covars that have

1280
00:49:40,239 --> 00:49:43,959
gotten like bred out of existence

1281
00:49:42,199 --> 00:49:46,239
because either you know they didn't

1282
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:48,519
yield the greatest or they weren't uh

1283
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:50,639
you know eight week poppers or seven we

1284
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:52,960
poppers they were too strong they smell

1285
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:56,480
too strong exactly yeah and you had them

1286
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:59,760
to where now we have this like set of

1287
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:01,599
strands that are really like similar

1288
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:03,319
right we don't get a re real lot of that

1289
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:06,519
variation that we used to get no there's

1290
00:50:03,318 --> 00:50:09,199
a lot of gelato and gelato mixes yeah

1291
00:50:06,519 --> 00:50:11,239
runs and gelato I mean all these you it

1292
00:50:09,199 --> 00:50:13,598
kind of happened with cookies yeah you

1293
00:50:11,239 --> 00:50:15,399
know around 2010 ises when it started

1294
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:18,400
and it just kind of snowballed into what

1295
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:19,838
it is now and yeah uh purple candy gas

1296
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,519
that's what people want these days I

1297
00:50:19,838 --> 00:50:23,679
mean but I think the old ways are coming

1298
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:26,440
back Sour Diesel is coming back Cuban

1299
00:50:23,679 --> 00:50:28,279
black Haze which is an nl5 Haze yeah

1300
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,519
that is coming back Northern Lights

1301
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:31,040
people talking about Northern Light I

1302
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:33,719
like Northern Lights I like Fort colins

1303
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:35,239
cough y um and maybe we won't find it in

1304
00:50:33,719 --> 00:50:37,199
just pure Northern Lights On The Shelf

1305
00:50:35,239 --> 00:50:39,118
but we're going to find a cross with

1306
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:40,798
Northern I got some Northern Lights

1307
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:42,559
crosses and I think that's how it lives

1308
00:50:40,798 --> 00:50:45,079
right I think that's how we get some of

1309
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:46,640
those cultivars that have been bred out

1310
00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:49,760
for whatever reason to be able to live

1311
00:50:46,639 --> 00:50:51,558
on is okay we'll we'll we'll meet you in

1312
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:53,359
the middle now right well children live

1313
00:50:51,559 --> 00:50:55,440
on through their ancestors that's right

1314
00:50:53,358 --> 00:50:56,960
let's just try to make them uh the best

1315
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,318
children possible I think doing the

1316
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:01,798
selection process that's true that's a

1317
00:50:59,318 --> 00:51:03,880
very good point man and so yeah like

1318
00:51:01,798 --> 00:51:06,280
even with what we have with with profit

1319
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:09,440
Brands man profit Brands is a brand that

1320
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:11,280
I'm launching with Ricardo awesome and

1321
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:13,079
that's what we're that's what we we seek

1322
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:15,040
out when we do our like feno hunts and

1323
00:51:13,079 --> 00:51:18,039
looking for what what cultivars we want

1324
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:20,039
to put like we are looking for really

1325
00:51:18,039 --> 00:51:22,079
specific things that we liked back in

1326
00:51:20,039 --> 00:51:24,000
the day cultivars that are buried like

1327
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:26,119
in the Central Valley somewhere that you

1328
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,559
know somebody one of their Prof or one

1329
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:30,760
of their teachers gave him a old school

1330
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:32,319
Santa Cruz blueberry or something you

1331
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:36,040
know what I mean and it's just it's

1332
00:51:32,318 --> 00:51:38,079
Unique and it it might like we may have

1333
00:51:36,039 --> 00:51:40,199
to come meet the market halfway but

1334
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:42,359
we'll still keep some of that Integrity

1335
00:51:40,199 --> 00:51:44,000
of that and that uniqueness and I think

1336
00:51:42,358 --> 00:51:45,920
that's what can set people apart and

1337
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,639
that's what as you know as well as I do

1338
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,400
as a breeder that's what sets you apart

1339
00:51:47,639 --> 00:51:51,960
is because of the uniqueness that you

1340
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:53,838
bring and and your individualism brings

1341
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:56,760
to your breeding program right we don't

1342
00:51:53,838 --> 00:51:59,759
need another runs no but but runs times

1343
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:03,000
something else exactly you know like a

1344
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:05,599
G13 or something might be G13 some

1345
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,760
Romulan some romul in there runs Romulan

1346
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:10,079
might be kind of cool Romulan genetics

1347
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:12,280
they got some run romulans I'm sure but

1348
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:14,119
yeah it's it's a you know and that's the

1349
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:16,440
beauty of it adding adding to the the

1350
00:52:14,119 --> 00:52:18,160
diversity back into the plant yeah is

1351
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:19,599
what it's you're G to get Vigor back

1352
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:21,519
you're GNA get yeah you're going to get

1353
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:24,119
a lot of amazing things so what was the

1354
00:52:21,519 --> 00:52:27,000
first first thing you saw cannabis wise

1355
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:30,798
when you came back out of

1356
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:34,519
prison the first strand or yeah Lemon

1357
00:52:30,798 --> 00:52:37,239
Cherry gelano of course

1358
00:52:34,519 --> 00:52:40,719
purple GDP so you got interesting story

1359
00:52:37,239 --> 00:52:43,000
with GDP too oh man the GDP man I love

1360
00:52:40,719 --> 00:52:45,159
her it's like it's like a tragic love

1361
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,838
story like but it's

1362
00:52:45,159 --> 00:52:49,759
nostalgic shout out to Ken Estes man and

1363
00:52:47,838 --> 00:52:52,400
what he's doing he's a character I hung

1364
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:54,640
out with him in at spannabis last year

1365
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:57,720
in Barcelona oh yeah okay so he's a good

1366
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:59,639
guy yeah Ken's crazy man shout out Ken

1367
00:52:57,719 --> 00:53:01,719
but anyway I I actually told him um when

1368
00:52:59,639 --> 00:53:04,798
I was in prison I actually we had burner

1369
00:53:01,719 --> 00:53:07,879
phones in there I mean or somebody did

1370
00:53:04,798 --> 00:53:09,199
and um text we text him back or hit him

1371
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:11,200
on messenger and we're talking back and

1372
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:13,679
forth about the story and about like the

1373
00:53:11,199 --> 00:53:17,279
role that GDP played in it but yeah man

1374
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:20,039
it one like it was one of my it still is

1375
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:22,440
it still is like in its pure form man

1376
00:53:20,039 --> 00:53:24,759
that GDP is special just something

1377
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:26,920
special about real GDP real GDP and

1378
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:29,720
that's the thing is like a lot of people

1379
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:31,639
got exposed to granddaddy purple and it

1380
00:53:29,719 --> 00:53:33,159
wasn't Granddaddy Purple it was just

1381
00:53:31,639 --> 00:53:35,159
something that had color in it you know

1382
00:53:33,159 --> 00:53:36,719
I mean that or it was a seed made from

1383
00:53:35,159 --> 00:53:40,039
Granddaddy Purple but it was there was

1384
00:53:36,719 --> 00:53:42,919
that one cut the real deal nice chunky

1385
00:53:40,039 --> 00:53:47,239
buds didn't get it was a short plant yes

1386
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:49,200
yeah it was a short plant and so when I

1387
00:53:47,239 --> 00:53:52,000
eventually was able to find the plug on

1388
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:57,279
it up in mesino it was a guy named Jerry

1389
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:59,599
Jerry Scarboro right and we go up to his

1390
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:01,880
my buddy Addison brings us up there we

1391
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:04,920
drive up to like this the cuts up in

1392
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:06,798
mesino a little town called Willets yeah

1393
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:09,000
and we go drive backck into like the

1394
00:54:06,798 --> 00:54:11,358
logging roads back there we come up on

1395
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,318
on on Jerry's house we go up we meet him

1396
00:54:11,358 --> 00:54:15,960
we talk all day we don't even talk about

1397
00:54:13,318 --> 00:54:17,719
business at all and then at the end of

1398
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:20,000
the day he says all right you know like

1399
00:54:17,719 --> 00:54:22,358
what do you guys what do you guys want

1400
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:25,798
he ends up having like an endless supply

1401
00:54:22,358 --> 00:54:27,639
of this granddaddy it was like falling

1402
00:54:25,798 --> 00:54:30,798
into a pot of gold like we were the

1403
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:32,318
dispensary that needed a supply so bad

1404
00:54:30,798 --> 00:54:35,400
you know I mean like I'm running around

1405
00:54:32,318 --> 00:54:37,558
literally James like this is not an

1406
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:40,798
exaggeration at all the store would

1407
00:54:37,559 --> 00:54:43,599
close at 7 I would run around and try to

1408
00:54:40,798 --> 00:54:46,719
find the next day's inventory to like

1409
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:49,400
one or two in the morning wow almost

1410
00:54:46,719 --> 00:54:51,439
like nightly because we were tapping

1411
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:53,318
every grower in the Central Valley and

1412
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:55,559
draining everything they

1413
00:54:53,318 --> 00:54:57,558
had yeah and you were the only on we

1414
00:54:55,559 --> 00:55:00,079
were the only game in town yeah so it

1415
00:54:57,559 --> 00:55:01,640
was like in a 100 mile radius we're the

1416
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:02,880
only we're the only game in town because

1417
00:55:01,639 --> 00:55:05,920
the one of the things I didn't touch on

1418
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:07,880
either is once we establish Modesto

1419
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,159
passes a ban right but it didn't affect

1420
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:11,119
us because we were grandfather did and

1421
00:55:09,159 --> 00:55:14,118
then all the surrounding cities pass a

1422
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:15,640
band too yeah Stockton Merced you know

1423
00:55:14,119 --> 00:55:18,480
everywhere basically the Bay Area was

1424
00:55:15,639 --> 00:55:21,358
your next closest spot to get to go to a

1425
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:23,679
dispensary right so yeah it was crazy

1426
00:55:21,358 --> 00:55:27,000
man it was it

1427
00:55:23,679 --> 00:55:30,038
was it it was wild let's just say that I

1428
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:32,920
bet yeah but yeah that GDP is something

1429
00:55:30,039 --> 00:55:36,760
special it like the effect was good too

1430
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:41,039
yeah the taste like I could I could have

1431
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:45,359
like a car tray full of roaches and like

1432
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:47,240
I would pull out one nope nope boom GDP

1433
00:55:45,358 --> 00:55:49,318
yeah I would know it instantly yeah

1434
00:55:47,239 --> 00:55:51,199
floral it's floral gas super floral

1435
00:55:49,318 --> 00:55:52,558
floral gas and there it was so unique at

1436
00:55:51,199 --> 00:55:54,519
the time there was nothing like it it

1437
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:57,640
was so potent on your lungs when you

1438
00:55:54,519 --> 00:56:00,679
would inh it and listen the pounds back

1439
00:55:57,639 --> 00:56:03,598
then were

1440
00:56:00,679 --> 00:56:06,318
$4,000 yeah all day that's if you knew

1441
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:08,680
like that was our plug yeah he's like yo

1442
00:56:06,318 --> 00:56:11,400
this is 4,000 how many do you want if

1443
00:56:08,679 --> 00:56:14,000
you're taking 50 of them it was $44,000

1444
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:16,519
a pound for 50 of them right so it

1445
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,199
didn't matter but it also didn't matter

1446
00:56:16,519 --> 00:56:19,079
when we got it back down on our end

1447
00:56:18,199 --> 00:56:22,519
either

1448
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:25,400
because I think to give you a kind of an

1449
00:56:22,519 --> 00:56:27,318
idea a little snapshot of like how it

1450
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:28,838
would H what The Feeding Frenzy that

1451
00:56:27,318 --> 00:56:30,759
would happen when purple would hit like

1452
00:56:28,838 --> 00:56:33,078
the dispensary back in the day was we

1453
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:36,160
had run out of purple for like of of

1454
00:56:33,079 --> 00:56:38,359
granddaddy for like a day or two and we

1455
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:40,719
were just waiting we couldn't get some

1456
00:56:38,358 --> 00:56:42,920
rich it was always rich or Ricardo or I

1457
00:56:40,719 --> 00:56:45,038
had to go up to mesino to get the pack

1458
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:46,240
right so we were waiting for Ricardo to

1459
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:49,680
get back or something it was just that

1460
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:51,000
we had a delay so people would just come

1461
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:52,759
in they look at our board they turn

1462
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,079
around and walk right out we had other

1463
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:57,240
good we had Romulan we had uh train

1464
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:58,720
wreck you know we had a bunch of top top

1465
00:56:57,239 --> 00:57:02,399
grade strands but they wanted the

1466
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:05,239
Granddaddy and that was it yeah so

1467
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:08,039
finally I I I remember oh shoot I have

1468
00:57:05,239 --> 00:57:10,439
one stashed in like the safe in the back

1469
00:57:08,039 --> 00:57:12,480
like on like a reserve pound right so

1470
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:14,039
I'm like boom I tell our processing guy

1471
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:16,039
go to the back I tell them where it's at

1472
00:57:14,039 --> 00:57:18,760
I said it's the last one grab it bust it

1473
00:57:16,039 --> 00:57:20,359
down in all e put a 1/8 limit on it so

1474
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:22,680
that you can stretch it out like to as

1475
00:57:20,358 --> 00:57:24,400
many patients as possible until we can

1476
00:57:22,679 --> 00:57:26,038
kind of buy some time like I'm thinking

1477
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:27,559
I could buy at least the rest of the day

1478
00:57:26,039 --> 00:57:29,359
it's in the morning I could buy the rest

1479
00:57:27,559 --> 00:57:34,720
of the day with this pound like on the

1480
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:38,519
1/8 limit 35 minutes wow 35 minutes it

1481
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:40,598
was gone so now I'm doing the math on

1482
00:57:38,519 --> 00:57:44,079
that I'm like damn I paid 4,000 for that

1483
00:57:40,599 --> 00:57:46,039
pound in 35 minutes we sold $50 Ace we

1484
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:47,880
ate the we ate the sales tax we didn't

1485
00:57:46,039 --> 00:57:49,319
charge we didn't charge the patient the

1486
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:51,960
sales tax that was the top price for eth

1487
00:57:49,318 --> 00:57:55,519
Back in the Day Bucks 50 bucks was top

1488
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:57,599
heck yeah like our top top maybe 60

1489
00:57:55,519 --> 00:58:00,440
60 if you're in the Bay Area 60 in the

1490
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:02,400
bay you could get all day but like our

1491
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:04,240
top like if it wasn't granddaddy it was

1492
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:06,240
45 we wouldn't go over it but for

1493
00:58:04,239 --> 00:58:08,000
granddaddy we were pay we were paying a

1494
00:58:06,239 --> 00:58:09,838
little bit more for it yeah I paid 60

1495
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,318
for cat piss back in the day oh man

1496

1497
00:58:11,318 --> 00:58:17,440
with that yeah my boy had my boy Thunder

1498
00:58:14,318 --> 00:58:19,159
had a really unique cut of that wow like

1499
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,798
you would he would be able to smoke that

1500
00:58:19,159 --> 00:58:23,159
in like a room and you could walk into

1501
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:25,239
the room like 3 hours later and know he

1502
00:58:23,159 --> 00:58:26,879
smoked one of those joints in there it

1503
00:58:25,239 --> 00:58:29,199
still smells like catpiss it was the

1504
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:31,838
only strand that was like that yeah it

1505
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:34,480
was crazy but I love that strand yeah

1506
00:58:31,838 --> 00:58:36,000
yeah me too that's that's like uh if I

1507
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:38,318
had to guess you if I had to say my

1508
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,318
all-time favorite would be catpiss of

1509
00:58:38,318 --> 00:58:42,599
all the stuff the desert island I like

1510
00:58:40,318 --> 00:58:44,279
yeah it is the desert islands stain but

1511
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:46,400
I want the ciss from back then not the

1512
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:48,640
ciss now because I've yet to see I

1513
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,960
haven't seen it I've yet to see anything

1514
00:58:48,639 --> 00:58:51,679
equivalent to what we got back in the

1515
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:53,559
day but there's a several things that we

1516
00:58:51,679 --> 00:58:55,440
had that were really amazing yeah have

1517
00:58:53,559 --> 00:58:57,559
kind of been lost along the way way do

1518
00:58:55,440 --> 00:59:00,280
you ever think

1519
00:58:57,559 --> 00:59:01,599
like like it's like a kid going into

1520
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:03,280
like his old house right where you

1521
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:04,920
thought your room was way bigger than it

1522
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,920
used to be you know what I mean there

1523
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:08,880
there's definit truth to that yeah like

1524
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:11,599
we remember things a certain way but I

1525
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:13,039
think your memory can be a little fickle

1526
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:14,720
yeah you know like you you want to

1527
00:59:13,039 --> 00:59:17,599
remember it this way but maybe it was

1528
00:59:14,719 --> 00:59:19,679
slightly different but you know who's to

1529
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:22,359
say we're actually here right now right

1530
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:24,719
yeah it's well I think therefore I am I

1531
00:59:22,358 --> 00:59:26,880
got tattooed on my chest nice that's the

1532
00:59:24,719 --> 00:59:29,358
only reason I know you guys might not

1533
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:31,440
all be real but I know I'm real at least

1534
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:33,400
totally yeah yeah I mean there's guys

1535
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:36,200
theor the the theory we're all in a

1536
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:37,920
simulation all this stuff you know I I

1537
00:59:36,199 --> 00:59:40,000
think that there's definitely truth to

1538
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:42,200
we we remember things differently than

1539
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,159
how they really are sometimes especially

1540
00:59:42,199 --> 00:59:47,279
with flavor but I'll tell you the one

1541
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:49,679
thing I still remember rhubarb from when

1542
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:52,440
I was a kid I still when I taste rhubarb

1543
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:53,759
or smell rhubarb I'm like man cooking

1544
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:55,720
especially when you're cooking rhubarb

1545
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:58,760
on the stove you know because I was a

1546
00:59:55,719 --> 01:00:00,199
chef for a while and a lot of these

1547
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:02,440
things are like from childhood

1548
01:00:00,199 --> 01:00:04,318
especially baking with my mother and

1549
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:05,798
yeah gingerbread houses making

1550
01:00:04,318 --> 01:00:08,318
gingerbread you know stuff like good

1551
01:00:05,798 --> 01:00:10,960
memories the warm fuzzy memories yeah

1552
01:00:08,318 --> 01:00:12,519
yep totally yeah that's true and then it

1553
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:15,199
it works in the opposite direction too

1554
01:00:12,519 --> 01:00:17,119
right like strawberry Boons like wine I

1555
01:00:15,199 --> 01:00:19,239
can't I can't get anywhere if I smell it

1556
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:21,440
I'll throw up because I my first time

1557
01:00:19,239 --> 01:00:24,279
getting drunk was on like a strawberry

1558
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:26,240
Boon Hill yeah and it was like I was

1559
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:27,880
throwing up like red liquid the whole

1560
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:30,239
night it was the worst thing so now even

1561
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:34,079
if I smell that smell it's over with

1562
01:00:30,239 --> 01:00:36,639
yeah yes Cisco Cisco Cisco yeah I can't

1563
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:38,200
do the Cisco it's the same kind of thing

1564
01:00:36,639 --> 01:00:39,519
it's almost idal I can smell it right

1565
01:00:38,199 --> 01:00:41,558
now that we're talking about it you know

1566
01:00:39,519 --> 01:00:43,519
you get those things and I think also

1567
01:00:41,559 --> 01:00:46,119
experience plays into like we can relate

1568
01:00:43,519 --> 01:00:47,719
an experience to certain tastes and

1569
01:00:46,119 --> 01:00:49,960
flavors in those things but yeah

1570
01:00:47,719 --> 01:00:51,118
especially cannabis it's like especially

1571
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:52,318
when you're young we got really good

1572
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:55,200
weed back then people don't understand

1573
01:00:52,318 --> 01:00:56,558
the weed was really good yeah so what

1574
01:00:55,199 --> 01:00:58,719
what was your first like what was your

1575
01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:01,440
first grow so my first grow was a

1576
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:03,038
Phototron in a closet I had two

1577
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:05,440
roommates in a one bedroom apartment and

1578
01:01:03,039 --> 01:01:06,760
we had a photoon with the top yeah the

1579
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:09,159
one that opens up with the with the

1580
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:11,559
lights on the side yeah and that was all

1581
01:01:09,159 --> 01:01:13,558
hobby stuff yeah you know it was fun and

1582
01:01:11,559 --> 01:01:15,319
one of my buddies actually took and I

1583
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:17,359
went to go snowboarding for a couple

1584
01:01:15,318 --> 01:01:19,679
days I'm like can you water the plants

1585
01:01:17,358 --> 01:01:21,480
and I told him one tablespoon of fish

1586
01:01:19,679 --> 01:01:24,879
emotion he thought it was one gallon of

1587
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:26,880
fish emotion oh no and so the weed I I

1588
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:28,318
Tred to flush it all these things and

1589
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:30,280
it's actually back when we thought we

1590
01:01:28,318 --> 01:01:32,079
could flush oh yeah well you couldn't

1591
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:33,720
flush the salmon smell out of the weed

1592
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:35,839
the salmon taste and so I actually ended

1593
01:01:33,719 --> 01:01:37,798
up selling it to somebody but uh it

1594
01:01:35,838 --> 01:01:41,000
wasn't stuff I would even smoke myself

1595
01:01:37,798 --> 01:01:43,719
oh yeah uh but yeah and then I was lucky

1596
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:46,519
enough to be in the Bay Area so we had a

1597
01:01:43,719 --> 01:01:48,078
mix of all the best genetics oh yeah I

1598
01:01:46,519 --> 01:01:50,838
mean the stuff was coming down from

1599
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:52,400
mesino coming up from La yeah we were

1600
01:01:50,838 --> 01:01:55,199
getting a lot of stuff and this is you

1601
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:57,160
know 90s we were getting amazing uh when

1602
01:01:55,199 --> 01:01:59,000
the gas first started and I saw waves of

1603
01:01:57,159 --> 01:02:00,960
the purple where the purple was hot and

1604
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,559
then the purple was not hot and you

1605
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:04,039
couldn't sell purple to save your life

1606
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:05,440
people wouldn't want it that's crazy

1607
01:02:04,039 --> 01:02:06,559
right but we also had droughts people

1608
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:08,079
don't understand there was droughts

1609
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:09,278
where you couldn't get weed there would

1610
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:10,798
there would be like a time where you

1611
01:02:09,278 --> 01:02:12,798
couldn't even get brown weed you

1612
01:02:10,798 --> 01:02:14,519
couldn't even get the brick weed yeah

1613
01:02:12,798 --> 01:02:16,920
and that would that that used to hurt

1614
01:02:14,519 --> 01:02:19,038
like and it seemed like it always hit

1615
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:21,159
like in Modesto anyway like around the

1616
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:23,278
holidays man and it would be like on

1617
01:02:21,159 --> 01:02:25,078
Thanksgiving I'd be out looking for weed

1618
01:02:23,278 --> 01:02:27,159
instead of like being at house with my

1619
01:02:25,079 --> 01:02:28,960

anything just give me an ounce of in

1621

1632
01:02:53,199 --> 01:02:58,399
times but yeah so my brother grew a

1633
01:02:55,599 --> 01:03:00,160
plant or plants when we were younger and

1634
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:02,519
we would move him into the neighbor's

1635
01:03:00,159 --> 01:03:04,519
backyard at night when my parents had

1636
01:03:02,519 --> 01:03:06,119
come home and because we had a fence

1637
01:03:04,519 --> 01:03:07,559
between our the neighbor's house yeah

1638
01:03:06,119 --> 01:03:08,640
and put them in the backyard so my dad

1639
01:03:07,559 --> 01:03:11,119
when he go in the backyard he never

1640
01:03:08,639 --> 01:03:13,199
found the plants okay and so that's that

was kind of like always like you know

1662
01:03:58,599 --> 01:04:02,880
most of my exposure was like either

1663
01:04:00,119 --> 01:04:04,519
outdoor very limited indoor growth

1664
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:07,200
experience early you know I'm talking

1665
01:04:04,519 --> 01:04:09,318
about 90s era yeah so what you saw in

1666
01:04:07,199 --> 01:04:11,519
High Times was like that was it that was

1667
01:04:09,318 --> 01:04:14,119
the Grail yeah we used to make beds out

1668
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:16,679
of wood you know we'd have our 8x4 beds

1669
01:04:14,119 --> 01:04:19,920
out of wood you know we had air cooled

1670
01:04:16,679 --> 01:04:22,358
lights saw hes saw horses yeah that

1671
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:24,519
we've done that too and you know and

1672
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:27,239
then even uh the adjusta wing the big

1673
01:04:24,519 --> 01:04:30,000
huge Wing lights you know and air cooled

1674
01:04:27,239 --> 01:04:31,759
lights I grew with octagons for a while

1675
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,400
uh okay me and my buddy used to use the

1676
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:35,200
vertical growing cuz we thought there

1677
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:37,798
was less of a vertical footprint so the

1678
01:04:35,199 --> 01:04:40,038
helicopters couldn't get us yeah it's

1679
01:04:37,798 --> 01:04:42,119
like the hel listen the helicopter fear

1680
01:04:40,039 --> 01:04:43,400
was real though it was real even I was

1681
01:04:42,119 --> 01:04:45,400
like the helicopters are going to get us

1682
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:48,000
with their infrared technology and our

1683
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:50,838
house is going to Glow purple yeah it

1684
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:53,440
probably did you know it probably did

1685
01:04:50,838 --> 01:04:55,119
yeah yeah a lot of good times man it's

1686
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:56,838
it's uh it's it's interesting and how

1687
01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:59,240
it's evolved into where it's at now

1688
01:04:56,838 --> 01:05:01,639
where you know we're like one step away

1689
01:04:59,239 --> 01:05:04,078
from a far pharmaceutical level yeah but

1690
01:05:01,639 --> 01:05:05,879
also one step away from real egg you

1691
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:07,798
know we're talking about like tomato

1692
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:09,278
farming I talk about it a lot you know I

1693
01:05:07,798 --> 01:05:11,278
have a lot of credit to the Tomato

1694
01:05:09,278 --> 01:05:12,760
Farmers out there you know I don't think

1695
01:05:11,278 --> 01:05:14,599
they get enough credit sometimes but

1696
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:18,480
tomato farming is no joke like those

1697
01:05:14,599 --> 01:05:21,480
guys no any farming is real is real work

1698
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:24,358
real agriculture yeah listen hands off

1699
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:26,400
to hats off to all the farmers yeah um I

1700
01:05:24,358 --> 01:05:28,598
think Thomas Jefferson has a quote that

1701
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:30,599
says something similar to don't direct

1702
01:05:28,599 --> 01:05:32,760
quote me I'll paraphrases like the

1703
01:05:30,599 --> 01:05:34,960
people that work the labor in the Earth

1704
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:36,559
are like the chosen of God or something

1705
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:38,679
like that and because it's true like you

1706
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:40,000
really feel a connection when you're

1707
01:05:38,679 --> 01:05:41,480
doing things like that when your hands

1708
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,639
are in the Earth and you're planting

1709
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:45,278
stuff and you're growing stuff and

1710
01:05:42,639 --> 01:05:47,480
creating like that you feel it it's real

1711
01:05:45,278 --> 01:05:49,278
well it's so gratifying I feel like it's

1712
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:50,519
a great you're connecting to something

1713
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:51,798
else too and you're watching you're

1714
01:05:50,519 --> 01:05:53,880
taking care of something it's your

1715
01:05:51,798 --> 01:05:57,278
responsibility yeah and you know we're

1763
01:07:37,639 --> 01:07:41,519
the future and we really want to take

1766
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:46,680
about growing and cultivars and things

special about the plant and and meet the

1769
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:54,200
future with it you know sometimes we

1770
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:56,558

amazing it's a privilege but also it's a

1823
01:09:51,479 --> 01:09:56,279
responsibility because these stories are

1824
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:58,480
getting get lost otherwise right so like

01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,520
stories out there there's so many

1830
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:11,320
stories that never get told so at least

1831
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:13,760
we can capture some of the reality of

1832
01:10:11,319 --> 01:10:15,000
what happened of the past you know and

1833
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:18,039
so hopefully we can learn from our

1834
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:19,640
mistakes and right move forward so we're

1835
