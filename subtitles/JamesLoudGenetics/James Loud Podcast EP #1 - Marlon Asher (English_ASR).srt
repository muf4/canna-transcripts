32
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,459
time we met at a high times Cannabis Cup

33
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,280
in Amsterdam when I won the first cup

34
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:34,259
you were my first cup yeah in the hybrid

35
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:36,299
category in 2012 so 13 years ago yeah I

36
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:39,180
was partaken as a

37
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:41,640
I was actually a celebrity judge at the

38
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,759
at the cup at that time in performing

39
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,400
yeah and I was performing I actually had

40
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:50,938
the best time of my life after I met

41
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:53,399
James because James had that good good

42
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:56,398
smoke that I was looking searching the

43
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:59,759
place for we were all about it

44
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,320
man yeah it was all about OG Sour Diesel

45
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,759
the gas this is all kind of you know

46
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:04,859
cookies was coming on the scene and I

47
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,379
like cookies cookies was great but those

48
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:09,538
classic gas strains yeah man the OG

49
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:12,000
spliff that was the that was it for us

50
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:15,000
you know and we we bonded because we

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,699
were about you know actually levels of

52
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,919
the same strain that OG Kush from way

53
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:21,780
back that strain that I don't think we

54
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,399
can get it right now oh we can get it we

55
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,878
can get it nobody wants to grow it it

56
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,680
doesn't exactly you know farmers in in

57
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:29,878
California everywhere Farmers everywhere

58
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,140
they don't like growing it because it

59
00:02:29,878 --> 00:02:35,098
doesn't yield as much as some of the

60
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:38,279
other varieties but LG can yield I love

61
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:40,799
OG I love gas you know I used to grow

62
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:44,459
some Moji back in the days you know and

63
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:47,340
I had a few rooms and I got a few pounds

64
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:50,580
out of it me and my good friend Judah

65
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:53,098
back in the days and you know we had a

66
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:56,599
good run from that that was one of the

67
00:02:53,098 --> 00:03:00,539
most you know requested strain back then

68
00:02:56,598 --> 00:03:03,359
so that was kind of a

69
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:05,340
what made me kind of fall in love with

70
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,560
this train oh geek that was the Exotic

71
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,878
of its day

72
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,640
exotic that was the one like if you had

73
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:14,459
the OG back in the day you had the the

74
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:16,378
one you know yeah it was it was the

75
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:18,598
strain it was the variety everybody

76
00:03:16,378 --> 00:03:20,098
wanted you know like that nobody could

77
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:21,539
get because there was only a handful of

78
00:03:20,098 --> 00:03:23,639
people with it and nobody wanted to

79
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:25,318
share it and it was expensive and that's

80
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:28,919
the reason why

81
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:33,139
we bonded so much in Amsterdam because

82
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:37,318
you know we it was kind of a

83
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:39,419
Awakening of Aroma when we smell that oh

84
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:41,818
she coming through the crowd bro for

85
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:44,039
sure and I must say thanks for you know

86
00:03:41,818 --> 00:03:46,500
having it back then because

87
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:48,298
yeah it was great over in Amsterdam over

88
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,639
in Europe to have OG Kush was a rare

89
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:52,920
thing bro I would have been on a panic

90
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:55,378
streak because I had there was so much

91
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:57,119
sativity how much you guys smoked that

92
00:03:55,378 --> 00:03:59,878
was the crazy part the amount of weed

93
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,658
you guys smoked I mean there yeah you

94
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:04,500
guys

95
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:05,459
smoked hard you know I grew up I would

96
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,639
say

97
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:11,098
go in and buy weed for the elderly yeah

98
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,119
they would call me I would go run into

99
00:04:11,098 --> 00:04:14,158
the

100
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,959
so I had to sit and smoke the weed

101
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:17,819
before I take it back to him make sure

102
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:21,060
it's good so right you have a fair

103
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:23,959
understanding of what you know the good

104
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:27,300
stuff is yeah and you've experienced

105
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:29,638
cannabis for a long time yeah a long

106
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,199
time so you've seen the evolution of it

107
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:32,519
and how it's changed into the wreck

108
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,680
market today

109
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:36,599
uh so a little bit about my show what

110
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,780
we're doing is a blind tasting on each

111
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,580
episode so we have three different uh

112
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:44,039
products that are from the California

113
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:46,978
rec market and we're gonna sample each

114
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:50,160
one in a blind fashion and we have one

115
00:04:46,978 --> 00:04:52,860
that's a five dollar gram uh one that's

116
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,120
around 10 and then one that's more than

117
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,580
15.

118
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,899
uh that's the premium exotic and so

119
00:04:56,579 --> 00:05:00,599
we're doing a blind tasting we're gonna

120
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:01,918
see how these different products are you

121
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,840
know I'm gonna get some feedback from

122
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:06,180
Marlon and we're gonna see how his

123
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:09,299
palette works but let me say

124
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:11,040
before we go forward that sometime the

125
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:14,639
five dollar gram

126
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:18,479
can't have that taste that people you

127
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:22,860
know really hold on to other than the

128
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:25,199
the 80 grams you know sometimes oh man

129
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,300
you said the words it can go both ways I

130
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,280
mean it's really expensive it's trash

131
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,960
and I've seen stuff really cheap that's

132
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,359
amazing I mean

133
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:35,459
so this should this should be excited

134
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,038
because you know

135
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:39,418
sometimes you know the herbs that we

136
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:42,240
test

137
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:45,418
you know brings out something special

138
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,579
and we hold fast to it so I'll see where

139
00:05:45,418 --> 00:05:49,978
it goes from here and what I'm smoking

140
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:51,538
after today so what are your thoughts on

141
00:05:49,978 --> 00:05:53,579
outdoor versus indoor do you have a

142
00:05:51,538 --> 00:05:56,219
preference on outdoor versus indoor well

143
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:58,139
I like indoor but outdoor to me carries

144
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:01,199
the flavor that I like you know it's

145
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:05,280
kind of how about the effect the effect

146
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:09,000
is different from the indoor indoor is

147
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:12,000
more uh if it's a if it's Indica it's

148
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,399
more down a Vibe but the outdoor Indica

149
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,038
gives you an upliftment that you you

150
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:19,978
know you appreciate yeah so sometimes

151
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:22,139
outdoor Is Not a Bad Thing OG outdoor is

152
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:24,599
amazing especially especially though

153
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:25,680
yeah it's a trip it's a trip you know

154
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,319
all these different varieties living

155
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,120
soil the living soil indoors yeah I like

156
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,000
it exactly that's hands down that's why

157
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,280
I say sometimes indoor I'm okay with

158
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,360
smoking cocoa I smoke cocoa yeah indoor

159
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:41,818
all the time uh I don't mind salt but I

160
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,699
do really enjoy living soil living soil

161
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:47,100
is is I think it's literally I think

162
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:49,259
it's actually what's leading in the

163
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:52,039
market right now so

164
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:53,939
a living side spliff is always nice to

165
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:56,038
compliment today you know what I'm

166
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:58,500
saying totally I feel like yeah you

167
00:06:56,038 --> 00:07:00,418
can't go wrong typically definitely so

168
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,399
this is the first one all right let's

169
00:07:00,418 --> 00:07:05,000
Light It Up

170
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:08,099
are you scared I'm I'm probably

171
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,379
sometimes you know how it is we get some

172
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,180
weed and we can I gotta drive home you

173
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:16,259
know so I gotta be careful of what I

174
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:17,939
smoke it's a nice gesture but come on

175
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:20,780
I'm scared a little

176
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:20,779
foreign

177
00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:30,180
[Music]

178
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:32,460
from first days what do you think

179
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:35,598
there's flavor hmm

180
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:35,598
there's flavor in that one

181
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:44,160
it's got some breadiness to it

182
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:46,079
a little creaminess little breadiness

183
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,720
I could taste that creaminess that's

184
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:50,818
good that's a good thing that flavor is

185
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,940
there

186
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:56,819
flavor's there yes it's good

187
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:59,300
got that notice but all right so if you

188
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:59,300
had to guess

189
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:04,379
oh you get another couple hits in yeah

190
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,780
or one more and then you can tell me do

191
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:10,740
you think that is the five dollar or

192
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:13,079
less the ten dollar or less or the 15.

193
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,360
that's definitely the ten dollars a left

194
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:18,620
ten dollars or less yeah has definitely

195
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,620
the ten dollars are left

196
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:25,318
I mean it tastes good oil

197
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:27,780
we're not getting too much of an oil

198
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:29,819
rings it's kind of starting but it's not

199
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:32,759
burning clean look that's not

200
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:36,778
it's not white ash no not white ash by

201
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:39,360
any means definitely ten dollars

202
00:08:36,778 --> 00:08:41,338
so 10 and under yeah

203
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,440
okay

204
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:45,480
well we give it that

205
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,360
I hope I'm right because it's got nice

206
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:51,740
flavor you know what I'm saying it goes

207
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,740
it it goes good

208
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:57,778
it's not ten and under 10 enough I did

209
00:08:54,899 --> 00:09:00,419
it yep yeah that's it I I knew it it's

210
00:08:57,778 --> 00:09:02,759
it's just that it's got the flavor but

211
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:05,759
it doesn't do anything otherwise than

212
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:08,100
that you know yeah

213
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:10,439
it's a good smoke though I would like to

214
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:13,200
smoke that like late evening you know

215
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,420
that's uh so the effects let's talk

216
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,600
about the effect I mean I feel like it's

217
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:21,299
mellow it says it's over 30 THC I don't

218
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:24,300
think so I I don't think so I think it's

219
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:26,039
a I I don't know man I don't know I mean

220
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:28,079
if it is I don't know I'm gonna take one

221
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:31,679
more hit just all right just to confirm

222
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:34,620
let me take another hit just to comfort

223
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:36,539
over 30

224
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:39,839
I don't know you must feel the effect

225
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:41,819
from uh you take a draw of the weed and

226
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,440
you say it gives you a feeling it could

227
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,060
creep on you too you know sometimes we

228
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,580
get some creeper weed yeah we know about

229
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:50,659
creeper

230
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,660
all right

231
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:01,200
not bad it could be could be a monster

232
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:03,120
so we got some Burr's crate well first

233
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,100
place grape and Chris see now maybe it

234
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,959
is 30 yeah I'm feeling it now it's

235
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,060
creeping up on me a little bit burst

236
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:12,119
place and it's grape and cream

237
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:15,059
and it says it's above 30 this probably

238
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:18,060
is I can feel it I don't think it's

239
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:21,479
above 30 30 should rock your world I

240
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:23,819
think it's just about 30 percent yep

241
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,220
well if it was above 30 percent I would

242
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:28,800
be flavor is good though

243
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:30,420
yeah I would be happy as a consumer

244
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:33,000
buying this for that price point yeah

245
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:35,099
it's just where it's at it's just where

246
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,200
it's at I mean in California that is a

247
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,420
good deal that's value bargain weed you

248
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:44,040
know a lot of people shop

249
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:45,778
and buy weed around that average area 10

250
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:47,639
and under you know we're gonna dive into

251
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:51,139
number two yeah

252
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:51,139
and let's see what you think

253
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:56,459
so tell me about Trinidad and the

254
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:58,200
legalization over there I think they've

255
00:10:56,458 --> 00:11:00,078
been pushing forward with it yeah man

256
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,519
I'm about to get a

257
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:03,659
cultivation license and distribution

258
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:06,419
probably

259
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:10,199
or Transportation at least lies in over

260
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:15,240
there they've been working on

261
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:17,759
performing uh cannabis committee so

262
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,759
I'm kind of waiting around for them to

263
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:22,860
issue the license which they are about

264
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:25,379
to issue

265
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:27,839
the first 10 lives now on the island so

266
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:29,600
I think imma be part of that first

267
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,920
tenant

268
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,920
they've come a long way I must say you

269
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:36,000
know because they've been working really

270
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:38,759
hard

271
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,940
to meet standards and not

272
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:45,240
be overboard so yeah they're actually

273
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:46,860
taking their appropriate time to do the

274
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,440
right things how's our good friend Dr

uh Saint Vincent together in 2019. yeah

294
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,640

295
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:41,278
with the Cannabis Authority

296
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:42,539

297
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:43,980
lecture That was supposed to be a

298
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:47,759
30-minute election I think it ended up

299
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:49,620
being like a three-hour lecture uh

300
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:51,480
what are your thoughts on uh Saint

301
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:55,078
Vincent in their future

302
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:57,720
well Saint Vincent for me I think you

303
00:12:55,078 --> 00:13:00,299
know Saint Vincent is very promising as

304
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:03,240
far as the herbs go they trying to be

305
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:05,159
Pioneers in everything they're doing so

306
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:09,240
definitely in the future they're going

307
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:11,100
to be a top runner for the Caribbean

308
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,860
they already stare ahead in their

309
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,540
programs and yes you see we've been

310
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,339
there it's a special place yeah it's

311
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:21,480
definitely a special place especially

312
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:25,079
the soil they got they got lava molten

313
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:27,659
lava yeah that you know covers the land

314
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:30,599
from time to time so they

315
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:31,679
they always got fresh soil and they have

316
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,079
some of the poorest people that I've

317
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:36,239
ever seen yeah yeah definitely some of

318
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:39,479
the happiest people too and some of the

319
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,659
most uh enlightened people for sure at

320
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:45,180

and go to a different Island it's always

329
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:07,078
party time and then

330
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:09,180
you leave in your country to go there

331
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:11,278
and Sample the weed that's in that

332
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:12,599
island so

333
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:16,559
back then

334
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:20,220
the Vinci the Saint Vincent weed was

335
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:23,699
like top number one on my Island so

336
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:26,759
describe the Vinci weed for us well like

337
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:28,200
the weed now or the wheat the weed back

338
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:30,179
in the back in the day what you guys

339
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,759
loved about the Vinci wheat was it the

340
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:34,138
effect or was it the flavor I mean you

341
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:36,720
guys did a lot of roll-ons too right

342
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:38,579
yeah but I think it's a combination of a

343
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,778
lot of things that made that weed

344
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:43,338
special all right

345
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:45,480
all right for instance this weed was

346
00:14:43,339 --> 00:14:48,660
fluorescent yellow

347
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:51,778
fluorescent yellow like spongy or like

348
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:54,838
dry and hard not spongy not spongy so

349
00:14:51,778 --> 00:14:57,778
completely dry not it's dry but it's not

350
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:59,880
spongy huh and it's not hard either but

351
00:14:57,778 --> 00:15:01,919
there was a lot of trichomes

352
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:04,860
there was a lot of trichomes it was

353
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:07,860
properly grown and properly well trimmed

354
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:10,379
wow so you could actually see was there

355
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:12,120
seeds in it it was seeds there was lots

356
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:13,259
of seeds and there were seeds man I wish

357
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,320
you would have saved those seeds for me

358
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:18,659
back then I had no idea that we would

359
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,720
have been doing what we're doing what

360
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:23,578
we're doing today totally and that's the

361
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,500
thing about life you know It prepares

362
00:15:23,578 --> 00:15:28,198
you for a lot of things that you don't

363
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:30,839
understand because as soon

364
00:15:28,198 --> 00:15:32,879
this video as soon as you finally see it

365
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:34,500
you go and put it in the Earth for sure

366
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:36,899
because you want to grow something like

367
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,639
this right so back then we'll be

368
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:40,078
collecting the seeds and growing them

369
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,419
out and

370
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:45,120
you know having

371
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:47,838
not being able to grow it right and get

372
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:51,839
a bunch from it but we would get a smoke

373
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:53,160
right a couple buds on a branch and yeah

374
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,660
it used to be

375
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:58,078
because

376
00:15:54,659 --> 00:16:00,240
control the seeds were not controlled so

377
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:04,078
they couldn't heal the same thing every

378
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,339
time right so man so how do you can a

379
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:09,359
quick question how do you compare it to

380
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:12,600
Orange Hill man Orange Hill is different

381
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:16,019
in what ways well Orange Hill The Strain

382
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,639
in Orange Hill is a land race train that

383
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:20,578
yeah

384
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:23,839
that is stands out you know I I can't

385
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:23,838
even knocks you on your ass

386
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:30,480
the thing about that Orange Hill weed is

387
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:33,480
you get it today you smoke it tomorrow

388
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:37,320
it's the same effect every time yeah

389
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:39,600
you can get a different smoke of it so

390
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,399
well let's jump into this what do you

391
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,220
think this is do you think this is the

392
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:45,899
five dollar or less do you think this is

393
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:49,980
the

394
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:52,500
15 or more it's probably

395
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:54,839
it's pretty good pretty good I I'm

396
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,220
actually really surprised I surprised I

397
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:59,160
mean we got an oil ring on this thing

398
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:01,079
yeah but it's five dollars though yep

399
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:02,698
but I know it's like that is because

400
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:04,318
here what that's a bargain right there

401
00:17:02,698 --> 00:17:06,779
yeah and I feel like it gets you high

402
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:08,879
like I feel high from this yeah more

403
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:10,558
High than from the other one but but the

404
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,339
thing about this fight another spliff

405
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:14,338
that

406
00:17:11,338 --> 00:17:16,740
with me I feel high while I'm smoking it

407
00:17:14,338 --> 00:17:20,578
but as we stop now

408
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:23,519
I feel yeah I believe

409
00:17:20,578 --> 00:17:27,178
this is a 13 eighth

410
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:30,599
this is Republic Riverview Farms

411
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:33,600
gushments gushments yeah

412
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:35,759
gushments we got Smalls of gushments it

413
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:37,319
was it was it was good bargain weed dude

414
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:40,319
check out the buds though so it's all

415
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:42,359
smalls yeah you're getting small I mean

416
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:45,599
they're good Smalls though like

417
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:47,339
I think it smells delicious but while

418
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:50,939
I'm smoking and I'm feeling the high but

419
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:53,279
as we stop now it went away so that's

420
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:55,320
why I think it was five dollars

421
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:57,899
yeah it's interesting yeah it's it's

422
00:17:55,319 --> 00:18:00,240
hard to I mean but if you compare these

423
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:02,940
I think that's pretty accurate yeah yeah

424
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,460
like as far as quality goes

425
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:07,620
oh man I might have tricked you by

426
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:10,380
putting a another five dollar one here

427
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:13,979
you just never know oh let's see yeah

428
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:16,679
let's see what let's see what goes

429
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,880
so tell us a little bit about Jamaica

430
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:20,240
you just got back from Jamaica you've

431
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:23,460
been working with Don Corleone yeah man

432
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,160

writer Don Corleone amazing producer you

435
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,779
know I think my album this year is gonna

436
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,940
be

437
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:38,279
something that the Grammy is going to be

438
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:40,620
looking at so yes really that's the

439
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:41,639
level of music that I think it's so tell

440
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,139
us a little bit about your new album

441
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,640
it's a little different style I got to

442
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,259
hear it in Atlanta when I was there and

443
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,360
I'm freaking blown away because it's a

444
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:51,119
different style than that I always put

445
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:54,418
out you know how I sing I sing deep and

446
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:57,359
I like to go into the music that uplift

447
00:18:54,419 --> 00:19:01,559
and really resonate with your heart yeah

448
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:04,740
but this this stuff just just

449
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:07,798
it's like um like blood to your body

450
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:10,819
it's a new style for me it's more uppity

451
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:13,619
beat it but you know at the same time

452
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:17,099
it's still the message that I would like

453
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:20,639
to carry right and portray myself as so

454
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:22,558

483
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:39,240
it's super gas like I like the candy in

484

don't like the half candy this has a

489
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:52,500
little tiny hint of it but it's super

490
00:20:49,259 --> 00:20:54,240
strong in the gas yeah it's my taste of

491
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:57,720
the Skittles but

492
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,160
the gas comes at you like whoa gas and

493
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,038
there's cream there that's it's it's

494
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:04,500
nice it's really nice I would pay for

495
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:07,319
that I must say

496
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:09,179
yeah look how it burns clean I mean I

497
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:11,819
think it's a winner

498
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:13,019
this would be nice in a pre-roller too

499
00:21:11,819 --> 00:21:14,819
I don't I don't know if they do

500
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:16,379
pre-rolls I think I saw this in a while

501
00:21:14,819 --> 00:21:17,759
back but I haven't tried any of their

502
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,020
pre-rolls I'm sure they're probably good

503
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:20,519
yeah

504
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:22,079
they're producing good work I mean they

505
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:24,918
got a bunch of different varieties there

506
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:27,058

Ultra delicious

508

and then it has one of those uplifting

509
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,659
highs that's the one thing Skittles is

510
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:34,980
on what's that back flavor you get in

511
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:37,760
from there

512
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:40,079

514
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:44,279
like creamy breadiness to it maybe again

515
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:47,100
we

516
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:48,779
oh it's interesting that's nice James

517
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:50,158
but yeah so we're talking about Skittles

518
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:52,200
and Skittles is on this upward Trend

519
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,760
it's become really popular again and

520
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,919
I've always loved Skittles you know it's

521
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:58,679
like yeah yeah the first time I smoked

522
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:01,259
Skittles was in 2014 at the High Times

523
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:02,759
Cannabis Cup in San Francisco I believe

524
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:05,279
Brandon

525
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:08,339
from third gen walked up to me and I was

526
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:11,399
with Kenny from tricome Technologies and

527
00:22:08,339 --> 00:22:12,839
we hit it and I was like holy [ __ ] still

528
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,759
to this day I have that kind of holy

529
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:16,859
[ __ ] every time I smoke I'm like oh man

530
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:18,900
this is this is what weed should taste

531
00:22:16,859 --> 00:22:21,599
like and I think if all the [ __ ] tasted

532
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:23,159
on the level that Skittles does

533
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:25,199
more people would smoke weed for one

534
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:27,960
thing yeah yeah because the first time I

535
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,779
I got Skittles I was like how did they

536
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:33,240
do this what did they what how did they

537
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:35,460
Infuse it with something and then they

538
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:38,819
were like man this genetic is going to

539
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:42,960
be the next thing yeah and so sad so

540
00:22:38,819 --> 00:22:46,319
done Skittles is uh one of the you know

541
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,460
the most sorted after strain right now

542
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:49,798
yeah

543
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:51,900

way for me it's a dream you know I met

553
00:23:13,798 --> 00:23:20,460
James and he fascinated me with you know

554
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:23,279
the the works of the seed and how it

555
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:25,679
actually you know is actually the engine

556
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:28,440
of marijuana and

557
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:30,538
I just wanted to be a part of that and

558
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,759
we've been doing a lot of good things

559
00:23:30,538 --> 00:23:36,480
with the marijuana breeding a lot of

560
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:38,879
good strains and you know the process of

561
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,159
you know selecting for me has been

562
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:44,700
wonderful you know I've learned so much

563
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:48,360
about marijuana and James you know

564
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:50,700
I I was kind of a one strain-minded guy

565
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:55,139
but then I you know learned to

566
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:57,419
appreciate yeah you went to GMO you went

567
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:59,159
from OG to like GMO and then you were

568
00:23:57,419 --> 00:24:02,100
you were puffing hard so you were

569
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:04,500
[ __ ] GMO yeah crazy bro yeah that

570
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:06,480
stuff gets you super high bro you quit

571
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:10,019
doing dabs in your smoking GM no

572
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:12,779
remember no actually the GMO reminded me

573
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:15,119
of dab so I could I could smoke and dab

574
00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:16,798
at the same time that was my feeling but

575
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:18,839
at the same time

576
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:21,960
I made a lot of good music off of that

577
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:23,939
gmodo yeah that meditation and that

578
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,960
state of mind that I needed to be in

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,798
learned to you know navigate and

588
00:24:51,298 --> 00:24:56,220
understand that

589
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:58,379
the weed is a industry that grows and if

590
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:00,298
it's growing a lot of different things

595
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,558
having positive impacts here talking

596
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:13,500
about cannabis definitely for so long

597
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:15,720
you know it wasn't a mainstream thing

598
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,640
and people looked at it negatively you

599
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,140
know good people even looked at it

600
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,700
negatively because they didn't fully

601
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,600
understand it that's all [ __ ]

602
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:25,140
changing

603
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:28,019
we we live in a world where you know my

604
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:30,059
parents weren't heavy smokers I I was

605
00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:31,918
just about to say I would I never

606
00:25:30,058 --> 00:25:35,339
thought I would see that day that my mom

607
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:37,860
would be using a CBD product exactly me

608
00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:39,480
too so you see what I'm saying so yeah

609
00:25:37,859 --> 00:25:41,579
my parents have a CBD company yeah

610
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,079
that's like uh sweet Wellness is the

611
00:25:41,579 --> 00:25:47,220
name of their CBD company out of Texas

612
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:51,658
but they were against marijuana when I

613
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:53,038
was younger exactly dude Sanjay Gupta is

614
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:55,260
the one that changed a lot of it when he

615
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:57,240
had a 60-minute special and he had kids

616
00:25:55,259 --> 00:25:58,500
that were being cured of their disease

617
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,778
with cancer

618
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:02,880
uh well with cancer with the Cannabis

619
00:26:00,778 --> 00:26:06,419
see I'm high yeah it's a good thing

620
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:09,659
though but yeah it's not about James I

621
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:12,720
must say that yeah man but my parents

622
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:15,179
back then if they ever knew

623
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,058
that I'm involved in cannabis that would

624
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:19,798
have been bad for me because I would

625
00:26:18,058 --> 00:26:20,879
have got a whooping my parents would

626
00:26:19,798 --> 00:26:22,798
have been Invincible I mean they were

627
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,778
disappointed I mean because I was pretty

628
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:26,460
honest with them uh all the way about

629
00:26:24,778 --> 00:26:28,380
what I've done you know I was a chef

630
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:31,620
I've done other stuff but one thing I

631
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:34,679
think we both have in common that very

632
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:36,719
few people have in common is that if you

633
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:38,400
looked at our 18 year old selves and you

634
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,339
told them what the [ __ ] we're doing now

635
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,659
they were like right amazing yeah

636
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:44,699
amazing you know what I mean to be able

637
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:45,840
to kill that story is that your 18 year

638

00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:28,678
this let's do this you know and this

655
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:30,240
time we're going back there with a plan

656
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:33,000
that we're doing this and doing that

657
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,558
yeah we kind of got yeah I'm not gonna

658
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,419
say we got screwed but covet screwed

659
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:37,918
everybody but definitely like right when

660
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:40,080
we were about to launch Ganja Farmer

661
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:43,520
Seed Company in Europe all of a sudden

662
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:46,079
covet hit we had this booth set up

663
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:48,839
a good chunk on all this stuff and doing

664
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:50,399
it right and we had a booth set up it

665
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:51,839
was a beautiful Booth they had like the

666
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,778
banners up and everything we didn't even

667
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:56,339
get to use the booth and so that kind of

668
00:27:54,778 --> 00:27:58,798
put us back a little bit but it's like

669
00:27:56,339 --> 00:28:00,298
all this stuff happens for a reason I

670
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:01,980
believe that I believe so we're on the

671
00:28:00,298 --> 00:28:04,259
right pathway we're doing the things the

672
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:07,558
right way and you know a guy's a farmer

673
00:28:04,259 --> 00:28:10,158
Seed Company uh is gonna take off yeah

674
00:28:07,558 --> 00:28:14,278
we have so much more to offer now and

675
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:16,860
and then as far as you know genetics you

676
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:18,480
know it's the best that we can offer to

677
00:28:16,859 --> 00:28:20,399
the world I think there's some good

678
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,440
stuff I think there's a good variety of

679
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,080
stuff so and the gods of farmer seeds

680
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,640
will be available on James lab genetics

681
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:29,819
definitely it'll be online soon and

682
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:32,820
everyone will get to enjoy what we enjoy

683
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:35,579
you know which is growing good strains

684
00:28:32,819 --> 00:28:37,918
and getting good results when you grow

685
00:28:35,579 --> 00:28:40,439
your strain and smoking good weed oh

686
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,940
yeah definitely does it yeah it's funny

687
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,320
we I don't think either one of us smoked

688
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,940
nearly as much as we used to but we

689
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:47,579
still smoke a good amount I can still

690
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:50,278
put it down especially joints I love on

691
00:28:47,579 --> 00:28:51,720
my days off really unfortunate but I

692
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:54,240
don't smoke as much during the days as I

693
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:59,600
used to say that I sit down and remember

694
00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:03,240
what I would smoke non-stop all day bro

695
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:05,639
it's like you don't dab anymore I I do a

696
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,259
little bit I do like the cold start you

697
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,120
know the baby dabs yeah you know if I

698
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:11,278
take a dab now I would fall asleep

699
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:13,199
immediately yeah I mean I got a pen I

700
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:16,440
love my pens I still use that that's

701
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,840
like I do have a pen at home but I don't

702
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:21,538
travel with it as much because I don't

703
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:24,119
really go to the pen how was the

704
00:29:21,538 --> 00:29:25,619
farmer's cup so you did the judging for

705
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:28,259
the farmer's cup what do you think of

706
00:29:25,619 --> 00:29:29,519
the the entries do you have you have a

707
00:29:28,259 --> 00:29:31,859
good time there's a lot of products I

708
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:34,558
saw the video that was a lot of products

709
00:29:31,859 --> 00:29:37,439
let me tell you this James people are

710
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:40,019
sure being Innovative yeah you know and

711
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,538
trying to be the best is what at what

712
00:29:40,019 --> 00:29:45,058
they do yeah but you know sometimes you

713
00:29:42,538 --> 00:29:47,640
got to really fine tune what you're

714
00:29:45,058 --> 00:29:50,119
given to the world and make sure that

715
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:53,038
it's absolutely the best product cause

716
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:56,099
what I like for myself is what I want to

717
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:58,919
present to people in any aspect of sale

718
00:29:56,099 --> 00:30:01,678
you know so that's just something for

719
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:04,020
people to think about yeah as far as the

720
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:07,980
family so did you judge just the flower

721
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:11,158
or did they you just extract in I I went

722
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:14,038
through the chocolate

723
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:17,940
there was chocolate entries yep I went

724
00:30:14,038 --> 00:30:20,940
through pure rolls I did flowers and

725
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:23,640
then I did some like

726
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:26,460
like drinks you know what do you think

727
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,919
of the new beverages man

728
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:30,480
I don't think I'm all that too fancy of

729
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:32,940
the flavors they're choosing though

730
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,099
interesting I I really I'm a fan I know

731
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:37,080
that's like the next big thing you know

732
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:39,778
but

733
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:42,960
I don't know if it's a Pacific you know

734
00:30:39,778 --> 00:30:46,079
cup yeah you know and that's limited to

735
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:49,079
what those people presented but

736
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:51,480
sometimes a thought is not really good

737
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:53,278
in taste yeah you see what I'm saying

738
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,500
well I think so many products

739
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:56,880
conceptually sound good like in your

740
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:59,339
mind it sounds like this is going to be

741
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,380
amazing but you have to do a lot of r d

742
00:30:59,339 --> 00:31:03,298
and you can't just stop at a certain

743
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:04,919
point until it's right and I mean over

744
00:31:03,298 --> 00:31:06,538
time that's like what we do with

745
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:09,360
breeding and everything else we don't

746
00:31:06,538 --> 00:31:11,398
stop and I mean at least I try not to

747
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:13,139
just stop and go that's good enough yeah

748
00:31:11,398 --> 00:31:14,699
you want to get we wanted the best

749
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:16,500
product yeah especially with something

750
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,940
that's going to be so competitive you

751
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,259
better have something that's amazing and

752
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:21,058
it's just like everything with cannabis

753
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:23,099
you better have a competitive product

754
00:31:21,058 --> 00:31:25,740
these days to be successful it's not

755
00:31:23,099 --> 00:31:28,558
like you join in a market where there is

756
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:30,120
nobody there to compete with and you're

757
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:32,879
just giving people something that

758
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:34,678
they're gonna get accustomed to yeah you

759
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:38,278
know people already know what they want

760
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:41,159
yeah as far as cannabis culture goes

761
00:31:38,278 --> 00:31:44,519
right so you got to really come with

762
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:46,440
something that Wows the taste buds or

763
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:47,298
even their smoke so what's your new

764
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,700
favorite

765
00:31:47,298 --> 00:31:53,579
oh man I just

766
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:55,798
can't even say right now my new I like

767
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:58,019
the Mochi right now

768
00:31:55,798 --> 00:31:59,639
there's good Mochi and bad Mochi but I

769
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:02,339
agree mochi's good when you're in good

770
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,980
when you get a good Mochi you get a good

771
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:06,240
that flavor tasty

772
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:08,720
yeah I mean it's all about tasty weed

773
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,980
these days that flavor is to die foreign

774
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,538
especially like if you roll joints of it

775
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:15,179
I want it to taste good I was really

776
00:32:12,538 --> 00:32:17,398
surprised with the samples today you

777
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:20,399
know not the sfk I'm used to smoking sfk

778
00:32:17,398 --> 00:32:23,038
and I really like their product yeah but

779
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:24,418
the other two were for their price it

780
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:26,519
was not bad

781
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:28,940
if I didn't have a lot of money I would

782
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:31,918
probably yeah either one of those

783
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:33,600
products and to be honest with you I

784
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,880
figured the five dollar left in my mind

785
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:38,339
was gonna be garbage right like I've

786
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:40,440
seen garbage weed in wreck too that but

787
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:43,139
it wasn't garbage no that wasn't garbage

788
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,399
no you know it's like all three of those

789
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:48,480
definitely have their place in the

790
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:50,819
morning yep yep and I know in the market

791
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,099
there's a buyer for every

792
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:56,158
for all three of those there are buyers

793
00:32:53,099 --> 00:32:58,439
yeah because people smoke differently

794
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:01,440
I know people that

795
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:03,899
thinks that you know oh I can't smoke

796
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,940
that Mochi it's too much and I know

797
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:08,939
people that

798
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:12,000
they can't get enough of that moochie so

799
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:12,778
definitely these three strain here right

800
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,538
here

801
00:33:12,778 --> 00:33:18,000
that we tested today have a place in the

802
00:33:15,538 --> 00:33:19,619
market and I would definitely buy any

803
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,419
one of them and smoke

804
00:33:19,619 --> 00:33:25,558
I mean

805
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:27,600
yeah ish ish yes because you know what I

806
00:33:25,558 --> 00:33:28,859
would lean to well no and it's always

807
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:30,359
like we want to smoke the best stuff

808
00:33:28,859 --> 00:33:31,979
that we can afford right like there's a

809
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:35,639
price point for anything I mean I heard

810
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:38,399
about 1800 ounces the other day 18 100

811
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:40,559
ounces living soil weed

812
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:43,558
that's a nice that shit's crazy it

813
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:45,058
should be nice I I wonder that would

814
00:33:43,558 --> 00:33:47,460
probably be something that we would like

815
00:33:45,058 --> 00:33:49,558
