23
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,640
how you get your start in the industry

24
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:56,320
yeah I got my start kind of um you know

25
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,120
just growing growing uh selling weed you

26
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,039
know I first started out just uh selling

27
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:03,399
really mhm and uh then I just evolved

28
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,719
into uh growing and making seeds you

29
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:07,478
know what I mean did you sell before you

30
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:08,959
smoked or did you start I sold before I

31
00:01:07,478 --> 00:01:11,039
smoked we that's that seems to be a

32
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:13,438
common theme with a lot of people but I

33
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,640

58
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:16,000

so I mean nice did you have friends that

63
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,120
made seeds is that how you desire or the

64
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,640
no no I didn't really have anybody no

65
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,959
forms yeah I'm like total nobody in my

66
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:36,000
family you know I'm first generation

67
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,199
right you know I just kind of figured it

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,919
out like kind of on my own I I got a a

69
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:42,759
Soma that Som style uhuh that's the only

70
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:43,799
book I kind of found and I started

71
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:45,959
reading there and he started talking

72
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,920
about how to make femin seeds right like

73
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:50,400
naturally like how you naturally reverse

74
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:53,359
the plant and so I started doing that

75
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,360
like 0708 you know right when I started

76
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,040
uh learning how to grow yeah you know so

77
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,200
it was like um I figured out really

78
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,959
quick it's like I got to learn how to

79
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:02,719
grow first before I make seeds and you

80
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,640
know I was trying to do both at once and

81
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:07,799
right and it did it did like develop you

82
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:10,958
know uh together right you know what I

83
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:12,680
mean but um so you know my whole thing

84
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,479
was to make feminized seeds and to make

85
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:18,360
stuff for myself that was really good I

86
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:20,199
wanted to make you know a strain

87
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,599
everybody knew like you you know back

88
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:23,759
then you stick your head in a bag you

89
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:26,479
could be like oh that's that's Bubba

90
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:28,158
Kush oh that's Blue Dream oh that's this

91
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,318
oh that's this kush or whatever you know

92
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:32,158
used to be a oh it's purple whatever

93
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:33,878
you know You' be able to be distinctive

94
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:35,479
there wasn't like a million strains I

95
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:37,120
mean there's a lot more but not like

96
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:40,000
there is now you know there wasn't 300

97
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,560
gelato St yeah exactly a million runs

98
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,878
it's like right you know and then you

99
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,319
got the guys that are kind of making fun

100
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:48,000
of gelato and Skittles but they like

101
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:51,560
love runs and everybody's confused you

102
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,719
know totally confused yeah yeah I mean I

103
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,239
think it's confusing quality is

104
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:56,239
confusing to a lot of people yeah you

105
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:58,079
know I think there's a lot of people

106
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,759
that are confused by what quality is and

107
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:03,200
Instagram is 100% to blame you know I

108
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:04,560
think that before Instagram we saw the

109
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:05,598
bud and there was a lot more about

110
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,799
effect but then all of a sudden

111
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:09,199
Instagram came out and we saw these

112
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,438
beautiful photos and people like that's

113
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:14,000
the onein I want that because the way it

114
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,799
looks it's definitely a Instagram is

115
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,879
there's Instagram weed it's definitely a

116
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:20,478
thing for sure you know like back then

117
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:22,680
it it effects is really what What

118
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:25,039
mattered and uh and the high you know

119
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,478
you want to get want to we want to fill

120
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,280
it you know what I mean and some of this

121
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:31,120
stuff now is just people are seeing

122
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:32,679
pictures and basing their breeding off

123
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,680
of that and not even really growing it

124
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,560
out and smoking it you know I laugh at

125
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,918
some people that you know they post a

126
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,319
picture and they're like it's like wheat

127
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:40,839
six or seven they're like this is my

128
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:42,639
keeper I'm like so you're you're not

129
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:43,719
even picking you're not smoking at or

130
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,038
you're just going by how it takes

131
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,960
Instagram pictures yeah it's like okay

132
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:49,839
come on man like so many people are like

133
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:53,198
that yeah I totally base everything off

134
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:56,000
of not not really like tests so much as

135
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,960
like just me smoking it because right

136
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,639
you know I'm I'm the test you know it's

137
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:01,198
what I want to smoke it's what gets me

138
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:02,680
high it's what I like cuz that's why I

139
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,478
originally started I didn't originally

140
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:08,720
start making seeds to sell them I made

141
00:05:05,478 --> 00:05:11,199
them for myself yeah you know and uh

142
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,520
I've done a lot of a lot of testing a

143
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,879
lot of uh a lot of R&amp;D smoking you know

144
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:18,120
smoking my own strains yeah and then

145
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:19,478
also stress testing I fully believe in

146
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,918
you know stress testing your plants

147
00:05:19,478 --> 00:05:23,000
growing them out and that's the only way

148
00:05:20,918 --> 00:05:25,279
you're going to really get strong fims I

149
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,680
I really stand behind my fims and I've

150
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,079
done a lot of work like I've been

151
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,038
messing around since 2008 I haven't

152
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:33,599
really made

153
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:36,360
serious films till like about 2015

154
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,000
2016 and then um you know my company

155
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,319
started I started up in 2017 so you

156
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,319
started with a lot of stable genetics

157
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,560
though back in the day because I feel

158
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:46,120
like the stuff back you know 15 years

159
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,079
ago was a lot more stable than it is

160
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,720
today especially sexually stable

161
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:55,038
definitely no it it really was u a lot

162
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:57,639
more stable stuff and it was easier for

163
00:05:55,038 --> 00:06:01,038
me to really learn more about uh

164
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:02,478
breeding and how to make uh good fims

165
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:04,120
right and you know how it all works

166
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:07,000
because I'm kind of just you know going

167
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,879
off that Soma book and and uh you know

168
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,720
teaching myself a lot of trial and error

169
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:12,680
a lot of growing and to get where I'm at

170
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,199
today when you if you cross stuff that's

171
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,639
very distinct if you're Crossing two

172
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:19,879
gelato it's hard to see what the progyny

173
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:21,639
is actually getting from the two parents

174
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:23,918
which one it came from whereas if you

175
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:26,319
have like a sativa and you have

176
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:28,079
something that's more that's what I love

177
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,039
to do SE sativa and something small

178
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:33,560
something tall and then the fos are

179
00:06:30,038 --> 00:06:35,399
really easy to to pick out absolutely

180
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,000
you know it's it's uh that's one of my

181
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:38,679
favorite things to do like I like uh

182
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,439
doing a lot of breeding with green crack

183
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:44,560
I have the old green crack uh cut green

184
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:46,918
it's real short it's a special strain

185
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,639
though special yeah and it's one of

186
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:50,519
those ones I build a tolerance to it

187
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,918
really really really fast but when you

188
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:53,879
smoke it for the first time after you've

189
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:55,560
harvested it it'll rock your world

190
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:56,918
definitely but then you know by the time

191
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,199
you're sharing it with your friends a

192
00:06:56,918 --> 00:06:59,079
week later you have this big tolerance

193
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:01,079
to it and they're all just getting their

194
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:03,478
asses is kicked by it yeah I do the same

195
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:05,318
thing and and um but still I'll think I

196
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:06,918
have much tolerance built up to it but

197
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:08,919
I'll go to smoke it when I want to go to

198
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:10,399
sleep yeah and I'll just be staring at

199
00:07:08,918 --> 00:07:12,758
the wall for three hours you know just

200
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:15,198
like oh my gosh like can't can't go to

201
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:16,639
bed but yeah I like to do some breeding

202
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,560
with the green crack it's a old strain I

203
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,079
found it you know I'm from I'm from

204
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,519
Fresno so it's like a lot of a lot of

205
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:25,598
good strains a lot of good breeders have

206
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:26,839
come out of that around that area for

207
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:28,878
sure that was hay brothers that

208
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:30,478
originally bred that like blue dream

209
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:34,280
green cra

210
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:36,120
yeah yeah a bunch of awesome stuff yeah

211
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:37,959
it's such a unique strain and so many

212
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,439
people grow it it's really a part of a

213
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:42,878
part of cannabis history a lot of people

214
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:44,519
grew it and uh you know and I think it's

215
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,599
just so special

216
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:50,439
because it grows so much like an indicia

217
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:52,598
it's so small and it has such a sativa

218
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:55,959
High yeah it's really really unique

219
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:58,560
nitrous oxide and beef jerky

220
00:07:55,959 --> 00:08:00,198
yeah the best velous stuff on the planet

221
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,598
yeah no it's it's interesting clamp for

222
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:05,560
sure yeah just I plan on actually mixing

223
00:08:02,598 --> 00:08:06,560
it with uh Panama Red nice because uh I

224
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,759
actually had it

225
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,918
phos the Green Crack MH and um it's the

226
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:14,680
furthest a part I know everybody doesn't

227
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:16,598
like phos or whatever but you know they

228
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,720
kind of fill off a long time ago it's

229
00:08:16,598 --> 00:08:19,800
the furthest apart in the Galaxy yeah I

230
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,879
figure you know there's a lot of

231
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,918
bottlenecking going on like you see the

232
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:25,680
gelada it's just it's totally crazy and

233
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:27,038
people don't even realize really what

234
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,360
they're doing to the genetics they don't

235
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:29,878
understand the genetics well they think

236
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,199
they're making out crosses when they're

237
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,959
in breeding and I think that's one of

238
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,038
the biggest problems today is we get all

239
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,000
these guys that are thinking they're

240
00:08:34,038 --> 00:08:37,399
making new stuff they're they're making

241
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,958
novel stuff and they're not and they're

242
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:41,399
taken away from the Vigor and they don't

243
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:43,000
realize you're you're degrading the

244
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:45,879
genetics you need to find things that

245
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
are further apart bring them together

246
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:50,159
and that's what creates the Vigor and

247
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,480
you find like a special plant like I

248
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:53,879
make some crosses sometimes I'm just

249
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,839
like man this is this is better than the

250
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:56,919
the mom and the dad yeah you know what I

251
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,120
mean it's like that's really the goal of

252
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:59,719
breeding at the end of the day is to

253
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,278
make something better than the and the

254
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,360
dad exactly but you're just like holy

255
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:04,480
[ __ ] they're complet it's like a

256
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:07,399
completely new thing it doesn't really

257
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,560
have too much of either Char

258
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:10,200
accomplished if you make something

259
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:11,399
better than both of the parents and I

260
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,480
feel like that's where a lot of people

261
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:14,879
fall short is they make stuff and it's

262
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,759
not better than neither one of the

263
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:19,519
parents right and they're still they

264
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:21,519
don't even T put it out there so much

265
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,480
stuff it's a lot of lot of that going on

266
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,639
now we're doing it as a whole within the

267
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,320
industry you know it's like the second

268
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:29,759
people get fixated on one thing whether

269
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,440
it's candy or whether it's purple or

270
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:33,360
whether you know we start fixating on

271
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,600
one thing we take away a lot of the

272
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,759
diversity as as an industry and then it

273
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,320
doesn't seem like we're doing it because

274
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:39,879
everybody's doing it and everyone jumps

275
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,839
on this train and it's not necessarily

276
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:43,559
the right train right I mean I'm guilty

277
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,360
of it too I have a bunch of gelato

278
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:47,719
crosses yeah you know what I mean but

279
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,320
it's like at least I'm aware of what's

280
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,480
going on there and well it's what sells

281
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,519
right now right so if you're not

282
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,639
following the trends then you're not

283
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:56,320
necessarily going to be able to sell

284
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:58,720
seeds yeah I mean I like to sell taste

285
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,040
the T the weed to taste good when yeah

286
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,160
when I SM smoke it you know what I mean

287
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:04,439
like a lot of this stuff now I'm just

288
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:06,240
like oh I feel like uh we could have

289
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,920
hunted this better or you know some of

290
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,159
this stuff is just like not there're

291
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:11,000
older turps I'm just like where are

292
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:12,480
these coming from we're already done

293
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,839
with these you know they're branded as

294
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,759
new turps but they've been around for a

295
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,079
long time exactly it's so crazy to hear

296
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:20,600
some new name on Old I'm like no it's

297
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:22,759
you know it's uh Jacker is a big one

298
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,600
yeah you know uh well Jack Herer used to

299
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:26,319
be good people don't understand it's

300
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,120
associated with a bad name but like some

301
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,360
of the Jack the original Jacks that we

302
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,480
were seeing and in the 90s and early

303
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,919
like early 2000s the one I was seeing

304
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:39,159
was like definitely like more complex it

305
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:41,000
wasn't so straight trolene limonene

306
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:43,319
right you know and it definitely got you

307
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,240
ripped off your ass yeah no I don't not

308
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,760
like it it's just when somebody presents

309
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:50,079
it as something else yeah and then it's

310
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:51,639
it's clearly this you can't call it that

311
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:53,319
you cannot call it it's like come on you

312
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:54,639
know yeah I mean it's blue dream is

313
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,399
another one that got renamed a bunch and

314
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:58,159
the real blue dream is fire you know I

315
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,958
mean I think it really was the turps got

316
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:01,278
burnt out you know here in Cali CU so

317
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:03,039
many people were growing it because it

318
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:05,078
was so easy to grow you know you're

319
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:08,199
hitting three AI back on the

320
00:11:05,078 --> 00:11:10,479
double-ended bulbs I mean a single I was

321
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,399
getting 2.2 PBS and like that that back

322
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,399
in the day was like everyone got 1.5 and

323
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,879
then I had gotten 2.2 on that and it was

324
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,559
like I always had the saying that you

325
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:19,159
could [ __ ] in the reservoir and still

326
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:20,518
get two pounds of light and with blue

327
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:21,719
dream you really could I say the same

328
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:23,200
thing i' be like you could piss on the

329
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,560
on the plant and it'll still come out

330
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:29,079
good it still come out good it big huge

331
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:31,039
chunky we doing a like the dwc hydro

332
00:11:29,078 --> 00:11:32,599
back then yeah so let's talk about that

333
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:34,719
actually we'll dive into that cuz you're

334
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:38,920
big into the dwc and I think you grow

335
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:42,040
really good dwc products uh my buddy uh

336
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:44,399
from Master Yoda he's he's a big dwc guy

337
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:47,159
as well he wins a bunch of competitions

338
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,799
and stuff and so people people knock it

339
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:51,360
people knock Hydro they knock three part

340
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:53,759
they knock all these things but grow you

341
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,639
know weed grown correctly is good weed

342
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:58,078
you know I feel like weed well is good

343
00:11:55,639 --> 00:12:00,159
good weed I feel like a lot of people uh

344
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:02,799
on the high Hydro whatever it is

345
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:04,399
recirculating dwc bubble ponic whatever

346
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:07,679
it is it's it's all it comes down to the

347
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,320
flush yeah you know and you you can't

348
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:11,759
it's a short flush and you need to be

349
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,519
flushing with nutrients for a period of

350
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:16,360
time right and not not just you know

351
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:18,000
these guys if you give it five seven

352
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,680
days of just water you just ruined your

353
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,198
whole crop yeah you know you go in the

354
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:24,078
room it's sticky it smells it's good and

355
00:12:22,198 --> 00:12:25,799
then a couple days later it's just dry

356
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:29,239
and you know I've done it yeah I've done

357
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:30,838
it I've flushed for too long and um it's

358
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,919
I really feel like it's in the flush and

359
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:33,639
and really what you're putting in the

360
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:36,039
system if you have healthy Roots if you

361
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:37,799
have if your plant is growing healthy

362
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:40,120
you know it's it's just that little bit

363
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:42,078
at the end every every medium needs a

364
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:45,679
different flush yeah you know and I feel

365
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:47,799
like um I do do the old dwc I do the

366
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:49,679
General Hydroponics buckets really but I

367
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:51,639
just made old school with the Halos yeah

368
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:55,039
with the Halos yeah yeah yeah you know

369
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:56,759
and uh it's just the the rapid growth

370
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:58,000
that you get with deep water culture

371
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:59,519
especially with those Halos you could

372
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,480
totally cheat with the Halos cuz the

373
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,360
water can go down right so the water

374
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,320
level is really important doing dwc and

375
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,000
recirculating but with the Halos it's

376
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,879
totally cheating because the water level

377
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,720
could could almost be empty but as long

378
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:13,240
as that Halo's still dripping on the top

379
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,120
the plants the plants are still fine I

380
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,919
mean you don't want to do that but so do

381
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,919
you flush with sugars and and like yeah

382
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:21,039
sugars at the end and magnesium sugar

383
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:23,278
and just a little

384
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:26,799
bit I don't really push I just give it

385
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:29,759
like the regular the regular uh like a

386
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:32,639
ripen yeah but I just just lower the

387
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:35,399
ppms yeah just slowly lowering the ppms

388
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,480
all the way down and then uh within that

389
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:40,120
flush week you know week nine or 10

390
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:42,759
whatever you decide to do uh it usually

391
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,959
go 63 to 70 days depending on the plant

392
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:47,120
but a lot of my a lot of my stuff is has

393
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,599
done it 70 days you know so it's a lot

394
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,679
stronger too I feel like the stuff that

395
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,199
goes you know because some of the

396
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:53,159
genetics I mean it just depends on the

397
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:55,319
varieties you have but some of the

398
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:58,240
genetics is like Skittles is like a 53

399
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,920
to 56 Day plant I feel Skittles is so

400
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,440
funny cuz everybody loves Skittles and

401
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:03,679
it it's like this hash thing and uh it

402
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,079
is really good the turps are just

403
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:08,559
amazing are good everybody wants these

404
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:11,399
huge washers right but skills is like

405
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:13,958
one or two% no it's yeah it doesn't was

406
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:16,198
it it grows like the worst plant ever

407
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:18,198
like it it just doesn't want to grow

408
00:14:16,198 --> 00:14:20,439
it's the polar opposite of blue dream

409
00:14:18,198 --> 00:14:24,120
blue dream over here it is the exact

410
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:26,440
obious like that uh that movie of twins

411
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,159
it's Danny Deo it's Danny Deo it is the

412
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:31,199
Danny deito of cannabis yeah definitely

413
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:32,439
yeah that's a great analogy yeah you

414
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:34,599
know and I think there are some good

415
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:37,120
Skittle crosses you know you helped me

416
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:40,040
uh you were you entered in the contest

417
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,759
but you also helped me judge I feel like

418
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:43,439
much fun to judge everything yeah we had

419
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:45,240
a lot of good entries in the first and

420
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,040
second place where both Skittle acrosses

421
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,278
on steroids I feel like they were both

422
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,639
stronger than the original yeah and

423
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:52,958
definitely I wasn't trying to talk bad

424
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:55,680
about the Skittles is just it really

425
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:57,278
goes to show that TPS really win in the

426
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:59,479
end I mean look at that plant it doesn't

427
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:00,879
wash everybody's washing it doesn't grow

428
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,680
everybody's grow you look at it wrong

429
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:06,198
and it shrivels up yeah so it's like if

430
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,479
you have the proper TPS you know the

431
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:08,879
other stuff doesn't matter you know when

432
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,639
we're I'm starting to wash all my

433
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:14,958
strains and getting into uh into washing

434
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:17,680
I got um gasman Exotics helping me out

435
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:19,399
he's a he's big into washing he has a

436

439
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:27,479
long time I think like 2016 or 17 now

440
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,680
yeah you guys use resend to test for

441
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:32,079
watch you we have I haven't yet I want

442
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:33,559
to get into the resin dial I I want to

443
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:36,638
get one of those for sure it's like a

444
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:38,119
back order something right now um but

445
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,680
yeah the resin dial is like the next

446
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,039
step but right now you know I'm just

447
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:43,879
like doing what everybody says you know

448
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:46,198
how they say you got to it's it's all

449
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:48,360
funny you know you you put your fingers

450
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:51,000
on it you do this you see how much comes

451
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,440
off you you want the not the Slicker no

452
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,198

453
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,240
gritt stuff not greasy you want um they

454
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:58,919
say like gelato don't wash OG's don't

455
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,799
wash you know stuff like that looks

456
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:03,000
Frosty cuz the stems you know of the of

457
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:04,679
the actual Tri Chrome you want you're

458
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,639
looking for like a shorter Tri Chrome

459
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:09,000
with a bigger head is really that breaks

460
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,919
off easily is is kind of I me not I'm

461
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,039
not an expert don't quote me but it's

462
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:15,399
kind of more what you or more for the

463
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:17,159
washing washing side but I'm more into

464
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:18,559
the TPS I'm going to W you know I'm into

465
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:21,600
washing all my stuff right now and

466
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:23,638
getting the proper percentages like to

467
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,759
rosin you know a lot of people are like

468
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:31,318
oh I got whatever percentage they say 9%

469
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:33,440
6% uh 19 19% 10% yeah know like all this

470
00:16:31,318 --> 00:16:36,078
crazy stuff I'm just like okay percent

471
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,399
of what is that with the food grade yeah

472
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:40,719
is that to Hash is or is that pressed

473
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:44,360
out put in the jars right you know I

474
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,759
want where you know where's that where's

475
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,399
the percentage at you know what I mean

476
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,560
because uh everything that I I'm I'm

477
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:52,120
doing what's you know the end the end

478
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:54,479
product you know plus there is a lot of

479
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:57,639
uh leftover food product like the 160

480
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,800
and the and the uh 40 sure that's what

481
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:01,639

484
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:06,359
lot of people are are mixing it in there

485
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,240
to they get higher percentage and

486
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:10,838
they're calling it uh full spectrum you

487
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,439

but it's like no it's like you got to

490
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:18,078
put it in there otherwise it's not full

491
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,759
Spectre it's like yeah right okay yeah

492

is crazy the picture breing it's just

498
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,038
it's a lot of uh you know I do my best

499
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:35,839
to get out there and try to teach people

500
00:17:34,038 --> 00:17:38,240
the right way and and we do a lot of

501
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:40,119
like hom grower stuff yeah so we try to

502
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,960
really get like new Growers the people

503
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:43,959
that don't grow you know try to get

504
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,519
people on the page that that don't grow

505
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,360
and then yeah convert him into growing

506
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:50,000
totally you know what I mean and like be

507
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:51,759
look this is really easy and I really

508
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,200
try to get them into the deep water

509
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:55,960
culture uh right off the bat cuz I feel

510
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,240
like it's easy it's I feel like it's

511
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,400
forgiving some people be like it's not

512
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,919
forgiving you know it's really quick

513
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,080
quick but it compared to like soil I fre

514
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:04,799
I feel like it really is easier to

515
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:06,038
understand like what's in that bucket if

516
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:07,879
it's not right you could just dump it

517
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:09,119
out and it's so funny because I have the

518
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,320
exact opposite feeling because I've

519
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:14,038
struggled with dwc and and soil has that

520
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:16,158
buffer and so I like the buffer and then

521
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:18,798
I like cocoa and I I like the effect of

522
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:20,640
soil is the main thing but like yeah

523
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:23,158
it's what you know and on once you've

524
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,440
like mastered it it's very easy whatever

525
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:27,880
it is right and yeah I have that old

526
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,320
three-part nutrients from uh not the

527
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,559
nutrients the old chart yeah and it just

528
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:33,720
really works well and it's like really

529
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:37,319
hard to find online I don't know I don't

530
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:39,319
know why but um I run that the General

531
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:41,519
Hydroponics three-part you know in there

532
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:43,918
and it just it works really well I mean

533
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:46,000
the growth is just you know three four

534
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,440
weeks I mean I can't grow I can't veg

535
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,440
any longer than that and the plants are

536
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,798
just absolutely huge you know I think

537
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:55,080
the the biggest one I got was um I mean

538
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,918
I've hit I've hit a pound on the plant

539
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:59,519
but like consistently is like anywhere

540
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:01,759
from like 10 oz 12 O you know some 14

541
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:05,038
but it's like 3 we veg you're getting 10

542
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:07,158
o on a plant you know it's it's and it's

543
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:08,679
really fire it's good and and it stinks

544
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:10,200
you know you do the flush right

545
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:11,880
everything it comes out and you're

546
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,960
really really here to be like look guys

547
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:18,200
you could you can still get just as good

548
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:20,519
as of weed with dwc and yeah I could see

549
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,840
like um Organics being better in the way

550
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:24,599
of like uh more of a shelf life yeah it

551
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:28,319
probably has more of longer shelf life

552
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:30,000
you know and uh and there Organics is is

553
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,558
could be better whatever but it doesn't

554
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,200
mean that dwc is tripless and it's not

555
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:35,720
good weed no exactly you know I mean

556
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,960
yeah I mean it's all about the grower

557
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,440
too there has a lot to do with the

558
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,400
grower a lot to do with what they're

559
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:43,200
doing with it and flushing it and all

560
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,960
these things um but a lot of guys they

561
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,759
have stuff that's tasteless too that

562
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,159
that doesn't taste with a lot of tpps

563
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:51,000
exactly looks amazing and they're giving

564
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:52,559
everybody else a bad rap right but uh

565
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
yeah I've seen a lot of that Organics is

566
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,519
like some of it it's like really good

567
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,240
and some of it's like really just not

568
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:59,038
that good you know well the funny thing

569
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:02,759
is is so in the contest that we just

570
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:03,919
judged which uh the we're I'm announcing

571
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:05,359
in a couple days but we're actually

572
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:09,480
filming and this won't be aired for a

573
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:12,719
couple weeks but we had Coco we had soil

574
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:15,038
we had dwc so we had Hydroponics all

575
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,159
against each other and the guys who say

576
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:18,879
living soil is the best hands down they

577
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:21,200
were wrong as far as what the loudest

578
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,280
Bud was right they was grown in Cocoa

579
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,440
yeah so you know and then the living

580
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:28,399
soil came in second and you know and and

581
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,759
it's real interesting because you know

582
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,120
people always want to say well this is

583
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:33,079
the very best way and it's like well

584
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:34,439
that's the very best way for you right

585
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:36,359
right it's that's what I really try to

586
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,038
tell like uh people that are starting to

587
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:39,839
Growing you know we have a yeah like I

588
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:41,519
said I started the home Growers just

589
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:43,038
start growing it's like look just

590
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:44,079
because it's that that guy's doing it

591
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:46,119
that way or this guy's doing there's a

592
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:47,678
million different ways you can grow yeah

593
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:49,319
you just need to find your way like you

594
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,600
can't you're not going to do it exactly

595
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:52,000
like how I am I'm going to guide you and

596
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:54,839
you're going to have to find your own

597
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,400
little Groove yeah you know and that's

598
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:58,678
just how it works for everybody it's not

599
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,159
one one way of growing there's a lot of

600
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:02,320
different ways and you got to just find

601
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,400
your your way of doing it that you like

602
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:06,439
to do totally and I mean learning how to

603
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,559
grow in general is just that's an that's

604
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,798
an art and that's probably the best

605
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:10,839
thing to learn in the beginning is just

606
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:12,079
how to grow whatever it is just growing

607
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:13,359
skills it doesn't have to be wheed

608
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:15,119
either you can grow tomatoes yeah you

609
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:16,879
can grow you can grow anything I always

610
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:19,839
run a garden outside with a bunch of

611
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,278
different stuff I I grow I enjoy growing

612
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:22,678
plants and having a garden and

613
00:21:21,278 --> 00:21:24,839
everything like that it's really

614
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:26,320
therapeutic you know especially people

615
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:27,639
are just you know a lot of these guys

616
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:30,439
that's what they do in their Garden it's

617
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,320
their meditation time you know it's it's

618
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,880
a it's it does a lot of different things

619
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:36,079
for people not just smoking it growing

620
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,039
it too well and there's there's some

621
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:40,199
pride and you know people people there's

622
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:41,519
something special about growing

623
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,960
something and then consuming it whether

624
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:44,798
you're smoking it or eating it you grow

625
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,600
tomato and you eat that tomato it tastes

626
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:47,759
extra special that's part of the reason

627
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:50,918
why everyone thinks they have the best

628
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:52,000
weed is they grew it and they're like

629
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:54,240
you know and because there's an

630
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,960
attachment to that plant especially if

631
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,278
you took the time and and like breeding

632
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,400
is the same way but if you're growing a

633
00:21:57,278 --> 00:22:02,359
plant and you've put the days in whether

634
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,519
it's 53 days or 70 days of flower plus

635
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:05,798
it's a veg you've you've cared for that

636
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:07,359
plant throughout its entire life and

637
00:22:05,798 --> 00:22:09,119
then consuming it you have a special

638
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:10,839
relationship with that plant right and

639
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,959
so and not everybody can understand that

640
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:13,599
but same thing with breeding if you're

641
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,519
taking two things you're Crossing them

642
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:18,000
together you know breeding is the

643
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:20,400
marathon right so like it it may take

644
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,919
you years to properly pheno hunt and you

645
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,120
know a year to properly get something

646
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:25,919
out to where you could even bring it to

647
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:27,639
Market if you do it correct right but

648
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,960
then that's really special and you

649
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,720
understand the the life that plant and

650
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:34,480
its parents had and you know you know

651
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,000
what's gone into it yeah you know what's

652
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,880
gone into it and so there's something

653
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,839
special about popping a seed that you

654
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,840
made and seeing it you know to fruition

655
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:45,119
to where you have flour and that's part

656
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:46,599
of the beauty and that's why I think

657
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:48,319
everybody should breed I think I think

658
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:49,959
there's nothing wrong with people

659
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,240
breeding I think understanding what

660
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,880
you're doing is important but also just

661
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,120
going through the process so you can

662
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,919
understand that fulfillment because I

663
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:59,239
get fulfillment out of it yeah no

664
00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:00,600
definitely I I encourage everybody to to

665
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,359
make their own seeds and if they have

666
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:03,798
any questions on how to you know reverse

667
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:08,079
the plants or anything like that you

668
00:23:03,798 --> 00:23:10,599
know feel free to to ask you know and um

669
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:13,038
and yeah we we promote you know the hom

670
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:15,399
Growers to to definitely do do their own

671
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:17,599
thing and yeah and growing it's like you

672
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:21,120
know what you you put into that plant

673
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:23,158
it's and it's like um you're not at the

674
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:24,798
at the club or buying weed you don't

675
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:26,919
have no idea what they sprayed on it or

676
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:30,359
re remediated or whatever that word is

677
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:31,520
right you know you don't know what's uh

678
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:33,278
what's on there and if you grow the

679
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:35,359
plant yourself you grow it up you know

680
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:38,558
what you put into it the time the effort

681
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:40,079
you have a a new respect and and uh and

682
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:42,558
really passion for it I really fell in

683
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:44,240
love with with growing you know I really

684
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:46,000
I really liked it when I first started

685
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,720
doing it yeah and it's it's a lot more

686
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,679
challenging than people think but it's

687
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:52,159
it's very therapeutic at the same time I

688
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,559
mean right I think some people get into

689
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,320
it for the money and then they realize

690
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:57,399
that it's actual work that's the other

691
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:59,359
thing it's like this is actual work you

692
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,559
know we're slowly becoming tomato

693
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:03,359
farmers and I I think tomato Farmers

694
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:04,678
they deserve a lot of respect yeah you

695
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:07,839
know it's pretty amazing what tomato

696
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:09,679
farmers do and I think that cannabis

697
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:12,278
farmers and tomato Farmers you know it

698
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:15,200
used to there's this celebrity you know

699
00:24:12,278 --> 00:24:16,798
side of it but that's more or less and

700
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,319
the financial side of it isn't what it

701
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:20,960
used to be and you know but you can make

702
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:23,319
a good living whether you're a tomato

703
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,200
farmer or you're a cannabis farmer and

704
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:27,519
now we can do it legally so yeah it's

705
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,480
been so crazy to see over the last 20

706
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:31,798
years how Everything's changed in you

707
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:34,240
know in cannabis it everything uh

708
00:24:31,798 --> 00:24:35,599
rapidly changes all the time rapidly

709
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,038
really quick you know this is the new

710
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:39,759

712
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:45,519
just like and seeing uh like the wax uh

713
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:48,960
you know evolve from us you know you

714
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:51,200
know blowing butane through a PVC PVC

715
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,120
pipe you know what I mean like in 2006

716
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,480
or seven and to where we got the rosin

717
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:59,319
now it's like it's totally crazy to to

718
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,679
see it all come through yeah and it was

719
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:03,879
just all the different techniques along

720
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,720
the way right you know I was there in

721
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,720
the beginning where we we had to go

722
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,759
through all the techniques and it was

723
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,440
really quick oh what are you doing now

724
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:11,319
to how oh how did you make the pull and

725
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,759
snap or how did you yeah we didn't have

726
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:16,000
dab eggs back in the day we smoked them

727
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:18,440
on coals or whatever you put it inot hot

728
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,440
knif hot knife legendary hot knives man

729
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,679
I love the hot knives that's yeah that's

730
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,480
a that's a day

731
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,600
wrecker the first time you got to be

732
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,360
careful of those yeah so for those of

733
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:29,839
you that don't know hot knifing is where

734
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:32,678
you hot knives from your parents drawer

735
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:34,639
from the silverware drawer and you put

736
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:36,919
them on the stove till they're red hot

737
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,960
and I wouldn't do with rosin but you use

738
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:42,120
old school hash yeah hash and uh a paper

739
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,278
towel tube or whatever kind of tube you

740
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:45,158
can I think people have done it with

741
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:46,200
straws but the paper towel tube is ideal

742
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:48,640
because you can kind of put the knife

743
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:51,720
tips as you smash and put it in there

744
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,880
and then just get this big huge hot

745
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:56,600
gigantic

746
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:58,799
dab yeah and cough typically super hot

747
00:25:56,599 --> 00:26:00,000
you're just like oh God yeah I think we

748
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:02,480
got to the point where we weren't

749
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,038
getting to coughs like we didn't cough

750
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,759
you know we got to but but then our

751
00:26:04,038 --> 00:26:09,000
friends did you know I've told the story

752
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:11,679
about my buddy who he just got so wasted

753
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,240
and then went out and sat in his car

754
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,120

755
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:17,519
first dab I used to do it all I was

they hit it you can just see them you

768
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,278

769
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:39,679
could see them get high you know their

770
00:26:38,278 --> 00:26:43,038
eyes start watering instantly their ears

771
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:44,720
are purple yeah like oh I gotta go and

772
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:47,359
they just they just out here didn't buy

773
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:50,600
any wheed or nothing they just cut out

774
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:52,359
yeah with the old dabs we use titanium

775
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:54,439
too it's like those things you get that

776
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:56,918
titanium nail real hot it started out

777
00:26:54,440 --> 00:27:00,038
with the little glass the stupid the

778
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:01,559
swing arm and the glass nail and then we

779
00:27:00,038 --> 00:27:05,158
we thought we really upgraded when we

780
00:27:01,558 --> 00:27:06,599
got the titanium nail right totally we l

781
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:08,559
like a chest piece originally the quartz

782
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:10,519
Little Nail we quartz nail right so we

783
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:12,079
had the quartz nail and then that was

784
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:14,119
like the first rigs that the quartz nail

785
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:15,480
would go in and you had the little thing

786
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:17,839
over the top of it or whatever it's so

787
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:20,200
crazy to think we were smoking that the

788
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:23,240
oh yeah yeah I was I was making a lot of

789
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:25,798
a lot of BHO with

790
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:28,120
PVC we finally got the glass but yeah

791
00:27:25,798 --> 00:27:29,519
open blasting and did you whip Ed like

792
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:30,839
Pyrex dishes well that was the thing we

793
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:33,119
had to figure it all out at first we

794
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:35,359
didn't wild we first we didn't yeah it

795
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:37,359
was Pyrex glass we' double boil it and

796
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:39,639
we like okay if you do this it turns it

797
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:42,479
yellow you know like we don't know you

798
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:43,640
know we finally finally figured out you

799
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,159
know we were always not letting it

800
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,720
finish it would always be goopy so I

801
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,760
would just leave it in that hot plate

802
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,880
keep longer and longer and longer and

803
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:53,839
then it finally would would turn in turn

804
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,640
a wax wax that's how you got the ear wax

805
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,759
butter wax like ear it looked like ear

806
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,240
wax that's why everybody called it ear

807
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:00,679
wax but yeah once I figured that out it

808
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,679
was over yeah and uh getting slabs as

809
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:04,640
long as your arm big old chunks yeah and

810
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:05,880
then after that came like the you know

811
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,919
like shatter and stuff they're putting

812
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,880
it in the The Purge The Purge ovens and

813
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,880
you got the

814
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,640
ovx slabs in the pizza boxes you know

815
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,200
all about that I all about yeah we got

816
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:17,000
the pizza boxes you have a long history

817
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,120
with pizza boxes I bet yeah yeah

818
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,960
definitely lots of slabs been in the

819
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:23,719
pizza boxes but yeah that's not how we

820
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:27,558
we came up with that idea yeah our brand

821
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:30,038
is uh is pizza Italian involved you know

822

824
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:38,360

871
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:09,000
cool it was like a conversation starter

872
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:11,640
and then they tried the stuff you I'd

873
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,079
have them because my main goal back then

874
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:17,480
when I first started coming out was uh

875
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:20,918
and always is to have uh you know a

876
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:23,599
really loud fire strin that people was

877
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:26,880
was really distinctive to smell so I

878
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:29,158
would have it the SES right the bud mhm

879
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,960
and the the wax that I made I made it

880
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:32,039
you know grew it myself made the wax

881
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,240
myself and then I'd have the seeds

882
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:35,000
available so I'd be like all right take

883
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,798
the take a dab free dab you everybody's

884
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,159
taking a dab they like oh it's so good

885
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:41,240
all right look take a smoke some of the

886
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:42,799
weed oh man it's buy the Seed I don't

887
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,558
grow well hey we could teach you how to

888
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:46,679
grow you know and I got a lot of people

889
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:48,359
growing like that and uh it's just

890
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:50,720
satisfying to see people grow your stuff

891
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:52,479
out and really come back and be like man

892
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,440
that was really good and i' you know I

893
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,759
started growing and and they have a big

894
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:59,600
old huge room now you know that's really

895
00:30:56,759 --> 00:31:01,519
how the the pizza box came and then I

896
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:04,079
came up with this this guy and I dress

897
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:06,558
up as him and nice and that's really the

898
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:08,558
whole story there that's pretty awesome

899
00:31:06,558 --> 00:31:10,480
yeah I like I like the diecut packaging

900
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:13,839
I feel like it's simple it's cost

901
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:16,440
effective and uh yeah I mean it's it's

902
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:17,918
great diecut is in for one thing but

903
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,798
like these are you can put a thousand of

904
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:22,038
these in one little box right I have

905
00:31:19,798 --> 00:31:23,879
some other packaging too like boxes and

906
00:31:22,038 --> 00:31:26,599
I have some standup packs where it's

907
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:28,880
like a it's really like a dab container

908
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:30,398
yeah but it has seeds in it and it just

909
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,039
doesn't work for like the seed banks and

910
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:33,599
people like oh you know I could only fit

911
00:31:32,038 --> 00:31:35,319
like two of them in a little package

912
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:36,879
right so it's like to get a big order

913
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:38,278
for them to hold it at the the seed

914
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,200
banks or whatever it just takes up too

915
00:31:38,278 --> 00:31:42,200
much room and these are perfect I I

916
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,798
really like these a lot of time I put in

917
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:47,000
a really good guy that uh designed those

918
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:49,359
for me it's the even the seed that I'm

919
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,679
holding is like a reflective yeah yeah

920
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:53,678
it's you know I like I like that uh I

921
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:55,240
like you know details on everything you

922
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,559
know I want to have details I want to

923
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,519
have the best stuff you know that's why

924
00:31:56,558 --> 00:31:59,759
we always started to have that's why I

925
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:02,120
started growing and want to make my own

926
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:04,398
stuff because I had so much access

927
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:06,839
access you know living in Fresno back

928
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:09,479
then to really good bud I'm interested

929
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:11,199
about uh snow beef because I'm not a

930
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:14,038
huge fan of apple fritters because it

931
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,798
smells amazing but I feel like the smell

932
00:32:14,038 --> 00:32:18,480
doesn't carry over in the the the smoke

933
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:20,480
right if you're smoking a joint of it

934
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,360
but like I always say apple fritters

935
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,880
Oreos purple punch they're one step away

936
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:27,879
from being good I mean I just feel I'm

937
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,760
not fan of purple punch at all no I

938
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:32,760
purple punch yeah uh what's the other

939
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:35,119
one uh Oreos Oreos one I'm thinking of

940
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:37,638
Oreos uh purple punch yeah it's just

941
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:39,158
like oh my goodness it's a picture weed

942
00:32:37,638 --> 00:32:41,918
you know it's great on Instagram it

943
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:43,639
looks amazing they make some decent they

944
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:46,480
make some really good crosses I think

945
00:32:43,638 --> 00:32:48,319
they yeah I mean that Dante's Inferno I

946
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,599
think it's kind of the same might out a

947
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:51,720
little bit or whatever but like I think

948
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:53,638
it's as far as the genetics are concern

949
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,278
man it's got a really unique nose on it

950
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:57,319
and I could smell the Oreos in there a

951
00:32:55,278 --> 00:32:58,638
little bit but it's got It's it's got

952
00:32:57,319 --> 00:33:00,359
something it's got something and it's

953
00:32:58,638 --> 00:33:02,759
not Oreos I like it much better than

954
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:05,359
Oreos yeah I grew that in my greenhouse

955
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:07,079
and I I wasn't really a fan of the Dante

956
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:09,278
cuz it it was just the weakest genetics

957
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:12,158
in there it was the first one yeah to go

958
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:13,839
you know and right and uh I just I'm

959
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:16,720
about strong genetics I want to bring

960
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:18,879
back the the rigidity of of the plant

961
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,558
you know like right like um the Green

962
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,399
Crack you know it it's like a pretty PM

963
00:33:21,558 --> 00:33:25,119
resistant you know and I really worked a

964
00:33:23,398 --> 00:33:27,239
lot of strains for the East Coast

965
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:29,239
outdoor Growers and I really focused on

966
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,000
that for the last couple years right and

967
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,079
I feel like nobody's doing that anymore

968
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,720
nobody's really going on the effects

969
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:38,278
nobody you know sure the TPS they're

970
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:40,079
just going off of pictures and and names

971
00:33:38,278 --> 00:33:42,919
and it's just uh it's not the way to do

972
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:45,798
it you know no and I mean everything you

973
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:48,720
know we have these es and flows in in

974
00:33:45,798 --> 00:33:50,720
every facet of life and we're we're in

975
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,120
the gelato phase right now and the cany

976
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,480
phase where people are really locked in

977
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:57,959
but I also see OG making a comeback and

978
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:59,519
I also see hazes popping up here and

979
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,840
there I seen the piff and the Cuban

980
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:04,200
black and you know some some old school

981
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:06,398
Haze I feel like they're making some

982
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:09,358
comebacks and I feel like definitely the

983
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:10,519
haze on the East Coast the piff all that

984

those yeah important yeah and it's

991
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:26,440
subtle but it's it's one of those subtle

992
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:28,440
TPS it's got subtle tping profile smokes

993
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,800
good down the roads and it has it still

994
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,480
kind of has a ceiling compared to some

995
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,599
hazes you smoke some of the hazes

996

is not cookies bro yeah like the real

1018
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,559
original when it first started coming

1019
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:21,639
around was just the cut fishing the cut

1020
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:23,320
fishing has been so rampit over the last

1021
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:25,920
10 years especially with so many

1022
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:27,720
different things uh especially nurseries

1023
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,159
wanting to sell stuff

1024
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:31,358
and you know not all of them you know

1025
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:32,920
there there's good nurseries and bad

1026
00:35:31,358 --> 00:35:36,039
nurseries but there's been a lot of cut

1027
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:38,320
fishing and other problems like uh seed

1028
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:40,000
junkie selling wedding cake seeds and

1029
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,160
then we got 30 different fenos because

1030
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,400
there's a lot of different I mean

1031
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:46,239
there's literally 30 different

1032
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:48,000
expressions of of wedding cake right and

1033
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:50,759
there's there's a good one there's maybe

1034
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,480
a few good ones there's lots of yeah you

1035
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,200
could right there's that one cut

1036
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,199
everybody well a lot of people put out

1037
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:58,519
the separate cuts and they hoard the the

1038
00:35:56,199 --> 00:36:02,519
best cut for El it's been a practice in

1039
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:04,960
C forever you know since 196 whatever

1040
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:06,280
yeah it's like you know it's yeah that's

1041
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,480
what's been going on and to get those

1042
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:10,839
real cuts and and uh to actually breed

1043
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:15,039
with those real Cuts is is important and

1044
00:36:10,838 --> 00:36:16,799
that's something I strive to do yeah so

1045
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:18,159
as far as like the genetics you you

1046
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,839
talked about Green Crack but what else

1047
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:22,399
were you working with back in the day

1048
00:36:19,838 --> 00:36:23,719
you you guys had some hazes I'm sure

1049
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,680
yeah when I was just messing around

1050
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:27,838
making seeds I was just making them for

1051
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:30,159
myself you know I had a super silver

1052
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:32,159
haze I had the uh original like purple

1053
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:34,559
Urkel the one that would turn solid

1054
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:37,199
purple like smaller plant real smaller

1055
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:39,920
plant yeah the the super silver haze had

1056
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:42,480
that one big Cola you know I mean but I

1057
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,039
was just trying to learn you know really

1058
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,079
how to make seeds I didn't really put

1059
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:46,559
any of those out that was just for

1060
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:48,599
myself like the super silver like it

1061
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:50,920
burns your nose kind of like where you

1062
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:53,559
actually have like literally the THS

1063
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:55,240
burn your nose yeah it was really good I

1064
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:56,440
always thought oh this plant this is so

1065
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:58,639
funny cuz I got it right when I first

1066
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:00,920
started started growing yeah and uh and

1067
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:03,000
I learned a lot since then but I would

1068
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:06,318
think uh I always thought the plant

1069
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,719
sucked because it had the main Cola and

1070
00:37:06,318 --> 00:37:08,880
like I didn't have a proper environment

1071
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:10,759
room so it would mold the main Cola

1072
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,160
would mold every time i' like cut it off

1073
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:14,040
and the I mean it was good smoke around

1074
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:16,000
the thing man this plant molds it sucks

1075
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:18,079
no this was actually my fault you know

1076
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,199
better grower it was a great plant you

1077
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:22,039
know so it it was this funny stuff

1078
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:23,358
learning stuff like that along the way

1079
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:26,199
just trial and error you know I've done

1080
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:27,119
a lot of trial and error and um I think

1081
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:28,598
that's the best

1082
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:31,160
that's the best way to learn I feel like

1083
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:32,640
a lot of people get almost bombarded

1084
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:35,679
with the amount of information that's

1085
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:37,799
out there nowadays totally you know and

1086
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:39,358
so crazy you know the last 20 years how

1087
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,800
much has changed going going from no

1088
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:44,279
information like when we started doing

1089
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:46,839
the BHO yeah making rosin and stuff or

1090
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:49,240
not rosin but wax you know there was you

1091
00:37:46,838 --> 00:37:50,838
couldn't look up a YouTube video it

1092
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:52,279
would there was nowhere to find any

1093
00:37:50,838 --> 00:37:54,159
information I think the first time it

1094
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:56,079
came out was like in High Times Like '

1095
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:58,480
05 and then that's when people started

1096
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:00,519
trying to blow themselves up and yeah

1097
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:03,000
you yeah I think K from triome

1098
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:05,639
Technologies wrote a paper about butane

1099
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:09,480
extraction in 1998 I believe he was the

1100
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:10,920
first and it kind of slowly caught on um

1101
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:13,400
after that but yeah it was like early

1102
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,880
2000s people were doing it on the under

1103
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,599
yeah you know it was like and then it

1104
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:20,559
was like Wax butter wax that was pretty

1105
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:22,599
much it uh or bubble has there lots of

1106
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:24,519
bubble hash back then yeah definitely

1107
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:26,079
the bubble hash all that all that stuff

1108
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:27,800
and there's people I still see people

1109
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:30,318
making some really good bubble has

1110
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,640
nowadays too I love I love bubble hash

1111
00:38:30,318 --> 00:38:33,079
you know I love I love the taste of

1112
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:34,759
bubble has I like putting in my joints I

1113
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:37,400
like you know I mean the same thing with

1114
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:39,319
sift I got some amazing sift here too oh

1115
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:42,240
yeah and uh yeah I love good dry sift

1116
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:44,880
it's it's hard to find right that's I

1117
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:47,598
always use the the trim bins yeah you

1118
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,800
know you know get when I was doing seeds

1119
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:51,200
we always I mean I had a 50 lighter we

1120
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,680
were doing seeds and we I always use the

1121
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:56,199
trim bins for the stuff and I would end

1122
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:58,000
up with big huge I use the ice cream or

1123
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:59,759
the aotto containers the clear ones with

1124
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,880
the black tops yeah and we put them in

1125
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,880
there and and then i' you know I'd cure

1126
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:06,039
them out and then put them in there and

1127
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:08,720
put them in the freezer oh nice pull out

1128
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:11,119
these awesome blocks of uh sift oh

1129
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:12,799
that's awesome that's funny it's block

1130
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:15,400
of sift even the Autoflower like the

1131
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,880
Autoflower sift was phenomenal so but

1132
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,720
you're getting a mix of plants it's not

1133
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,160
like one phenotype so right yeah you're

1134
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:21,959
getting you're getting everything with

1135
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:24,598
the autoflowers you can't really can't

1136
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:26,559
take clones of them and no but the more

1137
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:30,039
Generations you have the more stable

1138
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:32,920
they get right the the more even the

1139
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:34,480
profile is the less muddled it becomes

1140
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:37,200
yeah you got to actually really breed

1141
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,159
them yeah I tell people I was like you

1142
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:40,559
gota just don't buy Autos off anybody

1143
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:42,639
you know that they're just starting to

1144
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:44,358
don't understand well if you take a lot

1145
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:46,920
of good Autos out there there are good

1146
00:39:44,358 --> 00:39:48,318
Autos 100% I make amazing Autos I think

1147
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:52,240
there's a lot of people that make them

1148
00:39:48,318 --> 00:39:54,559
not a lot I think uh em seeds is he

1149
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:56,759
makes some really really nice stuff yeah

1150
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:58,440
yeah but typically if you take even if

1151
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,440
you take two autos and you breed those

1152
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,400
together that doesn't mean you're going

1153
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,039
to get good stuff A lot of times it's

1154
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,800
just the opposite right you have to do

1155
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:06,639
some refinement you have to do you know

1156
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,519
a couple generations of work at the very

1157
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:10,799
least yeah no definitely there's a lot

1158
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:12,639
of work that goes into the into breeding

1159
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,920
Autos I see that there's come a long

1160
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:16,440
ways too from when they first yep from

1161
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:18,838
it first came out now like a lot of

1162
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:22,159
people that really put the work into I

1163
00:40:18,838 --> 00:40:24,799
hate it I hate lot of people are just

1164
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:26,679
like no they they suck I hated I hated

1165
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,119
autos and Mesto changed all that B man

1166
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:30,598
big up some Mesto they really they paved

1167
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:33,880
the way for the rest of us that are

1168
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:37,720
making good autoflowers if it wasn't for

1169
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:39,680
Mesto uh Tim and Mitch killing it you

1170
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:40,959
know yeah D those guys are amazing we

1171
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:42,960
wouldn't be here today without them in

1172
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,280
the Autoflower world right so a lot of

1173
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,800
people don't give them the proper credit

1174
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:50,200
they deserve but like the autoflowers in

1175
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:54,400
Europe back in the early 2000s 2010 even

1176
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:56,919
2012 they were mediocre at best and

1177
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,318
they've they've changed so much the

1178
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,079
whole European scene has changed with

1179
00:40:58,318 --> 00:41:02,000
utof flowers right but like good

1180
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,920
smokable products I mean it's still an

1181
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,880
easy plant to grow otof flowers are easy

1182
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,519
if you want something if you want to

1183
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,920
grow something outside and you have no

1184
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:09,559
experience or you want to grow something

1185
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,480
like you'd even put one in your window

1186
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:14,000
sill sort of right window something like

1187
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,480
that I see people there's a

1188
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,400
misconception I feel like that it's

1189
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:20,639
easier to grow than a regular photo

1190
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,440
period in a tent I just like that's just

1191
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:24,279
I don't feel like that's the truth yeah

1192
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:27,519
you know what I mean I feel like Photo

1193
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:29,880
period is is almost easier you know to

1194
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:31,079
to grow you know more what's going on

1195
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:33,960
than an Autoflower I don't know I could

1196
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:35,839
be wrong I've I've never grown really

1197
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,599
I've grown like maybe one Autoflower One

1198
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:39,358
Time by accident but I just don't see

1199
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,880
like everybody says that there's all

1200
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:42,719
these it grows faster and it does this

1201
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,318
and that I just don't well it definitely

1202
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:47,318
is more vigorous right so like the thing

1203
00:41:45,318 --> 00:41:48,279
is is like if you even look at the the

1204
00:41:47,318 --> 00:41:50,960
seed

1205
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:53,240
start a week later when you basically

1206
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,720
germinate it like if you don't

1207
00:41:53,239 --> 00:41:56,318
transplant it right away you're going to

1208
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:58,159
get that it's going to get rootbound

1209
00:41:56,318 --> 00:42:00,800
right away oh

1210
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:02,559
really so but it has a smaller basically

1211
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,160
the root ball is so much it's typically

1212
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:07,519
a lot smaller than a photo period plant

1213
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:09,039
and you're getting a tap rout with it as

1214
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:11,239
opposed to typically if you're clone

1215
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:13,480
growing course yeah the tap there's

1216
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:15,919
definitely some differences but I feel

1217
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:18,480
like it I I think Autos are really easy

1218
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,519
to grow you know if you it's fairly you

1219
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,358
know you follow steps they come out

1220
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:24,599
really good for somebody who's a no

1221
00:42:22,358 --> 00:42:26,838
novice but photo periods are also great

1222
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:28,800
for novices too it just depends on what

1223
00:42:26,838 --> 00:42:30,358
you want to do I prefer 20 hours of

1224
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,079
light with my flowers indoors I feel

1225
00:42:30,358 --> 00:42:35,639
like I get the best results giving them

1226
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:38,480
20 with four hours of sleep nice 20 yeah

1227
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:39,960
20 light 4 Hour Darkness I get the best

1228
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,079
results and then same thing with seeds I

1229
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:44,039
get way more seeds when I do it that way

1230
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:48,039
really when I'm breeding yeah like sign

1231
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:50,440
significantly more oh wow so 20 20 hours

1232
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:52,880
on yeah 20 hours on gotta love that

1233
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:55,200
electrical bill like yeah I was thinking

1234
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:58,119
like 20 hours on man yeah that's pretty

1235
00:42:55,199 --> 00:43:00,318
that's a long time doubling your bill

1236
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:03,000
there doubling up on the bill you know

1237
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:05,679
yeah but back to this no beef uh you

1238
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,400
know uh it has a really unique smell uh

1239
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:11,719
gasman is the one that actually bred it

1240
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:14,318
and he he gave me the his cut and and

1241
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:16,719
the Mel yeah and I've I've uh made the

1242
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:18,639
f2s and we're working together you know

1243
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:21,598
to make a lot of a lot of strains and

1244
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:26,358
it's a zcube and a meat breath a cookie

1245
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:28,640
do dominant uh male yeah with Z cube is

1246
00:43:26,358 --> 00:43:32,838
cross and uh it you know it dumps really

1247
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:34,519
good 5% four to 5% Y and uh you know it

1248
00:43:32,838 --> 00:43:37,440
comes out really well I brought some we

1249
00:43:34,519 --> 00:43:41,119
could try it out and I also brought um

1250
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:44,480
the second place dab right yeah yeah um

1251
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:46,920
and the Seventh Place Eco Clash yeah

1252
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,159
that Z Cube's all right it's all right I

1253
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:50,559
I honestly I never really liked the

1254
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:53,078
zcube it was smaller and I didn't really

1255
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:54,480
like the anything that has Skittles TPS

1256
00:43:53,079 --> 00:43:56,440
it's the most interesting thing when you

1257
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,800
breed Skittles with something you want

1258
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:00,200
you you don't even need to uh smell them

1259
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,880
you look for the shittiest plants in the

1260
00:44:00,199 --> 00:44:05,399
room that's a skittles cross that lean

1261
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,960
Skittles you know it's like you know I

1262
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,440
mean he did a really good job because

1263
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,000
the plant is nothing like that it

1264
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:12,960
doesn't grow I mean it's very vigorous

1265
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,358
the way it grows you got nice big buds

1266
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,039
it's super Frosty I mean I show you a

1267
00:44:14,358 --> 00:44:18,719
picture of it it's just crazy yeah yeah

1268
00:44:16,039 --> 00:44:20,639
and it does it it smokes good and it and

1269
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:22,558
it presses out you know we right I made

1270
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:24,558
about 30 crosses with it now we're

1271
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:27,760
hunting through those and getting those

1272
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:31,400
out to to the testers yeah so is it

1273
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:34,240
candy still or where do the I would say

1274
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:35,800
it's like a little bit of candy yeah you

1275
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:38,159
know in the flavor you could taste it in

1276
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:41,039
the back back end but it's more like uh

1277
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:44,639
really gassy it's real gassy and it has

1278
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:46,400
a really distinct uh its own kind of

1279
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:48,000
it's own kind of flavor you know what I

1280
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,519
mean I don't want to say it's like a

1281
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,079
white truffle flavor because it's not

1282
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:54,880
it's it's but it's has that gasing I

1283
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:57,119
don't really like white truffle yeah you

1284
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:01,559
know the the the TPS on it you know for

1285
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:03,640
sure but um I have the Ruffles with it

1286
00:45:01,559 --> 00:45:05,200
white Shuffle mixed with Skittles again

1287
00:45:03,639 --> 00:45:07,719
of course and that's really good you

1288
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:10,919
know it came out amazing and that's uh

1289
00:45:07,719 --> 00:45:13,239
can of research uh and fresh Coast

1290
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:14,480
collaboration so z Snow beef do you know

1291
00:45:13,239 --> 00:45:16,598
where you got the name because when I

1292
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,159
think of snow beef I think of wagu from

1293
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:22,039
Japan and that's my favorite that's well

1294
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:24,838
the strain was originally named wagu

1295
00:45:22,039 --> 00:45:27,358
zagu with the Z zwag you know every puts

1296
00:45:24,838 --> 00:45:30,920
the Z on it it was this is wagu and and

1297
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:34,000
but this particular feno that we have he

1298
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:37,358
he named is no beef yeah and it has it

1299
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:40,119
just has this special turp to it yeah I

1300
00:45:37,358 --> 00:45:42,039
believe snow beef comes from Hokkaido

1301
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:44,800
it's a cold region and that is some of

1302
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:46,358
the best wagu in the world right that's

1303
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,720
what he's going for we're going for we

1304
00:45:46,358 --> 00:45:50,078
want to make the best stuff we're coming

1306
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:53,440
best wagon it's the best you know that's

1307
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,880
what we want to have the best TPS we

got the the man torch yeah this is the I

1507
00:53:23,358 --> 00:53:28,719
feel like the best way to take a dab

1508
00:53:25,798 --> 00:53:30,440
is the dab right with the TP slurper is

1509
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:32,558
y is by far my

1510

00:53:40,199 --> 00:53:46,199
this is the best way and uh I you know I

1514

take them colder too but I don't like to

1517

with you the devs with nice yeah totally

1553
00:55:27,039 --> 00:55:31,280
and yeah I started smoking weed after

1554
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:33,000
that and being in California like

1555
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:36,000
yourself there's access to really good

1556
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:41,079
weed yeah it's I got really lucky early

1557
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:42,719
on um able to to find a a guy that was

1558
00:55:41,079 --> 00:55:45,359
really

1559
00:55:42,719 --> 00:55:49,118
um had the best stuff you know and I got

1560
00:55:45,358 --> 00:55:50,719
I got a good name of of uh you know

1561
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:52,240
having the best best weed around because

1562
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:53,679
of them you know and it was like you

1563

show up oh you got the best stuff but

1564
00:55:53,679 --> 00:55:59,000
then it's like somebody else grew this

1565
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:01,480
and it really really got me thinking uh

1566
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,679
you know who's growing this where is it

1567
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:06,240
coming from you know it's a big secret

1568
00:56:03,679 --> 00:56:07,598
back then you know where the seeds come

1569
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:09,279
I remember getting a bag of weed and

1570
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:11,318
just praying that there's a seed bag

1571
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:13,280
seed in it you know like there we had no

1572
00:56:11,318 --> 00:56:14,838
access like we do now and it's do se's

1573
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,599
back in the day were always great yeah

1574
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:18,440
they were always great and it's you know

1575
00:56:16,599 --> 00:56:19,720
you get a really fire sack of weed you

1576
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:21,119
know you're never going to see the weed

1577
00:56:19,719 --> 00:56:23,639
again you know so much good weed came

1578
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:25,798
and gone like so fast like the phases of

1579
00:56:23,639 --> 00:56:28,480
purple so many good purples and then all

1580
00:56:25,798 --> 00:56:30,838
the kushes like all the phases of kushes

1581
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:33,079
I the master cush was amazing dude like

1582
00:56:30,838 --> 00:56:35,440
the real old school Master Hindu Kush

1583
00:56:33,079 --> 00:56:37,280
that was called uh can't remember the

1584
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:41,000
nickname for it but it was an HK and it

1585
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:43,039
was super super super fire not like the

1586
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:46,000
typical stuff that you're seeing today I

1587
00:56:43,039 --> 00:56:47,559
feel like it was super special yeah

1588
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,798

00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:56,000
is is you don't have to do everything

1618
00:57:53,559 --> 00:57:57,839
and as you grow and

1619
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,079
have a company you really become a

1620
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:00,519
specialist in what you're good at and

1621
00:57:59,079 --> 00:58:02,039
you can hire people that are good at

1622
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:03,920

that especially I can tell you this

1652
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:21,119
one's strong just by the smell it's got

1653
00:59:19,159 --> 00:59:23,399
some power to it yeah it's definitely

1654
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:26,318
stronger I wish I could remember who who

1655
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:28,760
bred it and the cross that were on it

1656
00:59:26,318 --> 00:59:30,239
but um I'm sure I I could find out for

1657
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:33,920

1658

pretty yeah turpy it's got a good good

1659

tur profile it definitely has the best

1660
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,720
um it's almost like you know you want it

1661
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:42,240
to transfer over that one almost

1662
00:59:39,719 --> 00:59:44,959

1666
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:52,000

1667
00:59:50,519 --> 00:59:53,480

you're

1684
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:40,119
right that is the best flavor I've had

1685
01:00:36,159 --> 01:00:43,078
in a dab in a long time like

1686
01:00:40,119 --> 01:00:45,720
literally it's it smells good it smells

1687
01:00:43,079 --> 01:00:45,720
unique but it

1688
01:00:49,239 --> 01:00:53,558
tastes tastes super good it it tastes

1689
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:55,760
better than it smells I feel like you

1690
01:00:53,559 --> 01:00:57,839
know stronger

1691
01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:01,039
well very good it smells very good too

1692
01:00:57,838 --> 01:01:03,358
but yeah and it's got this nice floral

1693
01:01:01,039 --> 01:01:04,920
character along with it it's not Rose

1694
01:01:03,358 --> 01:01:08,159
it's not your

1695
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:09,599
typical floral profile right but it's

1696
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:10,838
got like a little bit of sweetness and a

1697
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:14,559
little bit of

1698
01:01:10,838 --> 01:01:16,199
floral and uh yeah almost there's a

1699
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:18,798
little soapiness to it too like in a

1700
01:01:16,199 --> 01:01:22,439
good way not like right the reminds me

1701
01:01:18,798 --> 01:01:22,440
of like childhood right

1702
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:26,440
right

1703
01:01:27,639 --> 01:01:32,480
what's your opinion on the sprayed

1704
01:01:29,838 --> 01:01:33,920
turps uh I don't know I feel like that's

1705
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:36,039
like a East Coast thing I don't know

1706
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:38,440
it's a weird thing that's like we don't

1707
01:01:36,039 --> 01:01:42,160
have to worry about like that same thing

1708
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:43,720
with the uh the TCA the

1709
01:01:42,159 --> 01:01:45,480
Snowballs I don't know if you've seen

1710
01:01:43,719 --> 01:01:47,879
the snow cap or the Snowballs where they

1711
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:51,760
they uh shake the bag and put it in oh

1712
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:54,440
yeah putting uh they they're putting the

1713
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:56,960
the weed in a bubble bag with dry ice

1714
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:58,318
totally and shaking it yeah I don't know

1715
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:00,318
what that that was like a thing there

1716
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:02,400
for a little bit I guess no no it's back

1717
01:02:00,318 --> 01:02:04,880
it's back in full force it's back in a

1718
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:06,720
bad way I don't understand why you can't

1719
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:09,838
it's it's not that hard just to make

1720
01:02:06,719 --> 01:02:11,480
this I mean it it's not easy yeah but

1721
01:02:09,838 --> 01:02:12,880
the basics of it you know these guys

1722
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:14,719
have refined it you know serpent

1723
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:16,559
temperature certain everything you know

1724
01:02:14,719 --> 01:02:18,959
it's it's real special to be getting it

1725
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:20,720
this good right but the basics of it is

1726
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:22,278
better than sticking dry ice in a bag

1727
01:02:20,719 --> 01:02:24,959
and you know I don't know I don't I

1728
01:02:22,278 --> 01:02:28,159
don't agree with a lot of weird stuff on

1729
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:30,679
the The Mean Streets of Instagram oh

1730
01:02:28,159 --> 01:02:32,558
yeah yeah it's it's kind of strange I

1731
01:02:30,679 --> 01:02:35,440
think a lot of people want to create a

1732
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:37,119
product that's different right and

1733
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:39,519
they're willing to sacrifice quality for

1734
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:40,680
one thing or they have inferior quality

1735
01:02:39,519 --> 01:02:43,199
and so they want to make their product

1736
01:02:40,679 --> 01:02:45,440
better in their opinion right more

1737
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:47,358
marketable right it's like just just

1738
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:50,039
make better products you know just make

1739
01:02:47,358 --> 01:02:51,838
better products just do better just do

1740
01:02:50,039 --> 01:02:53,359
better just do better that goes for

1741
01:02:51,838 --> 01:02:54,880
everybody including myself like let's

1742
01:02:53,358 --> 01:02:56,920
just do better yeah

1743
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:58,200
exactly that's what we're striving out

1744
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:59,920
here to do yeah that's the right

1745
01:02:58,199 --> 01:03:01,838
mentality I think and to teach you know

1746
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:03,920
that's why I really want to you know

1747
01:03:01,838 --> 01:03:06,278
teach uh the new people that are growing

1748
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:08,240
you know the right way about it and yeah

1749
