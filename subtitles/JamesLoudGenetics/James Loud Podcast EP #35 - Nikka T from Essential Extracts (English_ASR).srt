how's it going everybody welcome to

3
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:12,320
another episode of the James Lab podcast

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,280
and today my special guest is my good

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,759
friend Nick T how you doing today I'm

6
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:18,799
feeling blessed bro thank you so much

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,679
for having me yeah so we go way back uh

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,640
but let's let's talk about long hair man

9
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:24,920
I guess when we first met we both had

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,080
long hair you had dreadlocks I had long

11
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,560
long hair have longer hair yeah yeah

12
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:32,039
yeah I had dreadlocks down in my ankles

13
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:34,280
bro yeah 13 years yeah so you coined the

14
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:36,439
term solventless which I disagreed with

15
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,399
back in the day I was like solventless

16
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:39,238
love you were one of the guys

17
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:42,320
disagreeing yeah I was like that's the

18
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:44,359
universal solvent you know it's like but

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,238
you know I feel like the the interesting

20
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:49,238
thing with language is over time when

21
00:00:47,238 --> 00:00:50,799
you have something that makes sense if

22
00:00:49,238 --> 00:00:52,679
enough people use it you can change

23
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,000
language it doesn't have to be a

24
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:56,159
specific way especially if there's

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,679
purpose right and that that's pretty

26
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,279
much what you did which is really

27
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,238
impressive you know from that from

28
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,160
looking back now I'm like well he had a

29
00:01:01,238 --> 00:01:04,878
point it made sense it's pretty crazy

30
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:06,759
there were definitely a lot of naysayers

31
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,640
a lot of uh scientists that came at me

32
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:12,280
Waters the universal solvent um just you

33
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,239
know in general there was a lot of hate

34
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,879
with coining a new term and creating a

35
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:19,438
product that people really hadn't seen

36
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:21,798
before um but it's pretty cool to see

37
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:24,118
where it's come today well the evolution

38
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:27,280
you know you're you're a pioneer as far

39
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:28,840
as extract and you took it from you know

40
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,599
there there was just regular bubble has

41
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,000
that was amazing back in the 90s I

42
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:37,239
remember seeing really good bubble hash

43
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,840
but then I met you maybe around 2010

44
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:43,759
2011 something like that and you took it

45
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,280
up a notch to where it was it was a

46
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,159
whole different thing it it wasn't

47
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:51,759
bubble has it it was bubble has but it

48
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:54,399
was like another level of bubble has

49
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,840
that in it of itself created the issue

50
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,079
and that's the point of or the reason I

51
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,280
coin the term solventless because I

52
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:03,239
started bringing product to the shelves

53
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,879
that I was working with and saying hey

54
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:06,599
here's my bubble has and they were like

55
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:08,639
no bubble has is what we already have on

56
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:10,439
the Shelf yours doesn't look like that

57
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,238
yours doesn't smell like that right

58
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:14,280
people aren't consuming it the same you

59
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,759
can't call it bubble has really you know

60
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,479
yeah um and uh we were doing things a

61
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:20,439
little bit differently than what Mark or

62
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,560
bubble man was promoting how he was

63
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:24,959
processing so we wanted to kind of

64
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,000
create initially a term that separated

65
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,479
us from the rest of course it caught on

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,598
and a lot of people started using that

67
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:35,759
term real quickly after wanting to hoard

68
00:02:32,598 --> 00:02:38,039
that term for just separation I realized

69
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:39,878
that I needed to teach people what we

70
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:41,120
were doing in order to really sell the

71
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:43,039
product that I was selling because

72
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,599
people didn't understand it right and in

73
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:49,560
doing so everyone wanted to jump on that

74
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:51,919
solving this train right so um yeah it's

75
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,239
a trip yeah and I mean you completely

76
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:56,639
changed the the landscape for Rosen and

77
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:57,719
all these other things I mean you paved

78
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:59,839
the way for

79
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:01,598
rosin uh it's really impressive so so

80
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,120
let's take a step back and and talk

81
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,598
about because we're both from California

82
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,719
I'm originally from Oregon but I grew up

83
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:10,119
in the Bay Area and you grew up in

84
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:11,400
Northern California originally so let's

85
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,920
talk about cannabis in Northern

86
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:17,000
California and how you got your roots

87
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:20,199
yeah you know being you know raised in

88
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,439
Northern California meant that cannabis

89
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:25,560
was very prevalent in my upbringing and

90
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:27,439
very accepted um I guess I'm I'm blessed

91
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,799
I'm in a blessed situation where my

92
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:32,479
family was very accepting of cannabis I

93
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:34,599
had people in my family that used to be

94
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:36,280
drivers um I had people in my family

95
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:40,158
used to be Farmers that are still

96
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:42,438
Farmers actually um and so I grew up in

97
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:45,438
a place that cannabis was extremely

98
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:47,799
accepted and when I started selling weed

99
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:50,919
it wasn't something that my family was

100
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:53,239
stoked about by any means but it wasn't

101
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:55,399
something that they were going to get

102
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:57,878
mad at me for is what it felt like I

103
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,438
felt like what I was doing was fairly

104
00:03:57,878 --> 00:04:01,679
accepted by my family and that really

105
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:03,799
allow allowed me to excel in the

106
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,280
Cannabis space from an early age well

107
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:07,799
before regulation I was definitely

108
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,079
selling cannabis it came to a point

109
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:11,360
where I was bringing in some money and

110
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:13,319
some weed into like the family house and

111
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,759
I was like this doesn't feel right so I

112
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:18,519
actually moved out kind of early on and

113
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:21,840
started going to junior college instead

114
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:24,399
of high school early on and um that also

115
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,319
opened up more Avenues to sell more

116
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:28,599
cannabis is going to a junior high or

117
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:32,519
Junior College when I was 13 years old

118
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:34,680
so Big Game Changer yeah so essential

119
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:36,478
extracts started did it originally start

120
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,800
in Colorado or was yeah it started in

121
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:42,360
Colorado

122
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:46,000
2012 maybe a little before that um I was

123
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:48,680
operating in California and I was DJing

124
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,360
and and doing some promotion promotional

125
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:54,000
work for True school and we started

126
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,840
something here in Oakland actually and

127
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,120
had some attention some unwanted

128
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:59,599
attention and we were told that

129
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,840
California wasn't ready for what I was

130
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,280
was doing basically go back to Colorado

131
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:06,079
oh I believe it um so that's what we did

132
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:08,359
we went to Colorado Colorado was one of

133
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:12,120
the first places that really allowed us

134
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:14,560
to operate um it felt a lot safer than

135
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,199
215 I wanted to sleep at night I've sold

136
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,918
weed my entire life and uh I had just

137
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,280
recently had a kid and I wanted to sleep

138
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:24,079
at night so I came back to Colorado and

139
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:28,159
we started essential extracts actually

140
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:31,478
in 2009 um by 2010 it was a licensed

141
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:34,039
entity oh wow that's awesome yeah

142
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:35,318
Colorado is in some ways is a lot I talk

143
00:05:34,038 --> 00:05:37,279
about on my show about being a more

144
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:39,120
mature Market than California and I feel

145
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:41,799
like they trust their brands it's it's a

146
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,280
different Market I would not personally

147
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,919
you know as far as cultivation like

148
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:47,000
indoor cultivation yeah but like it's

149
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:49,279
it's tough out there it's so dry

150
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,199
Washington is the polar opposite and

151
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:54,000
then you got California which is like

152
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,680
the perfect weather and I think that

153
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,079
perfect is really according to what

154
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:02,079
you're trying to do and it stems back to

155
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:04,959
historically ter are and

156
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:06,879
hash regions weren't in near the

157
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:09,758
equatorial but the flower cultivation

158
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:12,439
regions were so you know for me Colorado

159
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,680
is like that dry cold climate that's

160
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:16,879
perfect for making hash yeah so it might

161
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,879
not be the best for you know producing

162
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:21,360
flour or drying and curing flour um but

163
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:23,159
as far as hash production it's one of

164
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,840
the best places to make hash in the

165
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,439
United States totally so how did you get

166
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:30,038
your start because now a lot of kids

167
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:31,560
they have YouTube and they have a lot of

168
00:06:30,038 --> 00:06:33,159
re there's tons of resources it's

169
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,800
endless you know and there's so many

170
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,479
extract

171
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,478
artists uh how did you get your start I

172
00:06:37,478 --> 00:06:41,240
know you work with MAA a little bit at a

173
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:43,000
certain point but really the start came

174
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,720
from having a family that was accepting

175
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,038
of cannabis so my start was as a

176
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:52,560
teenager selling weed in the Bay Area um

177
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:54,719
from there I always wanted it to be on

178
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,439
the up and up I always wanted to sleep

179
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,520
at night I got robbed as a kid I you

180
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:01,800
know had some issues with the law as a

181
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:06,120
kid and I was tired of that I wanted to

182
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,478
be Forefront about what I did and um so

183
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,759
I was actually one of the first people

184
00:07:07,478 --> 00:07:11,240
to reach out to the do and to reach out

185
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,720
to them and being like hey I want to pay

186
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,400
taxes on hashish I don't want to play

187
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,199
around I want to be licensed I want to

188
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:20,318
sleep at night and so I think that's

189
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:22,319
really where the start happened for the

190
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,039
regulated Community is essential

191
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,240
extracts was one of the very first

192
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:29,719
licensed hash making companies in the

193
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:32,000
United States wow um and from there we

194
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,319
had one of the first Labs so I had

195
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,680
companies from all over the world from

196
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,960
micro fluid X who was in the cold brew

197
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,800
coffee industry to other techn

198
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:43,239
technology Industries Brewing Industries

199
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,240
coming to us being like hey we want to

200
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:48,439
bring our equipment into your lab

201
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:51,240
because it's protected yeah really so um

202
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:54,199
I think that's a big you know reason

203
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:56,199
that we came up early is we had one of

204
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:58,639
those first licens protected

205
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:00,000
Laboratories where big bigger Brands

206
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,720
felt comfortable bring in a quarter

207
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,560
million dollar piece of equipment into

208
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,440
that lab rather than in the homie's

209
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,478
basement or your garage right so let's

210
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:10,319
talk about solventless what is

211
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:12,199
solventless for those people that don't

212
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:16,199
know what is

213
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:19,000
solventless um you know so initially the

214
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:21,560
very first term that was coined back in

215
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,639
like 2010 and with the help of Paul

216
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,158
token who was one of I think one of the

217
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:27,158
first influencers one of the first

218
00:08:25,158 --> 00:08:31,478
YouTube influencers If you will we were

219
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:33,319
hanging out and I was L trying to evolve

220
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:34,799
the technology we were producing to

221
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,200
mimic what we were seeing in the

222
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:41,639
hydrocarbon world so when honey oil

223
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:44,959
first came to the market butane hash oil

224
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:46,439
um we I I I made it in reality let's go

225
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,879
back to that I made it when it first

226
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,279
came to Market I bought a honeybee

227
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:50,838
extractor in the back of high times and

228
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:53,958
I was making it on my back porch in

229
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:57,160
Boulder Colorado but there was a lot of

230
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:58,599
unknowns and I loved the color and I

231
00:08:57,159 --> 00:09:00,159
loved the consistency but I didn't know

232
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,240
what I was giving to my friends and what

233
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:06,439
I was selling my people so I went to

234
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,240
Amsterdam and I looked into this one of

235
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,160
the first and only cafes that was

236
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,240
willing to share some coas with me was

237
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:14,078
the Bluebird Cafe back in the day in

238
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,360
fact they were also one of the first

239
00:09:14,078 --> 00:09:19,559
cafes to have a milk alternative for my

240
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,959
lactose intolerant s wow so I I liked

241
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,479
the bluebird but they were able to share

242
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:26,000
some things with me that showed me that

243
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:29,278
there was other ISO butane isopentane

244
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,278
and other residuals left behind in that

245
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:32,679
butane hash or one of the products

246
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:34,838
obviously there's there were a lot of

247
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:36,559
different people making it back then um

248
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:40,680
but it scared me and so I kind of came

249
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:42,958
back to the United States with this idea

250
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:46,799
that I wanted to create something that

251
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:48,639
looked and tasted and and was consumed

252
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:50,359
like that butane hash oil but without

253
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:51,319
the use of any chemical solvents that

254
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:55,399
was my

255
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:58,560
goal and at that time the product

256
00:09:55,399 --> 00:10:01,120
consistency of ear wax and that term was

257
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:03,078
really popular yeah so the first term

258
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,000
that you know Paul and I really coined

259
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:07,879
was solventless wax MH but then we

260
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,799
realized different consistencies were

261
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:12,519
coming out you know from Sol or from you

262
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:15,479
know more of a batter likee consistency

263
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:19,440
the shatter like consistencies more you

264
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:22,800
know more or less viscosity and I

265
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,920
realized and then we started recreating

266
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:27,759
with more heat or less heat those

267
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:29,639
different consistencies utilizing water

268
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:31,159
hash and

269
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:33,879
started calling things solventless

270
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:36,240
shatter and solventless batter and then

271
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:38,439
solventless really became the overhead

272
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,240
umbrella term and it all happened really

273
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,279
really quickly um I'd say within like a

274
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,240
six-month period we started talking

275
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:47,600
about solventless wax but then very

276
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,799
quickly it became an umbrella term for

277
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,879
anything that we created mechanically

278
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:53,559
without the use of any chemical solvents

279
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:55,320
so I think that's the answered your

280
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:57,479
question initially you asked what is

281
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,240
solventless um it's mechanically

282
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,039
separated triome heads yeah more

283
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,079
recently you've even worked with

284
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:06,679
developing cultivars specifically I mean

285
00:11:05,078 --> 00:11:08,239
probably for a long time but I I've

286
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:11,120
known about it from Recently with my

287
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,680
book you actually help you with the the

288
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,039
stuff on selecting washers you know and

289
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:19,319
your I say I developed ctiv ours yeah

290
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:23,360
but definitely have

291
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:27,200
developed a method of tactile sensation

292
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:29,519
to fine washers right yeah you want to

293
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,040
talk about that you're a little bit yeah

294
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:35,159
yeah yeah know I mean I'm down to talk

295
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:38,000
about it all um I've always been washing

296
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:41,838
and really it wasn't until 2012 that we

297
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,480
started keeping track of that data 2012

298
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,959
is when we started keeping track of

299
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:48,680
yield data and we started looking at all

300
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:51,958
the cultivars at pink house uh the

301
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:53,439
facility that I was working with and um

302
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:55,919
we started noticing that some of these

303
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,480
cultivars were yielding way less and

304
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:59,879
some of them were yielding way more and

305
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,920
it that's really when my eyes opened up

306
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:05,078
like okay maybe we shouldn't wash this

307
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:07,319
blue dream maybe we should send that to

308
00:12:05,078 --> 00:12:09,000
hydrocarbon um in reality because I was

309
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,480
seeing like sub

310
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,879
05% on this blue dream cut that we were

311
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:16,560
still y yielding two and a half pounds

312
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:20,480
per light back in the day U metric if

313
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:22,518
you will and um it was still selling for

314
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,480
really high numbers in flower form so

315
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:27,919
why was I taking all these fresh frozen

316
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,440
or or even dry pounds back then and

317
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:33,679
processing them if I was going to see

318
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:36,120
you know a minimal yield and that

319
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:37,759
minimal yield was never the highest

320
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,639
quality when it was yielding that low

321
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:42,480
when you're like sub 1% it's never the

322
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:45,759
highest quality um well Shouldn't Say

323
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,759
Never there's some outliers always yeah

324
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:52,120
but you know looking at those numbers we

325
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:54,639
realize that not everything is allocated

326
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:57,039
or should be allocated to

327
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,079
solventless and so I think that that's

328
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:01,480
where things changed for us and we

329
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:03,759
started to hone in on those bigger

330
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,000
washers that also still had the tarpine

331
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:07,600
representation or you know the volatile

332
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,440
compound representation that we were

333
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,800
after right nice well and then it's

334
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,959
funny how far that's come too as far as

335
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:18,120
washers you know strawberry banana has

336
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:20,159
always been known as a good washer and

337
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:24,039
then all these the banana cond and the

338
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:27,159
banana Oreos these ones that t 6% 6%

339
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:29,519
Plus what's the highest test you've seen

340
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:31,879
you know highest test on paper I saw

341
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,159
personally was the gorilla princess this

342
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:37,519
was inside the field extracts lab field

343
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:40,120
extracts was a company that um I

344
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:43,839
collaborated with for their launch we

345
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,879
won a few cups together um and in that

346
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,680
time we were processing a few different

347
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:51,078
things from all of our our licensed

348
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:54,599
friends and uh Fieldy brought over some

349
00:13:51,078 --> 00:13:56,638
gorilla princess and it hit like over 9%

350
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,839
which was crazy to me n [ __ ] crazy to

351
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,680
me didn't make sense totally but and it

352
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:03,000
and ended up not being something I put

353
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:04,399
my name on um cuz we were collaborating

354
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,360
so we were finding certain things that I

355
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,759
like could really stand behind and yes

356
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,720
it was a huge yielder but it didn't have

357
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:13,519
a tpine profile once you get like above

358
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:16,639
6% I feel like the Tarpin get a little

359
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:20,159
subdued huh interesting yeah because

360
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:23,278
it's like same thing when you're above

361
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:25,120
30 40% THC oftentimes those aren't like

362
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:26,879
the super turpy strains that I'm looking

363
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,879
for for sure I'm the same sometimes you

364
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:31,838
know sometimes you find a super tast

365
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:34,799
strin that's also 35 Plus I'm not

366
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:37,600
looking for high THC in reality I'm I'm

367
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:39,198
looking for those I wish we could go

368
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,600
back and take all that stuff away and be

369
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:42,599
like does it taste good how does it make

370
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,320
you feel yeah you know those two things

371
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,399
it's like if if you can answer those two

372
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,199
things that's all you really need to

373
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:51,679
know that the THC and and it's great but

374
00:14:48,198 --> 00:14:53,838
it's such a you know it's it's such a

375
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:56,758
confusing to the consumer it's such a

376
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,519
confusing piece of information that they

377
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:59,800
think that because it's high THC that

378
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:01,198
it's it's going to get them more High

379
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:03,078
yeah we're really trying to dispel that

380
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:05,198
myth yeah yeah and you work with the

381
00:15:03,078 --> 00:15:08,000
ganier definitely so so you guys you

382
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:09,799
guys are out there full force trying to

383
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,720
dispill lots of myths which I think is

384
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:14,399
great really just you know the industry

385
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,160
is still brand new um and we just

386
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,278
started researching the plant not too

387
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:22,399
long ago on a empirical level if you

388
00:15:18,278 --> 00:15:23,759
will protected level and um so the the

389
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,360
program is constantly evolving and

390
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:27,120
that's what I like about it it is the

391
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,480
professional platform that I was looking

392
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:33,000
for as a teacher it's a a constantly

393
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,600
evolving platform you know or constantly

394
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
evolving education just as our industry

395
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,600
is constantly evolving so you are one of

396
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,198
the most busiest guys I know so tell us

397
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,600
a little bit more about the ganier and

398
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:46,318
how that started and how you got

399
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,560
involved with that yeah I shot um a

400
00:15:46,318 --> 00:15:50,559
little TV

401
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:53,278
series in Southern California at the

402
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:55,559
greenflower media studio with Derek

403
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:59,159
Gilman the show was called high

404
00:15:55,559 --> 00:16:02,119
rollers and when I pulled up at the

405
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:04,958
studio they had like a makeup person and

406
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,759
um you know proper lighting and real

407
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:09,159
Studio setups and I was like okay this

408
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:10,720
is what I've been looking for in reality

409
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:12,399
I've done some teaching for a lot of the

410
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,480
other platforms I'm not going to name

411
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:17,078
right now um and I've grown up teaching

412
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,480
from swim instruction to Surf

413
00:16:17,078 --> 00:16:21,958
instruction to snowboard instruction I

414
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,959
love teaching so I was looking for a

415
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:27,638
professional platform and after shooting

416
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:29,078
high rollers with Derek um I thought

417
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:32,198
that green flower could be that

418
00:16:29,078 --> 00:16:34,318
professional platform very soon after it

419
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:36,639
all kind of happened at the right time

420
00:16:34,318 --> 00:16:39,360
too cuz I was looking for that platform

421
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,360
and very soon after high rollers um they

422
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,519
brought another project that they wanted

423
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,039
to involve me in and they also involved

424
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,399
I believe it was 16 or 20 other maybe

425
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:50,360
more other council members in this

426
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,360
project at the very onset of it I don't

427
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:56,639
even believe it had a name wow um very

428
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:59,079
soon after the onset the term Gan became

429
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,120
the name Kevin jodry brought that name

430
00:16:59,078 --> 00:17:04,198
to us it was a name that was previously

431
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,240
given to Kevin um but we utilized it for

432
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:08,679
the platform and uh there's a lot of

433
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,439
council members that was another reason

434
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:14,360
that I wanted to work with the platform

435
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:17,240
because it had peers and mentors of mine

436
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:19,879
that I looked up to um that I agree with

437
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:22,359
you know in a lot of the aspects of the

438
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:25,559
industry so I was excited to be among

439
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:29,240
people that I like to be around right um

440
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:30,879
and that I respected so um all of that

441
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,279
kind of came together and we started

442
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,720
ganier program maybe four or five years

443
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:40,200
ago now and I believe I think we're in

444
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:45,160
our third year of active um on or

445
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:46,759
in-person training so the ganier do a uh

446
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,440
a period where they're doing a bunch of

447
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:51,279
online studies and that period could be

448
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,919
any number of time depending on how long

449
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,678
it takes you to get through it but the

450
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:59,038
online goes through everything from

451
00:17:54,679 --> 00:18:00,600
cultivation to processing to the law

452
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:04,679
to

453
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:06,079
retail it covers a big chunk of our

454
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:08,240
industry as a

455
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:10,678
whole and

456
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,960
um then after they've finished or

457
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:13,559
sometimes they don't have to finish the

458
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,759
online portion but whe they're when

459
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:16,918
they're confident with the online

460
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:20,038
portion they can sign up for in-person

461
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:21,480
training and um of course they have to

462
00:18:20,038 --> 00:18:23,679
finish you know the online and the

463
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,839
in-person training to get certified but

464
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,720
the in-person training consists of two

465
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:29,359
days where the first day we do some

466
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,679
assessments

467
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:34,879
um we actually assess some local

468
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,600
Southern humble cultivated flower

469
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,640
generally it's full sun but we also

470
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:41,279
bring in some other living soil grows um

471
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:44,000
some living soil indoor grows as well

472
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:46,200
for assessment purposes and we assess

473
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,159
utilizing the systematic assessment

474
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,279
protocol app which is an application

475
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:53,600
that we've developed and are constantly

476
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:56,639
evolving as well to uh assess the flower

477
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:59,158
because we felt like that was a big need

478
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,919
in the industry what is quality we

479
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:03,840
wanted to talk about what is quality in

480
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,720
the industry there's a lot of myths out

481
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:08,759
there as far as what is quality so we do

482
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,120
an assessment and then we also do a farm

483
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:15,038
tour where we bring the students to a

484
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:17,000
local uh Southern humble farm and you

485
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:18,960
know they let they they get to feel the

486
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,319
magic at that point nice you know once

487
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,400
they come up to farm I don't really need

488
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:23,918
to do too much talking um I love

489
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,320
bringing people on the farm because

490
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,880
especially people from out of state or

491
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:28,960
people that haven't seen live cannabis

492
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,880
plants it's uh it's a treat

493
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,279
yeah it's an eye opening experience you

494
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,760
know it's pretty amazing I remember the

495
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:37,038
first time I saw a plant I don't know if

496
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:40,759
you remember the first time you saw a

497
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:43,599
plant but first time I don't know I

498
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:46,558
remember growing a few in the backyard

499
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:49,000
as a as a little kid but yeah

500
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:50,558
totally I couldn't believe I mean I I

501
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,279
seen Bud for a while before I saw a

502
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:53,678
plant the first time I saw a plant I was

503
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:56,399
like holy

504
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,440
[ __ ] so that's what that's what it is

505
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,640
that we're smoking and you know know

506
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,679
it's like uh all these things are

507
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,679
becoming lost arts and there's a lot of

508
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,960
people that that are out there that have

509
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,679
never actually seen a plant growing just

510
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,000
like they've never seen the vegetables

511
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:11,960
growing that they're eating that they're

512
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,558
buying from the grocery store sad but

513
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:16,400
true yeah yeah we live in a strange

514
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:19,359
world where there's this big disconnect

515
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:22,320
from how and I think education can solve

516
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:24,519
a lot of that you know but also

517
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:26,599
experience so we're trying to provide

518
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:28,200
both yeah and I'm constantly learning

519
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:30,480
each and every day it's what keeps me

520
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,279
motivated to teach in reality and that's

521
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,000
why this emerging market so perfect for

522
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:37,240
me cuz I'm still motivated after 20

523
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,759
something years of doing this yeah um

524
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,000
but thank you to the plant for real

525
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:42,798
because she keeps me going yeah I mean

526
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,159
we're in a we're in a really strange

527
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:46,440
time in the industry but we're

528
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,960
definitely you know we're in this

529
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,720
especially in the United States like

530
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,279
this consolidation phase again and so

531
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,319
there are people that are suffering and

532
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:55,240
people that are having tough times but

533
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:56,639
we are in the infancy of an industry

534
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,798
that'll be you know 100 years from now

535
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,440
is going to be a very stable industry

536
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:02,798
and a very different industry in a lot

537
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,159
of ways I think yeah definitely even 10

538
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:05,158
years from now we should be a little

539
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,600
more

540
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:10,080
stabilized uh right now you know what's

541
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,519
your thought on all the new genetics

542
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:12,678
that are coming out we have a top 40s

543
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:14,720
list and it seems like every three

544
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:17,840
months there's something new you know

545
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,558
you're an OG guy though so like OG is

546
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:21,519
like a classic hit that'll be around

547
00:21:19,558 --> 00:21:22,839
Forever Blue Dream that's another one

548
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:24,679
regardless of how you feel about blue

549
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:26,959
dream I feel like that's a or anybody

550
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:28,960
that's watching it's a staple that'll

551
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,400
always be around I haven't seen blue

552
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,759
dream in a minute I have just recently

553
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,080
yeah I mean it's starting to come back

554
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:35,879
now yeah it's starting to come back now

555
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:38,480
for sure but it's been uh it's been a

556
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:41,000
minute um yeah OG's were gone for a

557
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,200
while OG's were like really not in your

558
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,359
world not in my world

559
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:49,120
everun in fact like I actually ran out

560
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:50,959
of my little living soil tent recently

561
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:52,439
just in the last couple days here and I

562
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,720
reached out to somebody and that's

563
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,200
actually what I'm smoking is some

564
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,600
somebody else's living soil OG Skittles

565
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,440
cross and it's [ __ ] amazing and I'm

566
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:01,278
super blessed to have found this guy

567
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,159
because normally I just smoke my weed

568
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:06,240
and I haven't run out of my weed in a

569
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:07,799
long time but um I've been on tour and

570
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,480
some things got a little sidetracked in

571
00:22:07,798 --> 00:22:13,839
the garden and had to do a little reset

572
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,599
if you will um and uh now we're good to

573
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:17,119
go it just was a you know it was a quick

574
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:19,199
couple month reset that we haven't

575
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:21,918
flowered for but I smoked up all my

576
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,080
flowers in those couple months wow yeah

577
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,520
it's there's something special to be

578
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:26,240
said about growing your own flower and

579
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:28,119
smoking your own flour you know exactly

580
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,480
what was put into it and what you put

581
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:32,959
into it is what you get out of it and

582
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,319
especially effect wise definitely is

583
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,440
that what you love about the living soil

584
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:40,879
the most well what I love about my

585
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,840
personal living soil is I know all the

586
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,440
Amendments and everything that goes into

587
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:47,480
the soil and I know everything that is

588
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,759
being brewed as a tea we still do hit it

589
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:53,400
with some teas um but all of my tees are

590
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:55,960
made by my good friend Rich and Bas

591
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,720
organic I know where his farm is you

592
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,679
know and like it's all very close to

593
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,000
home

594
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:03,400
and like there's something about Rich's

595
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,919
nutrients that I just it gives me this

596
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,679
certain even just getting them in raw

597
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,360
form there's this smell when I get them

598
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:14,159
all you know um his veg and his Bloom

599
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:17,399
there's just this homely smell about it

600
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:20,159
um when I've tasted other people's

601
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:23,038
living soil or k&amp;f Gardens often times

602
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:25,240
I'm tasting like uh a fruit ferment or

603
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:28,839
I'm tasting something else that's not

604
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:30,400
really cannabis and with our soil blend

605
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:33,558
that we've been you know constantly

606
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,720
tweaking over the years there's just for

607
00:23:33,558 --> 00:23:37,720
me anyways because it's it's something

608
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,159
I've gotten used to there's no outliers

609
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:42,000
I'm tasting really truly what that

610
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,320
phenotypical expression wants me to

611
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,278
taste is how I feel about my garden I'm

612
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:48,439
not getting any of that extra molasses

613
00:23:46,278 --> 00:23:50,679
or any of that extra fruit juice or

614
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,360
whatever it may be even in an organic

615
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:54,759
sense they're things that can be done in

616
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:56,959
a living soil Garden that I don't like

617
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:58,240
that I don't want to taste um and then

618
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,640
of course on the salt side there's

619
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,960
things as well you know like I don't

620
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:04,080
want to taste the line cleaner I don't

621
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,840
want to taste you know that extra carb

622
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:07,079
boost that you pumped it in the end to

623
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:09,639
give it that bag appeal I don't want to

624
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:11,079
taste that right yeah you want the full

625
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,400
expression of the plant at the end of

626
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:15,399
the day you know it might be a little

627
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:18,519
bit different for each person because

628
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:21,278
now my pet's train to this you know what

629
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:23,000
I mean um and this is rare that I find

630
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:24,679
somebody else's living soil Garden that

631
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,119
I'm like really happy with that I want

632
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:28,679
to smoke and or actually somebody's

633
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:30,158
Garden in general it's not just the

634
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:31,720
living soil somebody's salt grow or

635
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,200
whatever it may be every once in a while

636
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,839
I find like somebody's you know salt

637
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,120
grow that I actually really like and I'm

638
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:39,918
like whoa what what are you doing cuz

639
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:42,278
you're running that nutrient brand but

640
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,000
it tastes like this that's rad totally

641
00:24:42,278 --> 00:24:46,640
there's guys that really can pull it off

642
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,240
for sure um living

643
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,159
soil uh how big of scale have you seen

644
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,480
people successfully pull it off at to

645
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:55,120
where it's stuff that you would enjoy

646
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,919
smoking yeah I think that um one of the

647
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:59,719
first people that really built out a lot

648
00:24:56,919 --> 00:25:02,120
of the initial living soil grows in

649
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:04,640
Colorado was this woman named

650
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:06,918
Cassandra um and she started at this

651
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,038
dispensary called Eminem dispensary Mike

652
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:10,679
and Mike dispensary and Boulder I

653
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:12,000
started following around from there

654
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:15,440
because we started getting product from

655
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,558
them dry material that was washing like

656
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,240
it was fresh frozen yeah so there was

657
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:20,480
something happening in this Garden I

658
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:22,159
didn't know at the time it was living

659
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,759
soil I didn't know what the method was

660
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,000
of their cultivation I just knew that

661
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:27,359
Eminem was giving me the fire and we

662
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,079
ended up winning a cup with some of

663
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:33,038
their material and then I saw that that

664
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:36,240
same cultivator went over to places like

665
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:38,440
Verde um and I was like okay wait and we

666
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,319
had partnered with Verde kind of around

667
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:43,278
that same time uh Pink House and Verde

668
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:45,960
created a little Bond if you will and we

669
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:47,480
shared some things um and Chuck's still

670
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,480
a really really good friend of mine yeah

671
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,399
me too I started noticing I started

672
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:53,360
noticing this trend of where you know

673
00:25:51,398 --> 00:25:55,439
this girl went and built out these big

674
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:59,479
living soil beds that I liked that

675
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:02,480
flower so um big up Cassandra she's a

676
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:04,599
woman that has really set the stage for

677
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,200
living soil cultivations in Colorado not

678
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:08,519
of people not a lot of people know about

679
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:11,080
her and know about it um and know that

680
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:14,599
that's why that product was different

681
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:18,599
yeah um but then I've also seen um our

682
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:20,879
buddies over at Moon Valley cannabis um

683
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:22,519
in the north bay and they have it's

684
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,960
still not a large facility I think it's

685
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:29,038
5 to 7,500 maybe 10,000 square ft um but

686
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:32,120
beautiful large living soil bed indoors

687
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:35,240
yeah and um it is scalable on in that

688
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:36,599
sense um and I'd say that those are some

689
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,640
of the bigger ones though that I've seen

690
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:41,038
are 10K 10,000 foot living soil indoors

691
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,840
yeah I think that there's bigger out

692
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:44,440
there I just yeah I've never been to

693
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:47,278
Wrigley in Nevada her they're doing

694
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:50,600
interesting stuff living soil my friend

695
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:52,919
Flor Flame Chris Castle uh they're in

Oakland and they're doing double stack

697
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:58,240
two-tier living soil beds pretty good

698
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,720

00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:17,679
about to pop these seeds from DNA these

706
00:27:14,038 --> 00:27:20,640
uh um it's not strawberry banana but

707
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:22,320
it's something banana and Skittles yeah

708

they're doing good good guys nice that's

711
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:34,798
this is living soil indoor living soil

712
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:36,799
indoor yeah blown out SMS good yeah it's

713
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:38,960
not bad it's got nice banana chirps it's

714
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:41,398
like it's mild on the banana but I kind

715
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:45,079
of like that it's not super Skittle but

716
00:27:41,398 --> 00:27:46,798
it's candy okay so and it smokes the it

717
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:48,759
translates in the Smoke which is what I

718
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:51,398
like so not everything translates in

719
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:53,599
smoke some stuff you smell purple punch

720
00:27:51,398 --> 00:27:55,719
for an example smells amazing you got to

721
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:58,038
smoke it the extract's okay don't don't

722
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:01,278
get me wrong I'm not a big fan fan of

723
00:27:58,038 --> 00:28:03,879
purple punch I'm not Oreos Oreos is

724
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:05,759
something very Bland to me Oreos the

725
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:08,960
original Oreos cut looks amazing bag

726
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:10,679
appeal banging super easy to grow but I

727
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,278
do not want to yeah it's got It's got

728
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:14,880
bag appeal definitely got a look to it

729
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:16,798
and if you couldn't smell it you'd think

730
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,440
it was amazing white truffles is another

731
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:20,759
one I'm not really fond of personally

732
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:23,000
interesting I really like that Cron's

733
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:25,640
cut of white truffle um I think it has

734
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,759
this like Petra cor to it that like

735
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:31,200
speaks to me it has this like Sandalwood

736
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:32,879
eucalyptus Petra cor thing that I like

737
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,080
it's like similar to biscotti I

738
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,880
definitely preer prefer the biscotti TPS

739
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:40,720
cuz it's like that same earthy Petra cor

740
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:42,519
gas eucalyptus but the biscotti also has

741
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,519
the cream and the gas totally well

742
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:46,200
that's the interesting thing sometimes

743
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:48,839
until you try the right cut you might

744
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,319
think something sucks so maybe I haven't

745
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:51,918
I'm one of those people that i' I've

746
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:53,398
seen that happen so many times in my

747
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,120
life where I'm like oh it sucks it sucks

748
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:57,199
it sucks and then someone shows me the

749
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:59,398
good version of it and it's like oh [ __ ]

750
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,000
this is this is what's up uh wedding

751
00:28:59,398 --> 00:29:02,518
cake was the best example of that I'd

752
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,880
seen there's so many fenos out there

753
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:06,558
that over 30 I think there's over 30

754
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,519
fenos of wedding cake I'd seen a bunch

755
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:08,759
said I was just in Thailand they're

756
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:10,278
calling stuff Wedding Crashers and

757
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:12,119
wedding cake that's so far from it I

758
00:29:10,278 --> 00:29:15,038
think I tasted some lemon tree that was

759
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:17,000
called Wedding Crashers in Thailand but

760
00:29:15,038 --> 00:29:18,720
um yeah the first time I saw a good

761
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,038
wedding cake I'd probably seen like 10

762
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,120
other fenos of it and I'm just like e

763
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:25,119
and then it wasn't the biggest yielding

764
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:27,798
it wasn't the cakest but it had the most

765
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:29,719
flavor and smoking it it was bready it

766
00:29:27,798 --> 00:29:32,319
was amazing it you know you burned down

767
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,759
the roach the roach tasted good and

768
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:35,359
that's a that's a big test for me is

769
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:38,679
like how does it taste of the roach if I

770
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:40,319
refire it how does it taste definitely

771
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:42,360
definitely it's interesting we're just

772
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:44,599
getting all this rain right here so I

773
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:46,678
was kind of talking to uh my buddy

774
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:49,038
before I popped in here that this was

775
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:50,840
burning like super white in Colorado the

776
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:52,839
same weed but now that it's so much

777
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:56,038
humidity and I was just out in the rain

778
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:57,359
basically burning a little darker too

779
00:29:56,038 --> 00:29:59,119
yeah it's interesting some of these guys

780
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:00,678
are flushing with magnesium now they're

781
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:02,278
adding magnesium to flush so it burns

782
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:03,798
it's a trick they're using to make it

783
00:30:02,278 --> 00:30:05,200
burn more white yeah definitely

784
00:30:03,798 --> 00:30:07,200
definitely I think it

785
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,798
increases uh yeah the temperature at

786
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,319
which it combusts um so it burns more

787
00:30:09,798 --> 00:30:13,918
fully which creates more white should be

788
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:17,678
more flavor the white what's your

789
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:19,960
thought on White Ash um I like even Ash

790
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,960
for me it doesn't have to be white um

791
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:25,399
but there's

792
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:28,759
definitely there's reasons that white

793
00:30:25,398 --> 00:30:30,239
ash I I want my my weed to fully combust

794
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:32,558
I don't want there to be any carbon left

795
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,000
over and when cannabis fully combusts

796
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:35,759
it's generally going to be a little bit

797
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,159
lighter in

798
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:40,398
color I think for me it's a combination

799
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:43,120
of the water content and the combustion

800
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:45,158
so that combustion is attributed to what

801
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:47,158
micronutrients are left behind and what

802
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:50,240
you know what else is left so there's a

803
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:52,200
lot of variables to it um I'm definitely

804
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,200
impressed every time I see all white ash

805
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,798
you know I mean where it looks like a

806
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,519
cigarette or a cigar but a lot of that

807
00:30:55,798 --> 00:30:59,440
has to do with the perfect cure too but

808
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,120
I've had all white ash where it just

809
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,480
tastes so

810
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:06,119
Bland I don't care I don't care that it

811
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:08,278
burns that clean if it tastes like the

812
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:10,199
paper I'm smoking yeah I was getting

813
00:31:08,278 --> 00:31:12,119
some stuff from Grass Valley in fact

814
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,038
this year that like it had the blackest

815
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:15,599
of Ash but it tasted so good and I just

816
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:17,798
want to keep smoking it yep it's

817
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:20,038
Greenhouse good stuff and if it burns

818
00:31:17,798 --> 00:31:21,558
even and that darker colored Ash is

819
00:31:20,038 --> 00:31:23,919
actually fully combusting and it's not

820
00:31:21,558 --> 00:31:25,440
leaving a lot of that super hard carbon

821
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,840
behind I'm okay with it but if it's

822
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,320
leaving a lot of carbon behind right

823
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:31,199
generally even if it tastes good I don't

824
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:33,558
want to smoke it yeah it's interesting I

825
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,720
just recently tried some um some more

826
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:38,319
freeze-dried flour I've had freeze-dried

827
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:41,000
flour in the past um but this this new

828
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:42,960
batch um of freeze-dried flour it looked

829
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,240
amazing smelled amazing but when I went

830
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:48,960
to burn it it wasn't like that the the

831
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:52,720
color of the ash was bothering me it was

832
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:55,720
the it wasn't satisfying it was such a

833
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:58,399
light yeah feeling that I wasn't getting

834
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:00,679
the full smoke satisfaction that I

835
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:02,599
wanted the freeze d weed trips me out Ed

836
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:04,480
Rosenthal has been pushing it for years

837
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:05,918
and these guys I I wanted to come on the

838
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,639
show and I wanted to do a side by side

839
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,440
because they claim it's you know higher

840
00:32:07,638 --> 00:32:12,278
Turpin higher can

841
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,798
avonoids uh and you know it looks weird

842
00:32:12,278 --> 00:32:16,240
though it's like astronaut ice cream but

843
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:18,038
with weed and I think you will get some

844
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,000
of those if you remove 100% of the water

845
00:32:18,038 --> 00:32:22,398
you know but I think it's also going to

846
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,038
be a balance of not wanting to remove

847
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:27,479
100% of the water sure and finding like

848
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:28,798
a a middle ground if you will well and

849
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,319
somebody out there watching is going to

850
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:32,200
find tuna and they're going to give me

851
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:34,158
some weed at spannabis or one of these

852
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,200
events that I'm going to oh I think cash

853
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,840
treemason freeze dried flour is some of

854
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:40,080
the best freeze-dried flour I've had so

855
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:42,359
I've had freeze-dried flour that smokes

856
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:44,398
proper what I want I have yet to try

857
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:46,038
some yeah it costs a lot of money yeah

858
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:47,359
it should I mean things that are good

859
00:32:46,038 --> 00:32:49,480
that are yeah you should try some of

860
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:51,839
that yeah you should try uh you should

861
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:54,798
try some of some of Cash's freeze-dried

862
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:56,839
flour cuz I thought it was actually good

863
00:32:54,798 --> 00:33:00,200
um and I've had you know some that is

864
00:32:56,839 --> 00:33:01,519
not not as I think the concept is great

865
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,278
so at the end of the day I think the

866
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,839
concept is really good I mean I like

867
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:07,919
freeze dryers and you know well and to

868
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:11,759
be able to control it if you can control

869
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:13,840
it down to uh you know below a percent a

870
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:15,638
tenth of a percent and you can control

871
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:17,918
the moisture and all these things I

872
00:33:15,638 --> 00:33:19,798
think that the science is there that you

873
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:22,360
know it's hard to argue with science I

874
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:24,638
have yet to try it and as soon as I do

875
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:26,079
I'll I'll be a big proponent of it but

876
00:33:24,638 --> 00:33:28,678
until I do I'm going to be like well the

877
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:30,720
stuff Ed gave me his house wasn't really

878
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:32,559
great yeah no there's some variables to

879
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,319
the freeze drying process in in all

880
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:38,119
aspects in in the hash world for us yeah

881
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:41,678
um and in freeze drying flower for sure

882
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:44,158
nice so in 2014 we did a Dabo with douge

883
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:46,559
and Mila San

884
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,399
Francisco uh we need to do another one

885
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:50,200
next year but let's talk about Davido a

886
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:54,000
little bit you got involved with me and

887
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:57,639
Mila so when did you uh start hanging

888
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:00,960
out and uh with Mila I believe I first

889
00:33:57,638 --> 00:34:06,158
met Mila in early 2000s

890
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:08,838
2004 um probably at the latest but um I

891
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:11,280
feel like I had gone previous to that

892
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:13,320
trip in 2004 but the most memorable

893
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,440
memorable trip for me was

894
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:20,599
2004 um when I like got a washing

895
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:23,000
machine from Mila we actually put a uh

896
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:25,679
one of these big I believe it was like a

897
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,320
Swedish or a press from Switzerland it

898
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,079
was like these big hand press and they

899
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,559
were 100% stainless there were tons of

900
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:32,399
knockoffs in the United States at the

901
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:33,799
time but they were all aluminum and if

902
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:35,480
you like used one of those aluminum

903
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,919
knockoffs you bought at the head shop

904
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:39,639
like they looked really fancy they came

905
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:41,078
in a nice velvet box and everything but

906
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:43,039
like after the first or second time

907
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:45,760
you'd start shaving aluminum into your

908
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:47,398
hash so real soon after like we saw

909
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,000
these knockoffs come to the states I was

910
00:34:47,398 --> 00:34:51,000
like I need the real one and Mila was

911
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,719
selling the these real presses so I put

912
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,599
it inside of a washing machine I bought

913
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:56,358
from Mil we ended up shipping it back

914
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:58,280
when it landed the washing machine was

915
00:34:56,358 --> 00:35:00,559
busted because the Press was so heavy it

916
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,160
busted out the plexiglass oh man I ended

917
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:04,838
up fixing it with some bat epoxy and I

918
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:06,679
still have that washing machine but um

919
00:35:04,838 --> 00:35:08,719
yeah that same year is when I bought

920
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:11,239
those papaya seeds from MAA that have

921
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:14,559
made a huge wave in the United States

922
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:16,039
yeah that papaya has gone everywhere

923
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:18,000
yeah um and it's really cool to see

924
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:21,599
people latch on to that one it's a big

925
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,838
extra for sure yeah um but yeah that

926
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:28,280
year is when I got those seeds um from

927
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:30,039
mivia and Nirvana but um yeah Mila

928
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,880
that's when I'm started hanging out with

929
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:35,159
Mila is in those early 2000s days I

930
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,559
first traveled to Amsterdam and I was

931
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:39,358
told that I need to find Mila Jansen the

932
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:42,199
hash queen and I was like okay you know

933
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:43,480
I was a hash guy already right um and so

934
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:46,199
people are like you need to meet this

935
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:48,079
woman you know and multiple people told

936
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:49,919
me that I would like go down the path of

937
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,039
trying to find these Mammoth tus

938
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,880
crutches so I used these crutches yeah

939
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:56,199
use those big long crutches and I found

940
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:58,318
these Mammoth tus so big up py in the

941
00:35:56,199 --> 00:36:00,039
mammoth TUS later on in life I found out

942
00:35:58,318 --> 00:36:03,800
who actually was making these and became

943
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:05,039
friends with him was crazy um but there

944
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,560
was a point where I was trying to track

945
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:08,440
down as many of them as I could find

946
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:11,599
it's an extinct animal so it's a rare

947
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:13,800
item I wanted these Mammoth tus crutches

948
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,838
and I heard that Mila had a lot of them

949
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:19,200
for sale so that's really kind of what

950
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:22,199
brought me initially to Mila's warehouse

951
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:24,559
and where my eyes opened up to a whole

952
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:27,679
wall of hash from around the world that

953
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:29,480
her fans had made her with using her

954
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:32,159
equipment right you've got like this

955
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:34,280
wall with like letters and Ziploc bags

956
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:38,719
and like little pieces of hash taped on

957
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:42,200
the wall and stuff um and uh I ended up

958
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:44,639
just picking Mila's brain th those trips

959
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:47,759
um because there wasn't a lot about

960
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:49,559
hashish and how to make it written down

961
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,000
there were forums popping up and people

962
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:55,358
were talking about it um but there

963
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:58,440
really wasn't a lot of books about

964
00:36:55,358 --> 00:37:00,400
hashish so you had to kind of go study

965
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,838
and MAA was one of those people that I

966
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,800
wanted to study

967
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:06,358
under so I would go to her shop her

968
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,680
Warehouse where she would sell the

969
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:10,519
pollinator and the bags and all that and

970
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:13,078
I would just basically sit down with her

971
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:16,280
and bug her and ask her question after

972
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:18,560
question after question um and she was

973
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:20,880
out smoking me and still does to this

974
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:23,159

1020
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:02,480
a long time ago we used to go out to the

1021
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,720
fairon islands and go out in the bay you

1022
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:07,079
know there's so many different types of

1023
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:08,759
fish and cool stuff to see so yeah so

1024
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:11,560
let's talk about you being a DJ because

1025
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:13,079
that's I mean you you got five different

1026
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:15,239
things you're you're doing right now

1027
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:17,480
that are all in this day and age you've

1028
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:20,159
got to do it all I feel like for me

1029
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:22,039
anyways to survive I can't just judge an

1030
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:24,039
event you know it's hard for the

1031
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:26,719
organizers to pay me just to judge so

1032
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:30,000
I'm often times wanting to couple my

1033
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:32,439
DJing or you know having a console on

1034
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,280
the ground wherever I'm traveling set up

1035
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:40,159
or a class or hosting an event um I

1036
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:44,760
really like to do a lot but yeah DJ 2013

1037
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:48,039
Marlon Asher uh opening up for uh Big

1038
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:49,599

1039
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:51,318

pretty crazy that was fun yeah yeah yeah

1042
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:57,119
and I actually I think that was the

1043
00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:00,000
first time I performed with Mar and I

1044
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:01,800
there was no preparation and and uh I

1045
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,159
was a little nervous cuz like this is an

1046
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,318
artist who I've looked up to and I've

1047
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:07,598
played his 7in records for probably 10

1048
00:40:05,318 --> 00:40:10,159
years before that event you know what I

00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:19,400
them up and just perform them without

1053
00:40:17,358 --> 00:40:21,000

1076
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,480
little bit for sure um they tried to

1077
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:09,039
bring it to Jamaica I went out to

1078
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,880
Jamaica with it um it was a little bit

1079
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:12,000
of drama on the ground there I guess but

1080
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,160
uh I don't think it's been back to

1081
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,559
Jamaica since I I didn't go to Jamaica

1082
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:17,838
so that was one of the ones I missed it

1083
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:20,838
was different it was fun though um I got

1084
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:23,000
to speak which was a trip you know being

1085
00:41:20,838 --> 00:41:25,239
um you know just being a white person in

1086
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,440
Jamaica speaking on an educational level

1087
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:31,239
to Jamaicans who been farming for you

1088
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:32,880
know Generations it was it was hard for

1089
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:34,559
me number one cuz I'm like I kind of

1090
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,318
wanted those guys to be on the stage

1091
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:39,920
with me you know reality but I had muda

1092
00:41:37,318 --> 00:41:41,880
baruka in the the crowd basically muda

1093
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,720
is the the voice of the people in

1094
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,519
Jamaica and so for him to be in the

1095
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:49,000
crowd and I remember him standing up and

1096
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:50,318
asking me a question and like um it was

1097
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,960
a pretty

1098
00:41:50,318 --> 00:41:55,920
direct straightforward militant style

1099
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,559
question and I answered it and I

1100
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,880
answered it you know to the best of my

1101
00:41:57,559 --> 00:42:03,159
ability and I remember him like you know

1102
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:04,720
saying all right respect and having that

1103
00:42:03,159 --> 00:42:06,480
you know from somebody who was the voice

1104
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:07,838
of the people to Jamaica was a trip so

1105
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,199
there were definitely some highlights to

1106
00:42:07,838 --> 00:42:12,078

travel around with like tackle boxes

1133
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:16,079
yeah and film cases and stuff whatever I

1134
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,280
could find that would fit 45s perfectly

1135
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:19,599
um and I would travel around doing that

1136
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,720
and it got to a point where it was a lot

1137
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:23,720
of Records even though there were

1138
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:26,639
smaller records it was a lot um and I'd

1139
00:43:23,719 --> 00:43:29,159
say once I finally converted to digital

1140
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:32,358
and started playing with Sado um I

1141
00:43:29,159 --> 00:43:34,519
started broadening my music selection

1142
00:43:32,358 --> 00:43:36,440
started with roots started with reggae

1143
00:43:34,519 --> 00:43:38,199
and Roots reggae then it got into

1144
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:41,039
dancehall a little slackness and some

1145
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:43,199
'90s you know bashment if you will which

1146
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:47,000
is you know a form of a little bit more

1147
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:51,439
up paced reggae music from Jamaica but a

1148
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:53,119
little bit more rude and raw um and then

1149
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,599
I'd say that things really

1150
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:57,280
changed maybe it was almost 10 years ago

1151
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:59,318
now when it was it was Mila's 70th

1152
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:02,680
birthday party that I djed in Amsterdam

1153
00:43:59,318 --> 00:44:05,519
and she wanted me to play 60s rock music

1154
00:44:02,679 --> 00:44:06,879
yeah I was like okay okay and she wanted

1155
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:07,838
you know she gave me a list of artists

1156
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,240
and I was like okay some of these

1157
00:44:07,838 --> 00:44:11,400
artists I really get down with and so

1158
00:44:09,239 --> 00:44:12,719
like I went back to the the drawing

1159
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,838
board and I was like now that I have

1160
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:17,598
this digital AA availability to me I'm

1161
00:44:15,838 --> 00:44:19,480
going to make some remixes or fine

1162
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:22,400
remixes so I called up all my producer

1163
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:24,679
friends and got a bunch of remixes of

1164
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:27,519
like more rock Style music but like

1165
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:29,279
reggae style or little bit of some house

1166
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:30,838
remixes for the end of the night and

1167
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,880
just kind of switched it up and I was

1168
00:44:30,838 --> 00:44:34,838
still able to perform the songs I think

1169
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,119
I even played some dead she wanted Dead

1170
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:39,440
you know to be performed so I played

1171
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,880
everything all bunch of genres for MAA

1172
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,519
and people were getting down and I had

1173
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,559
like dead heads that were there it was a

1174
00:44:42,519 --> 00:44:46,039
full pack crowd at the milk wag still

1175
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:47,960
and dead head's being like yo that

1176
00:44:46,039 --> 00:44:49,838
recording of that that show that you

1177
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:52,639
played up there like that was amazing I

1178
00:44:49,838 --> 00:44:55,078
was there and like so I feel like I hit

1179
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:58,078
a bunch of different people that were

1180
00:44:55,079 --> 00:45:00,119
like dude nicot is not just a reggae DJ

1181
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:03,760
right and I got some of that respect and

1182
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:06,160
so now being a DJ that's really focused

1183
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,119
on these cannabis events I'm playing

while I was in Thailand um that was my

1243
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,480
goal I didn't want to smoke what I can

1244
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:21,358

00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:24,199
there and uh smoke a bunch of really

1247
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,639
good local stuff it might not have been

1248
00:47:24,199 --> 00:47:28,919
labeled right or sure

1249
00:47:26,639 --> 00:47:31,000
but um yeah did you see any good land

1250
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:32,519
race stuff in Thailand they call things

1251
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,318
land race that I don't think was land

1252
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:37,199
race yeah there been a lot ofing yeah

1253
00:47:35,318 --> 00:47:39,400
there been a lot of inbreeding I did not

1254
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:41,399
personally I know that exists but I

1255
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:43,400
think that you know even you know it's

1256
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:45,039
funny you travel all around the world

1257
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:47,079
and like you get people saying hey this

1258
00:47:45,039 --> 00:47:49,079
is the land race and I smell things and

1259
00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:52,160
I'm like no a lot of that came from

1260
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:53,839
Amsterdam sorry but like back in the day

1261
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:57,598
and you might have had it for a long

1262
00:47:53,838 --> 00:48:00,960
long time but no I'm smelling tpine in

1263
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:05,119
smelling whatever it may

1264
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:07,760
be yeah sorry some White

1265
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:11,000
Widow but yeah that terpinolene lemine

1266
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:13,200
or terpinolene line it's like it's it's

1267
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,679
all over with stuff you know it's funny

1268
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:16,078
because some you you might even get that

1269
00:48:14,679 --> 00:48:18,719
from Crossing stuff that doesn't have it

1270
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:21,400
it'll come out surprise it's there you

1271
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:23,919
know yep yep so F4 all of a sudden we

1272
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:24,880
have some random occurrence yeah I see

1273
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,200
that with where do you think that came

1274
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:29,440
from that

1275
00:48:26,199 --> 00:48:31,838
turine I would say the I mean it came

1276
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,639
from Colombian too but like you also get

1277
00:48:31,838 --> 00:48:35,519
it in African genetics I mean there's

1278
00:48:33,639 --> 00:48:37,199
some in there but like the Colombian I

1279
00:48:35,519 --> 00:48:38,838
think it's extremely dominant with the

1280
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:41,199
the Colombian stuff I think it's like

1281
00:48:38,838 --> 00:48:43,358
naturally when you're in those extreme

1282
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:44,598
environments that like that like those

1283
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:46,279
desert likee environments that

1284
00:48:44,599 --> 00:48:48,318
terpinolene really helps protect the

1285
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:50,319
plant almost so like a protective

1286
00:48:48,318 --> 00:48:52,318
measure but yeah and it really stands

1287
00:48:50,318 --> 00:48:55,039
out you know it's like uh I got some

1288
00:48:52,318 --> 00:48:57,519
piff and some Cuban black and it's it's

1289
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:58,880
subtle in there it's not like it's not

1290
00:48:57,519 --> 00:49:00,358
like some of the hazes they punch you in

1291
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:02,480
the face I think that was the difference

1292
00:49:00,358 --> 00:49:04,719
between the piff like for me I actually

1293
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:07,798
liked the pffs that I've seen because it

1294
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:10,798
had way less if none none at all of the

1295
00:49:07,798 --> 00:49:13,159
terpinolene side of you know those

1296
00:49:10,798 --> 00:49:16,639
uplifting Cult of ours if you will for

1297
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:18,798
me like a Jamaican land race and piff is

1298
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:20,920
very similar and it I like it because

1299
00:49:18,798 --> 00:49:22,838
it's uplifting without terpinolene

1300
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:26,240
terpinolene gives me anxiety so any of

1301
00:49:22,838 --> 00:49:29,119
that spice any of that you much give me

1302
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:31,439
yeah I me I want the lemoning yeah but

1303
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:33,200
terpinolene anything with the Citrus and

1304
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:36,960
the spice to me just gives me a little

1305
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:38,598
bit too racy in my own head and um I'm

1306
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:41,039
blessed these days to really only smoke

1307
00:49:38,599 --> 00:49:42,920
what I want to smoke these days and know

1308
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:45,239
what I'm looking for know how it affects

1309
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:46,559
me I like it sometimes I like that racy

1310
00:49:45,239 --> 00:49:48,759
feeling sometimes where you're like am I

1311
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:51,880
gonna be okay I'm so I have some strains

1312
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:53,960
that have like you know similar tpine

1313
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:56,760
representations as like a piff or a land

1314
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:59,559
race Jamaican that that don't have that

1315
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:01,960
terpinolene and those still make me racy

1316
00:49:59,559 --> 00:50:04,200
but I would prefer that style of racy

1317
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:05,960
any tinge of terpinolene for some reason

1318
00:50:04,199 --> 00:50:07,439
just sends me over the edge thinking

1319
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:09,440
about it talking about it it's making me

1320
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:11,000
a little anxious bro it does it'll do

1321
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,358
that yeah you start talking about it

1322
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,440
you're like heartbeat goes up about 10

1323
00:50:13,358 --> 00:50:17,000
beats per

1324
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:19,519
minute yeah it's funny I really like

1325
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,280
Lamb's bread and you know Jamaican

1326
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:23,880
Jamaican genetics are pretty amazing I

1327
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:26,559
mean I'm sure the genetic layout has

1328
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:28,119
changed quite a bit with all the

1329
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:30,519
moves towards legalization that's

1330
00:50:28,119 --> 00:50:32,680
happened down there and guys coming from

1331
00:50:30,519 --> 00:50:35,119
Canada and United States and everything

1332
00:50:32,679 --> 00:50:37,000
else but some of those old Jamaican

1333
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:39,358
varieties are amazing so hard to find

1334
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:43,519
the the true ones because Jamaicans love

1335
00:50:39,358 --> 00:50:46,119
a breed yeah right yeah I mean but even

1336
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:47,798
like Sunny Chiba Shane he's got he's got

1337
00:50:46,119 --> 00:50:49,798
a lamb's bread cross that's like a dead

1338
00:50:47,798 --> 00:50:51,798
ringer for that musky lamb bre Lambs

1339
00:50:49,798 --> 00:50:52,960
bread tur I'd love to try it yeah it's

1340
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:55,679
really

1341
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:57,440
good yeah Jamaica's a fun place for sure

1342
00:50:55,679 --> 00:51:00,279
I always bring it back to that just cuz

1343
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:03,119
like for me that Jamaican land race is

1344
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:04,880
like what I want if it's a land race cuz

1345
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:07,160
I feel like it's got a little bit more

1346
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:09,559
depth to it some of these like very

1347
00:51:07,159 --> 00:51:12,039
stringy land races that just you know

1348
00:51:09,559 --> 00:51:14,640
are almost unsm smokable and you're like

1349
00:51:12,039 --> 00:51:17,119
picking each individual 4 inch bracks in

1350
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:19,798
the back they're like that

1351
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:22,798
th you can roll it up in the yeah it's

1352
00:51:19,798 --> 00:51:24,440
it's pretty cool though uh all these

1353
00:51:22,798 --> 00:51:26,119
different varieties from all over you

1354
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:28,159
know how they're contributing you know I

1355
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:29,318
guess it can go back to about six

1356
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:30,838
different varieties for what we have in

1357
00:51:29,318 --> 00:51:33,239
the United States pretty much six

1358
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:35,078
different regions contributed to all of

1359
00:51:33,239 --> 00:51:38,000
the genetics that we're smoking today

1360
00:51:35,079 --> 00:51:39,680
yeah makes sense so but yeah I you know

1361
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,039
I like land R stuff I'm curious about

1362
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:42,519
land R stuff more than anything like

1363
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:44,199
even if it tastes harsh or it's not

1364
00:51:42,519 --> 00:51:46,679
grown correctly I'm still curious about

1365
00:51:44,199 --> 00:51:49,039
these flavors yeah so and I feel like

1366
00:51:46,679 --> 00:51:51,000
diversity is the ticket like we've we've

1367
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:52,558
inbred this stuff so much that we have

1368
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,838
problems like hop plate and

1369
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:56,680
verid uh and you know we have weak

1370
00:51:54,838 --> 00:51:59,159
plants we have weak genetics compared to

1371
00:51:56,679 --> 00:52:00,919
what we could have and genetic diversity

1372
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:02,679
is the key but it's like the right kind

1373
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:04,760
of genetic diversity that that people

1374
00:52:02,679 --> 00:52:06,719
will appreciate you know I think

1375
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:09,000
durban's good I mean there's a lot of

1376
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:10,318
Durban and stuff already I've started

1377
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,679
really collecting a lot of those old

1378
00:52:10,318 --> 00:52:14,759
school genetics and like housed them

1379
00:52:12,679 --> 00:52:17,199
again you know from the UK cheese that

1380
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:21,040
we just kind of got recently thank you

1381
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:23,798
good old zenie um and uh I've kept all

1382
00:52:21,039 --> 00:52:27,239
these ogs and recently my best friend in

1383
00:52:23,798 --> 00:52:31,039
breeder who's also kept I'd say 75% of

1384
00:52:27,239 --> 00:52:33,879
these ogs for us as a family over the

1385
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:36,400
last uh couple decades here he just

1386
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:38,358
recently moved to the east coast and

1387
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,838
before he moved I wanted to make sure I

1388
00:52:38,358 --> 00:52:43,239
grabbed like all the other little ones

1389
00:52:40,838 --> 00:52:45,558
that we hadn't had in just under our

1390
00:52:43,239 --> 00:52:48,000
roof so yeah I feel like I've gotten

1391
00:52:45,559 --> 00:52:50,880
back most of the things that I really

1392
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:54,239
wanted to keep from back in the day so

1393
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:58,640
I've got the ghost OG got the sfv the

1394
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:59,959
triangle uh [ __ ] there's a few others um

1395
00:52:58,639 --> 00:53:01,759
you gave me samples of them they're all

1396
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:02,838
really good they were all good all those

1397
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,839
samples you gave you gave me some

1398
00:53:02,838 --> 00:53:06,838
blueberry as well I think the blueberry

1399
00:53:04,838 --> 00:53:09,558
is different it's got this tinge of

1400
00:53:06,838 --> 00:53:11,679
spice not a terpinolene spice but like a

1401
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:13,519
little bit of a almost like a blue dream

1402
00:53:11,679 --> 00:53:15,318
spice to me that's not the DJ Shar

1403
00:53:13,519 --> 00:53:18,239
blueberry that's a different no it was

1404
00:53:15,318 --> 00:53:21,318
given to me as the

1405
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:24,239
1992 or the 92 blueberry the Oregon

1406
00:53:21,318 --> 00:53:26,920
blueberry yeah I really don't know um it

1407
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:29,479
was given to me by bike uh get seeds

1408
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:31,039
here or get seeds right here good friend

1409
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:34,000
of mine who I've worked with for years

1410
00:53:31,039 --> 00:53:37,440
and years and years um and just been you

1411
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,639
know friends with uh for years he just

1412
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:41,200
keeps passing me interesting Cuts he's

1413
00:53:39,639 --> 00:53:43,199
like yo you just need to grow this out

1414
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:45,639
and then like let me know what you think

1415
00:53:43,199 --> 00:53:47,719
nice and at first I was hoping that it

1416
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:50,159
was like this original blueberry that we

1417
00:53:47,719 --> 00:53:53,358
used to grow back in like the late 90s

1418
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:56,358
early 2000s in Boulder um was it a

1419
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:59,279
sativa no the we had a sativa from

1420
00:53:56,358 --> 00:54:03,239
Oregon okay no this was way more like

1421
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:04,720
big super fat Leaf huge colas I don't

1422
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:07,919
know if what we were growing back in

1423
00:54:04,719 --> 00:54:09,639
Boulder Colorado was DJ shorts blueberry

1424
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,960
whatever it was it was blueberry

1425
00:54:09,639 --> 00:54:13,759
smelling in just huge colas yeah we were

1426
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:15,760
also growing at aeroponic Le it was a

1427
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:18,040
shorter plant with wide leaves yeah yeah

1428
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:19,440
I think DJ's was pretty his is you a

1429
00:54:18,039 --> 00:54:21,039
shorter plant wide leaves and it's

1430
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:23,200
changed over the years because he's done

1431
00:54:21,039 --> 00:54:25,400
so many generations too but that

1432
00:54:23,199 --> 00:54:27,358
original blueberry is what I thought

1433
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:28,760
bike was giving me but when we flowered

1434
00:54:27,358 --> 00:54:30,880
it out I was like oh no this is

1435
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:32,880
different it but I'm not mad at it

1436
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:35,798
because that original blueberry never

1437
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:39,400
really made good water hash for us the

1438
00:54:35,798 --> 00:54:41,719
one that bike gave me hits 4% and does

1439
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:44,280
pretty good so um tast get in a joint

1440
00:54:41,719 --> 00:54:46,358
too for me that one like I've kept it

1441
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:47,960
now as like a washer instead of what it

1442
00:54:46,358 --> 00:54:50,279
was supposed to be what I was looking

1443
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:52,079
for these big big holes and the the

1444
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:54,839
weight isn't bad on her on her either on

1445
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:57,519
the flower side but she washes okay and

1446
00:54:54,838 --> 00:54:59,558
the blue Essence carries through but

1447
00:54:57,519 --> 00:55:01,239
it's like this spicy blue it's not

1448
00:54:59,559 --> 00:55:02,920
exactly what I'm looking for but it's

1449
00:55:01,239 --> 00:55:06,318
something cool to have in the catalog

1450
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:09,280
yeah yeah yeah the ogs man we we just

1451
00:55:06,318 --> 00:55:13,480
got this crippy cut that uh it's like a

1452
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:15,319
sativa OG okay so real thin leaves cppy

1453
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:17,880
sativo yeah that reminds me of something

1454
00:55:15,318 --> 00:55:18,920
we're seeing like down in Colombia or

1455
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:21,318
it's real interesting because it has

1456
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:23,720
that pine cone Bud shape where the buds

1457
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:25,679
are like pine cones bad node spacing

1458
00:55:23,719 --> 00:55:29,318
sativa leaves very you know wants to

1459
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:31,558
flop over needs support but uh man it's

1460
00:55:29,318 --> 00:55:34,119
gassier than gas but it's not really I

1461
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:36,519
mean it's almost OG gas but it's like

1462
00:55:34,119 --> 00:55:38,838
how OG for me it's like how OG gas was

1463
00:55:36,519 --> 00:55:43,719
back in the 90s which I haven't seen in

1464
00:55:38,838 --> 00:55:45,759
a while all right all right yeah yeah so

1465
00:55:43,719 --> 00:55:47,038
yeah so what's your favorite new genetic

1466
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:49,599
that's popping

1467
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:53,400
off

1468
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:56,640
new you know in the last year I like the

1469
00:55:53,400 --> 00:56:00,240
direction of like the RS 11 and some of

1470
00:55:56,639 --> 00:56:01,719
those things um I still do like smoking

1471
00:56:00,239 --> 00:56:04,159
candy flavored things even though I'm an

1472
00:56:01,719 --> 00:56:06,519
OG head and that's what I need for like

1473
00:56:04,159 --> 00:56:09,159
the high side of things there's some of

1474
00:56:06,519 --> 00:56:13,559
these new flavors that I really do enjoy

1475
00:56:09,159 --> 00:56:15,078
um I like yeah rainbow sherb runs all

1476
00:56:13,559 --> 00:56:16,559
the crosses in between you grow a

1477
00:56:15,079 --> 00:56:20,280
rainbow Sher at one of them right you

1478
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:23,200
grow the 54 the 17 or it's this cross

1479
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:25,839
that was given to me by this guy OG

1480
00:56:23,199 --> 00:56:28,798
flare he really didn't know the original

1481
00:56:25,838 --> 00:56:30,519
Origins just to break it down um he gave

1482
00:56:28,798 --> 00:56:32,719
me an idea of what was in the garden

1483
00:56:30,519 --> 00:56:36,000
what he thinks pollinated it and I kind

1484
00:56:32,719 --> 00:56:38,078
of came to conclusions in reality um so

1485
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:41,079
we really don't know what's in that we I

1486
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:43,519
call it rs15 yeah it's tury yeah I

1487
00:56:41,079 --> 00:56:45,839
really really enjoy it it's candy for me

1488
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:49,599
um it definitely has a similar you know

1489
00:56:45,838 --> 00:56:52,000
profile as those rainbow sherbs and yeah

1490
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:53,440
things in that world so yeah so there's

1491
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,519
this trend going on right now and I

1492
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:58,798
don't know if you seen it's like called

1493
00:56:54,519 --> 00:57:01,199
snow snowballs or snow caps or uh buff

1494
00:56:58,798 --> 00:57:03,559
down weed where they coat it with thca

1495
00:57:01,199 --> 00:57:05,480
powder they're saying haven't even seen

1496
00:57:03,559 --> 00:57:07,720
this it smells it smells fake it's it

1497
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:12,000
looks like a flocked Christmas tree

1498
00:57:07,719 --> 00:57:14,639
stuff pretty wild the the over Satur

1499
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:17,798
oversaturation has really like tanked

1500
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:19,480
the flower price all around the world

1501
00:57:17,798 --> 00:57:21,838
and so people are doing all kinds of

1502
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:23,679
weird things and I'm that's also why I'm

1503
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:26,639
just smoking my own flour right now got

1504
00:57:23,679 --> 00:57:29,558
some sprinkles sell flour I don't really

1505
00:57:26,639 --> 00:57:32,038
buy flour I just smoke this is the first

1506
00:57:29,559 --> 00:57:33,280
thing I've bought in a minute wow yeah a

1507
00:57:32,039 --> 00:57:34,760
long time like when you grow it

1508
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,400
correctly yeah that's all you need you

1509
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:38,000
need you just need the plant you know

1510
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:41,000
and for me I like the flower I do like

1511
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:43,599
extract too I like rosin I I like Roos

1512
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:47,639
and hits I like micro dabs yeah I want

1513
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:50,119
turpy Rosen dabs for sure um I still

1514
00:57:47,639 --> 00:57:52,879
enjoy a spliff and just the art of grow

1515
00:57:50,119 --> 00:57:55,400
or you know rolling it um but I also

1516
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:57,079
like all the new technology in the dab

1517
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:59,358
world and that's actually what's made me

1518
00:57:57,079 --> 00:58:01,359
more of a Dabber is doing the the

1519
00:57:59,358 --> 00:58:03,239
cleaning of the slurper and using the

1520
00:58:01,358 --> 00:58:05,279
Q-tip and then put it in the alcohol and

1521
00:58:03,239 --> 00:58:07,399
all the little things to keep it you

1522
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:09,280
know free from cross-contamination

1523
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:12,920
really yeah um and keeping your [ __ ]

1524
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:15,599
fresh and looking clean um I like that

1525
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:18,159
about it so like I like my you know new

1526
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:21,720
little heady rig setup I like my control

1527
00:58:18,159 --> 00:58:23,440
tower from task yeah um I think that

1528
00:58:21,719 --> 00:58:24,959
anybody who's trying to do Innovation I

1529
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:28,760
think is good it's all good for the

1530
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:30,559
industry I I'm happy with uh the direct

1531
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:32,119
in a lot of ways I'm happy with the way

1532
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:34,319
the industry is going and unfortunately

1533
00:58:32,119 --> 00:58:36,400
there's a consolidation phase where the

1534
00:58:34,318 --> 00:58:38,759
guys that have middle of the road weed

1535
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:40,480
or they're get you're done like you need

1536
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:42,280
to move on to something else or grow

1537
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:43,480
better weed like at the end of the day

1538
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:46,559
hopefully yeah hopefully that's what's

1539
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:48,838
happening I'm still seeing a lot of like

1540
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:52,240
pretty weed that doesn't taste that good

1541
00:58:48,838 --> 00:58:55,480
so much and there's a lot of uninformed

1542
00:58:52,239 --> 00:58:57,399
uneducated buyers still there is so

1543
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:59,880
there's going to be that type of weed

1544
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:02,000
that's still going to run a muck right

1545
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:04,480
and I want to educate against having

1546
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:07,440
that in the market I agree 100% to me

1547
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:08,880
it's like pretend to kind and I don't

1548
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:11,079
even know if like there's some people

1549
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:12,640
that are like out there talking of [ __ ]

1550
00:59:11,079 --> 00:59:14,720
about everyone else's weed calling

1551
00:59:12,639 --> 00:59:17,199
everyone else's weed is mids cuz their

1552
00:59:14,719 --> 00:59:19,480
weed looks amazing in a bag but that to

1553
00:59:17,199 --> 00:59:21,838
me that weed that bag a peel weed that

1554
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:23,599
looks amazing but doesn't smoke right or

1555
00:59:21,838 --> 00:59:26,400
doesn't taste right that's the mids to

1556
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:28,880
me well so for me I think the future and

1557
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,639
what I want to push is pre-rolls and

1558
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:32,318
quality pre-rolls you don't ever get to

1559
00:59:30,639 --> 00:59:33,558
see the weed you don't need to because

1560
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:35,719
how does it make you feel how does it

1561
00:59:33,559 --> 00:59:37,400
taste as long as those two things are

1562
00:59:35,719 --> 00:59:39,399
proll are running the market already

1563
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:41,760
right now you know and you look at the

1564
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:43,079
numbers pre roll cruss well yeah and but

1565
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:45,119
you have to have a brand that people

1566
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:46,240
trust because if they see the pictures

1567
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:47,920
of this stuff and it's all scraggly

1568
00:59:46,239 --> 00:59:49,558
online they probably won't want it yeah

1569
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,880
but who cares at the end of the day who

1570
00:59:49,559 --> 00:59:52,440
cares what it looks like cat piss was

1571
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,119
the best [ __ ] ever and that was the

1572
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:56,079
ugliest weed I've ever seen it was also

1573
00:59:54,119 --> 00:59:57,920
the most expensive in the best Skittles

1574
00:59:56,079 --> 01:00:00,240
you know Skittles is not pretty it's not

1575
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:02,838
easy to grow not big yielding but I love

1576
01:00:00,239 --> 01:00:04,919
it totally I love it it's super turpy

1577
01:00:02,838 --> 01:00:06,279
it's it's one of those ones that like I

1578
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:08,720
keep going back to Skittles I always

1579
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:09,720
have Skittles at the house yep so yep

1580
01:00:08,719 --> 01:00:11,679
there's a couple different cuts of

1581
01:00:09,719 --> 01:00:13,879
Skittles now too so there's ones that

1582
01:00:11,679 --> 01:00:16,399
are I think even better than the

1583
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:18,000
original U as far as crosses though I

1584
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,680
don't know that there's a better cross

1585
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,000
with Skittles in it then Skittles Moon

1586
01:00:19,679 --> 01:00:23,239
Bow's good there's some really

1587
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:26,358
interesting ones but as far good work

1588
01:00:23,239 --> 01:00:28,439
with it um yeah I don't know if better

1589
01:00:26,358 --> 01:00:30,798
is a good adjective for it there's

1590
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:32,838
different I have this like pink zugar

1591
01:00:30,798 --> 01:00:35,480
that we're growing right now that I love

1592
01:00:32,838 --> 01:00:37,519
it's Skittles time straw guava yeah and

1593
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:40,318
it's just like Skittles with a little

1594
01:00:37,519 --> 01:00:42,759
bit more of a like a round creamy nature

1595
01:00:40,318 --> 01:00:45,279
it has less of the Citrus that Skittles

1596
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:49,400
tends to have less of the lime yeah

1597
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:51,000
exactly um and I I really enjoy it I

1598
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:53,480
think that it has a little bit more of a

1599
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:55,960
punch than like the original Skittles so

1600
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:57,798
like I've been leaning towards smoking

1601
01:00:55,960 --> 01:01:00,519
that when I like need to smoke because

1602
01:00:57,798 --> 01:01:02,599
it tastes amazing gives you know a

1603
01:01:00,519 --> 01:01:04,719
little bit extra totally yeah it's

1604
01:01:02,599 --> 01:01:06,359
interesting though um skitt I still love

1605
01:01:04,719 --> 01:01:08,399

trying to get high it's not it's I'm not

1607
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:12,760
saying that in a disc but like when I'm

1608
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:14,679
just trying to taste that flavor that's

1609
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:17,000
the flavor I want and there's nothing

1610
01:01:14,679 --> 01:01:19,279
that compares but when I need a little

1611
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:21,639
bit of extra something to get me through

1612
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:23,599
that day or whatever it may be the the

1613
01:01:21,639 --> 01:01:25,038

01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:32,039
through the ceiling the more you smoke

1647

1648
01:02:28,599 --> 01:02:31,440
gassy cuz I wanted to share it with

1651
01:02:33,278 --> 01:02:37,880

1652
01:02:35,358 --> 01:02:39,920
please and then now I don't have anymore

1653
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:41,838
what's your favorite OG out of all ghost

1654
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:44,720
ghost yeah it's the classic ghost is

1655
01:02:41,838 --> 01:02:47,038
like the original OG with Josh D ghost

1656
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:48,639
is all the same cut there's I think a

1657
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:50,079
lot of the cuts that are named certain

1658
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:53,519
things are probably the same but this

1659
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:55,318
ghost compared to the sfv that I have

1660
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:57,278
just has a little little bit it grows

1661
01:02:55,318 --> 01:02:59,278
almost identical the buds almost look

1662
01:02:57,278 --> 01:03:01,838
identical almost smell identical but the

1663
01:02:59,278 --> 01:03:04,838
ghost just has a little bit more of this

1664
01:03:01,838 --> 01:03:06,798
Rich Anis to it compared to the sfv as

1665
01:03:04,838 --> 01:03:09,719
far as the flavor a little more earthy

1666
01:03:06,798 --> 01:03:11,400
just a little bit more of the Anis or I

1667
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:13,558
don't know what it is less of tennis

1668
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:16,000
ball chunk buds on both yeah they still

1669
01:03:13,559 --> 01:03:18,839
look the same um and then the feeling on

1670
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,599
the ghost is way different than the sfv

1671
01:03:18,838 --> 01:03:23,239
even though everything else is the same

1672
01:03:20,599 --> 01:03:25,680
you know in our garden cuz sfv was a a

1673
01:03:23,239 --> 01:03:28,318
little more piny a little more earthy I

1674
01:03:25,679 --> 01:03:30,358
think they they the flavor-wise is

1675
01:03:28,318 --> 01:03:33,000
almost identical on the two cuts that I

1676
01:03:30,358 --> 01:03:35,199
have anyways um but the ghost just gives

1677
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:38,440
me this narcotic feeling wow just

1678
01:03:35,199 --> 01:03:40,118
narcotic and it makes me eat so like for

1679
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:43,440
any cancer patients or people that are

1680
01:03:40,119 --> 01:03:45,920
lacking uh appetite I give them ghost or

1681
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:48,000
ghost Edibles or ghost something that's

1682
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:49,838
like what I save that strain for it

1683
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,318
saved a lot of people in my family and a

1684
01:03:49,838 --> 01:03:52,358
lot of people in my life you know and

1685
01:03:51,318 --> 01:03:54,278
that's one of those ones you can smoke

1686
01:03:52,358 --> 01:03:56,318
in the morning afternoon evening right

1687
01:03:54,278 --> 01:03:57,639
before you go to bed'll for everyone but

1688
01:03:56,318 --> 01:03:59,679
yeah not for everybody but it will get

1689
01:03:57,639 --> 01:04:01,960
you high every time you smoke it every

1690
01:03:59,679 --> 01:04:05,399
single time for for 15 years or whatever

1691
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:09,159
how long I've I've been running it um or

1692
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:12,079
smoking it Scott reach uh rare dankness

1693
01:04:09,159 --> 01:04:14,558
is the first guy that gave me The Ghost

1694
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:17,079
and the sfv and he would sell me the

1695
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:20,440
flowers right one week Scott would give

1696
01:04:17,079 --> 01:04:23,160
me two ounces of ghost right um the next

1697
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:24,880
week Scott would give me 2 ounces of sfv

1698
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:27,838
and I would notice my moods were

1699
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:29,559
different huh like the flower tasted the

1700
01:04:27,838 --> 01:04:31,318
same but I would notice my moods were

1701
01:04:29,559 --> 01:04:33,160
different when I was like smoking on

1702
01:04:31,318 --> 01:04:36,000
ghost for a week compared to smoking on

1703
01:04:33,159 --> 01:04:38,519
sfv and then eventually I got those

1704
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:41,239
exact Cuts so Scott gave me the sfv

1705
01:04:38,519 --> 01:04:43,038
thank you Scott and later down the line

1706
01:04:41,239 --> 01:04:45,078
I always wanted the ghost Scott wouldn't

1707
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:48,359
give it to me later down the line Rich

1708
01:04:45,079 --> 01:04:51,559
who was partners with Scott gave me

1709
01:04:48,358 --> 01:04:53,038
sorry Scott but Rich gave Rich gave me

1710
01:04:51,559 --> 01:04:55,319
the ghost you ever smoked the star

1711
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:58,240
killer from Scott yeah that shit's fire

1712
01:04:55,318 --> 01:05:00,000
yeah but it's not like real OG to me if

1713
01:04:58,239 --> 01:05:01,679
it's an OG cross just like you were

1714
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,838
saying about you know these these

1715
01:05:01,679 --> 01:05:07,639
hybridized things um I don't like OG if

1716
01:05:04,838 --> 01:05:09,159
it's a cross I only want the Clone only

1717
01:05:07,639 --> 01:05:11,558
if I'm going to smoke gas I actually

1718
01:05:09,159 --> 01:05:14,798
can't smoke sour really or chem anymore

1719
01:05:11,559 --> 01:05:16,880
I only want clone only OG s and the chem

1720
01:05:14,798 --> 01:05:19,119
just doesn't give me the same effect I

1721
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:21,160
need my ghost OG like right [ __ ]

1722
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:23,599
weird I need it no and I feel like the

1723
01:05:21,159 --> 01:05:25,519
the Star Killer has a amazing effect and

1724
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:27,880
it's a long effect I feel like it's

1725
01:05:25,519 --> 01:05:29,440
longer than the typical yeah I'd agree

1726
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:32,838
it's a little more uplifting it's a

1727
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:36,278
little more racy um for me I can't do it

1728
01:05:32,838 --> 01:05:37,558
I I need the ghost I need my clone only

1729
01:05:36,278 --> 01:05:40,039
so you don't like ghost Jane Hayes then

1730
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:41,920
I guess no there was one feno that we'd

1731
01:05:40,039 --> 01:05:43,559
like to wash because it was super rare

1732
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:44,880
that anything with terpinolene would

1733
01:05:43,559 --> 01:05:46,880
actually wash but we had this ghost

1734
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:49,000
train Haze that smelled and tasted like

1735
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:52,160
lemon lime like Sprite yeah I think we

1736
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:55,239
called it Sprite feno um and it would

1737
01:05:52,159 --> 01:05:57,358
wash so that I like

1738
01:05:55,239 --> 01:05:58,879
um and I liked that it didn't really

1739
01:05:57,358 --> 01:06:01,199
have too much trinoline it had just

1740
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:03,039
enough to give it the Sprite sensation

1741
01:06:01,199 --> 01:06:05,118
or that flavor but not taste like

1742
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:07,000
terpinolene it was more on the limiting

1743
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:09,160
side of things right yeah so where do

1744
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,719
you see the industry going in the next

1745
01:06:09,159 --> 01:06:15,239
five

1746
01:06:10,719 --> 01:06:17,199
years um a lot of directions yeah I

1747
01:06:15,239 --> 01:06:20,679
think technolog is going to Prevail

1748
01:06:17,199 --> 01:06:24,798
automation I think that a lot of these

1749
01:06:20,679 --> 01:06:26,879
larger scale you know equipment

1750
01:06:24,798 --> 01:06:30,880
companies are going to be doing

1751
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:33,039
well um there's going to be less manual

1752
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:35,440
because it costs a lot to put your hands

1753
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:37,559
on things every touching Point costs a

1754
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:39,599
lot so we can eliminate those touching

1755
01:06:37,559 --> 01:06:42,160
points yeah um you're going to save your

1756
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:44,240
company a lot of money it's unfortunate

1757
01:06:42,159 --> 01:06:45,838
I'm very craft oriented and Hands-On but

1758
01:06:44,239 --> 01:06:47,358
I think that's where the future is going

1759
01:06:45,838 --> 01:06:50,278
if they're going to be cutting us you

1760
01:06:47,358 --> 01:06:52,119
know little guys out um things like that

1761

yeah you have to trip I mean I mean even

1763
01:06:54,358 --> 01:06:58,318
with breeding the tools we have now for

1764
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:00,838
breeding it's it's a game Cher and

1765
01:06:58,318 --> 01:07:03,400

1766
01:07:00,838 --> 01:07:06,679
it's all it's all going to change the

1767

1769
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:13,520
Z being able to

1770

over so you just got to stick with the

1776
01:07:24,318 --> 01:07:27,960
at the end of the day it's all about for

1777
01:07:26,159 --> 01:07:30,159
me it's all about quality like having

1778
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:31,760
the best product because you have a

1779
01:07:30,159 --> 01:07:35,199
better product then you have a leg up on

1780
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:36,839
other people so yeah no no I'm I'm

1781
01:07:35,199 --> 01:07:39,318
blessed to stay smoking my own little

1782
01:07:36,838 --> 01:07:40,838
living soil grow totally and finding

1783
01:07:39,318 --> 01:07:43,558
some homies that also have living soil

1784
01:07:40,838 --> 01:07:46,599
grows that don't add too much sweetener

1785
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:49,599
or this or that you know yeah keeping it

1786
01:07:46,599 --> 01:07:52,200
real with the living soil yeah yeah so

1787
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:56,000
if you could go back to to the younger

1788
01:07:52,199 --> 01:07:58,598
Nick that was in industry for maybe two

1789
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:01,199
years you had one piece of advice uh

1790

1795
01:08:10,599 --> 01:08:16,199
lot of places throughout the world so

1796

1806
01:08:42,439 --> 01:08:47,719
game for our industry and for the world

1807
01:08:46,079 --> 01:08:49,119
yeah I feel like if you have drive and

1808
01:08:47,719 --> 01:08:51,000
determination there's a lot of people

1809

conquer conquer whatever that is you

1816
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:05,000

1817
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:06,679
whether you want to do cultivation

1818
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,838
genetics there and there's so many

1819
01:09:06,679 --> 01:09:11,119
different things when we started in the

1820
01:09:08,838 --> 01:09:12,278
industry when it was the gray Market the

1821
01:09:11,119 --> 01:09:14,238
black market whatever you want to call

1822
01:09:12,279 --> 01:09:16,080
it the Legacy Market you had to do

1823
01:09:14,238 --> 01:09:17,959
everything you had to be the grower you

1824
01:09:16,079 --> 01:09:19,600
had to be the construction guy you had

1825
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:21,679
to be the extract artist I mean I I did

1826
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:23,520
all that stuff graic designer

1827
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:25,199
packaging I mean I was one of the first

1828
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:27,600
guys and my group of friends that had

1829
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:30,198
like packaging on my on my flower you

1830
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:32,000
know and I had some blueberry back then

1831
01:09:30,198 --> 01:09:35,238
I I made labels for I think I still have

1832
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:37,119
one and that was in like the early 2000s

1833
01:09:35,238 --> 01:09:40,278
yeah so but yeah you had to do

1834
01:09:37,119 --> 01:09:44,079
everything now you can be a specialist

1835
01:09:40,279 --> 01:09:46,400
you can be a perfectionist in one one

1836
01:09:44,079 --> 01:09:48,798
yeah one uh one study so whether you

1837
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:50,439
want to do genetics or you want to do

1838
01:09:48,798 --> 01:09:52,039
extract and you want to you know you do

1839
01:09:50,439 --> 01:09:52,719
a lot of stuff you know it's like with

1840
01:09:52,039 --> 01:09:55,279
the

1841
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:57,480
DJing a lot you know I've got like an

1842
01:09:55,279 --> 01:09:58,960
amazing team behind me with a lot of the

1843
01:09:57,479 --> 01:10:01,718
things that I'm doing you know for these

1844
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:04,640
essential education classes um that I'm

1845
01:10:01,719 --> 01:10:07,679
teaching I've got like a team of graphic

1846
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:12,480
designers and web designers and just a

1847
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:14,719
support system so um I do it a lot but

1848
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:16,839
also I'm trying to be more focused in

1849
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:18,840
what I know I'm good at I am not good at

1850
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:22,119
the back end I'm not good at the graphic

1851
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:24,520
design I'm not good at um you know a lot

1852
01:10:22,119 --> 01:10:26,640
of those things so I've been I think a

1853
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:28,679
big learning point in the industry also

1854
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:30,960
is uh delegation but not overd

1855
01:10:28,679 --> 01:10:32,840
delegating right you know delegating

1856
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:34,399
what you're not good at but if you overd

1857
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:36,560
delegate you can learn a lesson real

1858
01:10:34,399 --> 01:10:38,519
quick because I learned that lesson as a

1859
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:40,760
kid a couple years into the industry you

1860
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:42,320
know honesty is so important not just

1861
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:43,880
with other people but with yourself I

1862
01:10:42,319 --> 01:10:45,238
think you need to people need to take a

1863
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:46,480
hard look in the mirror and realize what

1864
01:10:45,238 --> 01:10:48,959
they're good at and what they're not

1865
01:10:46,479 --> 01:10:51,119
good at and be real about it and focus

1866
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:54,239
on your strengths and you know that's

1867
01:10:51,119 --> 01:10:56,119
that's the best way definitely and yeah

1868
01:10:54,238 --> 01:10:57,919
constantly evolve constantly pivot

1869
01:10:56,119 --> 01:11:00,079
because in this industry and in this

1870
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:01,920
world if you're stagnant if you stuck

1871
01:11:00,079 --> 01:11:05,439
with one thing you're going to get ran

1872
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:07,119
over yeah and you're in the past yeah so

1873
01:11:05,439 --> 01:11:08,919
I think that's another reason I'm I'm

1874
01:11:07,119 --> 01:11:11,279
blessed to still be here is I've

1875
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:13,119
constantly pivoted as the industry is

1876
01:11:11,279 --> 01:11:14,800
evolved yeah and there's nothing wrong

1877
01:11:13,119 --> 01:11:16,800
with Reinventing yourself or whatever I

1878
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:18,560
mean I've seen multiple people douge is

1879
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:20,360
the best example of that douge is

1880
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:22,640
someone who has reinvented

1881
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:24,359
himself several times since I've known

1882
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:26,560
him and freaking comes out on top every

1883
01:11:24,359 --> 01:11:28,519
time and crushes I love douge I've

1884
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:30,320
always supported douge um because Doug's

1885
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:33,600
always been good to me um and I've

1886
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:35,399
always been good to douge um right now

1887
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:37,239
um I'm hoping I'm coming back down here

1888
01:11:35,399 --> 01:11:38,920
to Cali for the best of California but

1889
01:11:37,238 --> 01:11:40,718

I've seen him go through tough times and

1894
01:11:47,279 --> 01:11:51,920
I've seen him on top and he's just he

1895
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:53,159
he's a fighter going though yeah he's a

1896
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:54,480
fighter he's one of those dudes who's

1900
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,600
you know and he's just a really good guy

1901
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:05,279
at the end of the day he's a really good

they air this episode it will be 2024 so

1906
