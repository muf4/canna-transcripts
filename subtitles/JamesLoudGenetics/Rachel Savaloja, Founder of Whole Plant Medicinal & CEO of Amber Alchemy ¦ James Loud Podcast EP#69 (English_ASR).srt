52
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:16,759
you're constantly creating new things

53
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:20,000
and new ideas and you're you're

54
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:21,959
opinionated in a great way and I feel

55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,318
like you always have contributions to

56
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,400
the conversation and you have

57
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:29,238
interesting perspective on a lot of

58
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,560
things that I've done and that uh you

59
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:35,599
know that everybody does thank you James

60
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:37,920
um I love being creative and gosh what

61
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:42,000
you know cannabis is such a creative

62
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:46,238
gift you know and um it's such a a guide

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,959
for being creative and um I love making

64
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,200
formulations ever since I can remember

65
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:55,080
I've been interested in plants and and

66
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:57,280
natural medicine and uh I'm I'm just so

67
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,239
glad to be working with this plant and

68
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,039
and it has so much to offer the world

69
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,799
yeah it does it's it's amazing because

70
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:06,639
what what you put in you get back with

71
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:08,480
cannabis that's definitely yes yeah and

72
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:10,639
I think there's a lot to be said for

73
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,318
owning a cannabis business It's a Grind

74
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:14,598
I feel like you have to be create as a

75
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:16,598
business owner you have to be able to

76
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:17,719
not only be creative and come come up

77
00:03:16,598 --> 00:03:20,679
with something that's different and

78
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:22,878
unique that the world needs but you also

79
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,360
have to grind and you have to work hard

80
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:27,518
and I saw you going around all these

81
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,519
dispensaries and you know putting in the

82
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,158
work and I think there's something to be

83
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,000
said for that and I think the younger

84
00:03:31,158 --> 00:03:35,878
generation is kind of losing some of

85
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,519
that and seeing it it just gets me

86
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:39,399
excited especially about cannabis and

87
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,879
people being successful and you've

88
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,360
you've been successful in your own right

89
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:44,840
with your cannabis businesses and it's a

90
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,959
beautiful thing well James when when you

91
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,560
find that passion in your life it just

92
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,878
makes you so driven to make it happen

93
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:56,438
and uh for me my passion is really truly

94
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:59,479
just to help people and um it has been a

95
00:03:56,438 --> 00:04:01,919
lot of time and energy put into this

96
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:04,359
it's paying off in so many ways and and

97
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:08,318
hearing people's stories you know of of

98
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:10,480
healing and um I I'm just glad to be

99
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:12,078
able to be part of it I feel like that's

100
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:16,079
one of the biggest takeaways from our

101
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:17,759
guests lately is the gratitude for being

102
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,799
part of it and part of this thing that's

103
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,519
so much bigger than ourselves and I

104
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:23,758
think I'm in the same boat I'm just so

105
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,000
grateful to be here and it's like so

106
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,479
amazing having a podcast and having

107
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,360
other guests that are just super

108
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:31,560
grateful and like living in Gra attitude

109
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,439
you know because I think that's half of

110
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,199
it the world's not a great place all the

111
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:39,038
time but there is Beauty and there is

112
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:41,960
greatness going on at all times that's

113
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:43,719
right yeah um everything is sacred

114
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:46,959
everything is special if you look at it

115
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:49,400
in in the right you know mindset and and

116
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:52,279
sitting in gratitude and and reminding

117
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:55,198
ourselves every day and and you know

118
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:58,918
every moment and life can get so tough

119
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:01,840
and um just coming back to being in

120
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:04,399
gratitude can really change things and

121
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:07,599
and help shift things um so that things

122
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:09,079
can flow better for everyone right yeah

123
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,479
well so how did you get started with all

124
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:14,399
this stuff because you were doing it

125
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:17,519
before we met even right yeah um of

126
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:19,519
course I met Marlin because of uh we

127
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:22,959
both are passionate about cannabis

128
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:26,680
absolutely um we met at chalice festival

129
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:29,478
and um but I got started uh you know in

130
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:32,000
2009 a couch Surfer came and stayed with

131
00:05:29,478 --> 00:05:33,560
me at my house for about a week and she

132
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,360
was telling me about this thing called

133
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,439
trimming and how I can make some money

134
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,400
doing that and she was going to go back

135
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:42,680
to Grass Valley and do trimming and

136
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:44,120
that's actually where I grew up and so I

137
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,400
thought you know I'm finishing up

138
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,478
College why not let's go to Burning Man

139
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:52,478
and then go to Grass Valley and go

140
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:55,639
trimming so we started with that and uh

141
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:58,719
got to know a bit about how cannabis is

142
00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:01,120
cultivated and um just got to know the

143
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,560
plant a bit and and started learning

144
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,240
I've always uh I mean I went to school

145
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,720
for Science and my background is science

146
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,840
research so I'm very interested in

147
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:16,160
knowing um what studies have been done

148
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:20,598
with cannabis my my uh passion grew a

149
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:23,160
lot more after my dear family member uh

150
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:27,360
found out that he had a basil cell skin

151
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:29,919
cancer and so um he was going to have to

152
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,400
get a surgery to remove a good chunk of

153
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:35,399
his shoulder like the doctors were

154
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:37,638
saying a golf ball siiz piece and um

155
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:40,478
from there I said hold on a minute let's

156
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:42,439
see what else can we we can find here to

157
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:45,038
help you and then I learned about Rick

158
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:47,199
Simpson and how he was making this oil

159
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:50,000
and he was healing his skin cancer on

160
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:54,439
his face right I was able to acquire

161
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,000
some herbs and and um through YouTube

162
00:06:54,439 --> 00:07:00,038
videos pieced together how to make my

163
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,560
first batch of medicine and um got it to

164
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:06,240
my family member and it actually worked

165
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:09,399
it uh went through a big transformation

166
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,478
um of kind of looking pretty nasty for a

167
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:14,519
while and oozing and peeling but

168
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:17,399
eventually it popped out some white

169
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:21,359
stuff and started healing back and uh

170
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:23,120
from there I I I just really became more

171
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,240
a lot more interested in what this plant

172
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,680
can do and found it is so versatile and

173
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,879
so helpful for so many things right I

174
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,879
mean the proof is out there when you

175
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:33,360
look at it yeah you know there and

176
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:35,840
there's so many great

177
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,400
stories and and maybe it doesn't heal

178
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:42,318
every type of cancer but it definitely

179
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:44,799
helps for a lot of things so many things

180
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,120
yeah and so many more things than the

181
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,199
average medicine I mean there's nothing

182
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,680
that that I know of that has so many

183
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:55,400
profound uses that make the world a

184
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:58,199
better place right yeah I mean our

185
00:07:55,399 --> 00:08:01,239
bodies are designed with this endoc

186
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:04,919
canabo system to process these molecules

187
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:08,400
and when our endoc canabo system is is

188
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:12,079
supported and um toned with with these

189
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:15,038
phyto canabo um all other body systems

190
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:18,439
can come into harmony into balance and

191
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:21,158
um be supported all other organs and and

192
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:24,240
even our brains and in the way that um

193
00:08:21,158 --> 00:08:27,120
we think uh you know it can be in more

194
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:30,280
in better balance and and Harmony um for

195
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:33,519
example CBD and and its ability to help

196
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:36,199
calm anxiety and um depression and and

197
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,360
uplift us yeah it's pretty special and

198
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,278
there's so many cannabinoids we don't

199
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,639
even understand how they all work yet I

200
00:08:40,278 --> 00:08:43,559
mean we're just scratching the surface

201
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:45,199
of it and and I think part of that is

202
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:47,278
because it's so subjective to the

203
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,640
individual because we all work with the

204
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:50,360
plan a little bit differently and it

205
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,120
helps us out in different ways and some

206
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,480
people like stuff that's narcotic and

207
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,480
some people like stuff that's a

208
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,399
stimulant and some people like stuff

209
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,879
that's somewhere in between

210
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:01,639
those and some people use it for

211
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:04,078
anti-inflammatory I mean there's just so

212
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:07,199
many yeah it does have anti-inflammatory

213
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:09,278
properties and it does have amazing

214
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,160
things that are so subjective to the

215
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:15,838
individual yeah definitely you got into

216
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:19,958
it in 2009 and then that evolved into

217
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:24,200
Amber Alchemy so Amber Alchemy started

218
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:28,039
as a collective and um people were able

219
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:31,879
to get uh medicine that would help them

220
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:33,039
and and all these various ways and uh

221
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:36,039
that was in

222
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:38,958
2017 uh I was able to bring products to

223
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:41,838
dispensaries then and uh of course when

224
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:44,479
2019 came um that's when we launched

225
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,920
whole plant medicinals the brand that is

226
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,600
in dispensaries here in California as a

227
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:52,078
licensed uh product yeah we've got uh

228
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,680
three different types of tinctures right

229
00:09:52,078 --> 00:09:57,199
now um that people take sublingually

230
00:09:54,679 --> 00:10:00,239
we've got we've got a daytime a 2:1

231
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:03,920
sativa a 1:1 in

232
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:07,839
uh we're talking ratio of CBD to THC U

233
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:12,319
for nighttime and then a high CBD

234
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:15,079
tincture for just general tonic right

235
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,160
yeah General well-being yes exactly you

236
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:20,278
can take it day or night anytime and you

237
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:21,759
probably feel better yes yeah I think

238
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:23,120
I've tried your tinctures over the years

239
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:25,759
and I think they're amazing and I think

240
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,480
they work really well and you use a full

241
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:33,399
spectrum product some people just put

242
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:35,000
CBD or just THC or they're mono canabo

243
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:37,519
whereas you're into the full spectrum

244
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,759
and I think that's great yeah and it's

245
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:42,519
not just a full spectrum of cannabinoids

246
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:44,519
and Turpin um I see a lot of times in

247
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:47,519
dispensaries products are labeled this

248
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:50,078
way and it might be like a CO2 extracted

249
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:53,560
product and of course it's got all of

250
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:56,319
those wonderful um non-polar canabo and

251
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:59,599
tpin but then we're leaving out all of

252
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,879
the polar molecules the flavonoids still

253
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,440
lignins there's just so many different

254
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:08,000
types of therapeutic pieces here um and

255
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:11,040
it and it just it all has Synergy it all

256
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,240
just works so much better as a whole

257
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:16,679
when when it's kept together and um the

258
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:21,399
solvent that does that the best is

259
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:24,399
alcohol so we use a high proof um grain

260
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:26,320
alcohol 190 proof it's food grade

261
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,360
pharmaceutical grade to do our initial

262
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,240
extractions to make our concentrate oil

263
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,480
actually partnered with a great company

264
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,720
out of Nevada city called um their name

265
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,200
is fluesy and they do all of that

266
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,480
initial extraction and and we make all

267
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,120
of the products right there out of

268
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,079
Nevada City awesome so how do you Source

269
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:47,560
your raw

270
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:50,799
material well um from we we first want

271
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:53,359
to make sure that the flowers are grown

272
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:55,399
um organically and we you know try to

273
00:11:53,360 --> 00:12:00,079
work with regener Farms that are using

274
00:11:55,399 --> 00:12:02,039
regenerative methods um but uh We've

275
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:04,439
we've just worked with a few Farms up in

276
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:07,879
in that Nevada City area locally there

277
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:10,200
to where Flores is a couple of them have

278
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:13,320
actually gone out of business at this

279
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:16,160
point and so it's rough out there yeah

280
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:19,600
yeah unfortunately yes we'll be looking

281
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:22,278
for new um new Farms to work with and

282
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,480
and partner with here again soon uh for

283
00:12:22,278 --> 00:12:26,919
our next batches yeah with legalization

284
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,320
it's it's kind of changed the landscape

285
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:33,159
of everything um for for better and for

286
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,760
worse and I've seen this consolidation

287
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:37,958
phase go yeah we've had a couple

288
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:39,720
consolidation phases but initially First

289
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:41,559
Once the market the product wasn't that

290
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,278
good now we're starting to stabilize but

291
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:44,679
we're going through another

292
00:12:42,278 --> 00:12:47,159
consolidation phase where people are

293
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:49,559
being bought out or they're going out of

294
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:50,639
business and it's making it difficult

295
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:52,879
for

296
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,600
everybody especially the people trying

297
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:56,679
to Source good raw

298
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,440
material you know and I think a lot of

299
00:12:56,679 --> 00:13:00,439
organic organic isn't necessarily the

300
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:04,040
cheapest way to go as far as for

301
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:05,199
creating a product there's it makes it

302
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:07,399
difficult when you're trying to do it

303
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:11,198
the right way sometimes definitely but

304
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:14,360
it's so important I I wish that uh the

305
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:17,319
rest of the Agricultural world had the

306
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:21,399
same types of you know very strict

307
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:23,600
testing requirements and that we weren't

308
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:26,839
allowed to just poison everything and

309
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:30,120
feed it to all the people yeah I'm I'm I

310
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:32,680
am happy about um the standards that are

311
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,639
in place for protecting cannabis

312
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:37,359
medicine and and making sure that at

313
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:39,360
least when you go to The Dispensary you

314
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,639
can be pretty confident that what you're

315
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,240
getting is not going to be contaminated

316
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:46,440
although I've heard people can edit

317
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,759
their tests and stuff too so well I

318
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,199
think they're really cracking down on it

319
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:53,078
and a lot of labs have closed okay but

320
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:55,639
yes I heard that uh people were getting

321
00:13:53,078 --> 00:13:57,519
by with test that weren't real I think

322
00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:00,519
the standardization with

323
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,959
testing uh has a long way to go I think

324
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:03,519
we're making progress and I think

325
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:05,078
there's awareness which is where it all

326
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,839
begins is like okay well we've got a

327
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:09,039
problem how do we fix it and I think

328
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:12,120
that that's happening on the state level

329
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:14,599
um with testing with Labs closing that

330
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,039
aren't doing a proper job and I think

331
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,720
all that stuff should be standardized

332
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:19,958
and it's one of the things we made a

333
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,879
mistake on in the beginning with

334
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:24,758
California was not standardizing the lab

335
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:27,519
testing where we see that know we just

336
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:32,199
talked about it on a podcast I had 45%

337
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:34,198
THC or even even total canono 45% that's

338
00:14:32,198 --> 00:14:37,120
kind of crazy and then you test it a

339
00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:39,439
different lab and it's 25 and

340
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,759
so these things need to be standardized

341
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,560
so it's an even playing field for

342
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:45,240
everybody and also the consumer needs to

343
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:47,000
understand that THC isn't everything

344
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:50,000
because I think so many people are

345
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,839
convinced that high THC is what I want

346
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,480
and if you're a a someone who's new to

347
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,320
the industry new to cannabis you're

348
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,399
looking for some way of telling what's

349
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,879
better than the other products is it the

350
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,320
higher they they assume high THC and

351
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:06,078
really it's almost high turbines would

352
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,320
be better that'd be a better just

353
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:11,399
justification for something if you were

354
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:14,399
going for a number but it's also

355
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:15,919
educating on the dispensary level for

356
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,759
the consumer so when they come in

357
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:18,879
there's an educated person that can give

358
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,800
them good

359
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:25,519
recommendations um I think that's huge

360
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:29,120
definitely and um with the with the

361
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:31,519
testing having an idea of how many

362
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,959
milligrams a person is consuming I mean

363
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,799
you certainly don't want to start

364
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:37,638
somebody out with you know 15 milligrams

365
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:41,198
of THC or something they're going to end

366
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:45,759
up not wanting to try it again right um

367
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:47,599
so yeah dosage is so important and I

368
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:50,278
mean when it comes to tinctures I really

369
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,240
love that you can dial it in and um you

370
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:54,919
know start so much easier to dial in the

371
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,919
flower you know then smoking it's like

372
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:59,479
with that like you if if you tried two

373
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:01,078
milligrams cuz you're scared well you

374
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,959
could try 5 milligrams the next day and

375
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:05,159
might be perfect or maybe you need to go

376
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:07,119
to 10 Mig but you can really and then

377
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:08,679
you're like okay 10 milligrams is cool

378
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,240
and then after a while you're like I

379
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:12,159
have a tolerance so I need to go to a

380
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,919
little bit more and a little bit more

381
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:15,278
but with smoking it's kind of all over

382
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:18,120
the place and you never know what you're

383
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:21,439
going to get necessarily as far as

384
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:23,959
effect yeah each strain can be different

385
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,360
and it could be the same amount of of uh

386
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:28,359
THC and in that joint that you have

387
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,079
there but like the Tarpin are going to

388
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,399
one of them will make you super paranoid

389
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:33,439
and the other one will make you just

390
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:35,958
chill out and fall asleep yeah and I

391
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:40,319
mean I prefer smoking but I think that

392
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:41,479
Edibles and uh consumables like that I

393
00:16:40,318 --> 00:16:42,879
think there's there's a whole bunch of

394
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,319
new products that are out and I think

395
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:47,240
that those things are a blessing too you

396
00:16:45,318 --> 00:16:49,799
know I think like it's all great and

397
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,720
it's so so much for the individual I

398
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:55,318
feel like

399
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,920
smoking is is the best way for my body

400
00:16:55,318 --> 00:16:58,599
for consumption but other people you

401
00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:00,679
know Edibles work and Edibles just kick

402
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,800
my but for the most part like I don't I

403
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:06,438
can't if if I take a 10 milligrams I'm

404
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:08,798
not going to go to sleep like right away

405
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:10,880
so whereas if uh I smoke a big joint I'm

406
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:13,959
gonna be tired and I'll pass right out

407
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,400
sure yep you've got a high tolerance I'm

408
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:17,759
sure right yes absolutely I mean I have

409
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,839
a high tolerance with smoking but with

410
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:21,599
Edibles no like I I I can smoke and

411
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:23,240
smoke and smoke Marlin and I sit there

412
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,399
and smoke an ounce you know and it's

413
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,160
like right we have no problem and and

414
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,759
just puffing and puffing and puffing

415
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:32,279
same thing with Psych

416
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:35,599
but no like high tolerance you know

417
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:38,160
whereas Edibles if I take 10 milligrams

418
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:39,918
I can't necessarily go to sleep that so

419
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,200
it's so much on and your body processes

420
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,480
it different you're getting it processed

421
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,080
through the liver and uh you know I

422
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:50,360
think there's also benefits to that as

423
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:51,839
well like I like thca in the edible form

424
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:54,359
like I think eating it doesn't get me

425
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:56,038
high it makes me feel amazing I get this

426
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:58,519
you know it's it's anti-inflammatory

427
00:17:56,038 --> 00:18:00,519
it's great I'm I'm working with a a lot

428
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:04,639
of people these days that are you know

429
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:08,319
going through cancer treatment and um

430
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:11,320
smoking is I I think ideal for the anti

431
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:13,480
nausea effect because it's just so quick

432
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:16,079
um whereas if you're trying to take a

433
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:18,200
tincture that might bring it on even

434
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:19,480
more you know if you can hold it down

435
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,440
yeah maybe it's going to help you with

436
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,798
the nausea but sometimes it takes me an

437
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,679
hour and a half before I feel the

438
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:27,639
effects of in edible too so I think

439
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,880
tinure your tinure kick in pretty fast

440
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:33,159
actually um if you hold it under the

441
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,600
tongue for a minute that usually and if

442
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:36,960
the other key is you've got to take it

443
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:40,439
on an empty stomach um otherwise it

444
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,919
would delay it for about an hour yeah

445
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,798
yeah whereas if you smoke you feel it

446
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,840
pretty much right away I mean I smoked

447
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:49,000
some creeper for the first time in a

448
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:51,599
while uh it was Mother's weed from or

449
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,359
mom's weed from Huckleberry Hill Farms

450
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:54,678
it was the real creeper is the real deal

451
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:56,959
where you smoke it and you're like I'm

452
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:59,720
not even high I should smoke some more

453
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,919
and then yeah and so I smoked a bunch

454
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:04,200
and then like I sat down and was playing

455
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,919
trivia and I'm like wait a second I'm

456
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,679
super ripped and it you know and it's

457
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:11,038
interesting because there's all these

458
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:12,759
different effects and we're just trying

459
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:15,038
to categorize it all and figure it all

460
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:16,720
out now and I mean I I have fun with

461
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:19,679
that I I think it's amazing I think

462
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,319
we're in an amazing time um you know

463
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,559
it's it's all been amazing up to this

464
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:25,399
point and it's all from here on out it's

465
00:19:23,558 --> 00:19:28,200
only going to get better in some ways

466
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,840
and uh yeah and and more exciting for

467
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,759
sure

468
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:34,678
yes definitely what do you think about

469
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:37,359
like the um the synthetic or not not

470
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:39,400
really synthetic but cannaboids that are

471
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:41,479
extracted from other sources like

472
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:45,360
there's um

473
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:46,960
thcv and like converted from well no

474
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:50,240
there's like some of them are extracted

475
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,840
from like algae sure yeah I don't know I

476
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,919
mean I'm I I used to hate on everything

477
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:56,359
new before I'd understand it fully and

478
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:58,960
so like I'm past that in my life I'm

479
00:19:56,359 --> 00:20:01,199
like I don't know maybe it'll be THC

480
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,798
extracted from algae kind of sounds cool

481
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,919
whether it's going to be the same thing

482
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:07,679
as coming from

483
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:10,400
Cannabis not sure I'm not a huge THV fan

484
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:13,120
anyway personally it's not like my jam

485
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,480
but uh I've heard recently that it's

486
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:18,678
really helpful for neuropathy and so

487
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:21,279
that's why I want I saw stud there was a

488
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:24,840
study that came out last not last year

489
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:27,519
but a couple months ago so yeah I and I

490
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:29,399
think that it's like it's so subjective

491
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,720
again so subjective to the individual

492
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,600
what works for one person you know like

493
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:37,839
I mean I and I like a lot of stuff my

494
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:41,038
spectrum of stuff that I enjoy is really

495
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:43,759
broad I I I would say that I like the

496
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:45,158
gassy stuff I like the ogs but I also

497
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:48,640
like the good sativas I like the good

498
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:50,760
Super Silver Haze and U I like some

499
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,880
really wild stuff that's unique and

500
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:53,400
different and I'm always looking for

501
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,320
that and it excites me trying stuff

502
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,320
that's new but I'll still go back to

503
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:58,599
smoking some Skittles or some gelato

504
00:20:57,319 --> 00:21:00,000
even though people are hating on gelato

505
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:03,158
a lot of these some some people are even

506
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,960
though it's the most popular thing so

507
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:09,600
and it's wild how we do that like we we

508
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:11,840
form these trends like as a society

509
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:13,798
what's what's popular now and

510
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:17,119
unfortunately social media plays this

511
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:19,759
big role in what's popular and a lot of

512
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:21,278
times you can't smell or taste the stuff

513
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:23,960
through the screen so you're like that

514
00:21:21,278 --> 00:21:26,919
looks the best and it's not always the

515
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,640
case you might get purple punch purple

516
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:30,960
punch it looks so good same thing with

517
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,799
Oreos they look so good but then you go

518
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,880
to smoke them and they just they don't

519
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:37,359
do it for them taste-wise effect wise

520
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:40,400
and I mean I think there's a tie in with

521
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:43,798
the taste and the effect but how do you

522
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:46,679
think it relates to tinctures so if we

523
00:21:43,798 --> 00:21:48,400
have something that smells great looks

524
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:51,640
great gets you high great it should turn

525
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,919
into a great tinture or a great uh

526
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,278
consumable edible well yeah I mean as

527
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:59,038
long as it's got plenty of resin in

528
00:21:56,278 --> 00:22:02,440
there then it's going to make you know

529
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:05,440
good cannabis oil um when I'm when I'm

530
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:08,038
picking strains for tinctures I'm

531
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,600
looking for you know Tarpin that are

532
00:22:08,038 --> 00:22:13,400
going to give me the in effects that

533
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:16,519
most people are looking for um I need a

534
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:19,960
good strong Indica um I really like

535
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:22,679
Northern Lights and AFU for that effect

536
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:25,880
um so I'll you know have help people to

537
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:28,000
seek those kind of strains out uh for I

538
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,559
need a good after so if you know anybody

539
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,720
cuz I haven't had AFU in a long time I

540
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:35,519
love that sweet AFU yeah uh yeah really

541
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,919
good that was the whitest stuff back in

542
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:40,240
the day I remember the first time I saw

543
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:41,880
it in somoma and it was just caked and I

544
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,079
thought it was fake looked like a

545
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:47,520
flocked Christmas tree yep and um

546
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:49,798
sativas I mean I like blue dream um I

547
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:51,759
know you had a podcast recently talking

548
00:22:49,798 --> 00:22:55,519
about it for a second but uh I think

549
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:57,440
it's just a really gentle sativa that um

550
00:22:55,519 --> 00:23:00,960
can help people get into that creative

551
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:04,200
space and and uh feel good and and get a

552
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:07,720
little bit of an appetite going and yeah

553
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:11,240
um like like banana strains and hazes

554
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:14,360
for sativas for sure I to like sativas

555
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:16,000
better than anything you like ban I do I

556
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:17,678
I love bananas in fact I made a whole

557
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,480
bunch of bananas Marlin and I are going

558
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,759
to be going to the Caribbean later this

559
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:26,599
year and gifting some of these crosses

560
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:29,599
that are very exclusive to uh St Vincent

561
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:31,959
and the grenad and uh yeah we are going

562
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:34,079
to be sharing these genetics that we

563
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:38,720
made specifically for them and I love

564
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:41,720
banana and I mean the they're their uh

565
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:44,519
economy was was focused on bananas their

566
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,519
economy was built around bananas the

567
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:49,440
great match huh yeah I think being able

568
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:51,798
to gift banana in the form of cannabis

569
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,240
back to them I think is an amazing thing

570
00:23:51,798 --> 00:23:54,359
and Marlin and I made a promise when we

571
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,599
were there last time that we were going

572
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:59,319
to come back with some banana crosses

573
00:23:56,599 --> 00:24:01,879
and we have them and so so we imported

574
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:04,319
seeds legally into the country one of

575
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:06,080
our last visits MH and that was an

576
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:08,839
amazing experience the people are just

577
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:10,599
so so amazing and so nice there and you

578
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:14,038
know they just went through a really bad

579
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:16,399
hurricane and so they they seem to have

580
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:18,400
the the the problems as far as they they

581
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,000
had a earth not earthquake they had a

582
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,798
volcano a couple years ago right yeah it

583
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,640
was a crazy volcano and then they just

584
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:29,240
had a hurricane and it's it's a

585
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:32,278
beautiful country beautiful island small

586
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:34,960
it's got small Vibe small it has that

587
00:24:32,278 --> 00:24:39,960
that Vibe of a small place with amazing

588
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:41,919
people and you know it was one of the

589
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:44,240
experiences where I got to experience

590
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,480
poverty on a different level and it made

591
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,839
me realize how grateful I am for what we

592
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,399
have and the people were just so nice

593
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:53,158
and you know the kids had never there

594
00:24:50,398 --> 00:24:55,158
was kids that had never had shoes before

595
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:57,880
and I have never met kids that had never

596
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:59,799
had shoes and it made me feel sad in

597
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:03,200
some ways but in other

598
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:06,359
ways I saw that they were so happy with

599
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,759
so little and sometimes it takes

600
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:10,199
experiences like that for you to step

601
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:12,200
back and go man it's like it's not about

602
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,360
these material things that we have

603
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,319
sometimes happiness can come from inside

604
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:18,519
it can come from family it can come from

605
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:21,839
other things and even when things aren't

606
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:23,720
working out we can still be happy yeah

607
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:25,759
and you know they are probably so much

608
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,919
more grounded and connected to this

609
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:31,200
earth not having this piece of rubber in

610
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:32,640
between them in the in the dirt right

611
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,840
yeah there's something to be said for

612
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,399
grounding and to be you know to be

613
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:38,879
connected to the Earth like that yeah um

614
00:25:37,398 --> 00:25:40,038
you know and they were you know they

615
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,960
used to make fun of all the hippies

616
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:43,599
doing it in the 60s and 70s and now it's

617
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,480
like turning out we got scientists

618
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:46,918
talking about how valuable grounding is

619
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,480
yeah now they come out with like sheets

620
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:51,240
to put on your bed to plug into your

621
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,919
wall to ground your bed totally yeah and

622
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:55,519
it's it's funny how you know we were

623
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,200
saying that butter was bad and then

624
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:58,918
margarine is bad and now margarine is

625
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,880
bad and Butter's good

626
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:02,480
which is true I mean it's it's funny how

627
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,278
they push that agenda for a long time

628
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,640
about margarine being good and healthy

629
00:26:04,278 --> 00:26:08,440
and it's like that's not but so many

630
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,440
things that are synthetic aren't

631
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:12,679
necessarily good and so many th you know

632
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,159
and but we're still all just figuring

633
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:18,399
all this science stuff out it's kind of

634
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:20,760
wild it certainly is and um you know I a

635
00:26:18,398 --> 00:26:23,398
lot of the people that are are seeking

636
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:27,158
my advice I I do coaching like health

637
00:26:23,398 --> 00:26:30,119
health coaching um and definitely bring

638
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:33,600
in cannabis medic into the

639
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:36,599
conversation um but just what people are

640
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:39,038
going through and in their health and

641
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:41,158
how we're just so bombarded every day

642
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:44,079
with chemicals in our food and our air

643
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:46,840
and the clothes we wear and the the

644
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:48,798
lotions and shampoos and it's in our

645
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:50,319
furniture and it's pretty amazing we're

646
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:52,720
still alive it's amazing and these

647
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:55,439
bodies are just keep keep on going we're

648
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:59,120
so resilient we are and there's more

649
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:02,159
poison and toxins than ever before in in

650
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:05,359
human history and we're able to adapt to

651
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:08,360
them to a degree and find

652
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:12,199
homeostasis not all of us but some of us

653
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:15,558
and uh yeah and it's just it's wild how

654
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:18,480
we can adapt to almost

655
00:27:15,558 --> 00:27:21,678
anything yeah it is I mean our oceans

656
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:24,599
are completely poison yeah the food we

657
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,960
eat has a tenth of the nutrition that it

658
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:29,519
did you know especially

659
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:32,038
vegetables uh yeah it's it's a strange

660
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:33,679
time to be alive but you know if you're

661
00:27:32,038 --> 00:27:36,079
looking at it from that perspective it's

662
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:38,600
like it's amazing that we're here yeah

663
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:41,439
but it's amazing how resilient the human

664
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:44,158
body is and how we can kind of adapt and

665
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,600
evolve in plant medicine you know we

666
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,200
went away from plant medicine for a long

667
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:49,798
time and now we're going back into plant

668
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,080
medicine the awareness is coming back

669
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:53,480
right so we're starting to be aware of

670
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:55,199
it and I it all starts with awareness

671
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,599
and if we can become aware of it then we

672
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,480
can start researching it we can do

673
00:27:56,599 --> 00:28:01,158
something about it and now we have this

674
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:04,399
amazing

675
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:06,679
tool the internet communication and

676
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:08,959
Technology to where we can research

677
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:11,840
stuff at a far greater and faster rate

678
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,480
than we ever could before and if used

679
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:16,278
correctly it's an amazing thing it can

680
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,679
also be used incorrectly and totally

681
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:21,919
mess people

682
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:23,240
up yeah and um I find it's so helpful

683
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,000
for people when they're becoming their

684
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:27,200
own advocates for their health you know

685
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,038
and and they don't want to go with the

686
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,480
the mainstream way and just you know be

687
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:37,119
funneled through this Health Care System

688
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:39,640
right um and uh they can go online and

689
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:41,879
in and find for themselves you know

690
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:44,080
plants and supplements that are going to

691
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:47,960
help support their bodies or detox their

692
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:51,359
bodies and and uh methods to do all of

693
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:54,679
it it's all at their fingertips and um

694
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:57,479
it's really wonderful that that's exist

695
00:28:54,679 --> 00:29:00,080
for sure yeah I mean there's so many

696
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,798
things that are blessing anac curse yeah

697
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:03,720
I mean I think used in moderation so

698
00:29:01,798 --> 00:29:06,158
many of these things can be

699
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,440
good so many things done correctly can

700
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,559
be good and so many things used

701
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:13,200
incorrectly can be bad I mean cannabis

702
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:15,839
being legal finally well it's not

703
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,679
finally federally legal but

704
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:21,599
it's rescheduled yeah what a Twist to

705
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:24,000
all this rescheduling now too that's

706
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:26,558
going to change things for dispensaries

707
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,839
right we don't know we don't know fully

708
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:31,158
yet I think we we assume a lot but that

709
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:33,639
doesn't mean anything because I feel

710
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:34,720
like they're talking about oh the taxes

711
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,640
they're potentially going to change and

712
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:40,240
all this stuff I don't think Uncle Sam

713
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:42,200
is gonna go away from wanting his kick

714
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:46,120
you know his I think Uncle Sam is always

715
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:48,240
gonna want his piece uh taxation is

716
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:49,879
tough I think there's over taxation in

717
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,120
the Cannabis industry right now what are

718
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:54,880
you talking about yeah it's taxed on

719
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:58,479
every step and yeah Uncle Sam gets his

720
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:00,480
piece and I think if we kind of

721
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,480
change the tax structure it would make

722
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,640
it easier for small businesses to

723
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,278
survive and I think that's the biggest

724
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,559
takeaway that I have from all this is

725
00:30:06,278 --> 00:30:11,759
like small businesses are the ones that

726
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:14,639
get affected the most uh that are trying

727
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:17,798
to go and survive in the legal you know

728
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,038
cannabis industry across the board and

729
00:30:17,798 --> 00:30:21,918
so these are the things that got to

730
00:30:19,038 --> 00:30:24,240
change for small business and and the

731
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:26,480
thing is is like big companies they can

732
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,480
survive yeah and it's not even just for

733
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:31,720
cannabis small businesses it's for small

734
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:34,679
businesses across the board I mean how

735
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:37,759
how this uh country is taxing everybody

736
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:39,159
just to put everybody at barely poverty

737
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:42,079
level you know

738
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:45,240
is uh yeah it's the same with cannabis

739
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:47,278
though yeah it's it's worse yeah but but

740
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:49,960
it's still the same it's it's on the

741
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:52,759
same side but it's it's rough and yeah

742
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:55,519
the taxation just kills people and

743
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:56,679
unfortunately so and I believe in taxes

744
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:59,599
I believe

745
00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:02,120
in paying to the to the government to a

746
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:03,839
degree I believe in paying taxes so that

747
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:06,359
we can make the world a better place

748
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:08,158
like I think yes that perspective take

749
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:10,519
the boxes on what we want to have our

750
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,919
taxes go toward that would great then

751
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:13,798
the world would really make some

752
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,278
positive change huh yeah well because

753
00:31:13,798 --> 00:31:17,839
use correctly taxes could potentially

754
00:31:16,278 --> 00:31:21,079
make the world a better place the whole

755
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:22,439
that's the whole concept is right so uh

756
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:24,599
well and same thing with traffic

757
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,240
violations you know they if you if you

758
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:28,719
get a ticket it should be going for

759
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,759
making the roads better but instead now

760
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,000
they've got all these things and this is

761
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:35,759
all crazy politics I hate talking about

762
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,519
politics but you know this is one of

763
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:41,440
those Wild Things paying taxes is um one

764
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:43,079
of the things about owning a business

765
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,399
that just makes me sometimes not even

766
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:48,678
want to own a business because I do not

767
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:51,000
like the way they're used and I and I

768
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:52,480
don't want to feed into that system but

769
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,880
if you don't then you can't run your

770
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:58,200
business so right it's to catch 22 Yeah

771
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,639
so I don't know what the solution is

772
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:03,240
either you know I think it starts at the

773
00:32:00,638 --> 00:32:05,158
bottom yeah they say it starts at the

774
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:08,200
top but it starts at the bottom and it

775
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:09,760
starts with small change in but just

776
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,759
tough it's tough being a small business

777
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:15,599
owner in this day and age 50 years ago

778
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:18,798
it was all about small business you know

779
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:20,439
but that slowly went away so and

780
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:22,119
cannabis too it starts out you know with

781
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,960
all these small businesses that get

782
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:25,398
Consolidated into bigger businesses into

783
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:28,120
bigger businesses and then we're left

784
00:32:25,398 --> 00:32:32,199
with the big four or the big three or

785
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:35,319
the big five sure yeah let's dive back

786
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:37,519
into your companies um so you got

787
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:39,960
started with the dispensaries and then

788
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,798
you're across uh how many dispensaries

789
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,159
in

790
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:46,240
California you know we're mostly

791
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:49,240
focusing right now around uh regionally

792
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:52,319
around the Nevada City area branching

793
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:55,919
out to Sacramento and up to like Taho

794
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:58,359
and and Chico right now we're about to

795
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:01,120
um look for more distribution

796
00:32:58,359 --> 00:33:03,079
options yeah so let's talk about the the

797
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:05,278
hustle part of of what you've done

798
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:07,439
because I saw you hustling and a lot of

799
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:08,519
people don't understand how it works

800
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,519
going

801
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:13,359
into uh cannabis working with

802
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:16,798
dispensaries and I saw you going to the

803
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:19,719
dispensaries showing up you would uh

804
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:21,278
educate and you did it over and over and

805
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,839
you were constantly doing deliveries and

806
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:27,200
I think that's one of the things that

807
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:31,480
impresses me the most about you is that

808
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:34,240
energy that you had and you know I think

809
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:37,120
you you went to so many dispensaries in

810
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,759
the area es even down here in the bay

811
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:41,599
yeah you know you want to show your face

812
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:44,759

company and why they should support

814
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:50,759
those products and um make it really

815
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:54,159
easy for them to share that information

816
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:56,679

821
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,878

822
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,918
didn't quite know how to you know what

823
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:14,319
direction to point them um so that was a

824
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:16,918
lot of the you know the educational

825
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:19,559
piece and and letting them know like you

826
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:22,918
know how much do you give a certain per

827
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:24,799
a certain person or which products to

828
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:28,039
recommend when you can't give out free

829
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:30,359
samples in Califoria unfortunately it'

830
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:32,800
be great if you could yeah it would be

831
00:34:30,358 --> 00:34:34,679
great so yeah they made it hard for us

832
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,960
you can't smell the product I mean I

833
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:39,639
guess you can yeah now I can't even go

834
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,440
transport my own company's product to

835
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:44,838
The Dispensary at this point so I just

836
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:47,280
have to hire the Distribution Company to

837
00:34:44,838 --> 00:34:49,440
deliver your samples and all on

838
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,960
manifests and gets charged in taxed and

839
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:55,358
all that good stuff yep yep yeah we

840
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:59,199
donate to um compassion programs as well

841
00:34:55,358 --> 00:35:02,078
you know um uh there's a dispensary in

842
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:03,639
Nevada City called elevation and uh

843
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:07,000
they've got a great program where

844
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:08,598
monthly people who are you know in need

845
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,079
of product and but don't have the

846
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:14,119
financial ability to support that they

847
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:18,160
can go in and get some tinctures or

848
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:21,160
concentrate oils and that's great yeah

849
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:22,679
yeah I think giving back is so huge uh

850
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:25,358
for for people especially they can't

851
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:26,519
afford medicine so and unfortunately the

852
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:29,199
medicine's not

853
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:31,159
free um but when you're able to give

854
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:32,598
back you should give back and I think

855
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:37,399
that just goes across the board with

856
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:40,599
everything definitely yeah um when

857
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:43,000
you H you know in in life I've been

858
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:45,079
really depleted financially and I

859
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,960
remember saying okay this is like my

860
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:50,720
last uh money here but more you know

861
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:53,720
knowing that more is going to come and

862
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:55,679
um just still being giving with uh you

863
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:58,639
know maybe at that time I don't didn't

864
00:35:55,679 --> 00:36:00,639
have work so I go and I and I you know

865
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:02,639
donate my time I help people and it

866
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:05,078
always comes back and it always just

867
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:08,039
life supports you when when you're

868
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:09,920
giving back and and yeah I mean I think

869
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:11,800
some people give up and I think that's

870
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,480
the difference between the successful

871
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,280
people and the people that don't make it

872
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:17,639
sometimes you just can't give up you

873
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,280
just got and even when it's the the

874
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:21,279
toughest or the hardest and you think

875
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:25,280
it's all falling apart sometimes it's

876
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:28,119
just one more day or one more week and

877
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,440
it's all going to be okay

878
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:31,760
my biggest takeaway is that it's all

879
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,760
going to be okay anyway in the end it's

880
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,000
all okay yes yes so yeah let's talk

881
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,280
about the Caribbean because I know

882
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,119
you've gone on multiple vacations to

883
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,880

884
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:45,680

of differences from my rostar husband

really good at that yeah he yeah he does

898
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:28,318
that with me I feel the same it's like

899
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,599

900
00:37:28,318 --> 00:37:32,400
he just you know you just need to

901
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:34,880

00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:40,358

you to find and you know maybe even a

929

940
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,639
takes a lot of effort and believing in

941
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:16,000
yourself even when other people

942
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:17,440

people around you I think that's so

important with with everything in life

945
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:22,440
you want to surround yourself with good

946
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:25,159
people yeah because the wrong people can

947
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:28,639
steer you the the wrong way that's for

948
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:33,358
sure and um in those times it's like you

949
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:36,879
just got to let them pass through and uh

950
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:39,000
focus on everything else and all all of

951
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,838
the other beautiful things that you want

952
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,599
to create in your life are just going to

953
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:48,960
Blossom while everything else just um

954
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:52,119
passes by yeah yeah just uh not to give

955
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:55,920
it our energy and allow it to take hold

956
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:58,358
on us yeah totally yeah feeding into bad

957
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,159
energy and it's easy to to do it's so

958
00:39:58,358 --> 00:40:02,920
it's it's almost easier to feed into

959
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:05,679
stuff sometimes definitely than ignore

960
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:07,318
it or to just let it pass by you know

961
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:09,000
it's like I've learned from social media

962
00:40:07,318 --> 00:40:11,079
and it's like people you know sometime

963
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,239
you just ignore stuff but yeah so let's

964
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:16,839
talk about genetics and and cannabis

965
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:18,439

flavor all the way through you know

974
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:43,440
sometime I I'm not even like I don't

975
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:45,800
even know if I'm so strain specific like

976
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,240
oh I really love these ones sometimes I

977
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:50,519
don't even really pay attention it's

978
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:53,318
just like it smells good and and it's

979
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:57,519
burning well you know that it's it

980
00:40:53,318 --> 00:40:59,039
doesn't have a bunch of um fertiliz is

981
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:02,280
are nutrients still in it if it's

982
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:04,000
burning clean um that's the main thing

983
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:06,319
I'm looking for when I'm

984
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,239
smoking what are your thoughts on the

985
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:13,639
rollant I like them yeah yeah yeah I

986
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:16,279
used to kind of hate on Marlin about it

987
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:20,318
like come on get rid of the tobacco you

988
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:23,920
know such a Caribbean thing yeah yeah I

989
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:28,279
I like the camouflage that's fun and

990
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:30,559
uh I like the the smoothness of of the

991
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:32,480
pole when when you have that filter on

992
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:36,679
there and the tobacco is such a nice

993
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:39,318
match with cannabis just I smoke those

994
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:43,078
these days as well a little tobacco

995
00:41:39,318 --> 00:41:45,440
mixed in yeah yeah I don't smoke tobacco

996
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:47,839
if I can help it but uh you know when

997
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,318
I'm down in the Caribbean like whatever

998
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:52,719
what I'll smoke whatever but yeah I try

999
00:41:49,318 --> 00:41:54,358
not to smoke tobacco um I smoked tobacco

1000
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:57,719
for a long time I smoked cigarettes a

1001
00:41:54,358 --> 00:42:00,880
long time ago yeah but uh not anymore

1002
00:41:57,719 --> 00:42:03,959
and I give me a good cigar I like cigars

1003
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:05,680
I'll smoke cigars but uh tobacco and

1004
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,559
weed I have friends that do the bong rip

1005
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:10,480
with the

1006
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:12,480
tobacco not my jam necessarily yeah yeah

1007
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,318
so although and I know and I don't smoke

1008
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,358
every day either I smoke probably a

1009
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:19,358
couple times a week yeah well being

1010
00:42:16,358 --> 00:42:21,920
around Marlin you yeah it's um it's

1011
00:42:19,358 --> 00:42:24,480
tough because I mean I I love the the

1012
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:27,318
smell and it sure you know makes me want

1013
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:31,760
to go roll one up myself when he's out

1014
00:42:27,318 --> 00:42:36,119
there three four times an hour an hour

1015
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:37,599
right yeah um yeah but uh I've been

1016
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:41,960
trying to just be a little more

1017
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:43,800
intentional about it as well and um I

1018
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:45,119
mean right now I'm on a path of really

1019
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,880
like

1020
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:52,079
uncovering you know my my true purpose

1021
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:55,160
in life and and um just trying to be a

1022
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:58,240
good leader and uh for my daughter you

1023
00:42:55,159 --> 00:43:00,078
know and um

1024
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:02,598
just discovering more about myself

1025
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:04,480
releasing things that don't serve me and

1026
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:07,359
cannabis and being in meditation with

1027
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:11,679
cannabis can really help me to see those

1028
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:14,880
things and um you know help Shake It Off

1029
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:18,159
and and and move energy that I I don't

1030
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,559
want to have Clinging On to me in my

1031
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:23,679
life well cannabis is so special too

1032
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:27,680
because I feel like uh it reveals you to

1033
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:29,919
yourself sometimes and sometimes we're

1034
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:33,039
[ __ ] or sometimes

1035
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:34,480
we're uh you know we we see ourselves

1036
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:36,400
different than how we really are but

1037
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:39,358
sometimes when you smoke I know I'm that

1038
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,400
way when I smoke I reveal my and I think

1039
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:42,639
that's why some people don't like

1040
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:45,599
smoking too it's because it reveals them

1041
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:47,159
to themselves sure and uh but but I love

1042
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,800
that part about cannabis is it kind of

1043
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:51,159
puts the world back into

1044
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:54,000
perspective and so same thing with

1045
00:43:51,159 --> 00:43:55,799
psychedelics and same thing with other

1046
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,838
forms of plant medicine they kind of

1047
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:01,480
reveal you to your self in a way that

1048
00:43:58,838 --> 00:44:04,440
only they can do yes so and then it's

1049
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:06,719
just about remembering right exactly

1050
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:09,240
exactly then it's just about remembering

1051
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:12,000
yeah so CA because ego is ego is a son

1052
00:44:09,239 --> 00:44:14,199
of a [ __ ] to be honest ego is tough and

1053
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:18,280
we're we're fighting ego every

1054
00:44:14,199 --> 00:44:19,159
day uh you know and and the world we

1055
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:23,440
live

1056
00:44:19,159 --> 00:44:24,838
in is based on ego and material objects

1057
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:28,599
and all these

1058
00:44:24,838 --> 00:44:31,759
things uh it's all based around ego and

1059
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:34,519
having these things and sometimes going

1060
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,960
away from that and and you know smoking

1061
00:44:34,519 --> 00:44:37,639
lots of weed I think that kind of puts

1062
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:40,480
the world back into perspective for some

1063
00:44:37,639 --> 00:44:42,480
people for me especially I think living

1064
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,599
in gratitude being grateful for stuff

1065
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,920
that's always you can't go wrong there

1066
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:48,519
right you know if you can count your

1067
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:50,079
blessings every day or say positive

1068
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:52,280
things because I think positive

1069
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:54,400
affirmation for what we're doing like if

1070
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:57,480
we're able to give ourselves not just

1071
00:44:54,400 --> 00:45:00,200
giving it to others because I think it's

1072
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:02,760
easy to give positive affirmation and

1073
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:05,239
positive uh words to others sometimes we

1074
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:07,400
just need to do it to ourselves and

1075
00:45:05,239 --> 00:45:11,078
remind ourselves that we're good people

1076
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:15,519
too and we're okay uh so many people get

1077
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:17,599
down on themselves yeah yeah and uh just

1078
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:20,679
keep repeating those thoughts and

1079
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:23,240
stories that we have about ourselves and

1080
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:27,279
about others that really give us all of

1081
00:45:23,239 --> 00:45:29,519
the suffering you know yeah yeah well

1082
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,240
and and pain and suffering is good too I

1083
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:34,199
think people want to stay away from it

1084
00:45:31,239 --> 00:45:37,358
they're scared of hard work especially

1085
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:39,159
like a lot of people are scared of um

1086
00:45:37,358 --> 00:45:41,480
pain and they they don't want their

1087
00:45:39,159 --> 00:45:43,759
children to suffer I think that's just a

1088
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:47,079
natural instinct right and but a lot of

1089
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:49,160
stuff is so much reality is so much the

1090
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:52,119
opposite of what we think sometimes and

1091
00:45:49,159 --> 00:45:54,000
we don't want our children to suffer yet

1092
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:57,240
we want them to experience enough pain

1093
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,280
so they can appreciate how good they

1094
00:45:57,239 --> 00:46:02,639
have it when it's good understanding

1095
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:04,000
Duality and uh so counterintuitive the

1096
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:05,799
world we live in is just so

1097
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,039
counterintuitive and it's a lot of stuff

1098
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:11,400
is the opposite of how we think it is

1099
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:13,719
you know from from one

1100
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:15,440
perspective but uh you know and it's

1101
00:46:13,719 --> 00:46:18,118
amazing I just having these

1102
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:20,960
conversations is great definitely yeah

1103
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:23,519
um it it can be so the opposite and a

1104
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,720
lot of times I'll have stories you know

1105
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:29,519
that that are creating shaping the way

1106
00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:31,959
I'm viewing a situation or a person and

1107
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:33,838
and ask five other people and they all

1108
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:35,880
have a a completely different

1109
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:38,480
perspective of the same thing and so

1110
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:40,880
what is real reality is how you see it I

1111
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,760
guess yeah right and and there's

1112
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,200
multiple realities because it's however

1113
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:46,680
you see it through your lens right and

1114
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:48,078
based on the experiences you've had in

1115
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:51,399
your life you see it differently through

1116
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:52,880
those lenses and so one person's reality

1117
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:56,599
can be completely different from another

1118
00:46:52,880 --> 00:47:00,200
person's and uh yeah it's and and it

1119
00:46:56,599 --> 00:47:02,039
goes on and on and on and so there's 7.5

1120
00:47:00,199 --> 00:47:03,519
billion different realities going on all

1121
00:47:02,039 --> 00:47:05,679
at the same time and we're part of this

1122
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:07,280
Collective Consciousness it's so much

1123
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:09,519
greater than ourselves and we're so

1124
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,880
interconnected and we want to separate

1125
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:14,280
ourselves but we're really all tied in

1126
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:17,800
together in this bigger fight right we

1127
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:20,640
are one and we need to realize that and

1128
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:22,599
yeah just start working together and

1129
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:24,358
building this beautiful world back up

1130
00:47:22,599 --> 00:47:26,960
into what it's supposed to be and we're

1131
00:47:24,358 --> 00:47:29,400
both Finnish American oh yes so yeah

1132
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:32,318
that's great heritage great heritage

1133
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:33,720
strong people strong willed people uh

1134
00:47:32,318 --> 00:47:35,400
some of the strongest willed people I

1135
00:47:33,719 --> 00:47:37,239
know I mean I'm speaking for my father

1136
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:40,838
he's he's the strongest willed person I

1137
00:47:37,239 --> 00:47:43,479
know in some ways uh yeah it's it's

1138
00:47:40,838 --> 00:47:47,838
amazing and I think our heritage is

1139
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:49,838
great having having that I think uh you

1140
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:53,960
know but but also realizing that we're

1141
00:47:49,838 --> 00:47:56,159
part of the bigger picture too so if you

1142
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:58,800
had one piece of advice for your younger

1143
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:00,399
self or for your daughter that wants to

1144
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,359
go into the Cannabis

1145
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:05,240
industry what would that one piece of

1146
00:48:02,358 --> 00:48:09,159
advice be to really just follow your

1147
00:48:05,239 --> 00:48:12,598
intuition because so many times I've

1148
00:48:09,159 --> 00:48:16,039
I've made a choice that I knew inside

1149
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:17,680
wasn't the right way to go with it um I

1150
00:48:16,039 --> 00:48:21,119
was hopeful that it was the right way to

1151
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:24,358
go with it but um I ended up you know

1152
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:26,800
really losing out on a lot of you know

1153
00:48:24,358 --> 00:48:30,480
time invested into a certain

1154
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:33,240
relationship or um financial investments

1155
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:36,159
and um if I would have just listened to

1156
00:48:33,239 --> 00:48:39,199
that inner voice um and moved a little

1157
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:41,039
slower a lot of times just was trying to

1158
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:44,558
get there first and like get on the

1159
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:48,639
Shelf before somebody else and and

1160
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:52,880
um that might that may have set me back

1161
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:56,199
in the end yeah nice so going at your

1162
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:58,200
own pace but um just remembering always

1163
00:48:56,199 --> 00:49:00,159
why you're doing this and and having

1164
00:48:58,199 --> 00:49:05,279
that at the center of everything that

1165
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:06,838
you do in in your work yeah right so you

1166
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,359
had some stories you want to share about

1167
00:49:06,838 --> 00:49:11,440
some of the people that you've worked

1168
00:49:08,358 --> 00:49:12,798
with over the years sure yeah I'd love

1169
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:16,838
to

1170
00:49:12,798 --> 00:49:20,920
um see I'll start with a a dear friend

1171
00:49:16,838 --> 00:49:23,400
of mine um her father was going through

1172
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:25,760
late stages of dementia he was at the

1173
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:29,039
point where he couldn't hardly speak

1174
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:32,440
anymore he would just kind of repeat the

1175
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:35,199
same couple of words and Mumble and be

1176
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:37,760
hunched over in his chair we started

1177
00:49:35,199 --> 00:49:43,919
working with him with only full spectrum

1178
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:47,079
CBD tincture and within a few days he

1179
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:50,200
started being able to um put put

1180
00:49:47,079 --> 00:49:53,640
sentences together and um ask for you

1181
00:49:50,199 --> 00:49:56,759
know what he was needing and then after

1182
00:49:53,639 --> 00:49:59,078
a couple of weeks he started

1183
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:02,359
going back into being able to tell

1184
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:04,318
stories again he he said to his daughter

1185
00:50:02,358 --> 00:50:08,880
come sit by me I want to tell you about

1186
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:11,558
my dear friend back in 19 so and so this

1187
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:13,200
guy was a big influence on my life for

1188
00:50:11,559 --> 00:50:17,200
this reason and this reason and he

1189
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:19,358
totally came back and uh was able to be

1190
00:50:17,199 --> 00:50:23,879
present for the last couple of years of

1191
00:50:19,358 --> 00:50:26,239
his life um so that was really special

1192
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:27,920
um and I just that's happened a few

1193
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:30,959
times with with people who have been

1194
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:33,960
going through dementia it just helps

1195
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:36,000
reignite the brain and and recover their

1196
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:37,318
ability to think and communicate again

1197
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,679
and and

1198
00:50:37,318 --> 00:50:44,079
remember and

1199
00:50:39,679 --> 00:50:46,960
um uh I've also worked with uh you know

1200
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:50,440
guiding some some parents with um a

1201
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:53,240
child who was autistic I mean is

1202
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:56,679
autistic um

1203
00:50:53,239 --> 00:51:01,239
non-verbal within a few months of taking

1204
00:50:56,679 --> 00:51:03,919
the oil he was singing within uh you

1205
00:51:01,239 --> 00:51:06,558
know a few months later he was learning

1206
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:10,720
another language on the computer and

1207
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:13,280
being able to speak both um I think the

1208
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:16,480
N the native language was Portuguese and

1209
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:18,680
then he started learning um English on

1210
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:22,719
on the computer and and it totally

1211
00:51:18,679 --> 00:51:25,719
changed his life wow um I've worked with

1212
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:31,039
people who have used cannabis medicine

1213
00:51:25,719 --> 00:51:33,000
alone um to completely recover from

1214
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:37,558
cancer

1215
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:43,079
um uh lymphoma is is one

1216
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:47,480
um uh as as a support and um you know in

1217
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:50,640
conjunction with with like uh another uh

1218
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:53,318
what was it immunotherapy another client

1219
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:55,519
of mine used cannabis oil and Amun

1220
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:58,558
theapy and their doctors were blown away

1221
00:51:55,519 --> 00:52:00,079
by their progress were able to uh

1222
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:01,280
eventually get to be completely

1223
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:05,039
cancer-free

1224
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:06,559
and um and the doctor said theotherapy

1225
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:08,358
wasn't supposed to do that it was just

1226
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:09,640
supposed to help stabilize things and

1227
00:52:08,358 --> 00:52:13,798
give you some more

1228
00:52:09,639 --> 00:52:15,719
time um wow I've worked with people who

1229
00:52:13,798 --> 00:52:17,280
are on high blood pressure medications

1230
00:52:15,719 --> 00:52:19,798
and that's an easy one just you know

1231
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:23,720
being able to stabilize and regulate

1232
00:52:19,798 --> 00:52:26,759
blood pressure um one client of mine her

1233
00:52:23,719 --> 00:52:28,439
husband was having a very high blood

1234
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:31,359
pressure was they were about to go to

1235
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:34,200
the emergency room they put some CBD oil

1236
00:52:31,358 --> 00:52:36,480
under his tongue and within 20 minutes

1237
00:52:34,199 --> 00:52:38,919
he was able to actually start feeling a

1238
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:40,960
little better within an hour the blood

1239
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:43,159
pressure was completely normal again and

1240
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,960
they didn't have to go to the hospital

1241
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:49,000
um but just getting people off of

1242
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:51,318
medications pain meds especially um even

1243
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:54,280
anti-inflammatories IDs getting people

1244
00:52:51,318 --> 00:52:57,000
off end heads because I think besides

1245
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:58,798
you know the hard stuff is as far as the

1246
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,559
opiate type pain medications a lot of

1247
00:52:58,798 --> 00:53:03,159
people use n heads for everything yeah

1248
00:53:01,559 --> 00:53:04,839
they got this pain in their necks they

1249
00:53:03,159 --> 00:53:07,078
take a anti-inflammatory they take a

1250
00:53:04,838 --> 00:53:09,239
ibuprofen or they take this or they take

1251
00:53:07,079 --> 00:53:12,039
that and there's nothing wrong with

1252
00:53:09,239 --> 00:53:13,679
using those occasionally but over time

1253
00:53:12,039 --> 00:53:16,159
they build up in your system and they're

1254
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:19,199
really really bad for you yep it clog up

1255
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:22,000
your liver and um and do damage yeah

1256
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:23,519
severe damage yes and I don't think we

1257
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,039
talk about it enough how you know

1258
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:27,318
Cannabis used correctly can be an

1259
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:29,239
anti-inflammatory and maybe

1260
00:53:27,318 --> 00:53:30,759
it's worth exploring maybe it won't work

1261
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:32,798
maybe it will but it's worth at least

1262
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:36,440
trying and that that's that's my thought

1263
00:53:32,798 --> 00:53:39,880
on the whole thing yeah um I love

1264
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:41,720
the I love working with pain in like

1265
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:44,760
kind of the onew punch where you've got

1266
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:47,719
the anti-inflammatory effects of CBD and

1267
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:49,599
CBG and then you have the the numbing

1268
00:53:47,719 --> 00:53:53,199
and pain relieving deep effects of the

1269
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:55,400
THC and so when I'm um guiding a client

1270
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:59,358
usually what we'll do is we'll do some

1271
00:53:55,400 --> 00:54:01,880
THC first let that absorb and then um

1272
00:53:59,358 --> 00:54:05,798
you know half an hour at least later

1273
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:08,039
they take the CBD CBG component and um

1274
00:54:05,798 --> 00:54:09,838
help calm the inflammation the reason

1275
00:54:08,039 --> 00:54:11,159
why we don't do it at the same time is

1276
00:54:09,838 --> 00:54:13,960
because we really want to make sure

1277
00:54:11,159 --> 00:54:17,519
we're dialing in the THC level to the

1278
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:20,519
appropriate amount and um CBD of course

1279
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:22,318
can block the absorption of THC it it

1280
00:54:20,519 --> 00:54:25,480
likes to bind to The receptors a little

1281
00:54:22,318 --> 00:54:27,480
stronger than THC can in some cases so I

1282
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:30,400
like to separate those out a little bit

1283
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:32,079
topical no um internal tinctures yeah

1284
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,480
cuz you used to have a topical that was

1285
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:35,680
really really good still do yeah well

1286
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,679
that's amazing yeah I thought your

1287
00:54:35,679 --> 00:54:40,279
topical yeah that's it's yeah that

1288
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:42,239
topical um it's got you know it's got

1289
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:44,720
the Cannabis part in there but it also

1290
00:54:42,239 --> 00:54:46,639
has a bunch of other medicinal herbs

1291
00:54:44,719 --> 00:54:49,959
that are beneficial for pain

1292
00:54:46,639 --> 00:54:52,639
inflammation and um just speeding up the

1293
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:54,838
Regeneration of tissues and bones and

1294
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:57,078
it's got It's got uh comfrey in there

1295
00:54:54,838 --> 00:54:58,519
and that herb it's called bone knit

1296
00:54:57,079 --> 00:55:00,240
because it's just so good at making the

1297
00:54:58,519 --> 00:55:04,159
bones strong and tying them back

1298
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:07,078
together um uh so I've got that I'm I'm

1299
00:55:04,159 --> 00:55:09,480
also now I've got another topical that

1300
00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:13,240
is a combination of

1301
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:18,559
um uh you know the Cannabis piece with a

1302
00:55:13,239 --> 00:55:22,159
castor oil and DMSO and DMSO um it it

1303
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:25,798
drives the oils in very deep as and when

1304
00:55:22,159 --> 00:55:28,920
you use it with for the dog too did for

1305
00:55:25,798 --> 00:55:31,960
Luna dog it's pasted but but yeah the

1306
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:35,159
DMSO okay yeah it's kind of stinky it is

1307
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:37,838
DMSO does stink but it's super it's it's

1308
00:55:35,159 --> 00:55:41,759
amazing if use correctly MSO can be

1309
00:55:37,838 --> 00:55:44,078
amazing for absorbing drugs yes clean

1310
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:46,440
the area first yeah because it'll absorb

1311
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:48,440
it'll absorb your dirt your bacteria all

1312
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:50,358
that stuff the D on your shirt yeah oh

1313
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:53,880
yeah pretty much anything yeah it stinks

1314
00:55:50,358 --> 00:55:56,480
like onions a little bit like burnt

1315
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:59,559
rubber bands and like it's a little funk

1316
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:01,960
rotting smell yeah it's you know and the

1317
00:55:59,559 --> 00:56:03,240
thing is is with dmsl like it's it might

1318
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:05,519
not smell that bad but if you start

1319
00:56:03,239 --> 00:56:08,239
sweating then it really smells you know

1320
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:10,318
I think um for for some people there's

1321
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:12,000
like a chemical reaction that that

1322
00:56:10,318 --> 00:56:13,759
happens to where some people don't smell

1323
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,798
much from it and some people really

1324
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:19,680
soell yeah yeah I've noticed if I put it

1325
00:56:16,798 --> 00:56:21,759
yeah if I put it on and because I think

1326
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:23,879
it really works good with THC yes so

1327
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:25,319
really really good but if you put it on

1328
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,920
and I start like if I start moving

1329
00:56:25,318 --> 00:56:29,000
around I'm sweating it's a hot day or

1330
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:32,559
something like that then I'm like oh

1331
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:34,280
can't use that stuff on hot days right

1332
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:37,559
right

1333
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:40,798
yeah um what else I'm really interested

1334
00:56:37,559 --> 00:56:43,559
in working with the roots and um you

1335
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:47,159
know just looking for a good source of

1336
00:56:43,559 --> 00:56:50,000
roots that are clean and you know don't

1337
00:56:47,159 --> 00:56:53,679
have bunch of nutrients in them of

1338
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:55,798
course plants generally like once they

1339
00:56:53,679 --> 00:56:58,358
flowered like the energy is sent up to

1340
00:56:55,798 --> 00:57:00,239
the flower hours one day I'd love to

1341
00:56:58,358 --> 00:57:02,480
just grow some plants for the roots and

1342
00:57:00,239 --> 00:57:04,000
be able to see well there's an extremely

1343
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:06,280
high concentration of

1344
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:09,000
tpin uh especially with certain

1345
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:11,680
varieties of cannabis so some some of

1346
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:13,000
these cultivars and the thing is is like

1347
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:14,679
if you've grown and you've thrown away

1348
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,559
root balls a lot of times you like if

1349
00:57:14,679 --> 00:57:18,078
you take it out of the pot because you

1350
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:19,960
reuse pots and you're breaking up those

1351
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:22,480
root balls you'll get a good whiff of

1352
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:24,440
TPS and I've noticed that some are

1353
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:26,719
stronger than others obviously just like

1354
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:29,599
the plants but yeah I've I've had some

1355
00:57:26,719 --> 00:57:32,199
amazing super turpy Roots before too I'm

1356
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:34,400
like we should be extracting this stuff

1357
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:37,038
yeah I think there's a lot of money

1358
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:39,519
wasted on not not you know there there's

1359
00:57:37,039 --> 00:57:40,839
some useful products out there where I

1360
00:57:39,519 --> 00:57:43,719
think there's people that are good at

1361
00:57:40,838 --> 00:57:45,759
using whole plants but like there's so

1362
00:57:43,719 --> 00:57:48,598
many uses for every part of the plant

1363
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:51,119
every last little part has some

1364
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:53,480
use so yeah I mean they're making

1365
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:55,200
hempcrete which amazing you can get a

1366
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:57,639
house built of hempcrete now I would

1367
00:57:55,199 --> 00:58:00,000
love to get in on one of those workshops

1368
00:57:57,639 --> 00:58:03,440
sometime and you know we're we're

1369

1370
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:07,720
want to build like a little studio for

1371
00:58:05,358 --> 00:58:09,558

the mud from the land or something like

1374
00:58:11,559 --> 00:58:14,839
that yeah I mean they do earth walls so

1375
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:17,519
you should look at the Earth walls are

1376
00:58:14,838 --> 00:58:19,798
amazing they they withand category five

1377

combination of sand and mud and Clay and

1379
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:27,639
other stuff and really impressive uh my

1380
00:58:25,798 --> 00:58:31,880
buddy in Mexico is building a whole

1381
00:58:27,639 --> 00:58:33,759
house of with Earth walls yes yeah just

1382
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:35,960
got to I guess you you just got to get a

1383
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:38,839
teacher and then like host a workshop on

1384
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:41,079
your property yeah right have everyone

1385
00:58:38,838 --> 00:58:42,838
build it for you or at least start it

1386
00:58:41,079 --> 00:58:44,280
start it you know at least yeah I mean

1387
00:58:42,838 --> 00:58:45,639
all this stuff is on YouTube now with

1388
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:49,119
technology you could you could learn how

1389
00:58:45,639 --> 00:58:51,358
to do anything true yeah so so yeah and

1390
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:52,920
then Costa Rica how's the Cannabis scene

1391
00:58:51,358 --> 00:58:53,719
down in Costa Rica because I've heard

1392
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:57,960
good

1393
00:58:53,719 --> 00:59:00,598
things we haven't been able to explore

1394
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:02,760
that too much at this point because

1395
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:06,480
we've only been there for you know a few

1396
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:10,240
months here and there um but uh people

1397
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:14,559
are definitely interested in in seeds

1398
00:59:10,239 --> 00:59:16,959
and and new strains um the laws have

1399
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:20,480
shifted in Costa Rica to where you can

1400
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:24,079
grow U personal plants for personal use

1401
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:27,240
but you're not allowed to sell them and

1402
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:30,880
uh yeah I think that it's you know about

1403
00:59:27,239 --> 00:59:33,719
to blow up over there and and

1404
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:36,880
really get get it to where more people

1405
00:59:33,719 --> 00:59:38,598
can access this and there are a lot of

1406
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:41,039
like health clinics too I'm really

1407
00:59:38,599 --> 00:59:43,160
interested in in continuing my work in

1408
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:46,119
Costa Rica and uh reaching out to some

1409
00:59:43,159 --> 00:59:49,078
of those health clinics and right you

1410
00:59:46,119 --> 00:59:50,960
know staying medicinal with it yeah it

1411
00:59:49,079 --> 00:59:53,240
sounds awesome and they're considered

1412
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:56,079
tropical right it's not equatorial it's

1413
00:59:53,239 --> 00:59:58,199
they're they're like in the I believe

1414
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:59,359
I'm not 100% on that I don't know but

1415
00:59:58,199 --> 01:00:01,199
I've heard some really interesting

1416
00:59:59,358 --> 01:00:03,759
stories about people growing OG my

1417
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:06,279
friend Tim growing OG kush here and then

1418
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:08,920
growing it in Costa Rica and how the

1419
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:10,440
same Cult of ARG grown in two places

1420
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:12,838
expresses completely different where you

1421
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:16,119
wouldn't even recognize it as OG Kush

1422
01:00:12,838 --> 01:00:17,440
grown outdoor in Costa Rica compared to

1423
01:00:16,119 --> 01:00:20,358
grown

1424
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:21,679
here so I'm interested in seeing some of

1425
01:00:20,358 --> 01:00:26,078
the diversity

1426
01:00:21,679 --> 01:00:28,480
there yep we uh we want to get a little

1427
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:30,400
Greenhouse going and and you know get

1428
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:32,838
our I think you can do like six plants

1429
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:34,960
or something so we'll have to try out

1430
01:00:32,838 --> 01:00:38,558
some of these strains for sure 6 20

1431
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:39,880
Footers that's yeah I mean it's the same

1432
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:43,240
thing here six plants legal in

1433
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:46,680
California but that's there's no rule to

1434
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:48,479
how big get or size so bigger the better

1435
01:00:46,679 --> 01:00:50,879
yeah I I think that it's so amazing that

1436
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:52,400
we're going global with cannabis

1437
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:54,640
legalization even though it's not fully

1438
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:57,318
legal in the US Germany just legalized

1439
01:00:54,639 --> 01:01:00,038
recreational as a country

1440
01:00:57,318 --> 01:01:01,920
uh you know and it's just big when big

1441
01:01:00,039 --> 01:01:04,680
countries like Germany move then other

1442
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:06,880
countries will follow along suit and you

1443
01:01:04,679 --> 01:01:09,440
know we've got Colombia they're doing

1444
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:11,240
they're they're Medical but uh they're

1445
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:13,200
doing export and you know there's so

1446
01:01:11,239 --> 01:01:16,239
many medical countries out there and

1447
01:01:13,199 --> 01:01:19,000
also so many W countries coming online

1448
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:21,078
so yeah yeah yeah so if people are

1449
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:24,838

actually be doing some good too with

1469
01:02:14,599 --> 01:02:19,278
hemp these days because I mean I I was

1470
01:02:17,639 --> 01:02:20,879
in the grocery store the other day and

1471
01:02:19,278 --> 01:02:23,798
there is gummies and they're like 5

1472
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:26,240
milligrams of THC per gummy and I was

1473
01:02:23,798 --> 01:02:28,199
surprised and I and because it's B B on

1474
01:02:26,239 --> 01:02:30,078
the weight and so I'm going to start

1475
01:02:28,199 --> 01:02:31,679
looking into that a little further too

1476
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:34,240
yeah it's totally based on the weight so

1477
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:37,239
5 milligrams if the gummy weighs you

1478
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:38,959
know three grams that's way less than

1479
01:02:37,239 --> 01:02:41,358
than yeah you're under the limit you're

1480
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:43,079
totally under the limit yeah um and a

1481
01:02:41,358 --> 01:02:46,798
lot of people are using the

1482
01:02:43,079 --> 01:02:48,798
thca loophole it's huge right now right

1483
01:02:46,798 --> 01:02:50,880
so which but but the thing is is like if

1484
01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:52,838
it's a gummy and it's thca it doesn't

1485
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:54,200
really get you high thca doesn't get you

1486
01:02:52,838 --> 01:02:56,838
high people don't understand it's Delta

1487
01:02:54,199 --> 01:02:59,558
9 THC gets you hi but

1488
01:02:56,838 --> 01:03:01,880
thca is anti-inflammatory and it does

1489
01:02:59,559 --> 01:03:05,319
all these amazing things but it does not

1490
