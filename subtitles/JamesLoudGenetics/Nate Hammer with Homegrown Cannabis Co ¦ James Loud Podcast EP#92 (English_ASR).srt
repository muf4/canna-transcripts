years on social media when I was working

52
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:26,359
Cannabis industry so when I when I first

53
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:28,400
moved out here there was I was pretty

54
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,400
limited to what I could do I started

55
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,840
like you know working on the Queen Mary

56
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,680
and Long Beach I literally sat outside

57
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,800
Home Depot with all the other illegals

58
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,360
looking for work right but you know I

59
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,680
had a degree in film CU that's what I'd

60
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,640
got before I came here but um I've had a

61
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,599
love affair with America for a long time

62
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:48,518
uh visiting since I was a kid my uncle

63
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:52,560
moved here uh in the 80s he's from the

64
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:55,280
same town as me in the UK yeah and um

65
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,360
yeah so I just uh I was doing all of

66
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,039
these jobs that I hated to do till one

67
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,440
day someone offered me an opportunity up

68
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:04,158
there you know in the Emerald Triangle

69
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,680
area trimming weed trimmigrants right

70
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:08,079
yeah that's why I was a trimmigrant for

71
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,319
a long time nice so yeah I I was working

72
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,640
on a farm up there just trimming weed

73
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:13,759
making way better money than I was

74
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:17,158
making sucking up [ __ ] on the the Queen

75
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:19,158

76
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:21,759
of the ranches I was working on we ended

77
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:23,280
up becoming friends and he said hey you

78
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:25,560
know I think I could teach you how to

79
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,799
grow weed uh instead of just sitting

80
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,039
there with some fiskers all day why

81
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,719
don't you come and um learn how to you

82
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,318
know do the business

83
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:36,000
so that's what I spent you know a long

84
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:38,958
time after that doing and um long story

85
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,120
short is I merged the two eventually

86
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,400
yeah you know a bit of cannabis

87
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,200
knowledge and uh film knowledge making

88
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,680
cannabis content the price of cannabis

89
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:50,079
dropped and then you win in fil yeah

90
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,000
yeah yeah exactly yeah yeah $300 a pound

91
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,120
or something it's wild now you know it's

92
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,280
it's really it's sad it's really sad I

93
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,239
mean I I was talking to guys at TP

94
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,919
namami recently talking in Vegas but

95
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,280
also TP namami was an event that we just

96
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:04,719
had recently and you know it's like when

97
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,878
outdoor I mean topshelf outdoor goes for

98
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:09,598
$500 a pound now and that's really

99
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:11,399
disheartening in a lot of ways I feel

100
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:12,919
like it's way undervalued I feel like on

101
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,360
the streets the stuff is still going for

102
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:17,279
a lot more yeah in dispensaries the

103
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,160
stuff is still going for a lot more yet

104
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:22,758
the farmers suffer yeah I mean the cost

105
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,439
of growing you know has gone down

106
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:26,479
especially with the LED Revolution but

107
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:29,120
still $500 a pound isn't going to meet

108
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:30,680
is it nutrients have gone up power has

109
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,120
gone up yeah the lights have actually

110
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,600
you know gone down U I think there are

111
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,319
some efficiencies to be had for sure I

112
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,759
mean people are doing double Stacks but

113
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,759
man it's like I think there's a lot of

114
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:46,120
mids going on right now too and there's

115
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:48,319
still that small like 1% so

116
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,840
transitioning from I mean you obviously

117
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:53,599
started with with a film degree and then

118
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:56,279
you grew cannabis and then at some point

119
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,960
you transitioned into film we take it

120
00:04:56,279 --> 00:05:01,799
way back I you know I grew up in the UK

121
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:03,918

133
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:32,279
head first um you know I wanted to you

134
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,319

135
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:35,719
so I went to The Barbers yesterday I was

136
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,039
ended up getting it [ __ ] Britney

137
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,199
Spears for some reason so I've showed up

138
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:42,000
looking like a sperm whale but sorry

139
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:43,280
about that a that's all right yeah so

140
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,079
yeah I worked in the fashion industry

141
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:47,318
for a lot of years um which is what

142
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:49,599
inspired me to uh learn how to make

143
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:51,919
films I was always way more interested

144
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,520
in how you know how it was done I was

145
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:56,560
like oh [ __ ] so I see what we're doing

146
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:58,240
is we're repeating this in this angle

147
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,160
and then doing it again in this angle so

148
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,720
you can somehow cut it up cuz up until

149
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,439
that time I always thought there was

150
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,000
some hidden cameras or something like

151
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:07,800
how do they do this so you know back in

152
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,079
the day I I was working with all of

153
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,038
these uh big names Hype Williams was one

154
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:14,038
of them yeah we shot this commercial in

155
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:15,839
Grand Central Station in New York and

156
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:18,719
when I saw Hype Williams sat there with

157
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,038
his director's canz on and you know

158
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,880
telling people what shots he wanted I

159
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:23,918
was like man that's what I want to do

160
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:27,478
nice so I decided to you know finally go

161
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:29,799
to film school and I got my degree and

162
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:31,318

163
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,720

164
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:35,919
girlfriend and I came to New York to cry

165
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,360
sorry to America to cry about it yeah

166
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:41,359
and then I just [ __ ] never left right

167
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,240
overstayed my Visa and then uh ended up

168
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,280
in you know the the trimming world the

169
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:49,319
trimmigrant world try to make a buck and

170
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:50,918
um yeah that's how I merged the two but

171
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:54,120
the story you know it goes deeper than

172
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:56,439
that I have friends in uh in Europe that

173
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,959
I you know I come from the same town as

174
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:01,800
and they they had their own seed game

175
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:04,318
yeah in in Europe but they wanted to a

176
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,240
lot of things were going on with the the

177
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:10,080
Postal Service in Europe that was making

178
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:12,759
it really hard to sell seeds so

179
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:15,878
especially the UK yeah especially the UK

180
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:17,400
the EU which the UK was part of the EU

181
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:19,120
till you know like a year and a half

182
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:20,799
years break it I think it's I think it's

183
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,000
even longer than that but yeah yeah it's

184
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,240
it time flies like that yeah it does

185
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,598
it's wild because it feels like it was

186
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,160
two years but it probably five years

187
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:28,959
because it was right around covid time

188
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,080
yeah yeah I think it was like 2019 2020

189
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:33,478
yeah yeah yeah so my um because I've

190
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:35,519
always been coming to America you know

191
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:37,199
since I was a little boy and a friend of

192
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:39,120
mine he's the guy who had the seed

193
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,079

194
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,879

195
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:44,318
always ACC costing me like I used to he

196

197
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,120
Matt like you know I'm doing this

198
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,199
cannabis thing and the word cannabis in

199
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,598
the UK back then and even now I'm

200
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:54,598
assuming I mean I've been here for a

201
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:56,079
decade yeah was you know really like no

203
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:00,478
crazy like I'm not going to jail right

204
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:03,560
so I always turned him down

205
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:05,639
so um you know cutter 2017 after I've

206
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,839
been working on this farm for a long

207
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:09,439
time and he was following my Instagram

208
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:12,239
and I was just unabashedly and

209
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:14,000
unashamedly posting weed stuff on some

210
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,879
on my Instagram yeah you know and people

211
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,240
from school would be like hey man like

212
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:19,439
what are you doing that's crazy but I'm

213
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:22,918
like no I'm in America this is you know

214
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:26,120
this is cool fine it's all good here so

215
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:28,000
um yeah something went down at that farm

216
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,840
that I worked at something you know that

217
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,679
I'm actually traumatized over yeah um so

218
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:33,918
I worked for this guy the guy who picked

219
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:36,199
me up when I was

220
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:38,519
trimming and um you know I I thought he

221
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,640
was pretty cool um there was always

222
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:42,200
something a bit sketchy about him I

223
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:45,199
think it was the way that he treated his

224
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,560
girl um I didn't it didn't sit well with

225
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,879
me the way that he treated his girl he

226
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:51,919
didn't treat her very well yeah um

227
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:54,000
anyway so over you know the months that

228
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:56,120
I was working there I was guaranteed

229
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,720
like you know a certain paycheck yeah

230
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,480
for growing the crop because I was I was

231
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:04,320
out there on my own living in this

232
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:06,159
little 20 foot shitty um RV oh wow

233
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,959
that's a very normal situation yeah

234
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:09,919
exactly I grew a big beard you know

235
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:11,799
what's what's crazy I have this weird

236
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:13,319
hair pulling condition which is why

237
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:15,479
you'll rarely see me with facial hair

238
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,200
cuz I I pull it out right and I've had

239
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,839
it since I was like really young I

240
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,240
started on my hair wow and uh but I had

241
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,279
the biggest beard when I worked up there

242
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,159
and I I equated that to like I think I'm

243
00:09:24,278 --> 00:09:28,399
actually really happy I was just on my

244
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:30,439
own no one was bothering me no stress

245
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:34,039
and I was I was growing we we had two

246
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:36,519
hoop houses yeah uh 40 ft wide 240 ft

247
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:39,159
long we grew 600 plants in there amazing

248
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:40,799
we had a valley with another 20 plants

249

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,360
Hoops they were light dip yeah yeah and

253
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:50,679

00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:36,120
off into the woods and then this guy's

325
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,800
like looking for me and I spent that

326
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:43,078
entire night and this is like the the

327
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:46,039
Central Coast in the woods all

328
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:47,638
night little English guy you know I I

329
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:50,559
know how to use a gun because I'd spent

330
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:52,759
a lot of time shooting so you know but I

331
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,599
hid in the woods for probably like eight

332
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:56,120
hours until it started to get light yeah

333
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,600
but I could see him you know in his

334
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,440
truck looking for me oh wow yeah I was

335
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,040
tripping ball man it was crazy and at

336
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:06,000
one point I could see some

337
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:07,480
houses so I uh I was like I'm going to

338
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,879
head to those houses and I'm going to

339
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,278
knock on the door not with a shotgun I'm

340
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:14,639
going to get rid of that and then uh I

341
00:13:12,278 --> 00:13:16,159
climbed over this fence and I just woke

342
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,639
up like I don't know how long later but

343
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,838
I guess the fence I tried to climb over

344
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:21,959
was an electrified deer fence oh [ __ ]

345
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:25,120
yeah still got the zip across my my

346
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:28,239
nipple right here wow so anyway that was

347
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,799
my experience growing weed on the

348
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,360
Central Coast and that's why I say I

349
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:35,359
have PTSD I left the farm never went

350
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,360
back yeah and um but you know for a long

351
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,360
time after that like I'd wake up and I'd

352
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,199
be looking around my house for him even

353
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,959
though it's unrealistic like he's not

354
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:44,479
going to be there someone that's still

355
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:47,000
in the industry I don't know if he's in

356
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:50,440
the industry or not I've cut ties with

357
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,120
him um you know I will say I hope he's

358
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,920
doing all right because he was obviously

359
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,320
like there's something going on with him

360
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:58,799
but yeah yeah we're not friends trauma

361
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,079
is one of those things man and I'm sure

362
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:01,599
that caused a lot of trauma a lot of

363
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:03,519
people say why don't you smoke some weed

364
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,560
but for me it just doesn't work yeah

365
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,679
it's so funny I feel like uh we all have

366
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:11,758
our own body chemistries and you know we

367
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:13,638
all respond to trauma differently and

368
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:15,720
one thing works for one person

369
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:17,680
especially with can canabo and with

370
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,399
Tarpin and all these different things I

371
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:22,758
mean it's you know these combinations

372
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:24,639
were good and maybe CBD yeah well I I

373
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:26,919
you know that's exactly what I do i'

374
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,919
I've tried CBD I still use it to this

375
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:29,838
day I do believe did you smoke before

376
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:31,759
that

377
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,160
no no I mean yeah I'd say yeah I've

378
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:35,600
smoked but I've never had a good

379
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:39,000
reaction huh and I'll tell you I'll tell

380
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:42,240
you for why so I use CBD yeah and they

381
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,039
have CBD RSO now yeah so I like to lift

382
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,959
in the gym and I have the crazy

383
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:49,159
inflammation especially in my elbows

384
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:51,319
yeah so someone recommended this CBD RSO

385
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:53,439
yeah so it's non psychoactive or it is

386
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,800
to a degree because it's like it's RSO

387
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,839
so that you know at the very base level

388
00:14:55,799 --> 00:15:00,679
it's like 2.2 milligrams per right it's

389
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:02,639
it's psychoactive like how ibuprofen is

390
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:04,758
Psy exactly I I definitely felt some

391
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,879
sort of buzz from taking it whereas if I

392
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:09,000
just had like a a CBD isolate or

393
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:11,399
whatever I wouldn't so right so I was

394
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,159
taking a CBD RSO for for months and I

395
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:14,440
felt like it was definitely definitely

396
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:16,519
helping where the inflammation was

397
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,880
concerned sure like the anxiety and

398
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:20,120
stuff I don't know about that but

399
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:22,600
definitely with the inflammation and the

400
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:26,600
packaging between the

401
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:29,000
THC the RSO and the CBD RSO was

402
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,720
identical the only difference was the

403
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,919
fact that it said CBD and the fact that

404
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,720
it said CHC and I got to such a comfort

405
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:37,120
level of walking into our March and Ash

406
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,720
I think it was to grab it right that you

407
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,560
know one day after work I just grabbed

408
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,800
it went home and I remember exactly what

409
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:45,479
I ate that night I cooked freaking

410
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:48,078
salmon uh with Holland days and um some

411
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:51,319
mashed potatoes and some asparagus right

412
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:52,399
for me my daughter and my wife and I had

413
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:55,759
a couple of

414
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:59,198
beers and uh had by this point I was

415
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:01,919
having half a gram so it come in a gram

416
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:04,639
pen yeah or syringe and I was having

417
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:07,240
half a gram of CBD RSO I'd put it under

418
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,799
my tongue right and you know I work out

419
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,639
like pretty competitively and I live

420
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:12,679
pretty heavily yeah so I so it was

421
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,919
really helping it was great for me nice

422
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:19,519
so I um this one night took half a gram

423
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:21,360
of CBD as what I thought it was yeah and

424
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,879
then had a couple of drinks and went to

425
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,959
bed and then at 4 in the morning I woke

426
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:27,559
up and I never I've never felt so

427
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:30,919
strange in my life I was like what's

428
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:32,879
going on like what did I do do and like

429
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:36,159
why do I feel this way I could hear my

430
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:39,240
heart like in my head in my chest but

431
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:41,958
then I I sat up and it was like time was

432
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,799
really slow it's like being high right

433
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:47,119
but for me don't forget like I don't

434
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:49,039
smoke weed I do use the plant and when

435
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,360
this is like an extreme amount you're

436
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:53,679
talking about 500 milligrams right so

437
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,959
you know especially for someone who has

438
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:58,239
no tolerance like it's a psychedelic

439
00:16:55,958 --> 00:17:00,799
experience and also yeah I mean

440
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,278
traumatized yeah yeah sure yeah so I

441
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:04,119
mean don't get me wrong we'll move on to

442
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:07,880
the psychedelics because I actually do

443
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:10,198
enjoy psychedelics but this one time I I

444
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,000
woke up I said to my wife there's

445
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:14,480
something wrong like there's something

446
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,519
wrong yeah and then I could hear my own

447
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,880
voice in my head and it was saying it

448
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:23,279
was it was like a psycho a psychotic

449
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:26,039
episode it was saying Matt not that you

450
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:27,959
would but you're capable of harming your

451
00:17:26,038 --> 00:17:30,119
family oh wow that's what my own voice

452
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:32,720
was saying yeah so I said to my wife

453
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:34,479
like call the ambulance now and she was

454
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,360
like why what's the matter I said just

455
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,480
just please call the ambulance so then I

456
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:41,159
go in the kitchen I'm sat there waiting

457
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,038
and uh this fir truck shows up I've got

458
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,160
a ring camera too so it it caught the

459
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:47,519
whole thing oh yeah and I'm wearing a

460
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:50,798
t-shirt that says homegrown cannabis oh

exactly what's happened like and I say

465
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,798
I've been taking CBD RSO expecting them

466
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:05,359
to know what I'm talking about yeah and

467
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:06,798
I could tell like they're just sort of

468
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:08,519
laughing off like this is just the guy

469
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:10,519
who's had too much cookie or like you

470
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:11,720
know he's ate too many edibles but I

471
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:14,558
know exactly what's happened and I'm

472
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:17,839
trying to explain to them I've had I've

473
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:19,480
had too much THC it's like it's Rick

474
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:21,199
Simpson Oil it's for cancer patients

475
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,839
it's extremely strong and I've had the

476
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,200
wrong one yeah uh so I try to tell them

477
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:27,839
like I just want to be away from my

478
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,480
family just until this wears off yeah So

479
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:31,678
eventually like they are you sure you

480
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:35,079
want to you know go to the hospital so

481
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:37,880
they put me in the uh the fir truck take

482
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:41,798
me to the hospital and all they end up

483
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:43,840
doing is just putting me in a chair and

484
00:18:41,798 --> 00:18:46,440
it had some restraints in it they

485
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:47,918
strapped you down yeah God it seems like

486
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,200
that would make it worse they they left

487
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,038
me in the freaking Lobby they didn't

488
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,000
even give me ma own room so I'm sat

489
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:54,879
there for 12 hours like Nicholas Cage in

490
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,759
[ __ ] one FL of the cook cuz they gave

491
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,320
me a sedative it could have been Xanax I

492
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:00,839
don't know what it was but they gave it

493
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:02,839
to me and did help so I'm sat there and

494
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:05,158
then you know as the time goes by I'm

495
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:08,558
like okay I think I'm ready to leave but

496
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:10,799
yeah my eyes were like super uh red for

497
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:13,279
a couple of days after I bet but what

498
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:15,599
Parker Curtis good friend of mine who's

499
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:17,558
going to be on the show told me was um

500
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:19,519
you should have had some CBD isolate

501
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:22,038
right because that will CBD will drop

502
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:23,240
you down yeah exactly and he he he

503
00:19:22,038 --> 00:19:24,879
actually happened to have some and

504
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,440
competes for The receptors actually is

505
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,280
that what happens yeah well I think that

506
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,240
these EMTs they need to be educated

507
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:34,000
because you know they just gave me a z

508
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,558
or something if they had some CBD

509
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,159
isolate maybe the situation would have

510
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:41,798
been better for me a lot quicker yeah

511
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:44,919
but they don't have CBD isolate yeah CBD

512
00:19:41,798 --> 00:19:46,960
is the Nan for THC exact right that's

513
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:49,240
the slogan right there it should be they

514
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,079
should they should make a Naran like

515
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:53,079
cannabis C Ann

516
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:54,798
Naran but uh that's actually a good

517
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:57,038
marketing tool right there well that's

518
00:19:54,798 --> 00:20:00,359
what happened to me so not that I did

519
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:04,119
indulge in you know THC anyway but I

520
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:07,479
accidentally overdosed on a RSO ended up

521
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:10,158
in a hospital walk outside with a I grow

522
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,720
weed t-shirt which is crazy all these

523
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,240
EMTs are laughing at me most

524
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,000
embarrassing experience of my life and

525
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:18,038
then I was literally I I was high for a

526
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,679
couple of days I bet yeah crazy wild

527
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:21,400
yeah I remember I ate too much I was I

528
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,679
had people trimming in my house right

529
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,840
because I used to grow plants in the

530
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,798
house we used to trim in the house in

531
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:27,519
the front room and I was making Edibles

532
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:29,359
for trco from Green Day He was going on

533
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,038
tour and wanted these really strong

534
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:33,558
edibles but he didn't want them to smell

535
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:35,480
like weat right so I kept on adding more

536
00:20:33,558 --> 00:20:37,558
to make them as strong as possible kept

537
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,798
tasting them making sure that it was

538
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:43,079
right next thing you know I'm curled up

539
00:20:39,798 --> 00:20:45,038
in the bed I'd eaten way too much I was

540
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:46,798
tripping and I thought everybody knew I

541
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:49,558
thought my neighbors knew that I was

542
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:52,158
high and my I thought I was going to

543
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:53,440
die so I called my wife and I'm like I

544
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,600
need to go to the hospital I need you to

545
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,080

546
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:57,359

551
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,159
Fruity Pebble Treats at the time right

552
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:10,639
and I told her I was making the Fruity

553
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,640
Pebble treats for tcole and I need to go

554
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,159
to the hospital because I'm dying and

555
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,440
she's like hangs up the phone yeah and

556
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,640
I'm like oh [ __ ] you got to ride this

557
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,120
[ __ ] out on your own I call her back and

558
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,720
she's like you need a man up and like

559
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:23,000
figure it out I'm not coming home she

560
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,159
was working at the time and she was

561
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,079
working right down the street but she's

562
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,320
like yeah I'm not coming home you ate

563
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:30,439
weed you're you're going to be fine and

564
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:31,678
I'm like like [ __ ] and then when she

565
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,679
said that at the end though it kind of

566
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,679
clicked it like oh yeah I'll be okay

567
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,880
yeah and then I'm looking out the window

568
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,640
like [ __ ] my neighbors know I'm high but

569
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,760
that that paranoia that you get from

570
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:45,640
Cannabis is real and I feel like there's

571
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:47,879
a large group of people out there that

572
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,960
heaven had the experience of trying a

573
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,640
smaller dose of cannabis where they

574
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,440
would enjoy it but because of this

575
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,640
traumatic experience where they either

576
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,720
ate way too much took a dab or consumed

577
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,200
way too much now they never want

578
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,480
cannabis again yeah or experience it my

579
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,519
first experience and I'm not you know I

580
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,440
think I spend all my life with people

581
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:10,079
who love cannabis I mean I think

582
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,600
cannabis is a freaking glorious plant

583
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:13,480
provided by Mother Nature and it's not

584
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:15,359
just for getting high but if that's you

585
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,400
know what you use it for great but

586
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:19,839
there's so many beneficial factors to it

587
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,559
but when I was I think I was about 10

588
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,959
that's the first time I got high yeah

589
00:22:21,558 --> 00:22:27,038
because my brother who's older than me

590
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:29,079
he started smoking um brick hash yeah um

591
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:31,359
and he used to make these things called

592
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:34,000
uh bottle bags have you heard of a

593
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:35,959
bottle bag No it's like very sort of

594
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,519
thing yeah [ __ ] have a bottle bag you

595
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,159
know what I mean so you'd get like a you

596
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:41,918
get a bottle of coke like a plastic

597
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,278
bottle of coke and you probably do have

598
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,400
it you just call it something different

599
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:48,440
here sure cut it in half yeah get a

600
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,960
plastic bag like the corner of a plastic

601
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:54,080
bag tape that to the bag yeah and then

602
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,880
push the bag into the ball get a foil

603
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:58,918
cap put some holes into it sure uh this

604
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,880
isn't a lesson for uh what's it called

605
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:02,480
paraphernalia by the way this great

606
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,640
though yeah so you've got your you've

607
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,519
got your bottle you've cut it in half

608
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,480
you've taped a bag around it you've

609
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:11,359
stuffed the bag up up into it you've got

610
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,839
a foil cap you stab it a few times with

611
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:16,479
a pin you sprinkle your hash on there

612
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:18,639
yeah you burn it and you draw it with

613
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,159
the bag so you pull the bag down once

614
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,600
it's full you take the thing off I mean

615
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:26,000
we used to use cook cans but I like that

616
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:27,639
I like and I fully understand how it

617
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,839
works it makes perfect sense I've never

618
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:33,600
done that but yeah I mean that smoke I

619
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:35,720
was 10 yeah and I I never like it was

620
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:37,079
the worst experience in my life so and

621
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,240
you know that was under the influence of

622
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:41,199
my brother the crazy bastard sure so

623
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,880
that was my first experience so how much

624
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,120
older was your brother four years two

625
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,440
years older than yeah two years older

626
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:47,959
than me and I might get that I might

627
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,240
have gotten that wrong maybe I was 12

628
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,120
and he was 14 or I was 10 and he was 12

629
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,519
either way that was a long time ago yeah

630
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:56,879
and it was it's no you know it's no uh

631
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:58,639
activity for a 10 or a 12 year old in my

632
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,000
opinion yeah I mean I think think I

633
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,200
started I started smoking when I was 14

634
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,798
right so I feel like that's a I'm not

635
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,080
going to say it's a good age but it was

636
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:09,679
the age where I started smoking I mean I

637
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:11,399
think high school high school a lot of

638
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,400
kids are introduced you know I was one

639
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,759
of those kids at chewing

640
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,080
tobacco I tried chac when I was seven

641
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:19,158
threw up all over the place yeah you got

642
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:21,678
the spins immediately it was so good

643
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:24,039
though to experience it when I was seven

644
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,278
CU When I was like 14 and everyone's

645
00:24:24,038 --> 00:24:27,960
like let's try chewing tobacco I was

646
00:24:26,278 --> 00:24:29,000
like you guys try chewing tobacco I'm

647
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,840
going to watch

648
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,720
and I saw all my friends get sick lying

649
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:35,158
on the ground throwing up drooling and

650
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,360
you know spitting and so I was never in

651
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:39,559
a chew like because of that experience

652
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:41,038
when I was seven right and cannabis I'm

653
00:24:39,558 --> 00:24:43,480
sure part of it was from that

654
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:45,558
10-year-old or 12-year-old experience

655
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:47,079
that basically turned you away from it

656
00:24:45,558 --> 00:24:49,240
yeah possibly maybe I should just start

657
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:50,798
small on the zins or something and my

658
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,480
wife back into I'm telling you there's

659
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:54,839
probably something that's right for you

660
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,440
and I feel like white Thorn Rose is feel

661
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:58,759
good weed so something like white Thorn

662
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:00,080
Rose you need to look for it I mean I I

663
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:02,000
don't have any right now but I could

664
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:04,558
probably get you some but like it's

665
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,720
about starting small and just you know I

666
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:08,359
think that there's a can canabo for

667
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,880
everybody I think there's some some

668
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:12,000
profile that works if CBD works for you

669
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,679
that means that there's probably

670
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,278
something else that works for you and I

671
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,120
think it's also about like exploring

672
00:25:16,278 --> 00:25:19,960
plant medicine Kyle's always saying to

673
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:21,479
me you know exactly what you're said

674
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,278
you're saying right now he says it's

675
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,159
just that you haven't found the right

676
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:28,398
cultivar or you know you know you're

677
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:30,240
smoking too much you I'm I'm totally

678
00:25:28,398 --> 00:25:32,239
open to it but you know I I've been

679
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,480
around I've been around the block and

680
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,798
you know I've had I've struggled with

681
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:40,159
addiction uh just not cannabis you know

682
00:25:37,798 --> 00:25:42,200
um alcohol you're English so it's

683
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:45,159
definitely alcohol you got another beer

684
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:47,960
yeah right no seriously drink drinking's

685
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:49,799
yeah that's part of my Heritage but War

686
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:52,000
you drink warm beer too no that's not

687
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:53,839
that's a freaking typ dude no actually

688
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,440
warm beer in the Caribbean is they they

689
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:57,639
drink Guinness warm and they have extra

690
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,840
bitter Guinness yeah I I used to work at

691
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,840
a pub in London

692
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:03,158
yeah um and we used to pour the it was

693
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:04,879
like um there are some beers that you

694
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:06,720
drink warm it comes right out of the

695
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,039
barrel and you just pump it a couple of

696
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,399
times it's ale sure it's ale right

697
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:12,000
that's why you drink warm you know

698
00:26:10,398 --> 00:26:13,359
that's like an old man's drink isn't it

699
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,240
for sure yeah I wouldn't you wouldn't

700
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:18,119
catch me dead drinking a warm beer

701
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:20,798
Stella you how about ipas ipas are like

702
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:23,119
the Cannabis of beer yeah IPA is an

703
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:25,319
interesting one I [ __ ] hate the taste

704
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:26,479
of it but I I keep drinking it yeah yeah

705
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:28,639
I don't know what that is well they're

706
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,798
strong yeah for sure and they're turpy

707
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:35,520
yeah definitely yeah I think the story

708
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:38,639
behind ipas is they were shipping it

709
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:40,398
across from the U Europe or the UK yeah

710
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,038
to America but they used to load it full

711
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:45,079
of hops right right to keep it I don't

712
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:47,158
know fresh or to keep it from spoiling

713
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:49,839
yeah and that's how it originated but

714
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:51,799
it's by no means yeah exactly there you

715
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:54,398
go but it's by no means like a it's an

716
00:26:51,798 --> 00:26:57,558
American Beverage for sure well I think

717
00:26:54,398 --> 00:27:00,038
it it originated going from England to

718
00:26:57,558 --> 00:27:01,599
India or or vice versa and then we've

719
00:27:00,038 --> 00:27:03,158
evolved it into something completely

720
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:04,639
different than what it was originally

721
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:06,399
that's what I'm saying yeah like you've

722
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,278
you've done so much with ipas that it's

723
00:27:06,398 --> 00:27:11,119
just it's an American drink it's like in

724
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:12,960
the in the 90s ipas evolved into so much

725
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:15,158
more and then these

726
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,840
specific hops that they use and the

727
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:19,480
combinations of hops that are really

728
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:23,158
dank and very much like cannabis there's

729
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:24,480
definitely ties to the the beer world

730
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:27,559
and the Cannabis industry there's

731
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,960
similarities with beer and cannabis

732
00:27:27,558 --> 00:27:31,558
especially with the recreational going

733
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,440
online yeah and these big companies and

734
00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:34,839
then we have in alcohol there's you know

735
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,880
the big four or whatever and then we

736
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:38,519
have the craft breweries and the craft

737
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,278
Brewers have kind of taken over wordss

738
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:42,359
the almost the exact opposite with

739
00:27:40,278 --> 00:27:44,480
cannabis it was all craft and now we

740
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:45,798
have these big companies coming online

741
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,278
and I think there's the fear of The

742
00:27:45,798 --> 00:27:49,918
Craft going away and I I think that

743
00:27:48,278 --> 00:27:52,240
people that have the best flower are

744
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,278
always going to be successful yeah um

745
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,679
but I also am big fans of people that

746
00:27:54,278 --> 00:27:57,798
make their own beer and grow their own

747
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,880
weed Kyle kushman great example of

748
00:27:57,798 --> 00:28:02,119
somebody who is a homeg grower who loves

749
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,080
weed and will grow plants no matter what

750
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:04,759
that's what we yeah that's what we've

751
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:06,798
been pushing for you know since I met

752
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:09,000
Kyle like eight years ago we've been

753
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:10,319
pushing out grow your own content well

754
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,359
you guys have your own channel and it's

755
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:14,278
very successful yeah I mean we've you

756
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:17,000
know we've curated over the years and

757
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:19,720
you know collaborated with I think more

758
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,159
recently the podcast I think we're in a

759
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:24,960
podcast boom aren't we like people just

760
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,320
freaking love podcasts and I think uh

761
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,798
yeah I think that's something that we've

762
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:30,798
been able to utilize yeah whereas you

763
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:33,679
know we'd spend you know a lot of time

764
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:35,639
and money and making a cinematic piece

765
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,880
of content yeah that would get barely

766
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:40,278
any engagement if you compared it to

767
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:44,159
just two people sitting across a table

768
00:28:40,278 --> 00:28:46,200
talking about you know breeding or uh

769
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,519
synthetic versus organic or Whatever It

770
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,080
Is Well I think the best podcast in my

771
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:51,359
opinion are the conversations that

772
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:53,199
people have between each other that are

773
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:54,398
just really casual conversations where

774
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,399
you get to know somebody like we're

775
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:58,558
doing today yeah like I think that's our

776
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:00,798
our you know in Joe Rogan kind started

777

know have a good team and you know it's

910
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:57,278
like I come from a world where it's all

911
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:59,399
about loyalty and about friendship and

912
00:33:57,278 --> 00:34:01,319
about winning and losing together so

913
00:33:59,398 --> 00:34:03,839
it's it's so good when you have a team

914
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:06,079
that when you suffer we all suffer when

915
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:07,720
we win we all win and it's like we've

916
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:10,239
had good times this year we've had bad

917
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:12,358
times this year but we got a solid team

918
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:13,519
and I mean and not just the podcast team

919
00:34:12,358 --> 00:34:15,480
because these guys have had to suffer

920
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:18,000
with me too or we've suffered and but

921
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,358
like my cultivation Partners we have

922
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,599
amazing cultivation partners and

923
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:24,960
partners all over and uh you know this

924
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:26,879
this group a lot of us started in the

925
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,960
black market even you started in you

926
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:31,480
know

927
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,000
yeah and and so coming and transitioning

928
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:35,800
to this it's a beautiful thing I love

929
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,878
the fact that people aren't going to

930
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:40,280
prison as much for cannabis yeah that's

931
00:34:37,878 --> 00:34:41,480
the big thing I love having Rick Deli

932
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,800
and luk

933
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:47,960
scarmazzo and you know both Uncle Rick

934
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:49,519
and his son who I met 15 years ago one

935
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,199
of the first things he told me is my

936
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:53,280
pops is in prison and we're going to get

937
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:56,439
him out yeah right and then to see him

938
00:34:53,280 --> 00:35:00,720
out you know he he had a 96e prison

939
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:04,119
sentence 96 serve 32 that's 98 serve 328

940
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:06,319
and serve 32 and so you know there's a

941
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:08,240
lot of blessings that we've been able to

942
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,519
experience in our life and yeah you know

943
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:11,118
and just I feel like it's a blessing

944
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:13,519
every day to be able to wake up and get

945
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:15,960
to do this kind of stuff yeah yeah yeah

946
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:19,280
so you know when you asked me earlier so

947
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:21,400
how did you transition from um you know

948
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:24,320
making films and being in cannabis or

949
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:26,599
vice versa so that's where it started

950
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,800
with my friend in the UK who had a seed

951
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:30,160
company and I finally was like you know

952
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,240
after what happened to me on the farm

953
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:34,719
with the gun and the night in the woods

954
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:37,479
and getting shocked by the electric deer

955
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:40,519
fence that's wild I it was really crazy

956
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:43,519
dude and um yeah you know not divulging

957
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:47,079
too much I I was already predisposed to

958
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:49,199
uh freaking uh drugs like yeah um and I

959
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:51,160
spent the last year being so happy

960
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:52,559
growing a beard like I told you right

961
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:54,719
and then I fell right back off that

962
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:57,960
wagon and I was I was in a bad way for

963
00:35:54,719 --> 00:36:00,239
quite a while mhm um until I decided you

964
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:02,159
know what [ __ ] this I I got to do

965
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:05,239
something or I'm going back to England

966
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:08,279
yeah so I I took the phone call I had my

967
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:10,000
boys come over from the UK yeah um

968
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:12,560
actually Sergio ended up being part of

969
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,159
that wow and uh I used all of the

970
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:17,159
connections that I'd made as a grower on

971
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:19,719
the Central Coast introduced him to

972
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:21,519
whoever I knew and then that company

973
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:24,000
turned into homegrown cannabis Co which

974
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:26,199
is what what it is today what I do for

975
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,079
homegrown cannabis Co is I curate the

976
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:30,759
education yeah but

977
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:33,079
the irony is the guy who put the gun to

978
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:35,160
my head he used to you know tell me

979
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:38,920
about all of his idols and all of his

980
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:40,000
idols were like DNA genetics and burner

981
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:43,200
who I'm going to be interviewing

982
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,838
tomorrow for our film with Richard Deli

983
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:47,879
all of these people that he idolized and

984
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:50,039
at that time I really had little

985
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,280
knowledge of I've worked with I've

986
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:53,519
literally worked with every single one

987
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,319
of them whether it's hge santis yeah or

988

of both of ours yeah you know and we

995
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,280
probably wouldn't be here sitting today

996
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:18,318
if you hadn't come in the door then I

997
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,640
mean it's hard to say right hard to say

998
00:37:18,318 --> 00:37:21,119
know but you're you're probably right

999
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:23,519
yeah but yeah some of the best guys in

1000
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:25,039
the industry I love those guys uh

1001
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:26,719
they're they're old school I've known

1002
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:28,119
them for a long time you know when I was

1003
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:30,199
just trying to break break into the

1004
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:33,920
industry those guys were already a huge

1005
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:35,439
success you know and then Kyle kushman

1006
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,159
you've been working with Kyle and he's

1007
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,000
you know he's he's an eccentric

1008
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:41,279
character I love him he's he's a wild

1009
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,719
man loves that Strawberry Cough part of

1010
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:47,160
our business model when we started the

1011
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:50,519
company was how do we separate

1012
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:52,279
ourselves from just a seed bank yeah to

1013
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:54,920
you know something that offers more than

1014
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:57,880
just seeds so that's where Kyle came

1015
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:59,079
into play Sergio yeah he had his own

1016
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:03,480
channel at the time I think it was

1017
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:05,000
called 420 TV mhm and um so he knew he

1018
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,159
knows everybody like he introduced me to

1019
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,679
Steve DeAngelo that's I made my f first

1020
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:12,440
film with him um so Kyle was integral in

1021
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:14,078
that business model because what we

1022
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:16,599
wanted to do is we wanted to create

1023
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:18,560
cannabis growing content that wasn't

1024
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:20,559
just your average grower but someone who

1025
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:22,838
was dedicated a certain amount of time

1026
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:24,880
and had a certain reputar in cannabis

1027
00:38:22,838 --> 00:38:26,199
right uh teaching you how to grow but we

1028
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,200
wanted to give that away to our

1029
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:30,439
customers for free

1030
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:32,919
you know in order to invite them into

1031
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:34,159
our ecosystem and our family right so

1032
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:36,318
that's what Kyle and I have been doing

1033
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:40,118
for all those years and you know we've

1034
00:38:36,318 --> 00:38:41,519
ended up making content with pretty much

1035
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:43,358
I mean there's a lot of people still out

1036
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:46,039
there that I'd love to work with yeah

1037
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:49,199
but at this point yeah it's like if you

1038
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:51,400
go to our channel on homegrown uh

1039
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:53,399
youtube.com homegrown cannabis Co and

1040
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,639
that's where the content that we've

1041
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,559
cated for the last decade is all

1042
00:38:55,639 --> 00:39:00,000
available there all really well well

1043
00:38:57,559 --> 00:39:02,480
laid out and ready to go I don't know

1044
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,719
there's this preconceived notion in

1045
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,400
cannabis that if you don't if you don't

1046
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:08,838
get high you shouldn't be in the

1047
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,519
industry or I I don't know what it is oh

1048
00:39:08,838 --> 00:39:12,239
yeah I agree with that 100% yeah you

1049
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:15,519
agree with it

1050
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:18,199
right no you know I I do have feelings

1051
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:19,759
about it though uh you know and I do

1052
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:22,719
have some of the best girls I know don't

1053
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,319
smoke but I also I'm the one who tests

1054
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:26,039
their flower for them they give me

1055
00:39:24,318 --> 00:39:28,358
samples and I'm like oh yeah this is

1056
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:30,279
amazing it's it's a really tough thing

1057
00:39:28,358 --> 00:39:31,519
and I think everyone has their place I'm

1058
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,800
not going to hate on people that don't

1059
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:35,960
smoke It's just tough doing business

1060
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:38,480
with people that don't have that

1061
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:40,720
experience um and they look at it just

1062
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,920
just money A lot of times it's it's a

1063
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:45,318
devotional thing for me yeah you know

1064
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:47,400
yeah yeah the full the full embodiment

1065
00:39:45,318 --> 00:39:50,440
yeah but as a as a camera person or

1066
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,680
somebody like uh our producer Ryan has

1067
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,400
gone through periods where he doesn't

1068
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:55,440
smoke and I don't have any negative

1069
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:58,280
feelings about that at all because I I I

1070
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:01,119
respect him because he's found his Place

1071
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:02,880
uh with us in this industry and and so

1072
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,400
that's okay for me but as a cultivator

1073
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,920
I'm like it's tough I know a couple

1074
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,119
cultivators who don't smoke and they do

1075
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:11,039
fine but it's a tough one I guess what

1076
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:13,559
I'm saying is um it's like are you too

1077
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:15,279
much of a [ __ ] to smoke weed right and

1078
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:18,000
it's like I almost feel compelled to

1079
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,640
rebuttal which but I shouldn't but it's

1080
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,559
like I've tried drugs that you probably

1081
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:25,199
haven't even [ __ ] heard of and you

1082
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:27,440
know we're all we're all human and yeah

1083
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:29,039
I don't I don't smoke weed because I

1084
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,079
just don't like how it makes me react I

1085
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:36,199
don't not smoke it because I'm afraid of

1086
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:37,680
it uh and I also do use the plant for

1087
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:39,358
what it's there for right and it's there

1088
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:40,519
for many things you know like at my

1089
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:41,920
story earlier which you know

1090
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:43,159
unfortunately was one of the most

1091
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,760
embarrassing things that's happened to

1092
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:48,279
me in my life but I still use CBD RSO

1093
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,319
right um I still use C full spectrum CBD

1094
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,960
tinctures um and I do feel like they

1095
00:40:50,318 --> 00:40:53,400
help you know I've got a lot of anx

1096
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,800
you're still consuming the plant yeah

1097
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,760
exactly you're absolutely still

1098
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:59,760
consuming the plant whether it's CBD or

1099
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:02,400
th C or any other canab there's CBN that

1100
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,800
people take for sleep yeah and it's it's

1101
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,280
not all I mean the plant has so many

1102
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,280
uses whether you know some people build

1103
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,280
houses with it you know I mean it has so

1104
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,760
much potential there's rope and clothes

1105
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,720
and all these things yeah if you spoke

1106
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:14,359
to a friend of mine Jacko you might even

1107
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:17,159
know um Steve

1108
00:41:14,358 --> 00:41:18,639
D'Angelo's um I used to work with Steve

1109
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:20,318
I don't know what his position was but

1110
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:23,440
yeah he he used to speak to me a lot

1111
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:25,000
about hemp and how it can save the world

1112
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,960
because there's so you can have hemp

1113
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:30,880
plastic like any hemp can but you know

1114
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:33,599
hemp would beat big a sorry big farmer

1115
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,880
and it just beat so many uh

1116
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:37,480
conglomerates textiles the whole textile

1117
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,280
industry could get taken over with h

1118
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:41,440
which I would I would think would make a

1119
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:43,800
lot of sense it's a better material

1120
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,358
better matal it's a lot stronger lasts a

1121
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,480
lot longer but that's also the problem

1122
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:48,039
if you're trying to make money and you

1123
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,039
only have to sell someone a handful of

1124
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:52,639
t-shirts to last the rest of their life

1125
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:56,239
there goes capitalism exactly bunch of

1126
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:58,759
hemp yeah so um yeah like like like we

1127
00:41:56,239 --> 00:42:01,199
were talking about I uh you know I

1128
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:03,880
started out back in the day uh working

1129
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:06,118
as a fashion model between London New

1130
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:08,440
York do like catwalks and stuff all that

1131
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:10,079
stuff no yeah I did I did catwalks you

1132
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:12,280
know I've walked Kelvin Klein things

1133
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:14,920
like that um my best friend grown up was

1134
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:16,680
a fashion model and he flew all over

1135
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:19,000
Italy Europe you know was very

1136
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:20,480
successful and yeah so those are the

1137
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,440
days you know when uh I think that was

1138
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:26,318
my Gateway into hardcore [ __ ] drugs

1139
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,880
you know I mean real drugs man drugs so

1140
00:42:26,318 --> 00:42:30,079
yeah I mean I'm not making light of it

1141
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:32,680
or maybe I am but that was an Affliction

1142
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:35,000
for many years of my life and I actually

1143
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:37,519
only stopped really [ __ ] around with

1144
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,679
uh hardcore drugs when my do my daughter

1145
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:41,920
was born yeah and that was that was what

1146
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:46,199
it took for me to you know take a step

1147
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:49,920
back and now I just basically uh drink

1148
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:52,399
all the time I just drink you know uh

1149
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,599
recreationally um but yeah like the the

1150
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,280
psychoactive nature of cannabis not for

1151
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:59,440
me right um not saying that it's not for

1152
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,359
everyone um it seems to be for most

1153
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,599
people but well at least you're going in

1154
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:03,838
the Psychedelic route so you like

1155
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:05,599
mushrooms and stuff like that love

1156
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:09,400
mushrooms hillbilly is my favorite

1157
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:11,519
cultivar um it's less of the from my

1158
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:13,720
experience you know I've had penis enves

1159
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:15,960
before I don't like I don't like pees

1160
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:17,519
yeah they they're way too psychoactive

1161
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:19,199
for me they're a different kind of

1162
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:20,880
psychoactive different kind of energy

1163
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:22,639
it's not you know I'm still I like

1164
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,519
golden teachers gold teachers are great

1165
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:27,318
hilles are great the Magnolia they have

1166
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:29,199
blue magnolia what's your experience

1167
00:43:27,318 --> 00:43:31,759
from Hillbillies I want to know if it's

1168
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:35,078
it's similar to mine um I feel like it's

1169
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,880
uplifting and energetic and I feel very

1170
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:39,039
good on them and that's what I like

1171
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,519
about uh golden teachers as well they I

1172
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:43,400
mean golden teachers are like the entry

1173
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:45,440
level right but I

1174
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:47,760
like that they're not super

1175
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,440
introspective and I'm not going and I

1176
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,319
like introspective too don't give me WR

1177
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,760
I think that's the problem with uh any

1178
00:43:51,318 --> 00:43:56,599
psychedelic that's introspective for me

1179
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:59,480
is I got a lot of demons and I don't

1180
00:43:56,599 --> 00:44:01,200
like being in my own head I think it's

1181
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,480
good to go in your head sometimes and I

1182
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:04,719
think there's a purge right there's a

1183
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,280
purge as and there there's a necessary

1184
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:07,358
Purge that you need to do every once in

1185
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,720
a while because we have all these

1186
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:11,078
filters and I

1187
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:13,318
think who you are now and how you see

1188
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:14,720
the world is from all the experiences

1189
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:16,440
each one of those experiences puts

1190
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:18,799
filter over your eyes right over your

1191
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:20,159
mind and so that's how you see the world

1192
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,079
and it's not necessarily the world

1193
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:23,679
really is that's your perception of the

1194
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:26,160
world and we all have different lenses

1195
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:30,159
based on these experiences and sometimes

1196
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:32,519
it takes a deep dive into psychedelics

1197
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:34,118
or you know cannabis and they they tune

1198
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:36,000
you in and make you see how the world

1199
00:44:34,119 --> 00:44:38,599
really is and sometimes you need to get

1200
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,280
out of that perspective to understand

1201
00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:43,599
that you're an [ __ ] because you do

1202
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:45,480
this this and this and psychedelics

1203
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:47,800
isn't the perfect cure for everybody but

1204
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:50,559
for me I'm able to look at the world

1205
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:52,839
through a different lens and I'm able to

1206
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:55,200
kind of see the world I mean I guess

1207
00:44:52,838 --> 00:44:57,400
it's all perception anyway so it's all

1208
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:59,558
you know your own personal experience

1209
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:01,000
but I feel like I'm less of an [ __ ]

1210
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:03,440
when I do psychedelics I want to make

1211
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,079
the world a better place I see how we're

1212
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,240
all tied in together once you start

1213
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:09,640
seeing that there's this

1214
00:45:07,239 --> 00:45:11,239
interconnected uh balance between

1215
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:14,279
everything every living thing that

1216
00:45:11,239 --> 00:45:16,679
exists you start realizing that uh you

1217
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:18,359
know you shouldn't be hating so much all

1218
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:20,440
these things and I really like that side

1219
00:45:18,358 --> 00:45:22,078
of this the Psychedelic experience

1220
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:24,240
whereas like you get so much more tuned

1221
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:26,400
in with cannabis tuned in with

1222
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:30,039
psychedelics whereas alcohol and some of

1223
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:32,920
these other drugs tune you out Sor

1224
00:45:30,039 --> 00:45:35,199
exactly you know and I feel like you you

1225
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:37,920
know you go to a Grateful Dead show back

1226
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:39,318
in the day now now dead in company and

1227
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,960
there's a lot of people with alcohol and

1228
00:45:39,318 --> 00:45:43,279
you can tell which ones are tuned in and

1229
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,318
which ones are tuned out yeah yeah and

1230
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,519
uh it just kind of grows goes across the

1231
00:45:45,318 --> 00:45:49,880
board but I feel like they they can both

1232
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:52,239
exist in in the world in a good way I

1233
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:54,440
mean alcohol can be something where you

1234
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:57,118
relax a little bit and and that works

1235
00:45:54,440 --> 00:46:00,280
for you but really I think alcohol does

1236
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:02,400
a lot more damage to people than more I

1237
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:04,680
mean I'll still keep drinking alcohol

1238
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,920
but you know in spite of knowing that

1239
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:07,279
and in spite of knowing that you know

1240
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,960
there's things out there that's that's

1241
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,440
way better but well us humans are doing

1242
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,599
our damages to try to kill kill

1243
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:14,679
ourselves every day you know so so and I

1244
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:16,280
feel like cannabis will it helps a

1245
00:46:14,679 --> 00:46:17,960
little bit going in the other direction

1246
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:19,880
I feel like yeah we might be smoking and

1247
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:23,039
all these things but we become more

1248
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:25,920
conscious of the things around us you

1249
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:27,719
know like cheeseburgers so yeah yeah I'm

1250
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,358
a sucker for a cheese B I guess I make

1251
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:31,679
the best cheeseburgers like literally I

1252
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:33,239
do Smash Burgers I mean I do I do big

1253
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:35,440
half pound the heck is that is that do

1254
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:37,479
they just like pound a piece of meat

1255
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,318
until it's just dust and no no no what

1256
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:41,639
you do is you have a griddle right you

1257
00:46:39,318 --> 00:46:43,119
have a hot griddle planta that you heat

1258
00:46:41,639 --> 00:46:45,719
up and you get it really hot and then

1259
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:49,680
you take your Patty that has to be 70%

1260
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:52,838
lean or less and you smash it with a

1261
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:55,399
with basically iron I have a cast iron

1262
00:46:52,838 --> 00:46:56,920
uh basically it's round it's cast iron I

1263
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:59,000
smash the burger with a piece of

1264
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:00,880
parchment paper it makes it real thin

1265
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,079
and what that does is it

1266
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:05,920
adheres to the PLA and then you actually

1267
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:08,400
scrape it off until you get this thick

1268
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:10,960
crust and what you do is you put some

1269
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,720
onions and salt and pepper before you

1270
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,838
flip it over and the onions start to

1271
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:15,279
cook then when you flip it over it

1272
00:47:13,838 --> 00:47:16,799
grills the onions a little bit you put

1273
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,760
your cheese on there and it's done in

1274
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,039
like two minutes I think at this point

1275
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:21,920
in the show when you look at the

1276
00:47:20,039 --> 00:47:23,358
analytics this is when the drop off is

1277
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,119
cuz all the Stoners are going into their

1278
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:27,960
kitchen to make a burger totally with

1279
00:47:26,119 --> 00:47:30,200
the munchies well it's funny because

1280
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:33,400
like I think a lot of there's a trans a

1281
00:47:30,199 --> 00:47:36,239
lot of people transition from cooking to

1282
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:38,160
cannabis disc really easy to transition

1283
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:41,000
because it's a lot of hard work and

1284
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:42,879
you're creating an amazing product the

1285
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,760
ones that are creating amazing products

1286
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:47,280
you know they understand that it takes a

1287
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:48,800
lot of hard work and it's all the

1288
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,480
components it's not just one it's not

1289
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,000
like we can have amazing meat but if the

1290
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:55,119
Buns [ __ ] the [ __ ] Burger sucks right

1291
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,559
so you have to have I like Brio but

1292
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:58,920
there's like good potato buns and other

1293
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:01,040
buns right but like it's also trial and

1294
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:03,039
error R&amp;D like but yeah as far as the

1295
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:05,039
tie-in with you know cooking and

1296
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:06,480
cannabis they really marry well together

1297
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:08,639
and I feel like breeding if you look at

1298
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,679
some of the top breeders in the world

1299
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:12,279
guys in the industry a lot of them have

1300
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:13,480
experience either cooking they they

1301
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:16,040
either love cooking or they were

1302
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:18,679
actually a chef talk about Arian rosam

1303
00:48:16,039 --> 00:48:20,440
sh Brooks I can name a million other

1304
00:48:18,679 --> 00:48:22,679
ones but like a lot of good friends of

1305
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:24,240
mine that are in the industry definitely

1306
00:48:22,679 --> 00:48:26,960
transitioned from cooking at some point

1307
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:28,479
in their life and understanding flavor

1308
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,720
and flavor profiles and combining

1309
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:33,440
flavors man that's just such a great way

1310
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:34,519
to transition into cannabis because you

1311
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,039
understand on a different level where

1312
00:48:34,519 --> 00:48:37,559
it's not like oh it's just good weed

1313
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:39,199
it's like no it's good weed and it has

1314
00:48:37,559 --> 00:48:41,240
these layers of flavor and then there's

1315
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:43,159
these these notes on the front and notes

1316
00:48:41,239 --> 00:48:44,318
on the back end and it has this long

1317
00:48:43,159 --> 00:48:46,358
finish and when you can start talking

1318
00:48:44,318 --> 00:48:49,480
about cannabis like that you know you

1319
00:48:46,358 --> 00:48:51,318
start understanding not only cannabis

1320
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:53,000
but everything like that you know and it

1321
00:48:51,318 --> 00:48:55,239
transitions to everything we should

1322
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,920
start having uh you know the Growers

1323
00:48:55,239 --> 00:48:59,279
wearing Chef's hats now sure yeah

1324
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,159
instead of just the L cloaks they're

1325
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,920
pretty sanitary too you know yeah could

1326
00:49:01,159 --> 00:49:05,239
you imagine guys with those big tall

1327
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:08,119
hats you can barely get through the door

1328
00:49:05,239 --> 00:49:09,239
you know but yeah that's pretty cool man

1329
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:11,358
yeah I like that you know it's a

1330
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:13,959
transferable skill no doubt well and

1331
00:49:11,358 --> 00:49:15,880
these are lifelong skills right farming

1332
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:17,559
if you understand farming in agriculture

1333
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:19,160
you can go anywhere in the world with

1334
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:20,440
that same thing with cooking same thing

1335
00:49:19,159 --> 00:49:24,118
with nursing there's a handful of

1336
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:25,440
careers out there it and I think you can

1337
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:26,720
transition if it doesn't matter where

1338
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,838
you go in the world if you know how to

1339
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:30,838
to grow you can probably get a job

1340
00:49:28,838 --> 00:49:32,239
growing somewhere yeah same thing with

1341
00:49:30,838 --> 00:49:33,599
cooking if you can cook really well you

1342
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:34,879
can go do that anywhere nursing

1343
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:36,559
obviously you can go to make money

1344
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,960
pretty much anywhere doing that yeah

1345
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:40,599
yeah they I I think um I remember Swami

1346
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:43,519
when we did a series with him he said

1347
00:49:40,599 --> 00:49:46,079
something along the lines of uh once you

1348
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:48,119
learn how to grow cannabis you learn how

1349
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,640
to grow which is like you know it's

1350
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:50,960
that's just suggesting that you know

1351
00:49:49,639 --> 00:49:52,879
it's not just cannabis you've learn how

1352
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:55,559
to grow so in a world where you need to

1353
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:57,079
grow your own fruits and veggies all of

1354
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:59,400
the the principles of grow the

1355
00:49:57,079 --> 00:50:01,720
fundamentals they're they're there yeah

1356
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:04,160
yeah for sure well and there's a lot of

1357
00:50:01,719 --> 00:50:05,480
places that are importing produce from

1358
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:06,440
the United States and other countries

1359
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:08,159
and like they could be more

1360
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:09,838
self-sufficient I'm I'm working down the

1361
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:12,920
Caribbean St Vincent with the government

1362
00:50:09,838 --> 00:50:16,759
down there uh we imported 30,000 seeds

1363
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:20,200
and came up with a a breeding plan and

1364
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:22,720
an economic plan to help out the the

1365
00:50:20,199 --> 00:50:24,598
community and you know I mean the actual

1366
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:26,798
local community that's a big deal yeah

1367
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:28,200
it's a big deal and I think it's it it

1368
00:50:26,798 --> 00:50:29,679
has a lot of potential you know all

1369
00:50:28,199 --> 00:50:32,480
these things look great on paper but

1370
00:50:29,679 --> 00:50:34,519
seeing them executed over time that's

1371
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:36,400
really what I would like and you know

1372
00:50:34,519 --> 00:50:38,759
I'm interested in the data too on like

1373
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,920
what varieties of mine grow well in the

1374
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:42,839
Caribbean you know so like from a

1375
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:45,720
breeding perspective then we can really

1376
00:50:42,838 --> 00:50:47,759
start yeah changing the world you know I

1377
00:50:45,719 --> 00:50:49,639
think with genetics you have um last

1378
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,000
time I was here a couple of months ago

1379
00:50:49,639 --> 00:50:52,078
um you showed me I mean I don't know how

1380
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,280
much you can talk about it because it

1381
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:56,440
might still be under wraps but you were

1382
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:59,760
talking about some real like analytical

1383
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:02,960
uh data research stuff that you're doing

1384
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:04,040
to learn how each cultiva responds to

1385
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,480
each yeah I thought it was really

1386
00:51:04,039 --> 00:51:06,920
fascinating well yeah and so basically

1387
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:08,440
we're we're a hub here and we're

1388
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:10,480
collecting all this data right on these

1389
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:12,240
cultivars but collecting it

1390
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,599
indoors you can get some really

1391
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:14,959
important information for other people

1392
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:16,960
that are growing indoors with your

1393
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,720
cultivars but then we can go take that

1394
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,960
same thing and we can have germ plasm

1395
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:23,159
sent all around the the world to these

1396
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:25,000
different climates and actually start

1397
00:51:23,159 --> 00:51:26,838
collecting data from how they perform in

1398
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,880
different environments and after you

1399
00:51:26,838 --> 00:51:30,880
have enough of them you can compare and

1400
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:33,358
get really useful information especially

1401
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:36,119
for breeding especially longterm and

1402
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:37,719
then creating you know cultivars that

1403
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:39,358
perform optimally in those different

1404
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:40,879
climates and really that's what we're

1405
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:43,279
chasing after that's what land race

1406
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,640
genetics typically are uh I think

1407
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,040
there's a confusion on what land race

1408
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:47,920
genetics are too I think a lot of people

1409
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:50,079
think land race are something that grow

1410
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:52,280
in the wild they're they're feral and

1411
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:54,119
that's just not the case land race are

1412
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:56,319
genetics that have been bred for a

1413
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:58,200
specific purpose in certain places in

1414
00:51:56,318 --> 00:52:00,000
the world and they don't necessarily

1415
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:01,759
have to be indigenous to that region but

1416
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,559
they're bred for a specific reason and

1417
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:06,799
typically they're optimal for that that

1418
00:52:03,559 --> 00:52:09,079
purpose or re reason and so I want to

1419
00:52:06,798 --> 00:52:11,798
get on that bandwagon and so start

1420
00:52:09,079 --> 00:52:13,318
optimizing genetics for certain places

1421
00:52:11,798 --> 00:52:14,838
and I think that that's what the world

1422
00:52:13,318 --> 00:52:16,279
needs is more optimization with

1423
00:52:14,838 --> 00:52:18,078
cultivars and and there's so many

1424
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:19,960
different uses there's that's the beauty

1425
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:22,000
of this plant is there's so many

1426
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:23,679
different uses not just the drug side of

1427
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,559
it but we can look at the you know the

1428
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:30,078
hemp side of it as far as Industrial

1429
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:32,440
hemp uh manufacturing for textiles uh

1430
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:34,480
seeds you know there's so you hemp seeds

1431
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:36,760
are extremely valuable can you so

1432
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:39,559
elaborate on the the land race aspect

1433
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:41,520
with what you talked about yeah um I

1434
00:52:39,559 --> 00:52:43,640
remember Ed Rosenthal was telling me

1435
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:45,759
that he wants to go to Jamaica yeah to

1436
00:52:43,639 --> 00:52:48,039
find a certain land race and the way I

1437
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:49,880
interpreted that was a a cultivar that

1438
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:52,159
was innate to Jamaica but is that not

1439
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:54,920
the case well it is it's so it's

1440
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:56,078
multiple Generations land race they've

1441
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:58,680
they've basically bred that through

1442
00:52:56,079 --> 00:53:01,160
multip generations for specific use and

1443
00:52:58,679 --> 00:53:03,318
it's the thing is these genetics these

1444
00:53:01,159 --> 00:53:05,078
varieties are dictated by climate

1445
00:53:03,318 --> 00:53:08,599
environment they're they're manipulated

1446
00:53:05,079 --> 00:53:10,920
from over time by the climate by the

1447
00:53:08,599 --> 00:53:12,599
nutrition by the basically by the

1448
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:14,440
environment and nutrition right so

1449
00:53:12,599 --> 00:53:16,760
that's what the phenotype that that

1450
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:18,760
expresses we have a genotype and that's

1451
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:20,480
basically the genotype is the DNA that's

1452
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:22,880
locked within the plant that doesn't

1453
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:25,000
change but phenotypical expression gets

1454
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:27,640
changed by environment and nutrition

1455
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:30,719
yeah yeah like you can have um the same

1456
00:53:27,639 --> 00:53:32,159
cultivar and um I mean I might sound

1457
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:33,519
real novice right now which I shouldn't

1458
00:53:32,159 --> 00:53:35,118
do I've been doing this for 10 years but

1459
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:37,199
I've only been you know making the films

1460
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:40,798
but I do try and educate myself a lot

1461
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:43,759
but I've seen the same cultivar MH but

1462
00:53:40,798 --> 00:53:46,079
one of them is so purple yeah and the

1463
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:49,480
other one is not sure and it could be

1464
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:52,079
that same exact plant the same genotype

1465
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:53,679
right right that's grown in Costa Rica

1466
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:54,960
right and grown in Alaska and it doesn't

1467
00:53:53,679 --> 00:53:56,598
even look like the same thing it doesn't

1468
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,960
smoke the same taste the same have the

1469
00:53:56,599 --> 00:54:01,280
same structure because it's influenced

1470
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:03,280
by its environment around it and so how

1471
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,240
about temperature cuz um I've heard like

1472
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:08,240
temperature is huge yeah so like it's

1473
00:54:05,239 --> 00:54:10,239
growing in a c yeah you see the purples

1474
00:54:08,239 --> 00:54:12,879
when it's uh you know cold yeah these

1475
00:54:10,239 --> 00:54:14,959
anthocyanins in the plant uh that make

1476
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:17,039
the plant purple especially in colder

1477
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,960
climates some plants are just naturally

1478
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:20,759
purple and no matter how hot it is or

1479
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:23,119
cold it is they will they will be purple

1480
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:24,960
but a lot of things are influenced by

1481
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:26,880
their environment so cold nighttime

1482
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:29,480
temperatures or cold temperatures in

1483
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:31,640
general they'll purple out um and then

1484
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:33,400
that can also change the flavor right

1485
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:35,639
and so there's specific flavors when

1486
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:36,880
people say it tastes purple you know

1487
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:39,358
they're talking about the floral

1488
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:40,960
characteristics a lot of times uh that

1489
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:43,039
you get with that but like yeah there's

1490
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:45,519
people that talk about it tasting like a

1491
00:54:43,039 --> 00:54:47,119
color and there is a color association

1492
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:50,239
with a flavor with cannabis and it's

1493
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:51,838
pretty wild so if this um you know if

1494
00:54:50,239 --> 00:54:53,159
anyone was tuning into to this episode

1495
00:54:51,838 --> 00:54:55,119
to learn anything about weed that was

1496
00:54:53,159 --> 00:54:58,239
your five minutes right there the rest

1497
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:59,760
of it's just anecdotal [ __ ] but um yeah

1498
00:54:58,239 --> 00:55:03,679
we were talking about transferable

1499
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:05,799
skills Chef to breeder um and you know

1500
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:07,719
filmmaker to cannabis content creator

1501
00:55:05,798 --> 00:55:09,239
and there's a certain aspect of

1502
00:55:07,719 --> 00:55:11,439
knowledge that's required well you've

1503
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:13,479
learned a lot about cannabis from

1504
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:15,838
learned a lot yeah I I met Eric nug

1505
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:18,159
shots for the first time oh nice I'm big

1506
00:55:15,838 --> 00:55:19,759
I'm a big fan of his he is a badass yeah

1507
00:55:18,159 --> 00:55:22,038
and you can tell you know you can tell

1508
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:24,880
that that guy is very well versed in you

1509
00:55:22,039 --> 00:55:26,839
know uh can in cannabis and cultivation

1510
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:29,400
yeah for sure well in in there's a whole

1511
00:55:26,838 --> 00:55:31,119
side of it to like there's guys I mean

1512
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:33,280
we've experienced it with guys coming in

1513
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:34,838
with photography skills where it's like

1514
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:36,599
okay I need you to shoot this and it's

1515
00:55:34,838 --> 00:55:38,838
like dude those seeds look like garbage

1516
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:40,440
but you have to educate somebody on same

1517
00:55:38,838 --> 00:55:44,038
thing with a plant and and what I love

1518
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:46,280
about cannabis photography so much is as

1519
00:55:44,039 --> 00:55:47,760
as a breeder and as a cultivator someone

1520
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:49,920
who's been working with the plant for so

1521
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:51,640
long when these guys pick the plants

1522
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:54,440
they've done some amazing stuff with DNA

1523
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:56,358
too yeah but uh yeah the spinning photos

1524
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:58,240
and this stuff it has to be perfect and

1525
00:55:56,358 --> 00:56:00,199
the thing is is if you have tips of your

1526
00:55:58,239 --> 00:56:02,598
leaves that are burnt or if you have

1527
00:56:00,199 --> 00:56:04,118
flaws it's there forever it shows up

1528
00:56:02,599 --> 00:56:06,599
it's very especially with these high

1529
00:56:04,119 --> 00:56:08,880
definition photos like everything stands

1530
00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:11,160
out so you have to pick the perfect Cola

1531
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:13,358
at the perfect time and have it still

1532
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:15,679
alive and happy when you shoot the photo

1533
00:56:13,358 --> 00:56:17,318
it was Todd McCormack who taught me all

1534
00:56:15,679 --> 00:56:19,440
about I was completely nous about

1535
00:56:17,318 --> 00:56:21,558
layering about photo stacking photo

1536
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,039
stack I went to his house uh we went to

1537
00:56:21,559 --> 00:56:25,480
stay with him for a couple of days and I

1538
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:26,799
was like so Todd why is your camera on

1539
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:28,639
this

1540
00:56:26,798 --> 00:56:29,719
it seems to be moving forward why do you

1541
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:32,358
have to go out of the room when you

1542
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:34,439
start yeah it's like yeah I've been over

1543
00:56:32,358 --> 00:56:36,960
there and seen his yeah yeah he taught

1544
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:40,720
me that so he was doing that 10 more

1545
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:42,798
than 10 years 12 this was 2015 yeah so

1546
00:56:40,719 --> 00:56:44,480
yeah he's been doing it for a long time

1547
00:56:42,798 --> 00:56:47,239
yeah and I think I I remember him doing

1548
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:50,119
some photos for us a long 2012 or

1549
00:56:47,239 --> 00:56:52,959
something like that know wild but yeah

1550
00:56:50,119 --> 00:56:54,838
technology has gotten so Advanced now I

1551
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,440
mean even the new iPhones for for

1552
00:56:54,838 --> 00:56:57,838
photography for cannabis is like the

1553
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:59,720
phones are better than the cameras that

1554
00:56:57,838 --> 00:57:01,119
we used to have yeah yeah man even the

1555
00:56:59,719 --> 00:57:04,038
video CER I've been implementing my

1556
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:06,039
phone into you know my workflow a lot

1557
00:57:04,039 --> 00:57:11,960
like I remember um we filmed this show

1558
00:57:06,039 --> 00:57:13,520
on iPhones you do no but you could you

1559
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:15,440
you would never know you would never

1560
00:57:13,519 --> 00:57:18,679
know yeah I'm like we do I wouldn't tell

1561
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:21,200
you if you did but yeah yeah I wanted to

1562
00:57:18,679 --> 00:57:23,159
um there was an anecdotal story I wanted

1563
00:57:21,199 --> 00:57:25,038
to talk about just because it was um

1564
00:57:23,159 --> 00:57:27,879
pretty funny might be incriminating for

1565
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:28,839
Ricky Williams so I will um disclaim it

1566
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:32,880
first

1567
00:57:28,838 --> 00:57:35,239
but one of my favorite um memories of

1568
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:39,400
making a piece of content was with Ricky

1569
00:57:35,239 --> 00:57:41,838
Williams um at the time being a Brit

1570
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:43,680
didn't know who he was um my colleagues

1571
00:57:41,838 --> 00:57:45,000
did as oh my gosh this is a big deal

1572
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:47,038
like Rick's going to come and do some

1573
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,039
stuff for home he's a stoner too and oh

1574
00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:52,359
yeah yeah he's totally into astrology

1575
00:57:49,039 --> 00:57:55,640
and um smoking weed learning about you

1576
00:57:52,358 --> 00:57:58,119
know uh all of that stuff yeah um so he

1577
00:57:55,639 --> 00:58:02,318
came to my house in San Diego um but you

1578
00:57:58,119 --> 00:58:04,440
know as hospitable as you know I am

1579
00:58:02,318 --> 00:58:06,358
that's that's all I could offer Ricky

1580
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:08,358
Williams I couldn't do the whole thing

1581
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:11,119
because I don't know who Ricky was yeah

1582
00:58:08,358 --> 00:58:13,038
but what a really nice guy um so yeah we

1583
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:16,880
spent the day interviewing him at my

1584
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:18,920
house and um I wanted some props I was

1585
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:20,920
like we need you know something to

1586
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:23,960
contextualize this video so let's pull

1587
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:26,519
some plants from the garden and Parker

1588
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:29,199
he's our head grower over at homegrown

1589
00:58:26,519 --> 00:58:31,119
yeah um he had a garden full of uh

1590
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:32,719
plants that they weren't flowering at

1591
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:35,160
that time so but they were you know

1592
00:58:32,719 --> 00:58:37,038
pretty tall I said Parker like we need

1593
00:58:35,159 --> 00:58:39,920
we need a few plants for the set so we

1594
00:58:37,039 --> 00:58:42,359
rented a U-Haul and we filled it with

1595
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:46,960
probably like 15 plants yeah I think

1596
00:58:42,358 --> 00:58:48,759
they're in um 25 gallon pots maybe wow

1597
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:50,079

transplanted big Parts though yeah big

1600
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:56,720

1601
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:58,838
filled up the U-Haul with it and then we

1602
00:58:56,719 --> 00:59:00,439
dressed my we went into my yard and we

1603
00:58:58,838 --> 00:59:03,000
dressed the set with these plants and it

1604
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:05,280
looked pretty nice um and then we

1605
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,559
interviewed Ricky and I was like right

1606
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:09,599
we've done the interview but I really

1607
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:11,599
want to get some b-roll yeah you know

1608
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:14,200
contextualize the interview get some of

1609
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:15,798
you smoking where can we do that and

1610
00:59:14,199 --> 00:59:18,318
Ricky was like well you know I grew up

1611
00:59:15,798 --> 00:59:19,639
here in San Diego yeah so oh no I

1612
00:59:18,318 --> 00:59:20,960
actually didn't know that I also didn't

1613
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:22,679
know that you played football until like

1614
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:25,280
20 minutes ago oh

1615
00:59:22,679 --> 00:59:27,078
wow I've you know I mean I wouldn't say

1616
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:28,480
Ricky and I were like Chums but you know

1617
00:59:27,079 --> 00:59:31,760
if we bumped into each other we'd know

1618
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:34,400
who one another are sure um so he said I

1619
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:36,319
went to Patrick Henry High School which

1620
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:38,358
is in San Diego and they've got a field

1621
00:59:36,318 --> 00:59:41,239
there um I was like well why don't we go

1622
00:59:38,358 --> 00:59:43,400
there and we'll um we'll film you just

1623
00:59:41,239 --> 00:59:46,038
throwing some balls and walking up and

1624
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:49,639
down and carrying on so he said yeah no

1625
00:59:46,039 --> 00:59:52,760
problem I'll meet you there so he he off

1626
00:59:49,639 --> 00:59:54,639
he went on his own and um I thought I'd

1627
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:56,119
kill two birds with one stone I was like

1628
00:59:54,639 --> 00:59:58,118
so what we'll do is we'll load all these

1629
00:59:56,119 --> 00:59:59,720
plants into the U-Haul yeah we'll drive

1630
00:59:58,119 --> 01:00:02,519
to Patrick Henry High which is a [ __ ]

1631
00:59:59,719 --> 01:00:04,279
high school yeah and we'll do the bit

1632
01:00:02,519 --> 01:00:05,480
with Ricky and then we'll get back in

1633
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:07,680
U-Haul and we'll take them back to the

1634
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:09,440
garden and put them where they were nice

1635
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:11,358
and that's what we did uh the school was

1636
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:13,119
closed too but Ricky was like ah we'll

1637
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:14,798
just hop the fence and you know of

1638
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:16,680
course we went we went and did all of

1639
01:00:14,798 --> 01:00:19,280
the cool [ __ ] with Ricky filmed and it

1640
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:21,399
was a great day and then um breaking the

1641
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,920
law with Ricky William yeah well he he

1642
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:25,280
wasn't breaking the law that's why I

1643
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:27,798
have to disclaim it he had no knowledge

1644
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:30,319
that and I showed up to the school with

1645
01:00:27,798 --> 01:00:32,280
a truck filled with weed plants like a

1646
01:00:30,318 --> 01:00:34,639
high school like he had absolutely no

1647
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:36,000
knowledge of this and I neither did I I

1648
01:00:34,639 --> 01:00:37,598
didn't even think about it to be honest

1649
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,559
with you think about it like that in

1650
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:41,960
that context yeah but then when I got

1651
01:00:39,559 --> 01:00:44,519
back I was like dude did we go to a high

1652

01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:16,440
in this Farmhouse which was like

1665
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:18,440
honestly when we got there I don't think

1666
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:20,400
it had been touched since like know the

1667
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:22,838
narcos were running the place yeah it

1668
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:25,039
was like they said it was a stash house

1669
01:01:22,838 --> 01:01:27,639
that Don and Aaron and res didn't the

1670
01:01:25,039 --> 01:01:28,920
the guy the guide did yeah I was like

1671
01:01:27,639 --> 01:01:30,480

1672
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:31,838

1673
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,798
Don and Aaron and then we went to all of

1674
01:01:31,838 --> 01:01:37,639
these Farms the next day and we made

1675
01:01:33,798 --> 01:01:39,559
this really cool video and um that was a

1676
01:01:37,639 --> 01:01:42,358
really good memory of mine and I didn't

1677
01:01:39,559 --> 01:01:44,079
know what to think of of Don and Aaron

1678
01:01:42,358 --> 01:01:46,038
because we hadn't spent a lot of time

1679
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:49,240
together but you know those guys are

1680
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:51,960
just the most humble like him Don Rez

1681
01:01:49,239 --> 01:01:53,959
yeah guys ever and I'm going to Colombia

1682

do these guys do Coke do they not do

1683
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:59,519
Coke turns out that they don't so I was

1684
01:01:56,159 --> 01:02:01,318
in safe hands so um uh yeah you know we

1685
01:01:59,519 --> 01:02:03,400
went to Colombia we didn't do any

1686
01:02:01,318 --> 01:02:05,119
cocaine and we did a really good uh job

1687
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:07,599

1691
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:15,519
have been disappointed a little bit but

1692
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:18,000
you know it's like I'm an adult I was

1693
01:02:15,519 --> 01:02:21,759

1695
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:25,119
adventure Bogota is one of the most

1696
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:27,239
beautiful cities it's also huge like

1697
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:28,720
that's the biggest did you see did you

1698
01:02:27,239 --> 01:02:31,118
see that hospital there's a hospital

1699
01:02:28,719 --> 01:02:33,078
that's just half built uh and it's been

1700
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:35,160
there since like the 80s and it was

1701
01:02:33,079 --> 01:02:36,960
actually being built by the Naros as a

1702
01:02:35,159 --> 01:02:38,519
narco Hospital wow but then the

1703
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:41,039
government obviously infiltrated the

1704
01:02:38,519 --> 01:02:42,559
Naros ended that era so the hospital's

1705
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:44,278
still there half built off the side of

1706

1708
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,760

still what we're doing right now is

1774
01:05:06,318 --> 01:05:10,278
we're sort of cultivating um the

1775
01:05:08,798 --> 01:05:11,798
interviews because we have all of the

1776
01:05:10,278 --> 01:05:14,358
resources already because you know at

1777
01:05:11,798 --> 01:05:16,000
homegrown we have our own production arm

1778
01:05:14,358 --> 01:05:18,719
yeah so we have the cameras we have the

1779
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:21,318
lights so when it's convenient to

1780
01:05:18,719 --> 01:05:23,239
anybody to that you know that wants to

participate in the film yeah we'll work

1782
01:05:23,239 --> 01:05:26,798
around their schedule we'll go and

1783
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:29,039
interview them then when it does come to

1784
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:31,838
time to tie the whole thing together and

1785
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:33,559
we've got the budget for that then um

1786
01:05:31,838 --> 01:05:36,000
we'll have more of an idea on when it's

1787
01:05:33,559 --> 01:05:37,519
ready to be released we have actually uh

1788
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,440
Uncle Rick is in one of our

1789
01:05:37,519 --> 01:05:42,199
documentaries that we've been working on

1790
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:44,400
with Steve D'Angelo for the last six

1791
01:05:42,199 --> 01:05:45,838
months and so we've just filmed when we

1792
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,119
can and we've taken long breaks in

1793
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:49,078
between yeah I think I was actually

1794
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:51,160
right I was lucky enough to you know

1795
01:05:49,079 --> 01:05:52,960
review some of it already for Ryan yeah

1796
01:05:51,159 --> 01:05:54,278
and it's coming along really nicely yeah

1797
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:57,159
it's a fun one and I feel like there's a

1798
01:05:54,278 --> 01:05:59,639
lot of good content and and uh these

1799
01:05:57,159 --> 01:06:01,480

know I really enjoy the podcast and

1802
01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:07,358
being able to tell the stories but it's

1803
01:06:04,798 --> 01:06:08,480
guys like Rick and Luke scarmazzo and

1804
01:06:07,358 --> 01:06:10,558
Steve

1805
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:11,880
D'Angelo uh who's you know it's funny

1806
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:14,798
because Steve has gotten a little bit of

1807
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:17,760
hate lately and Steve is just a great

1808
01:06:14,798 --> 01:06:19,599
guy and he's a Pioneer in his own right

01:06:23,639 --> 01:06:26,358
friends with them over the past few

1813

1815
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:34,119
looked up to when I was younger Andrew

1816
01:06:31,358 --> 01:06:36,679
has the most fascinating hemp shoes that

1817
01:06:34,119 --> 01:06:38,680
have this weird mushroom trippy like

1818
01:06:36,679 --> 01:06:41,919
aesthetic to him he's the most amazing

1819
01:06:38,679 --> 01:06:44,879
ex yeah he's mushrooms in Sarah Andre I

1820
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:47,240
mean I've so as far as energy and

1821
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:49,240
learning how to talk on camera Andrew

1822
01:06:47,239 --> 01:06:51,838
has given me the best pointers it's like

1823
01:06:49,239 --> 01:06:53,000
his experience with film as an actor

1824
01:06:51,838 --> 01:06:55,798
yeah it's like when I have questions

1825
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:57,239
about stuff about film or opinions he's

1826
01:06:55,798 --> 01:06:59,960
always got an opinion and it's always

1827
01:06:57,239 --> 01:07:01,759
something positive so yeah it's a good a

1828
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:03,199
good people yeah yeah well that's been

1829
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:05,160
the beauty of this podcast we filmed

1830
01:07:03,199 --> 01:07:08,038
over 90 episodes now and it's like I've

1831
01:07:05,159 --> 01:07:10,358
learned so much from my guests yeah and

1832
01:07:08,039 --> 01:07:11,720
gotten so much Insight on different

1833
01:07:10,358 --> 01:07:13,119
things that I never would have thought

1834
01:07:11,719 --> 01:07:15,798
in the beginning that I you know because

1835
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:17,640
I I did a podcast during covid so that's

1836
01:07:15,798 --> 01:07:18,960
when it all started I did 43 episodes on

1837
01:07:17,639 --> 01:07:21,480
the future cannabis project it was

1838
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:23,039
called the James Loud Show and I got a

1839
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:24,199
lot of insight from people had

1840
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:27,400
scientists on there but it was really

1841
01:07:24,199 --> 01:07:29,278
breeding focused and now so it's more

1842
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:31,160
about the Cannabis industry and all the

1843
01:07:29,278 --> 01:07:33,039
different aspects yeah and I'm able to

1844
01:07:31,159 --> 01:07:34,440
get these I feel like almost puzzle

1845
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:36,720
pieces like you're another piece of the

1846
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:38,519
puzzle right you get to get added to the

1847
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:40,038
big puzzle yeah we should have uh we

1848
01:07:38,519 --> 01:07:41,798

1849
01:07:40,039 --> 01:07:43,359

1850

great and he's a lot of fun and you know

1857
01:07:56,119 --> 01:07:59,680
but there are all these pieces to the

1858
01:07:57,679 --> 01:08:02,078
puzzle we're telling this bigger story

1859
01:07:59,679 --> 01:08:04,719
and and Kyle is you know his he's doing

know it's like and everybody has their

1867
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:19,920
own side of the story and I feel like

1868
01:08:17,319 --> 01:08:21,679
looking back 50 years from now I'm not

1869
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:24,679
going to be around in 50 years more than

1870
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:26,079
likely you never know but more than

1871
01:08:24,679 --> 01:08:27,279
likely I'm not going to be around in 50

1872
01:08:26,079 --> 01:08:29,559
years but you'll be able to see the

1873
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:32,679
stories of all these great people

1874
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:36,520
and I feel like we're just contributing

1875
01:08:32,679 --> 01:08:37,920
to the the bigger community and I think

1876
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:39,719
people are going to need to hear stories

1877
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:41,880
about why the world was so [ __ ] up

1878
01:08:39,719 --> 01:08:43,920
right now you know and how Canabis saved

1879
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:46,279
it and how cannabis saved it or directly

1880
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:49,199
from the mouths of the people that lived

1881
01:08:46,279 --> 01:08:51,480
those stories rather than saying this

1882
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:53,039
person did this in a history book yeah

1883
01:08:51,479 --> 01:08:55,879
that we've had forever you know I feel

1884
01:08:53,039 --> 01:08:57,640
like now we have a real inter and

1885
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:59,359
detailed timeline of the things that

1886
01:08:57,640 --> 01:09:02,119
went on directly from the people's

1887
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:03,400
mouths that's what I love you know and I

1888
01:09:02,119 --> 01:09:04,719
love that too especially about your

1889
01:09:03,399 --> 01:09:06,479
podcast I remember you saying out on

1890
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:07,719
mine you know yeah keeping the Legends

1891
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:10,238
alive they're not going to be around

1892
01:09:07,719 --> 01:09:12,239
forever they've contributed so much and

1893
01:09:10,238 --> 01:09:15,519
yeah we got to get that documented for

1894
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:17,318
sure and and cannabis you know it's been

1895
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:19,319
it's been turned into for the longest

1896
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:21,199
time it was demonized right is this bad

1897
01:09:19,319 --> 01:09:23,400
thing and I think being able to share

1898
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:24,678
these stories how it actually makes the

1899
01:09:23,399 --> 01:09:26,198
world a better place that's a beautiful

1900
01:09:24,679 --> 01:09:27,440
thing to be part of something like that

1901
01:09:26,198 --> 01:09:30,559
you know I'm proud to be part of that

1902
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:32,599
too for sure and in the most unlikely of

1903
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:34,359
circumstances yeah coming from a country

1904
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:36,199
where it's completely Contraband where

1905
01:09:34,359 --> 01:09:40,279
the word would be like hey well you know

1906
01:09:36,198 --> 01:09:43,838
you could be in jail for you know just I

1907
01:09:40,279 --> 01:09:46,040
can't even explain how you know the

1908
01:09:43,838 --> 01:09:48,359
contrast between how it is in America to

1909
01:09:46,039 --> 01:09:51,000
how it is in in Europe and the UK and

1910
01:09:48,359 --> 01:09:53,159
even how it still is right and it's it's

1911
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,880
ways yeah slowly but surely changing I

1912
01:09:53,158 --> 01:09:58,158
mean they have medical there yet or not

1913
01:09:54,880 --> 01:10:00,359
yet but in the UK they will yeah maybe I

1914
01:09:58,158 --> 01:10:01,920
think I've heard in some circumstances

1915
01:10:00,359 --> 01:10:04,198
you know maybe like in a charlott web

1916
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:08,319
sort of like dire circumstance it's

1917
01:10:04,198 --> 01:10:09,639
possible yeah but but otherwise no but

1918
01:10:08,319 --> 01:10:11,559
yeah in the most unlikeliest of

1919
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:13,719
circumstances I did not see my career

1920
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:16,000
unfolding down this Avenue but I'm very

1921
01:10:13,719 --> 01:10:18,679
very happy it did and I'm really happy

1922
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:21,158
to be a part of this community and

1923
01:10:18,679 --> 01:10:24,000
create content and to have it received

1924
01:10:21,158 --> 01:10:26,359
by the people that watch it and um those

1925
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,520
