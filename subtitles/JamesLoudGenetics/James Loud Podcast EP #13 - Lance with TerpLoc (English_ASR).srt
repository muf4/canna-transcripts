podcast today my guest is Lance and he

6
00:00:16,618 --> 00:00:19,859
works with terplock now but we've known

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,480
each other for a long time how you doing

8
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:22,800
Lance I'm doing really good man stoked

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,560
to finally be up here dude it's great

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,339
having you on uh I guess let's start off

11
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:31,739
talking about uh Spain in 2019 the best

12
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:34,259
interview I've ever done that never

13
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:36,000
aired I know that was frustrating we

14
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:38,699
slowly hit up Peter for that yeah that

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,019
was I'd known about you both of us you

16
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,579
know being from the bay area in

17
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,859
background and it's kind of similar

18
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,780
backgrounds you know I um saved up for

19
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:48,000
college thanks to flower thanks to this

20
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,439
plant and uh so I've been following you

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,238
for a while so when Peter's like hey you

22
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,159
gotta interview James I'm like yeah dude

23
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:54,238
I'm all about it nice and it was cool it

24
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:55,558
was nice because you're like right

25
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:57,839
across from where we were set up with

26
00:00:55,558 --> 00:01:00,238
the company eyes at at the time and uh

27
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,000
dude you're you're doing your thing and

28
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:05,158
it was nice to see a domestic genetics

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,719
company in Spain because like you know

30
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,520
we don't have to go too far now because

31
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:09,658
you know all about this but

32
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:10,978
um you know there's two episodes centers

33
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,020
as far as I'm concerned with genetics

34
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:15,239
and Spain's one and in California is the

35
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:16,618
other yeah and so you're there and a lot

36
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:18,478
of people don't know if you're not

37
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:19,680
familiar with spanibus uh you know start

38
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,438
out as a protestable like most

39
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:26,040
International but I just did an audit of

40
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:28,919
the show last year 21 of the exhibitors

41
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,479
are genetics so people don't realize

42
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,500
that and you you know you notice it when

43
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:33,539
you're walking through because we've

44
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,618
done several of them over the years but

45
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,900
then when you put that in perspective

46
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:38,819
it's like one out of five booths yeah

47
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,380
our genetics and about five different

48
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:42,839
companies make the seeds for all of them

49
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:44,280
XC and you know exactly true as well and

50
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,380
some of them come up and some people

51
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,879
know that and some people don't but uh

52
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:49,379
but again to see that American

53
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:51,179
representation there's a few other

54
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:53,280
companies but you're on an awesome

55
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,840
trajectory and I think the thing that

56
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,519
I've always been a fan about as far as

57
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,200
what you do is is the genetics that

58
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:59,759
you're into because I'm into the

59
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,500
generational stuff like I'm talking

60
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,379
about more the land race you know like

61
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:07,259
you know Acapulco Gold and Swahili and

62
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:08,579
Durban Poison and just all these

63
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:12,060
genetics that really were at the core

64
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:14,879
yeah back in the day so that interview I

65
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,439
had uh taken a micro dose of what I

66
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:19,019
thought was a micro dose of mushrooms

67
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:21,840
and then the funny part of the story is

68
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:25,980
that I was uh high on mushrooms I

69
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:29,039
actually was talking to Mario and to jai

70
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:30,238
they were arguing actually and so I was

71
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:31,560
like I gotta get out of here and then

72
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,459
next thing you know you're grabbing my

73
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,219
arm and you're like we need to do this

74
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:36,439
interview and I'm like

75
00:02:34,219 --> 00:02:38,818
okay

76
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:40,560
you ended up giving me a hug afterwards

77
00:02:38,818 --> 00:02:41,818
and I was like I think it's the best

78
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,780
interview I've ever done you're like I

79
00:02:41,818 --> 00:02:46,199
think it was a really good interview

80
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:48,239
yeah and then uh I I went away and you

81
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:50,399
came back maybe an hour later and you're

82
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,599
like dude we didn't have the sound dude

83
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,760
the sound on the microphone we have the

84
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:55,738
sound from the yeah the camcorder but

85
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,299
that was it yeah yeah it's frustrating

86
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:58,980
that the guy who was on site there that

87
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,660
Peter hired which he obviously did not

88
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:02,098
hire again

89
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:03,359
um but it was tough yeah because we lost

90
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:04,619
quite a bit on that and there were some

91
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,800
of the best interviews to your point

92
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,879
like it was so natural and both of us

93
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,819
not to speak for you but I feel like

94
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:13,199
we're very approachable impersonable and

95
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:15,299
we're about Good Vibes and we're about

96
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,098
community and you don't have to be from

97
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,719
NorCal to have this mentality but

98
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:20,579
there's enough of us to do so when you

99
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,620
get a few of us together right it just

100
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,540
flows it's not scripted right and

101
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,980
sometimes talking about like deviating

102
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:27,719
from talking about genetics and talking

103
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:30,419
about the passion for the sacred plant

104
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:32,340
and you know why we're all doing this I

105
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:34,018
think that's important and you know

106
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,920
sometimes that gets overlooked a little

107
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:37,439
bit and

108
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:39,419
you know and you know I just went to

109
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:42,719
three days of dead and Company and I

110
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:45,000
think we're here in part to the Grateful

111
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:47,818
Dead and their their influence on the

112
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,259
Cannabis industry uh you know Brands

113
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:52,158
like Anchor Steam that we just found out

114
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:54,598
Anchor Steam is now closing doors after

115
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:57,179
130 years or something like that it's

116
00:03:54,598 --> 00:04:00,298
insane you know and Fred Maytag he's a

117
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:02,760
big contributor to the reason cannabis

118
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:04,200
is legal in my opinion no true and and

119
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:06,298
we talked about that a little bit before

120
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:08,098
this like like I was telling you you

121
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:09,659
know when I people ask me and I love

122
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:11,938
doing these interviews during 4 20

123
00:04:09,658 --> 00:04:13,079
because people feel like they're still a

124
00:04:11,938 --> 00:04:14,459
Mystique and they don't quite know the

125
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,739
story and I'm like no the story is very

126
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:18,298
factual like if you're so I'm from Marin

127
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:20,039
County you know San Anselmo which is

128
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:21,539
right next to San Rafael and in the

129
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,639
Waldo's like we were discussing you know

130
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,259
who went to school at San Rafael high

131
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:27,360
and and you know eyes over Sir Francis

132
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:28,800
Drake but they're a little bit older

133
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,240
than us you know I'm friends with one of

134
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,000
their daughters but they were class of

135
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,379
71 but it's like no this we know this

136
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,839
history we know they're looking for the

137
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:38,699
Lost crime crop out at the beach and and

138
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:40,198
we know that all of a sudden they start

139
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:42,120
you know when the guys started touring

140
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:45,240
as a roadie with the dad and that kind

141
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:48,300
of took 420 to that National level and I

142
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,860
mean it's just there is a history in the

143
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,240
one thing I like that nobody argues is

144
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,919
like this really is the epicenter for

145
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,680
the culture and craft while the country

146
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:58,079
is falling behind on legalization and I

147
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,519
contribute that to extreme capitalism

148
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:00,959
um you have over three dozen countries

149
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,359
that have legalized already around the

150
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:05,279
world but no one can argue like and you

151
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,600
know this you travel too man I as in

152
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:09,000
Thailand in January and people like

153
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,800
you're from NorCal man Humboldt flat

154
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,620
Australia they know humble South America

155
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,819
they know humble you know if some know

156
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,160
the triangle

157
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:19,560
a few no Mendocino nobody knows Trinity

158
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,939
County that's a funny thing you know the

159
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,079
Emerald Triangle it's actually Three

160
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:23,160
Counties they're like really and I'm

161
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:24,959
like can you name it you always love

162
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,880
poison people but there is a lot of

163
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:29,459
history and there's a lot of influence

164
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:32,219
um you know post Summer Love post hippie

165
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:34,560
Hill in a carried through from that 60s

166
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,620
70s and still today with what guys like

167
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,720
you were doing yeah yeah so so when did

168
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:42,300
you start smoking uh late 80s early 90s

169
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:45,900
I started yeah oh my gosh man that's a

170
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:48,538
good uh it was either 89 or 90 yeah as a

171
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:50,279
young teen I had older siblings so

172
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:51,599
um pros and cons to that you know I

173
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:54,659
started partying a little bit younger

174
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,220
and um like we've talked about like I

175
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,840
said you know mine back in the day it

176
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,180
was tough because we got some good stuff

177
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:01,619
off the hill but as kids it was like

178
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:03,720
either you got stuff from South of the

179
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,000
Border the brick weed you know Mexi Tire

180
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,800
whatever it was or at the time for me

181
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,418
the coveted was was Northern Lights

182
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,100
because I was really hot back then right

183
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:12,959
I mean you could come across a little

184
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,360
again a little Swahili or maybe someone

185
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,859
had some Durban or something but that

186
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,620
that was my early experience was either

187
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,538
you're going to be totally blasted or

188
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,038
you can consume it all day you know yeah

189
00:06:21,538 --> 00:06:24,779
and we had a lot of times it was green

190
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:26,219
Bud you're buying green Bud we bought

191
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:28,079
green bud and it could have been any

192
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,520
name you know not really knowing what it

193
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:31,740
was it was there was green and brown

194
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:33,359
yeah that was it it was green and brown

195
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,759
and then there's snap crackle pop right

196
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,560
like I remember and I'm gonna say man

197
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,240
the kids these days don't know we went

198
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,860
up the hill you know two miles in snow

199
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,139
both ways to school I'm not trying to be

200
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,120
like a fallen old head but dude we were

201
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:46,978
picking out sticks and stems and and

202
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,300
seeds and you know of course we tried to

203
00:06:46,978 --> 00:06:50,699
grow those seeds I'm sure you did just

204
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:53,879
like I did and totally and there's good

205
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:56,340
stuff in there yeah I wish I would had

206
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:57,079
more stuff saved you know what I mean I

207
00:06:56,339 --> 00:06:59,038
think

208
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:00,779
especially you know some of the the

209
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:02,159
Mexican stuff that they that we were

210
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:04,019
getting I mean there's a lot of good

211
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,639
genetics in there there is it wasn't

212
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:08,459
grown necessarily the best it wasn't

213
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:09,600
cured or dried properly and it would get

214
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:11,219
you really high but a lot of times you

215
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,319
get a headache from smoking it yeah you

216
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:15,000
would you like a strong debilitating

217
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:18,539
headache you know tight behind the eyes

218
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,519
not like headband but like in pain in

219
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:22,139
something else it was yeah it was

220
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:24,418
different times and you know I remember

221
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:26,519
slinging and it's something it's

222
00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:27,959
interesting man because I didn't even I

223
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:29,399
think we talked about it before man you

224
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:31,560
know I came out of the proverbial Green

225
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:33,779
Closet in the teens you know because

226
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,639
while flower was a big part of my life

227
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:37,439
growing up and growing I mean I remember

228
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:39,960
going down and boarding in Half Moon Bay

229
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:41,399
my buddy's Uncle grew in Scott's Valley

230
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:43,318
and we'd swing by there on the way to

231
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:45,120
Capitola for Pizza My Heart Right for

232
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:46,500
lunch it's like these memories of

233
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,120
hanging out with these old heads that

234
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,879
they were growing some fantastic stuff

235
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,560
and the bud wasn't highly manicured it

236
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,839
sure as hell wasn't indoor it was either

237
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,478
hoop or outdoor in their Garden buried

238
00:07:54,839 --> 00:08:00,119
between totally you know crops and and

239
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:01,500
it's just it's nostalgic but it

240
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,879
definitely has changed but it was a

241
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,439
different time and your point sometimes

242
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,598
it's just it was green or it was brown

243
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:08,699
it was good it was great yeah you know

244
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:11,279
yeah we got we so we used to drive down

245
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:12,720
for eighths of weed into Santa Cruz and

246
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:15,299
it was called the strawberry but it was

247
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,680
skunk it was a skunk but it was the

248
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,120
reason it was called strawberry was

249
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,038
because it was strawberry sized nuggets

250
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,019
had nothing to do with the flavor it was

251
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:24,060
the structure it was the skunk weed it

252
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:26,279
was like you know what I would you know

253
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:28,319
people say road kill skunk whatever but

254
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:30,299
this stuff was strong skunk not cat piss

255
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,399
they had the ammonia it's just it was

256
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,680
just straight skunk and it tasted skunk

257
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,719
down to the roach and one little butt of

258
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,859
it would just smell everything up which

259
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,360
you don't really see stuff like that

260
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,440
anymore you don't you don't man it's

261
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,940
interesting what some of the guys are

262
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,440
smoking up on the hill like I go up

263
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,940
there and still and you know it was a

264
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,500
little more popular a few years back but

265
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,779
forbidden fruit's a good example of that

266
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,879
you know so we talk about the stuff you

267
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:53,039
know it's time some it was so I really

268
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:54,600
felt my age but in a good way when I so

269
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:55,980
you were at the the Dead Ahead over the

270
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,860
weekend I was at Northern Nights Music

271
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,720
Festival which is Heavy Music yeah they

272
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,700
had you know some great bands and some

273
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,080
great DJs but the undertone is health

274
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,820
and wellness and culture and craft it

275
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,320
takes place on the border of Humboldt

276
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,060
Mendocino County like you're in the

277
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,379
heart of Emerald Triangle right and I'm

278
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:11,819
sitting kind of preaching to these kids

279
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:13,919
and telling them some of the stories and

280
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:15,959
I'm like you know there is a reason why

281
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:17,579
genetics morphed and changed over the

282
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:19,439
years especially in the 80s with War on

283
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,120
Drugs because the guys that were grown

284
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,580
up on the hill they need to be mindful

285
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,200
of the smell yeah and the way that they

286
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,360
were able to grow now under hoop now

287
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,860
undercover and so you're right even the

288
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,080
indoor guys though because there was no

289
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,539
filtration like we have no not at all

290
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,339
even in the 90s we did have filtration

291
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:37,319
but it didn't always work effectively

292
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:39,060
and not today I mean and we won't call

293
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,980
it names of specific Brands but there's

294
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:42,899
a few companies that are killing it with

295
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,700
that filtration and you wouldn't be any

296
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:46,799
of the wiser for what's being produced

297
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,959
but but one cultivar going back to his

298
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:50,879
forbidden fruit and that stuff so as

299
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:52,079
explained to them and it's interesting I

300
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:53,820
kind of I love quizzing people because

301
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,500
I'm a facts guy but I love sharing and

302
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,839
educating so I'm like do you know what

303
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,480
the median THC is of of legal flower

304
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,220
across this country you know and I asked

305
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,360
these five guys and they're all part of

306
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,459
the production team so it's kind of cool

307
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:10,320
so they've been around it and stuff and

308
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:13,500
um you know one's like oh 25 21 23 40 15

309
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:16,019
like will the median THC levels 21 not

310
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,720
that everything revolves around THC I

311
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:20,339
said so take forbidden fruit what do you

312
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,420
think the median THC is they're like I

313
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:23,820
want to go through a whole process I'm

314
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:25,799
like it's about 15 16 yeah but the

315
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,600
terpene percentage we're talking five

316
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:29,879
percent six when the median's like one

317
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,159
percent so I started explaining to them

318
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,539
you know if if cannabinoids are the

319
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:35,159
engine the terpenes are the steering

320
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:37,559
wheel so everyone's putting an emphasis

321
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:39,958
on THC but be mindful of those smells

322
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:41,819
and those flavors because that's what

323
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:43,739
the real experiential is with the flour

324
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,579
right and they were just like Mindless I

325
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,200
started talking about all the different

326
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:48,239
terpenes they're like and there is an

327
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,399
old head there I mean like this guy

328
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,620
um was named Fred he's been doing AV for

329
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,879
all kinds of shows and huge dead fan and

330
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,440
stuff and he's like I don't even

331
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:59,039
understand what you're saying he's like

332
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,420
lemon and what Mercy person what like he

333
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:02,338
you're like dude you need to learn your

334
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:04,259
turret profile man you'll have that much

335
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:06,720
better of an experience for sure you

336
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:08,039
know but it's a whole Evolution compared

337
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,720
to what we grew up with with what's

338
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:12,419
accessible now both by product and

339
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,700
education right you know so it's it's

340
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:17,338
fine man I'm loving it yeah it's a

341
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:19,740
different world now it is a lot of stuff

342
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:21,540
is hype driven yeah and that's okay too

343
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,159
yeah I mean

344
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:24,360
you know so you get a little bit of

345
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:26,578
everything but at the end of the day

346
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,860
quality is quality and it's hard to

347
00:11:26,578 --> 00:11:30,958
argue quality now quality is subjective

348
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:33,360
to a degree flavor is subjective but I

349
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:35,338
feel like quality you know it's like if

350
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,019
the if the if the roach tastes good when

351
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:38,640
you fire it back up you know you got

352
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:40,078
some good stuff on your hands if it's

353
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:41,699
just burnt and it's sad and you want to

354
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:43,979
just keep it out then that's a whole

355
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,959
other story and I agree and you're

356
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,159
you're spot on with the hype like I

357
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:48,899
don't mean a knock it but I call them

358
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:50,578
trendy triangle strains and we went down

359
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:52,980
this road of all these candies and

360
00:11:50,578 --> 00:11:54,120
desserts and everything and there were

361
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,980
some great genetics that kind of got

362
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,539
overlooked like I feel like GMO didn't

363
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,339
get enough time in the light you know

364
00:11:57,539 --> 00:12:00,778
because so many people are wrapped up in

365
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:03,240
wedding cake then ice cream cake then

366
00:12:00,778 --> 00:12:04,620
gelato you know 41. now RS as I said you

367
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,419
know yeah that was with different groups

368
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,940
too because I feel like GMO really with

369
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:10,620
our with my friends with Marlin you know

370
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:14,399
my good friend Marlon Asher like he

371
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:15,778
loved GMO and but but yeah I guess to a

372
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,220
degree I understand what you're saying

373
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:18,480
same thing with sunset Sherbert I feel

374
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,000
like that was another one that really

375
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,220
didn't Peak like it should have it

376
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,019
didn't get as much credit as it should

377
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,639
have yeah and then you compare it to

378
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:28,799
Skittles in runs and you're like is

379
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,958
almost to or GG which they're not back

380
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,699
yeah but to your point it gets hyped up

381
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,919
and it gets into this social media

382
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,060
bubble and people are going after it for

383
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:38,278
the wrong reasons but I think that's

384
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:40,439
also the experience again talking on the

385
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:42,600
legal Market when people walk in and

386
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,100
they're asking I call it PC you know

387
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,659
cannabis Consultants but Bud tenders

388
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,159
sure you know hey what what should we

389
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:48,838
smoke and they're telling them what the

390
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:50,519
loudest thing is to smoke or what the

391
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:51,600
most popular thing is to smoke and

392
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,759
they're not saying hey are you trying to

393
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,220
get help with sleep or do you have a

394
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:57,778
knee injury or how high you want to get

395
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,980
how do you want to get to like you were

396
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:00,659
talking about earlier man you're spot on

397
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,039
like there's you know when you're

398
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:04,019
smoking something like Skittles which

399
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:06,599
I'm a huge fan of as well it's just this

400
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:08,578
nice cool Cruise right it's not like out

401
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,620
of your head but then you throw in

402
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:12,419
something like green crack and someone

403
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,220
isn't expecting that they're like what

404
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:16,139
did you give me man they're going on a

405
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,639
whole other level well Green Crack is

406
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:19,500
one of those ones that your body will

407
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:21,419
adapt to it really quickly yeah but if

408
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:24,179
you haven't been smoking it it gets you

409
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:26,399
super high and it Peaks really quickly

410
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:28,620
and then it drops down actually too but

411
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,600
man it it'll get you to the point where

412
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:32,339
you need to sit down yeah so exactly

413
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,019
true and just take it all in and it yeah

414
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:35,459
in everybody's body is different too I

415
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:37,440
was telling that same group of kids I

416
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:40,138
was like you know my friend came across

417
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,060
it was a GDP which I know I love the the

418
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:44,639
old Trooper like purple Urkel and

419
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:46,439
granddaddy right and so as a GDP crossed

420
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,120
with Harlequin and I explained the two

421
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,560
different genetics and lineages of those

422
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,740
both and I said it was one of those

423
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:54,299
cultivars where I smoked it and I had to

424
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,399
lay down and listen to Jimi Hendrix like

425
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:58,859
that was just right that that was the

426
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,000
vibe and it was like this every once in

427
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,980
a while you get into that perfect

428
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,839
balance of heady and body right you know

429
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,820
and it was that perfect heady body for

430
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:09,060
me and I tell people if you find that

431
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:11,519
perfect strain stick with it like that's

432
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:13,018
what your body wants you know yeah and

433
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,299
it may not be the perfect strain forever

434
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:17,339
because it's all you know it's one of

435
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:20,099
those things that weed can be it should

436
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:21,420
be consumed fresh yeah and each batch is

437
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,100
slightly different you're not getting

438
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:25,379
getting the same expression every time

439
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,000
especially grown you know Boutique

440
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:28,679
flower yeah

441
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,240
you know and then even the commercial

442
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:32,638
stuff it's like there's so many

443
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:36,060
variables if you think of plant flowers

444
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:38,220
for roughly 70 days there's a lot that

445
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:40,018
can happen in those 70 days even in an

446
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:42,300
indoor environment to where it can be

447
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:44,578
slightly different yeah and I'm at the

448
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:47,519
mercy of I'm an outdoor and it's nothing

449
00:14:44,578 --> 00:14:48,659
I have a level of respect for for dap

450
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,639
and indoor

451
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:52,259
but I'm a traditional outdoor full term

452
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,639
and a good example of that to your point

453
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:56,100
I was given

454
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:57,720
um some first round genetics from a guy

455
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,220
out of Santa Cruz thanks to Peter he's

456
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,600
like hey will you test run these and I'm

457
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,620
like you know I kind of stick to land

458
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,199
racing he's like well it's a good

459
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:05,278
Crossing to see what Neo with a Tai and

460
00:15:04,198 --> 00:15:06,899
I didn't know how I was going to express

461
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:08,519
and I didn't know what to feed it I

462
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:10,139
didn't have any idea but to your point

463
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:11,578
we got hit with a heat wave in SoCal

464
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:13,079
which a lot of people oh you're so lucky

465
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:15,359
Lance you get to do you know you've got

466
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:16,679
the perfect climate like not exactly

467
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,060
when you're hitting triple digits and

468
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:20,458
you're hotter than Vegas in September

469
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:22,679
like we got hit yeah I mean there's been

470
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:24,539
some rough Summers I mean the last the

471
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:26,638
year before that I went to 120 in

472
00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:28,078
Fallbrook when I was down there yeah and

473
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,240
you're like my friends were working so

474
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:32,219
yeah and what came out of that versus if

475
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,278
I were to rerun that now this season

476
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:36,600
with El Nino like you said it's it's too

477
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:39,958
different the expression because people

478
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:42,839
put and again the the genotype is a huge

479
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:45,179
Factor but Gino Fino chemo there's these

480
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:47,339
different elements on how you experience

481
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:49,379
these inputs they come here right well

482
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:51,540
an outdoor is like making wine in the

483
00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:54,299
sense that we talked terroir and then we

484
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:56,759
talk about climate and weather in all

485
00:15:54,299 --> 00:15:58,799
these things that contribute to the

486
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:00,360
final product exactly exactly you know

487
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:01,979
beyond drawing and curing there's so

488
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,600
much that goes on with outdoor that it's

489
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,980
different every year and so you're going

490
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,659
to have good vintages you're going to

491
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:09,120
have bad vintages you're going to have a

492
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:10,559
lot of stuff in between and even growing

493
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,360
the same exact genetics you're going to

494
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:14,638
get stuff all over the place every year

495
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,139
no matter what yeah it's very true and

496
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,120
you see it in your bed like I have a

497
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:20,940
friend uh Greg he's down in Santa Cruz

498
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,679
and uh kind of wild something I wouldn't

499
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,300
think in that climate but he went with a

500
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:25,799
Google grow format so he's like yeah I

501
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:27,719
took these logs let them soak all

502
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:30,299
through winter and now I'm growing these

503
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,800
lines and he's like he got these Jens he

504
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:34,198
got these pucks that he is running and

505
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:36,299
he said one of them he's gonna fully

506
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:38,159
bomb because just is just so the way it

507
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:39,240
expresses because that thing's like I

508
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:41,219
don't know four and a half foot now

509
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,440
where its siblings are like three foot

510
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:45,540
at best and it's it's in the same bed

511
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,279
and it's in the same grow format and

512
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:49,439
he's used so the same media the same

513
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:51,299
environment so to your point point the

514
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,320
the variants are great and it's

515
00:16:51,299 --> 00:16:54,179
specially outdoor and I'm a little

516
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,100
jealous of the I call it God growing the

517
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:58,138
into like I'm I'm dependent on mother

518
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,459
nature but the god going indoor where

519
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:01,919
you can control the environment and I'm

520
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:03,838
not saying it's easy but you see that

521
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:05,818
uniformity you know well and it's

522
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,620
repeatable yeah it's very repeatable

523
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:09,359
what you need from a medicine standpoint

524
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:11,879
which I'm a medical I'm not an activist

525
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:13,619
I'm a medical Advocate first so I fully

526
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,679
respect that again because if you have

527
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:18,178
Grandma seizures cerebral palsy like if

528
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:20,400
you find something that works and then

529
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:22,919
someone goes oh yeah no this is gg4 you

530
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,419
know it's not GG it's it's maybe the

531
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:25,740
genetics but it's from a completely

532
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:27,360
different grower growing a completely

533
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:29,460
different way to your point growing's

534
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,599
half the battle are you cure it how you

535
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:33,120
dry it and I don't know if you're into

536
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:35,579
it by age my bud so I actually do two

537
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:37,199
two and then two months of Aging right

538
00:17:35,579 --> 00:17:39,839
which I learned from the Italians like

539
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,880
but how you handle it like that really

540
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:43,980
factors into the end product for a

541
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:47,400
medical patient that matters totally so

542
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:49,140
I'm really big into aging not because I

543
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,120
want to age it but because I the

544
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,980
quantities you know it's like I want to

545
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:54,178
some stuff I want to say but for the

546
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,759
most part I want to smoke the best stuff

547
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:59,100
I have right at that moment but you know

548
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:00,660
leading into Turf lock you know it's

549
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:02,459
kind of a game changer because I'm a

550
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:05,400
mason jar guy I was always you know I

551
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:07,440
used mason jars forever and I was very

552
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,380
skeptical of the terplock I mentioned on

553
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:13,440
my podcast uh which will be two podcasts

554
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:16,260
ago terplock and I think a couple other

555
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,700
ones but I did side-by-side testing and

556
00:18:16,259 --> 00:18:21,058
if you keep it at the same temperature

557
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:23,340
the terplock has more Terps you know and

558
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:25,200
as you go longer the longer you go the

559
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:27,599
more Terps are in the terp block yeah

560
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,360
yeah so it's pretty cool thing I'm with

561
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:32,038
you so I was again kind of I was taught

562
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,599
grew up with hippies so I was taught the

563
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:35,400
old way you know and some might consider

564
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,779
them wives tales but there was not

565
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,940
factual information around this because

566
00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:41,220
this plant was suppressed for a century

567
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,538
you know is weaponized so

568
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,339
um we knew what we knew and that's what

569
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:45,960
always worked and when again the old

570
00:18:44,339 --> 00:18:47,579
guys taught you hey this is how I've

571
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,558
done it and you smoke it and it's fire

572
00:18:47,579 --> 00:18:51,538
or at least five us at that time you're

573
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:54,178
like okay it is what it is but I was the

574
00:18:51,538 --> 00:18:56,579
same way I ran mason jars and kept them

575
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:59,038
sterile did all the right process I was

576
00:18:56,579 --> 00:19:00,839
a little uncertain about the terplock

577
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:02,339
technology because I thought all bags

578
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,899
were created equal like we grew up with

579
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:05,459
you know Ziploc bags or whatever you

580
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,798
know baggies right when I slang and I

581
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:09,660
sell them in baggies you know but that

582
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:11,700
was based out in a set or film canisters

583
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:14,880
not if you remember we used to literally

584
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:17,160
the little stash cans but I was kind of

585
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,799
a little skeptical on it and then once

586
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,519
they explained the technology because

587
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:22,259
I'm one of the and you've probably

588
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:23,700
figured this out with me I'm being I'm

589
00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:25,679
Community First like I have to believe

590
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,779
in the brand and the product that I'm

591
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,940
representing and and I have to make sure

592
00:19:27,779 --> 00:19:31,619
that the culture and the core values of

593
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:33,120
that company are represent as well and

594
00:19:31,619 --> 00:19:34,139
I've made a few missteps in my career

595
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:35,819
here

596
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,200
um you know with companies that were

597
00:19:35,819 --> 00:19:38,819
maybe not necessarily in it for the same

598
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,100
reasons as me but I also got a place in

599
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:42,599
my career where I'm like I I'm in a good

600
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:44,219
spot to where I can be a little more

601
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:46,439
decisive and I can choose it for this a

602
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,120
good match or not so with these guys I

603
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,038
did a side by side test too before I

604
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:51,959
came to him I took one crop and I split

605
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:53,640
it and I did jars on one I did terplock

606
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,960
on the other and did what they said you

607
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:58,140
know hey go through your traditional

608
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,120
dryware 60 60 14 you know trim as you

609
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,559
trim and then put some in here put some

610
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:04,500
in in the jar

611
00:20:01,558 --> 00:20:06,779
I was floored because never had I not

612
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,700
touched as much as we hate it like you

613
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:10,678
have to babysit your buds when you're

614
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,000
curing yeah and you know technically you

615
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:14,580
guys see you don't even need to burp it

616
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,140
yeah I realized that you guys say you

617
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:18,178
don't need to burp it but I I tend to

618
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:19,380
want to look at my butt all the time so

619
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:20,700
I end up burping it without even

620
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,280
thinking that I'm burping it you know

621
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,660
and you are so yeah get getting into

622
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:26,339
technology to explain on that why you

623
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:28,798
don't because

624
00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:30,418
um the polymers that we use so again and

625
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:32,400
this isn't a throwaway bags isn't it

626
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:34,140
this is you can reuse them yeah for sure

627
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,759
time and time again we people are like

628
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,960
and again you deal with some people on

629
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:38,579
the hill they're like well I like mason

630
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,019
jars I like glass because it's bare for

631
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:42,298
the environment I'm like okay first off

632
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:45,058
the carbon footprint for producing glass

633
00:20:42,298 --> 00:20:47,279
and that Tin Top is exponentially higher

634
00:20:45,058 --> 00:20:49,798
than this right but the carbon footprint

635
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:51,119
for recycling that material is

636
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:52,619
exponentially higher than this because

637
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:54,178
it's recyclable as well and then think

638
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:55,678
about the logistics like it's even even

639
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:57,780
if it's a craft grower it's pulling down

640
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,919
500 pounds you're putting that in jars

641
00:20:57,779 --> 00:21:01,019
and you're shipping it all the way to

642
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:03,120
San Diego or LA how much weight is that

643
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:05,279
compared to the bags totally so I've

644
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:06,779
been on podcasts where this guy busts

645
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:08,038
out a Yeti and he's got all this and you

646
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:09,779
hear it coming you hear the rattling

647
00:21:08,038 --> 00:21:11,700
right and he pulls up and he's got the

648
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:13,139
jars and it's also I'm like here's what

649
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,880
I agree last season I keep it in a

650
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,440
turkey bag tin I am old school that way

651
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,900
and it's bags I'm holding it with one

652
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,880
hand and I'm like it's all here but the

653
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,960
technology is cool because what it does

654
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,280
is

655
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,600
um this plant's pretty radical in itself

656
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:26,519
right so we know that plants when

657
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:28,678
they're living you know take in that

658
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:30,240
carbon dioxide put out the oxygen well

659
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:32,940
when they're dying they do the opposite

660
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,558
so they they release that oxygen to try

661
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,900
to regenerate so this actually pushes

662
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:39,000
out the oxygen keeps that CO2 in that

663
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,919
environment because oxygen oxidizes

664
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,779
right so it keeps it down to a few

665
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:45,000
percent so it still allows the maturing

666
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:46,379
of the buds but on top of that the fact

667
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,900
that you've got antimicrobial

668
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:50,340
anti-static and UV protectant and even

669
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,900
our clear bags for guys like you because

670
00:21:50,339 --> 00:21:55,019
same thing I started off with clear we

671
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:56,519
have we call our glasses which is kind

672
00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:58,079
of making fun you know it looks like a

673
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:59,819
mason jar but it's a bag right but then

674
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:02,220
you can see your buds but you don't you

675
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:03,720
don't disrupt that environment but cool

676
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,940
that you figured out a Superman so we

677
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:08,100
did a test with a lab third party lab

678
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,600
independent we had to give them the

679
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:11,158
flower and we had to give them the

680
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,379
material to test so we named the jars

681
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:15,059
and we gave them the bags down in Lompoc

682
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:17,880
in Santa Barbara County and it was a

683
00:22:15,058 --> 00:22:19,980
long-term test three-month test and they

684
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,020
found that while you get to where you

685
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:24,120
want to with cure in two weeks the

686
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:26,279
optimal percentage for both cannabinoids

687
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:28,500
and terpenes is it two months in our

688
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:30,839
bags so if you can keep it in longer

689
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,579
you're you're it's not a detriment to

690
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:34,019
the end product for you to do so yeah

691
00:22:32,579 --> 00:22:35,038
and what happens after two months

692
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,480
because that's what friends have been

693
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:38,038
asking me it just it just levels off

694
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,179
it's not going to Peak further than that

695
00:22:38,038 --> 00:22:40,859
but it's going to assist and if you keep

696
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:42,538
it the right temperature I mean you're

697
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:45,658
looking six months and it's still a good

698
00:22:42,538 --> 00:22:49,500
product yeah the one thing is it's a bag

699
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:51,539
so you have to be aware of putting it in

700
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,460
a bag and getting it smashed you know

701
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:55,259
those are those are the things like I

702
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,819
love carrying around a tote with a bunch

703
00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:59,279
of different flavors or whatever you

704
00:22:56,819 --> 00:23:00,839
know and a backpack yeah and if you're

705
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:02,460
gonna do that you need to put them in

706
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:03,779
jars or something like that to work

707
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,640
because that's the only thing is you can

708
00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:07,678
get it smashed a little bit yeah we do

709
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,640
have like Squints down in SoCal he uses

710
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,340
trays

711
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,960
um so he'll potenti again that's again

712
00:23:11,339 --> 00:23:15,178
totally respect his craft being a full

713
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,460
indoor guy in his stuff especially is

714
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:20,759
Wendy is super loud I mean that's one

715
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:22,380
where I got in a regular bag and you

716
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:24,359
know bring it back home and my whole

717
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,620
whole house smelled like a skunk came

718
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:27,779
through so I'm like okay I gotta put

719
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:29,158
this in another bag but he puts them in

720
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:31,259
the little trays which does help with

721
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:33,900
that so that's one factor but to getting

722
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:35,279
into man this is I I gotta share this

723
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:37,620
and I gotta tell the story behind this

724
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:40,259
I've only told a few people so as far as

725
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:42,298
Segways so I have to share and you

726
00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:44,038
remember the phone call so I was over at

727
00:23:42,298 --> 00:23:46,379
Ed rosenthal's and we were on our way up

728
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:48,359
to Hall of flowers and I stopped by with

729
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,620
a few buddies and you're you're as good

730
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:51,538
advice too with that in jail oh yeah

731
00:23:49,619 --> 00:23:52,619
there's they're just lovely they're good

732
00:23:51,538 --> 00:23:55,798
people right we're really good people

733
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:58,739
and so we brought some flour we consumed

734
00:23:55,798 --> 00:24:00,480
that and then Ed brings out a baggie and

735
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,980
I mean literally I'm like Ed you're

736
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,900
giving me flashbacks of high school man

737
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:05,400
like what do you do with that bag and

738
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,200
where did you get it and he's like oh

739
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,780
James gave me this stuff and I open it

740
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,538
up like oh my gosh like I knew you were

741
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:14,639
genetics from a growing standpoint I

742
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:16,798
didn't know you grew that well like

743
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,900
really I was like my God this stuff is

744
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:21,379
fire and then my second response was

745
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:23,759
like what is it doing in a regular bag

746
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:25,860
so that's why I called you and I'm like

747
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:27,599
dude smoking your stuff right now Ed

748
00:24:25,859 --> 00:24:29,219
gave it to me but he gave it to me in a

749
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,480
freaking sandwich bag and I'm like we

750
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,860
gotta come up with something so I know

751
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,480
it's the first time of you seeing it

752
00:24:31,859 --> 00:24:34,918
this is really awesome but that's

753
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,659
exactly where you came up it definitely

754
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:39,720
embodies everything that we're doing it

755
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:41,700
has that 70s Vibe and I love your 70s

756
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,319
Vibe because that was a big time for you

757
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:45,360
know for the community for the industry

758
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:46,740
so totally definitely want to plan this

759
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:49,019
yeah we came together with the the

760
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:50,579
collab bags do with them as you will but

761
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:52,139
awesome that's the one thing I wanted to

762
00:24:50,579 --> 00:24:53,579
come out of it if I ever go back to Ed's

763
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:55,440
and he has your flower I didn't want

764
00:24:53,579 --> 00:24:57,899
yeah I didn't want to get it in a

765
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,880
sandwich bag you know totally yeah it's

766
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,919
funny how much like polyethylene bags

767
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,419
sandwich bags it's just they they kill

768
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,740
the Terps they do and people don't

769
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:06,059
understand they have a lot of you know

770
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:08,220
they have them sitting around and the

771
00:25:06,058 --> 00:25:10,079
thing is is like man unless they're in

772
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:12,298
the freezer in those bags you're killing

773
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:14,399
Terps you're losing Terps every day they

774
00:25:12,298 --> 00:25:16,619
go in those bags you are so man it's

775
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,840
it's a hydrocarbon people in in not to

776
00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:21,058
get geeky but that's exactly it man

777
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:24,000
terpenes and they're they're volatile

778
00:25:21,058 --> 00:25:25,798
hydrocarbons and you get them even 70

779
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,240
degrees and higher and they start this

780
00:25:25,798 --> 00:25:29,099
pain and that's why people like ah this

781
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,599
smells good people keep an opening the

782
00:25:29,099 --> 00:25:32,219
bag and it's like you're losing a little

783
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:33,959
bit of that love and you you can't get

784
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:35,640
it back that's the problem is it's Genie

785
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,440
in a Bottle scenario right once you let

786
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,240
it out it's not like I can put all that

787
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,798
goodness back in so be being able to

788
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,919
contain it and maintain it is a huge

789
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:46,379
factor and even a study a guy who's

790
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,820
doing large scale pre-rolls up here

791
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,740
um he had an R D team that was doing a

792
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:52,500
study they found that there's up to a 50

793
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:55,019
terp loss post grind and they're

794
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,400
grinding hundreds of pounds of shift and

795
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:58,019
they're oh my God how much quality are

796
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,298
we losing what can we do to try to

797
00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:02,220
retain as much as we can post crime but

798
00:26:00,298 --> 00:26:03,240
but through the people process what

799
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:06,000
they're talking about grinding is

800
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,620
probably putting in a blender yes to be

801
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,599
honest you know I feel like a lot of

802
00:26:07,619 --> 00:26:11,219
guys that do pre-rolls they blend it and

803
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:13,079
so like the pre-rolls we've been working

804
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:16,740
on a pre-roll to launch in metric in

805
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:18,178
California for a while and if we do it

806
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,140
we're gonna do it right it's gonna be

807
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:21,960
hand

808
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:23,640
ground everything's you know in milled

809
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,600
we're going to use a you know flower

810
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,940
Mill

811
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:28,619
that's as I said you know that yeah but

812
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:30,480
then those the thing is is with the

813
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:32,099
joints you want to consume them fresh

814
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,839
they're not something you want to sit on

815
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:35,399
a shelf for two months you don't even

816
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:37,379
really want to sit on a shelf for a

817
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,960
month if you could get a you know a

818
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:43,080
pre-roll should be rolled and smoked

819
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:44,940
relatively quickly I think that uh cold

820
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:46,558
storage will help these things same

821
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:48,900
thing you know doing Cold Storage with

822
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:50,639
these bags it probably last a year and

823
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,679
you absolutely can still maintain really

824
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,360
high quality exactly true we have fresh

825
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:56,038
frozen bags for guys that are you know

826
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:58,019
on the concentrate side but exactly your

827
00:26:56,038 --> 00:26:58,679
point you can chill them you can freeze

828
00:26:58,019 --> 00:27:00,480
them

829
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:01,860
um I agree with you 100 and you pointed

830
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,659
out something a lot of people are not

831
00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:04,740
really aware of or cognizant of we talk

832
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:06,059
about grinding but there's a difference

833
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:08,038
between grinding and milling and you

834
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:10,139
nailed it so grinding is you're

835
00:27:08,038 --> 00:27:11,339
pulverizing that material and what

836
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,980
you're doing is yeah you're ripping

837
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:15,599
apart the biomass but the most delicate

838
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,980
part of this plant is on the outside not

839
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:18,719
the inside so that's why I explained to

840
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:20,759
people who are kind of layman to the

841
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,839
industry they uh well can't you just

842
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:23,278
handle it this way can't you just

843
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:25,798
process isn't it the same as mushrooms

844
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:27,659
or tomatoes or any is like no because

845
00:27:25,798 --> 00:27:29,038
all those things the goodness is on the

846
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:31,140
inside a lot of them have a protective

847
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:32,940
layer yeah pineapples oranges every

848
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:34,740
citrus fruit has this protective layer

849
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:36,960
but a lot of your your

850
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,640
um gourds and you know a lot of your

851
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,079
your other vegetables have protective

852
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,240
layers as because I'm a gardener across

853
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:43,740
the board I've got Citrus I've got you

854
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,960
know all kinds of veggies and I've got

855
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:47,819
my flour and so I explained to them

856
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,860
that's the difference is it's on the

857
00:27:47,819 --> 00:27:51,298
outside and then I explained to him like

858
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:53,099
have you ever seen a hop and they're

859
00:27:51,298 --> 00:27:55,079
like yeah like you know Hop's the only

860
00:27:53,099 --> 00:27:56,819
cuts into cannabis but something

861
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:58,980
happened in the evolution of this plant

862
00:27:56,819 --> 00:28:00,720
centuries ago to where it expressed

863
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:02,278
itself internally and externally a hop

864
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,319
all the goodness is protected inside

865
00:28:02,278 --> 00:28:06,000
right but with a cannabis plant with the

866
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:07,859
profile everything's outside so we can't

867
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,019
handle it the same way we do others so

868
00:28:07,859 --> 00:28:12,000
to your point grinding you're ripping

869
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:13,980
the trichomes off that biomass you're

870
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,900
really especially pulverizing you're

871
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:17,159
just blending it it's the worst yeah and

872
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,019
it's so inconsistent people think you're

873
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:20,039
you're getting you're homoglizing it but

874
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:21,720
you're not you're getting an

875
00:28:20,038 --> 00:28:24,000
inconsistency because you're getting

876
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,798
clumps of those Terps and of those oils

877
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,319
and those when you're turning into a

878
00:28:25,798 --> 00:28:30,298
powder yeah yeah you know so yeah it's

879
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:32,220
so Milling it you know that Mill it and

880
00:28:30,298 --> 00:28:34,019
just have it work with itself in order

881
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,640
to break it down to a bare material so

882
00:28:34,019 --> 00:28:36,859
like you have to do a plug but the flour

883
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,240
Millet twice

884
00:28:36,859 --> 00:28:42,000
great I mean I use my old school grinder

885
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,740
still too but I'm it's delicate you know

886
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,599
so yeah we grew up like you remember the

887
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:47,278
Mendo Mulcher Mulcher Santa Cruz

888
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,839
Shredder dude the Sweet Leaf was the

889
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:51,359
first one and I got one of the first 10

890
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:53,699
prototypes no still Sweet Leaf is like

891
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:56,099
close to my heart as well you know I

892
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,900
love the flour mill you know I met uh

893
00:28:56,099 --> 00:28:59,099
the guys from Flour Mill a while back

894
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:01,798
and they hooked me up with some flour

895
00:28:59,099 --> 00:29:04,379
Mills dude yeah good stuff he's on a

896
00:29:01,798 --> 00:29:05,759
mission too he's just like you like you

897
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,260
know that's the owner of a business that

898
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:08,759
believes in his product but he also

899
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:10,200
cares about the community and he cares

900
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:11,640
about the plant and he's out there and

901
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,019
you run it I just saw him a hall of

902
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,220
flowers like you see him on the circuit

903
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:16,558
you see him working the shows and

904
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:18,058
representing and it's about being a part

905
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:19,558
of the community which is a bigger thing

906
00:29:18,058 --> 00:29:21,240
and again it's he believes in his

907
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:22,319
product and he should his product's a

908
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,359
good product yeah you know he definitely

909
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:25,918
should he should yeah and I believe in

910
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:28,379
excited at a scale back when I was

911
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:30,240
working yeah and there'd be flour Mills

912
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:32,460
yeah on point being a marketing guy I

913
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,500
love it is the packaging is great uh I

914
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:37,440
like the fact that you can go with

915
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:39,240
different size uh grinds so if you want

916
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,620
a coarse grind you can go coarse if you

917
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,940
want a fine grind you can kind of go

918
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:44,819
fine if people don't understand that

919
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:46,740
yeah like if you roll up like I'm again

920
00:29:44,819 --> 00:29:48,538
old school so I'm like more of the fine

921
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:50,399
but if you do like still snapping and

922
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:52,200
ripping bongs like you go for the course

923
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:54,178
yeah but people understand like even

924
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,679
that and you mentioned giant wine but

925
00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:57,960
even though it's like so the bigger the

926
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,580
joint the more coarse you want to go you

927
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,200
want the air to be able to travel yeah

928
00:29:59,579 --> 00:30:03,119
you know if it's too tight you're not

929
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,679
gonna you know too tight and they they

930
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:06,418
grind is too fine you're not going to be

931
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:07,620
able to get a good hit very true and so

932
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:09,419
you want to go of course so you get all

933
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:12,058
those air pockets in there so it travels

934
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:14,399
that smoke travels down yeah so yeah I

935
00:30:12,058 --> 00:30:16,740
smoked a 24 gram joint over the weekend

936
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:17,898
with uh with my producer of the show

937
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:21,419
yeah

938
00:30:17,898 --> 00:30:23,699
so yeah you were the deadhead show yeah

939
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:25,380
yeah dead and Company was pretty intense

940
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:28,440
it was pretty amazing it was that final

941
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:29,760
it was the final three tour dates in San

942
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,558
Francisco

943
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:33,000
you know different to be here like again

944
00:30:31,558 --> 00:30:35,339
for people who don't understand like

945
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,319
this is Ground Zero oh yeah for that

946
00:30:35,339 --> 00:30:40,079
group and for that movement oh the whole

947
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:41,759
band everything around the band started

948
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:43,678
here yeah you know the music started

949
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:45,419
here Jerry's house was here they grew up

950
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,399
pretty much everybody grew up here and

951
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:48,659
yeah so yeah yeah it's definitely some

952
00:30:47,398 --> 00:30:49,859
histories when I hit you up and is

953
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:51,600
asking if you're coming up on the hill

954
00:30:49,859 --> 00:30:53,038
and you're like no and I'm like got it

955
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:54,418
and then I ran into a few other people

956
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:55,740
same thing that they're like yeah my

957
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:57,720
buddy's gonna come up and he's in San

958
00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:00,000
Francisco for the show and it's Legend

959
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,259
especially again when you recognize how

960
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,259
much of an influence it had on the

961
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:05,640
community and the culture yeah so

962
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:07,379
definitely well and like the only

963
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:10,140
requirement to being a deadhead is that

964
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:11,820
you have good taste in music so you know

965
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:13,259
it's like you can be an [ __ ] you can

966
00:31:11,819 --> 00:31:15,178
be a good person whatever as long as you

967
00:31:13,259 --> 00:31:17,839
have good taste in music you know it's

968
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:20,399
usually when you get himself Good Vibes

969
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:21,778
one of the ladies that was in our little

970
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:23,519
group because we were 20 feet back from

971
00:31:21,778 --> 00:31:25,140
the stage maybe less maybe like 15 feet

972
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:27,298
back from the stage which was amazing

973
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:29,278
but uh one of the ladies pointed out

974
00:31:27,298 --> 00:31:30,898
that the problems are caused by the

975
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:33,058
people without alcohol and if you look

976
00:31:30,898 --> 00:31:34,678
around the ones with the beer cans in

977
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:36,778
their hand are the ones that are pushing

978
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:38,399
and shoving it's not the ones on you

979
00:31:36,778 --> 00:31:39,599
know psychedelics or the ones smoking

980
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:40,918
weed It's usually the ones with the

981
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:43,678
alcohol and there's definitely truth to

982
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:45,899
that I feel like uh alcohol kind of

983
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:48,120
numbs you and

984
00:31:45,898 --> 00:31:50,278
other things kind of uh you know

985
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:51,298
heighten your senses and you really for

986
00:31:50,278 --> 00:31:53,038
those kind of shows you want to be

987
00:31:51,298 --> 00:31:54,898
hypersensitive so you're yeah they

988
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:57,119
provide this hypersensitive experience

989
00:31:54,898 --> 00:31:58,979
for you if you're hypersensitive so

990
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:00,599
that's right it's an amazing experience

991
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:02,640
I say the same thing and that's right

992
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:04,500
again why we get along so well because I

993
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,240
tell people and I kind of just put it as

994
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,980
a summary so I quit drinking back in

995
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,019
2019 and I was never really a big

996
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:12,058
drinker again I I like the plant because

997
00:32:10,019 --> 00:32:13,619
of the holistic attributes to it and

998
00:32:12,058 --> 00:32:15,418
being a cancer survivor too I think

999
00:32:13,619 --> 00:32:16,619
about okay I need to I need to put good

1000
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:18,299
things in my body so I never want to

1001
00:32:16,619 --> 00:32:20,099
come out of remission right but I just

1002
00:32:18,298 --> 00:32:21,418
got bored of it and it is interesting

1003
00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:24,178
because to your point I was like man

1004
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:25,919
alcohol makes me forget whereas you're

1005
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:27,480
running like cannabis yeah it not only

1006
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,278
helps me remember but helps me discover

1007
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:31,019
and that's again this Against The

1008
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:33,720
Stereotype you know when I call out

1009
00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:36,119
because I can be a little bit a touch of

1010
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:38,940
activist when I do give my opinion on

1011
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:41,158
the overall stereotype and stigmas and

1012
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:43,620
tabooisms associated with the plant and

1013
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:46,740
I don't just blame anslinger back in the

1014
00:32:43,619 --> 00:32:48,959
30s or Nixon in the 70s or Daryl Gates

1015
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:52,079
and Nancy Reagan with the Dare program

1016
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,819
in Arya in the 80s but I also blame

1017
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:55,500
Hollywood I'm like okay so they've got

1018
00:32:53,819 --> 00:32:57,058
characters like Spicoli and guys trying

1019
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:00,960
to go find White Castle and all this

1020
00:32:57,058 --> 00:33:02,339
[ __ ] it's like that's not I maybe a

1021
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,380
little bit of short term because I'm so

1022
00:33:02,339 --> 00:33:05,339
enthralled in the moment but when I

1023
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:07,200
educate people and help them understand

1024
00:33:05,339 --> 00:33:09,959
it re-clocks your brain so that

1025
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,600
everything from an experiential I mean

1026
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:15,298
everything music food sex it doesn't

1027
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:17,519
matter everything is enhanced because it

1028
00:33:15,298 --> 00:33:19,379
puts more of an enunciation on that

1029
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,120
experiential but alcohol numbs you

1030
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:22,799
totally well you know and then there's

1031
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:24,538
guys like Sanjay Gupta who kind of

1032
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:26,759
brought it to the light on 60 Minutes

1033
00:33:24,538 --> 00:33:29,099
years ago that that made my parents

1034
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:31,679
aware of the benefits of cannabis and

1035
00:33:29,099 --> 00:33:34,079
THC and CBD and all these things and

1036
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:36,360
then we have Elon Musk who he smokes on

1037
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:38,579
The Joe Rogan podcast and he's the

1038
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:40,798
wealthiest person you know in the world

1039
00:33:38,579 --> 00:33:42,778
yeah and Sanjay that's a good one man

1040
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:44,819
because he he was he was going against

1041
00:33:42,778 --> 00:33:46,798
the grain with us and then totally he

1042
00:33:44,819 --> 00:33:48,898
corrected himself and it takes it takes

1043
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:51,058
a big person to say I'm wrong or I

1044
00:33:48,898 --> 00:33:52,979
misunderstood right but but the big

1045
00:33:51,058 --> 00:33:55,740
thing is is how can you argue with a

1046
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:58,440
parent that wants to help their kid get

1047
00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:01,319
better either kid's sick you know and

1048
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,880
it's like how how are we to say that

1049
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:04,678
they're wrong correct you know and

1050
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,059
that's my biggest argument it's like if

1051
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:07,500
it makes you better and you're not

1052
00:34:06,058 --> 00:34:10,079
hurting anybody how can you say that's

1053
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:12,000
wrong yeah that's that's what really in

1054
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:14,098
I don't talk about too much but when I

1055
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,300
segue you know because again well it was

1056
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:16,859
such an influence when I was younger I

1057
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:19,260
did go down the mainstream career path

1058
00:34:16,858 --> 00:34:20,940
but when I got pulled back in in a good

1059
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:22,379
way in Denver when it legalized moved

1060
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:24,480
out there in 2014 and you know

1061
00:34:22,378 --> 00:34:25,980
eventually became GM of the Cannabis but

1062
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,059
the thing I got to this pivotal point

1063
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,440
because I kind of pulled the Jerry

1064
00:34:27,059 --> 00:34:30,418
Maguire because that company is owned by

1065
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,440
hedge fund and again it didn't the

1066
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:32,638
beliefs weren't aligned right the

1067
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,039
culture and core values weren't aligned

1068
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:37,679
with me and I had friends that were from

1069
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:38,878
from digitalmedia.com marketing and

1070
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,960
they're like well it's not too late you

1071
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:41,219
can still come out with you and still

1072
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,378
put the parent company under the name

1073
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:46,378
and people don't know and I'm like first

1074
00:34:43,378 --> 00:34:48,000
off at this point because I do have such

1075
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:50,219
a lower respect for the plant I wouldn't

1076
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,659
work for anyone who holds that against

1077
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:53,699
me just look at let's just look at it

1078
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:56,220
from a business perspective the fastest

1079
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:58,139
growing industry in the world and the

1080
00:34:56,219 --> 00:35:00,000
greatest opportunity so if that's a

1081
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:01,920
business person that goes no you worked

1082
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,199
in weed I don't support that I went work

1083
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,579
for him but second what you touched on

1084
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:07,439
the kids the children it's interesting

1085
00:35:05,579 --> 00:35:10,440
because we actually were awarded we did

1086
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,639
a great story on all these families that

1087
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,019
were moving their children up that were

1088
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:14,460
dealing with Grandma seizures and this

1089
00:35:13,019 --> 00:35:16,920
is back in like the early like the

1090
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:19,320
Stanley Brothers Charlotte's Web kind of

1091
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:21,240
ear right and we're covering this and it

1092
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:23,460
really hit home for me because I don't

1093
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:25,078
know I you know way studying school with

1094
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:27,119
juvenile law and everything and and

1095
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:28,619
children's rights and all that and your

1096
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,880
point these these parents were being

1097
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:31,619
chastised but they were moving from

1098
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:33,119
places like Texas and Mississippi and

1099
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:35,400
Alabama to bring their kids to a place

1100
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:37,019
because Western medicine failed them and

1101
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:40,260
the side effects of Western medicine was

1102
00:35:37,019 --> 00:35:42,358
detrimental to to every aspect of that

1103
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:44,940
individual's life right and they came up

1104
00:35:42,358 --> 00:35:46,739
and they're going going from 95 seizures

1105
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:48,720
to five seizures a week how can you

1106
00:35:46,739 --> 00:35:50,519
argue with that you can't argue and so

1107
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:51,779
that's that's again I I told we were

1108
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:53,280
talking earlier that's when I came out

1109
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:55,200
of the proverbial green closet and I'm

1110
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,060
like I don't care what people think and

1111
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:58,858
you know quite honestly I'm at an age I

1112
00:35:57,059 --> 00:36:00,719
really shouldn't give a [ __ ] anyway you

1113
00:35:58,858 --> 00:36:01,858
know because what I believe in is what

1114
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:03,358
matters and I'm not saying I'm always

1115
00:36:01,858 --> 00:36:06,059
right and I'm not saying word is more

1116
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:07,619
I'm not but when you find out facts like

1117
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:09,900
that and you see how much it improves

1118
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:11,579
life and then you find out that the

1119
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:13,740
biggest studies from both the scientific

1120
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:15,240
and medical standpoint are happening in

1121
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:16,919
Tel Aviv Israel and I tell people like

1122
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:18,239
that is the epicenter of study on this

1123
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,500
plant they're like Israel I thought they

1124
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:21,479
were conservative I'm like no they're

1125
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:24,480
open-minded because they know not

1126
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:26,219
everything that can be a solution comes

1127
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,199
in a Petri dish and is man-made like

1128
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:30,239
trust Mother Nature she has a lot more

1129
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:33,239
answers for us than than people realize

1130
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:34,379
yeah you know so I definitely I feel the

1131
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:36,000
same way and that's what encouraged me

1132
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:37,019
to just stay and feel like you still

1133
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,420
enjoy it you still love it I'm like yeah

1134
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:41,099
I'm going on a decade I I can't imagine

1135
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:42,838
anything else you've been to a lot of

1136
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:45,838
cannabis events

1137
00:36:42,838 --> 00:36:49,259
I I have I have how many events have you

1138
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:51,358
been to I just hit my 190th uh yeah this

1139
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:52,859
past month and you know granted it's

1140
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:55,259
been over a decade but a majority of

1141
00:36:52,858 --> 00:36:57,539
those happen uh when first with weed

1142
00:36:55,260 --> 00:37:00,180
maps and to to now so it really happened

1143
00:36:57,539 --> 00:37:01,920
like in the last six years uh the one

1144
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:03,779
thing that I found and I actually wrote

1145
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,740
A series on it you probably know for mg

1146
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:07,680
magazine

1147
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:10,199
I wrote a multi-part series on the

1148
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:12,480
history of cannabis by country so I

1149
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:13,618
decided and I know again I've been kind

1150
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,880
of pushing more on that than other

1151
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:16,920
people in the space because a lot of

1152
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,599
people they kind of start local and Go

1153
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,639
Global and I decided to take a different

1154
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:22,019
approach I wanted to support it from a

1155
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:24,239
global level and bring it back home

1156
00:37:22,019 --> 00:37:25,500
right so I started looking into

1157
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:27,000
different countries and where they were

1158
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,099
and my travels were taking me there I

1159
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,659
mean thanks to Weedmaps I went on a tour

1160
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:32,460
and brought the product to Australia and

1161
00:37:30,659 --> 00:37:33,960
then went over to Europe and then more

1162
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:36,358
recently Thailand like we talked about

1163
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:38,639
South America Jamaica all these places

1164
00:37:36,358 --> 00:37:40,380
I've been to thanks to this plant and

1165
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:43,078
it's interesting because I found that

1166
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:45,000
you know there's Universal languages

1167
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:46,800
one of those things is food all of us

1168
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,539
need food we need stuff so we we need

1169
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,579
water we need to survive

1170
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:53,219
um but we all music is very Universal

1171
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:55,140
yeah words are not lyrics or not the

1172
00:37:53,219 --> 00:37:56,939
beat is is part of that heart and it's

1173
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:59,219
it's kind of like that that theme song

1174
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:01,200
to our life to function cannabis is

1175
00:37:59,219 --> 00:38:02,759
another it doesn't matter if I spoke the

1176
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:05,639
language or not I was greeted by Happy

1177
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:07,619
Smiles in the plant and so these are all

1178
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:09,598
just vibrations they are vibrations man

1179
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:12,420
everything in the earth is Shifting and

1180
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:15,480
it's it's moving into a faster vibration

1181
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:17,639
but everything has energy and that's

1182
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:19,740
what it comes back to but man I'm so

1183
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:22,139
thankful I mean some of the the ones

1184
00:38:19,739 --> 00:38:23,939
that really stand out is like nimbin uh

1185
00:38:22,139 --> 00:38:25,559
Mardi Gras down in immunizer for the

1186
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:28,260
25th anniversary and if you remember

1187
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:30,960
again earlier for us but we know this

1188
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:32,280
happened after the summer love here the

1189
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,780
the hippies were kind of pushed out

1190
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,940
because the yuppies were coming in the

1191
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:37,800
80s and and hippies were into granola

1192
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:40,139
and patchoulial and all that crazy stuff

1193
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:42,060
yeah so they were pushed out to Scotts

1194
00:38:40,139 --> 00:38:43,799
Valley or the locals stayed in Berkeley

1195
00:38:42,059 --> 00:38:46,440
but a lot went up to Menace Casino in

1196
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:49,019
Humboldt right you know up the coast

1197
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,519
and it was the same thing in Australia a

1198
00:38:49,019 --> 00:38:52,019
lot of those hippies moved out of Sydney

1199
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:53,639
and Brisbane and moved down to the

1200
00:38:52,019 --> 00:38:55,800
countryside on the border of New South

1201
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:57,539
Wales and Queensland and they started

1202
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:00,240
having this protestable and I went down

1203
00:38:57,539 --> 00:39:01,800
there and it was so experiential and it

1204
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:05,279
was so similar to here man I mean like

1205
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:07,440
the hairstyles uh the drum circles the

1206
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,240
the bong tossing competitions like all

1207
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,619
this stuff I'm like it's like being back

1208
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:12,479
in Northern California but with a

1209
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:13,858
different accent wow but everything else

1210
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,838
was like the whole the way they

1211
00:39:13,858 --> 00:39:17,578
respected the plant the Good Vibes they

1212
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:19,199
support each other that was pretty

1213
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:20,880
radical spanibus like we talked about

1214
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:23,098
I've been encouraging people for years

1215
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,200
I've seen the most people from from our

1216
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:28,079
side of the pond ever last this last

1217
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:30,659
year yeah out in spam this is insane

1218
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,859
um Expo weed the circuit down in in

1219
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:33,659
latam

1220
00:39:31,858 --> 00:39:35,699
um the Expo weed Chile specifically in

1221
00:39:33,659 --> 00:39:36,899
Santiago is phenomenal you get some

1222
00:39:35,699 --> 00:39:38,939
great guys that come over from Europe

1223
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:40,380
but from there's a whole culture down

1224
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:41,639
there I don't know why people don't

1225
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:43,320
really pay attention to South America

1226
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:45,239
but that's a whole other scene and they

1227
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:47,780
have a few land race that come out of

1228
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:51,000
there as well social history Africa

1229
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:52,859
Durban and and Johannesburg has a lot

1230
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,599
going on but several countries have been

1231
00:39:52,858 --> 00:39:56,519
producing for years over there so they

1232
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:59,640
have a whole vibe but I've been enjoying

1233
00:39:56,519 --> 00:40:01,079
it man it's really I tell people I there

1234
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:03,059
are places that were never on my bucket

1235
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:06,060
list in the Articles if you get a chance

1236
00:40:03,059 --> 00:40:08,578
Man Thailand like do do you know that

1237
00:40:06,059 --> 00:40:10,019
the U.S Postal Service has been one of

1238
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:12,180
the biggest drug dealers in history in

1239
00:40:10,019 --> 00:40:14,820
my opinion as far as trafficking but

1240
00:40:12,179 --> 00:40:17,759
when our troops would go on leave

1241
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:19,859
serving Vietnam they go over to the

1242
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,240
shores of Thailand and that's where they

1243
00:40:19,858 --> 00:40:22,858
discovered Thai stick and they're using

1244
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:24,479
the U.S Postal Service to ship that back

1245
00:40:22,858 --> 00:40:27,539
to their hippie friends back in the 60s

1246
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,699
here and then the term bong that's a

1247
00:40:27,539 --> 00:40:32,279
Thai term for how they consume cannabis

1248
00:40:29,699 --> 00:40:34,019
is bong and that was brought over so I

1249
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,940
learned stuff like that in doing that

1250
00:40:34,019 --> 00:40:37,500
series and again it brings a whole other

1251
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:39,059
level of respect of how this is very

1252
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:41,699
much a Universal Plant but it's a

1253
00:40:39,059 --> 00:40:43,019
universal culture too right so I've been

1254
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:44,098
loving it man and you're you're the same

1255
00:40:43,019 --> 00:40:45,480
like that's what I love about you and

1256
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:47,039
your Good Vibes you're like I'm just

1257
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,420
along for a phenomenal right and

1258
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:50,039
thankful to be a part of it and like

1259
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:52,200
both of us kind of have the same kind of

1260
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:53,519
yeah Extremely Blessed it's a great

1261
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:56,279
energy it's a great experience to have

1262
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:57,719
you know so definitely good stuff yeah

1263
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,040
it's pretty wild and you know the

1264
00:40:57,719 --> 00:41:01,980
different cultures all over and then

1265
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:04,559
Amsterdam at one point was the epicenter

1266
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:06,599
to a degree yeah it's changed it's

1267
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:08,159
changed half of the coffee shops have

1268
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:10,200
closed down the mayor who came in office

1269
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:12,539
she's a nice woman but she's been in

1270
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:14,039
since 18 now she's trying to push the

1271
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:15,300
red light district out to the edge of

1272
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:16,800
the city she's trying to push the

1273
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,060
Cannabis out to the city they're trying

1274
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,800
to make it so you have to be a legal

1275
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:21,420
resident to go into the coffee shops

1276
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:23,700
because they are technically safe havens

1277
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:25,980
right it's illegal to to produce and

1278
00:41:23,699 --> 00:41:27,480
Courier it's not technically legal or

1279
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:29,940
gray area until it crosses a threshold

1280
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:31,858
of the coffee shop so it's a system that

1281
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:33,960
did kind of get abused but you and I

1282
00:41:31,858 --> 00:41:35,819
both know this the real epicenter of

1283
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,260
cannabis in Europe is Spain and and

1284
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:40,320
really is Barcelona you're talking about

1285
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:41,640
Spain there's six 700 Social Clubs it's

1286
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:43,320
still a little more conservative than

1287
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:44,819
almost 10 years ago because 10 years ago

1288
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,019
you could go around smoking joints on

1289
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:47,880
the street and you can't really do that

1290
00:41:46,019 --> 00:41:49,259
anymore no you can't see it can't smell

1291
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,880
it can't hear it can't feel like it's

1292
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:52,079
that kind of space and the cat alone

1293
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,119
government has been trying to move it

1294
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,560
forward but I'll tell you man it's proof

1295
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:58,260
of concept because like being a member

1296
00:41:55,559 --> 00:42:00,539
of like HQ just as an example or dank of

1297
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:02,339
England down there and it proves that

1298
00:42:00,539 --> 00:42:04,980
people that choose to consume alcohol

1299
00:42:02,338 --> 00:42:07,199
can cohabitate with people who choose to

1300
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:08,579
consume flour and you can have an

1301
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:10,199
environment where where you can get

1302
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:12,539
drinks you can get food you can watch

1303
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:14,519
footy on the TV you can play snooker

1304
00:42:12,539 --> 00:42:16,980
whatever right but everyone gets along

1305
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:19,019
and everyone's Good Vibes you know and

1306
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:20,699
so it's like we're we're having this big

1307
00:42:19,019 --> 00:42:23,300
debate about social clubs domestically

1308
00:42:20,699 --> 00:42:25,739
it's like go to Spain

1309
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:27,000
yeah go experience and see that you you

1310
00:42:25,739 --> 00:42:28,199
can bring all these people together do

1311
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,320
it and you can watch if you don't smoke

1312
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:33,179
go experience it yeah like 100 yeah it's

1313
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:34,940
it's eye opening you know and we're

1314
00:42:33,179 --> 00:42:38,338
talking about places that serve alcohol

1315
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:41,700
that have cannabis a lot of hash and

1316
00:42:38,338 --> 00:42:42,719
stuff food or coffee or drinks and

1317
00:42:41,699 --> 00:42:44,338
they're not trying to hustle you through

1318
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:46,439
like the coffee shops is come in get

1319
00:42:44,338 --> 00:42:48,299
your spliff and your espresso and be

1320
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,679
done in 10 minutes that's not the

1321
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:51,359
mentality of the social club it's more

1322
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:53,098
of a co-op environment where you come to

1323
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:54,838
hang with friends and you might be

1324
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:56,519
watching soccer for three four hours

1325
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:58,739
yeah and they're not trying to rush you

1326
00:42:56,519 --> 00:43:01,800
out because you're invested in in that

1327
00:42:58,739 --> 00:43:03,779
that environment totally so yeah it's

1328
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,280
definitely um like I said it's it's been

1329
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:07,980
a great experience and and something

1330
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,480
that again both of us I think have fully

1331
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:11,219
enjoyed and enthralled ourselves in you

1332
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,780
know absolutely so

1333
00:43:11,219 --> 00:43:15,299
so yeah so what's your favorite strain

1334
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:17,099
well you know as far as genetics go what

1335
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:19,440
yeah what what do you I mean you said

1336
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:21,480
forbidden fruit a little bit Yeah but

1337
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,579
but as far as like you say I heard land

1338
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:25,858
race is there a particular land race

1339
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:27,359
that you prefer growing what where where

1340
00:43:25,858 --> 00:43:29,880
does that mean because land race

1341
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:32,880
encompasses quite a few different things

1342
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:34,380
yeah yeah so I've been nowhere to your

1343
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,180
level nowhere to someone like judgery's

1344
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:38,460
level but you know I've been collecting

1345
00:43:36,179 --> 00:43:40,679
through my travels and so I'm very

1346
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:42,780
fortunate to have some pure Durbin from

1347
00:43:40,679 --> 00:43:45,659
South Africa uh thanks to a good friend

1348
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:47,160
to get some tie from let's talk about

1349
00:43:45,659 --> 00:43:50,399
Durban real quick because it's been a

1350
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:52,139
Hot Topic so I believe that the Durban

1351
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,838
in the United States is not the same

1352
00:43:52,139 --> 00:43:57,779
Durban that we experienced that they

1353
00:43:54,838 --> 00:44:00,000
came from yeah Africa correct I believe

1354
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:03,000
it's the super silver haze cross that uh

1355
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,159
greenhouse and Scentsy had and and some

1356
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,980
other people yep I think uh Simon from

1357
00:44:05,159 --> 00:44:10,799
Sirius they had a Durban Poison and but

1358
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:13,139
I believe it was crossed with a haze and

1359
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,420
so the haze is very dominant it leans

1360
00:44:13,139 --> 00:44:18,000
towards that the real true Durbin is

1361
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:21,380
definitely more musky in my opinion it

1362
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,380
is um sandal

1363
00:44:22,099 --> 00:44:30,059
that licoricey kind of muskiness yeah

1364
00:44:26,219 --> 00:44:31,679
it's a really earthy cultivar and

1365
00:44:30,059 --> 00:44:33,179
um I didn't pop the seeds that I got

1366
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:35,759
from over there but I gave him to a good

1367
00:44:33,179 --> 00:44:37,679
friend Johnny Ray from Rey's he's about

1368
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,900
an hour east of Garberville phenomenal

1369
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:43,078
closed loop has sheep on the hill worms

1370
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:44,280
everything's all I'm a huge he's a hip

1371
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:46,318
neck through and through one of the

1372
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:49,200
smartest guys I've ever met and I gave

1373
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:51,358
my seeds to hit not all of them but gave

1374
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:53,159
a good amount of seeds to him uh he

1375
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:54,900
pulled out full term outdoor right you

1376
00:44:53,159 --> 00:44:57,899
know he's got nature to work with

1377
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:59,940
he sent me a picture and he showed me

1378
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:01,260
their trees he should and again this is

1379
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:02,880
another thing you know when it's more

1380
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:05,400
pure not cross because you write a lot

1381
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:08,039
of the the land race came through Europe

1382
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:09,420
and so when you get a land race from

1383
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:11,219
South Africa that's traveling through

1384
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:12,180
Europe or you get something from Asia or

1385
00:45:11,219 --> 00:45:13,799
you get something from the Middle East

1386
00:45:12,179 --> 00:45:15,299
that's traveling through Europe to your

1387
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,280
point they try to hardier they try to

1388
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:18,960
morph it and it's not the same because

1389
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,300
there's three different places no it

1390
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:24,358
doesn't you know by butt really quick

1391
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:25,740
tangent so so Northern Knights which I

1392
00:45:24,358 --> 00:45:27,960
was just doing there they had their 10

1393
00:45:25,739 --> 00:45:30,479
year anniversary and so they wanted to

1394
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,920
do a cultivar with Northern Lights which

1395
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,420
to answer your question that is one of

1396
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,639
my favorite is Northern Lights I like

1397
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:37,200
because I grew up with it and he sends

1398
00:45:35,639 --> 00:45:39,779
me video he had three different Farms

1399
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:41,338
including his own grow and he sent me a

1400
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:43,260
video of it and I'm like yeah that's it

1401
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:44,759
the bud structure that's how I didn't

1402
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:46,079
have to smell it I didn't have to taste

1403
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,880
it I saw the bud structure I'm like

1404
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,740
that's it so that is a Northern Lights

1405
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:51,720
Dom it's crossed with a specific look

1406
00:45:49,739 --> 00:45:53,399
yeah it has a very specific look and

1407
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:55,439
especially when you know how it's grown

1408
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:57,660
and that's again I think why I lean

1409
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:00,659
towards outdoor because the manipulation

1410
00:45:57,659 --> 00:46:01,858
that occurs indoor the the the bud

1411
00:46:00,659 --> 00:46:03,899
structure doesn't always express

1412
00:46:01,858 --> 00:46:06,480
correctly in my opinion when I let it go

1413
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:09,240
Outdoors so going back to to John

1414
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:11,039
he showed me a picture he already grows

1415
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:12,539
trees but he had a 12 foot ladder

1416
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:15,179
standing next to this thing and it was

1417
00:46:12,539 --> 00:46:18,059
14 foot tall this and I'll show you the

1418
00:46:15,179 --> 00:46:20,159
picture it was incredible and that's how

1419
00:46:18,059 --> 00:46:22,259
I knew that it wasn't something crossed

1420
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:23,940
with a dwarf or a large or something out

1421
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:26,040
because that's too many people across

1422
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:27,240
based on what's convenient oh this is

1423
00:46:26,039 --> 00:46:28,800
something that won't you know

1424
00:46:27,239 --> 00:46:29,939
contaminate the rest of my car this is

1425
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,220
something that won't get me in trouble

1426
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:33,900
it'll stay stunted or dwarfed like a

1427
00:46:32,219 --> 00:46:36,598
Swain yo that's another I'm a huge fan

1428
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:39,119
of sueno nobody knows that it's a 50 50

1429
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:40,920
pretty much of sour d and blue dream too

1430
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:43,619
that we were growing along with AK-47

1431
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:46,318
when we were still pushing packs back in

1432
00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:48,660
the late 90s early 2000s nobody likes to

1433
00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:50,818
grow because it's a Squatty not easy to

1434
00:46:48,659 --> 00:46:53,219
grow high maintenance plant but the

1435
00:46:50,818 --> 00:46:55,139
experiential is phenomenal so so going

1436
00:46:53,219 --> 00:46:56,879
back to yeah I really I do genuinely

1437
00:46:55,139 --> 00:46:59,460
like the land race they are sincerely

1438
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,780
hard to find I did find a guy over in

1439
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:03,358
Europe that supposedly has a true

1440
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:05,160
Northern Lights in the meantime I'm okay

1441
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:08,400
with you know I'm gonna get some seeds

1442
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:10,618
from because I think Andrea actually if

1443
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:13,920
I understand he got those from Nat up at

1444
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:15,660
HSC so and it's a it's a Northern Lights

1445
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,818
cross with GMO crossed with something

1446
00:47:15,659 --> 00:47:19,078
else but that does entice me if you're

1447
00:47:17,818 --> 00:47:21,300
looking for a cut of some real Northern

1448
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:22,619
Lights I got your back oh my gosh if you

1449
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:24,359
do it because seriously I've been

1450
00:47:22,619 --> 00:47:26,338
looking in the only place everyone keeps

1451
00:47:24,358 --> 00:47:27,719
directing me back to it he's a nice guy

1452
00:47:26,338 --> 00:47:29,400
I just haven't had the chance to meet

1453
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:31,858
them in person that'd be phenomenal so

1454
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:33,180
yeah my buddy Gordon my buddy Gordon has

1455
00:47:31,858 --> 00:47:35,279
done a lot of work he's from Grass

1456
00:47:33,179 --> 00:47:37,799
Valley but he's done a lot of work with

1457
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:39,060
Northern Lights and Sour Diesel and you

1458
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:41,400
know he's nice

1459
00:47:39,059 --> 00:47:43,799
he's got a huge collection of stuff and

1460
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:45,180
yeah it's definitely accessible I'd love

1461
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,400
that because that is a one there's just

1462
00:47:45,179 --> 00:47:48,899
something again for me because we know

1463
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:51,180
it's subjective our endocannabinoid

1464
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:53,160
systems yeah that's just always been oh

1465
00:47:51,179 --> 00:47:55,139
yeah it's so subjective you know what

1466
00:47:53,159 --> 00:47:56,879
works for one person isn't necessarily

1467
00:47:55,139 --> 00:47:58,618
going to work for the next some some

1468
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,358
person might like this profile it's just

1469
00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:02,519
like food and it is and everything else

1470
00:48:00,358 --> 00:48:04,139
it is yeah why do you like purple grapes

1471
00:48:02,519 --> 00:48:05,579
and I like green grapes you know you

1472
00:48:04,139 --> 00:48:06,900
like the sweetness I like the Sour

1473
00:48:05,579 --> 00:48:08,940
Whatever It Is and they got some crazy

1474
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:11,760
grapes coming out today cotton candy

1475
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:14,099
grapes are pretty pretty dope but which

1476
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,839
is fingers or whatever yeah they're

1477
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:17,460
insane and it's you know as long as it's

1478
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:19,139
natural I'm all for it you know I'm not

1479
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:21,119
about the yeah and I mean a lot of that

1480
00:48:19,139 --> 00:48:22,559
stuff we'd heard GMO but like the truth

1481
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:24,720
is like a lot of that stuff is actually

1482
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:27,659
just data driven breeding and actually

1483
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:28,980
experimentation and so but but done on a

1484
00:48:27,659 --> 00:48:30,420
different level than I think a lot of

1485
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:33,000
people are dealing with cannabis yeah

1486
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:34,619
but that's that's changing that's that's

1487
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,300
slowly changing I mean data-driven

1488
00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:37,619
beating is definitely changing I think a

1489
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:39,180
lot of guys that I know that are doing

1490
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:41,519
breeding at scale

1491
00:48:39,179 --> 00:48:43,500
are actually using data yeah it's like

1492
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:44,940
you kind of need to now if you're doing

1493
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:47,579
Autoflower breeding you should be doing

1494
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:49,559
using data as well yeah but which we

1495
00:48:47,579 --> 00:48:51,119
know how huge that is because you we've

1496
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:52,440
got a lot of similar friends across the

1497
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:54,000
pond and you know of course they use

1498
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:55,619
because of the growing environment where

1499
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,199
it is dense population that they're all

1500
00:48:55,619 --> 00:48:59,460
about the Autos but it seems like to

1501
00:48:58,199 --> 00:49:01,379
your point a lot of them are going more

1502
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:03,480
towards science and in versus the

1503
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:04,980
traditional well you have to to a degree

1504
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:06,659
I mean you can do whatever you know if

1505
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:08,460
you're doing small tents that's one

1506
00:49:06,659 --> 00:49:11,159
thing but if you're planting an acre or

1507
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:13,019
two acres or 20 acres you want something

1508
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:15,719
that's consistent and you want to

1509
00:49:13,019 --> 00:49:16,920
improve that over Generations if you're

1510
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:18,539
if you're making seeds you might as well

1511
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:19,800
be making better seeds yeah you know

1512
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:22,318
instead of just making seeds to make

1513
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:24,300
seeds I feel like you're either going

1514
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:26,099
one way or another if you're not going

1515
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:28,740
right in the middle every time unless

1516
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:30,240
it's stable which it's not no so that

1517
00:49:28,739 --> 00:49:31,500
you see it with regs the inconsistent

1518
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:34,199
going back to when you're when you're

1519
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:36,420
running just plain old seeds you it's a

1520
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:37,980
crap shoot yeah I never know what I'm

1521
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:40,619
gonna get good bad or ugly you know

1522
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:42,300
totally so well and then the thing is is

1523
00:49:40,619 --> 00:49:44,400
growing it out multiple times it's like

1524
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:46,260
if you just go from seed Outdoors the

1525
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,760
next year you grow that same cut it's

1526
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:49,800
probably going to be different yeah yeah

1527
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,839
so besides the environmental stuff it's

1528
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:54,900
genetically you know it's genetically

1529
00:49:51,838 --> 00:49:56,159
more mature yeah so yeah very true so

1530
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:57,780
yeah there's there's just sexual

1531
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:58,618
maturity that goes on where if you grow

1532
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:00,420
it

1533
00:49:58,619 --> 00:50:01,800
multiple times usually the third time

1534
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:03,119
the fourth time sometimes you hit it

1535
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:05,339
right the first time

1536
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:07,619
but it's those the the third generation

1537
00:50:05,338 --> 00:50:08,880
I feel like is is more of a true

1538
00:50:07,619 --> 00:50:10,019
expression of where you're going to get

1539
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,760
down there what you want yeah yeah

1540
00:50:10,019 --> 00:50:13,500
because I've done those what I ran last

1541
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,359
year was F1 and it was

1542
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:17,579
little basket case I mean I was

1543
00:50:15,358 --> 00:50:19,619
surprised like in veg it was some of the

1544
00:50:17,579 --> 00:50:21,180
fast sleeves I ever saw and not just to

1545
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:22,318
stereotype but to a certain extent you

1546
00:50:21,179 --> 00:50:24,419
do pay attention to those things and I'm

1547
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:26,099
like wow this is way leaning towards an

1548
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:27,900
indica and I mean even just clonal

1549
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:29,338
Generations so to take in a clone as

1550
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:31,139
opposed to Growing from seed getting

1551
00:50:29,338 --> 00:50:33,239
that Colonial generation a couple of

1552
00:50:31,139 --> 00:50:35,219
those in so you really know because the

1553
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:37,559
genetics stabilized and then you get the

1554
00:50:35,219 --> 00:50:39,259
same expression yeah and then you put in

1555
00:50:37,559 --> 00:50:41,578
tissue cultures

1556
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:44,220
what's your opinion on I'm just kind of

1557
00:50:41,579 --> 00:50:45,480
curious on um how long to heat moms

1558
00:50:44,219 --> 00:50:47,338
around because I have some friends of

1559
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:50,039
like nine ten rounds and I'm like

1560
00:50:47,338 --> 00:50:53,099
doesn't it get to a point to where well

1561
00:50:50,039 --> 00:50:56,338
so so there's there's a lot of

1562
00:50:53,099 --> 00:50:57,720
debate on on the subject and I feel like

1563
00:50:56,338 --> 00:50:59,880
if your moms are healthy you can keep

1564
00:50:57,719 --> 00:51:02,818
using them but

1565
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:04,500
but yeah from tissue culture we do two

1566
00:51:02,818 --> 00:51:06,838
two rounds of clones and then put new

1567
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:09,179
moms in right because we're worried

1568
00:51:06,838 --> 00:51:12,960
about uh viral load we're worried about

1569
00:51:09,179 --> 00:51:15,358
yeah just just uh renewing the Clones to

1570
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:17,400
keep them at the most optimal point and

1571
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:19,259
so we're doing gen one from tissue

1572
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:22,019
culture so we have the Gen zeros which

1573
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:23,280
are the tissue culture uh plants and

1574
00:51:22,019 --> 00:51:24,719
then we take the Clones off of those

1575
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,059
those are the Gen ones and we like those

1576
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:29,338
the best nice so I feel like they're the

1577
00:51:27,059 --> 00:51:31,380
most consistent they they respond the

1578
00:51:29,338 --> 00:51:32,519
most consistently

1579
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,780
um not that there's anything wrong with

1580
00:51:32,519 --> 00:51:36,900
Gen zeros they're a little bit harder to

1581
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:39,180
work with yeah so it's just one of those

1582
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:41,700
things but yeah two rounds uh but I've

1583
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:43,199
seen people put their you know we I was

1584
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:44,578
talking about DJ Short a while back but

1585
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:46,618
putting them in the ground every year

1586
00:51:44,579 --> 00:51:48,720
you've let them veg out and then you

1587
00:51:46,619 --> 00:51:50,700
know the the vibrations of the earth

1588
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:52,919
restore the genetics but there is truth

1589
00:51:50,699 --> 00:51:55,199
to that you get really rapid growth

1590
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:57,358
Outdoors so you're gonna get really

1591
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:59,098
clean cuts uh so if you don't have

1592
00:51:57,358 --> 00:52:01,019
tissue culture that's that's an option

1593
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:03,900
yeah so yeah that's the next best thing

1594
00:52:01,019 --> 00:52:06,659
you know nice cool man yeah it's good

1595
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:08,880
stuff yeah man so I guess we get we need

1596
00:52:06,659 --> 00:52:10,259
smoke we didn't smoke it we're gonna

1597
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:13,140
smoke something light we're gonna smoke

1598
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:15,720
some uh contest entry here oh no way

1599
00:52:13,139 --> 00:52:17,578
it's from the loops love the contest too

1600
00:52:15,719 --> 00:52:18,959
I was following that that's great and

1601
00:52:17,579 --> 00:52:21,119
you actually wanted the entrants I think

1602
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,800
uh you're fourth place it's like we

1603
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,900
actually submitted ours in Turf block I

1604
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,640
was like that's super dope yeah they did

1605
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:27,900
totally it was great seeing chirp walk

1606
00:52:26,639 --> 00:52:29,578
in there and

1607
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:31,019
you know we're doing it from clone next

1608
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:32,579
time we're gonna do tissue culture clone

1609
00:52:31,019 --> 00:52:34,920
for the next contest I feel like it'll

1610
00:52:32,579 --> 00:52:36,059
even even the playing field out a little

1611
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,619
bit more when you give genetics

1612
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:39,480
especially stuff that's not super stable

1613
00:52:37,619 --> 00:52:41,640
you get stuff all across the board

1614
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:42,659
yeah kind of taking more to that formula

1615
00:52:41,639 --> 00:52:44,639
one type where it's a little more

1616
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:45,899
uniform definitely makes sense

1617
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:47,818
so

1618
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:51,180
to your point Level Playing Field how

1619
00:52:47,818 --> 00:52:54,199
it's expressed this is this is uh

1620
00:52:51,179 --> 00:52:56,460
that is the way to smoke extremely fat

1621
00:52:54,199 --> 00:52:58,679
so I I think a lot of people say that

1622
00:52:56,460 --> 00:53:00,900
like I guess that's how I smoke mostly

1623
00:52:58,679 --> 00:53:03,419
because I feel like above two grams

1624
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:06,000
you really start getting the flavor

1625
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:08,460
uh I like the way they hit I like the

1626
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,659
way they re-fire

1627
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:11,880
um

1628
00:53:09,659 --> 00:53:15,739
nice candy chirps in there

1629
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:15,740
it's smooth too yeah

1630
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:26,219
so we've smoked almost all of the

1631
00:53:22,318 --> 00:53:28,259
entries no way all gone yeah I mean how

1632
00:53:26,219 --> 00:53:29,759
long was from start I'm not trying to be

1633
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:31,020
the interviewer yeah yeah that's okay

1634
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,220
I'm kind of curious man because I was

1635
00:53:31,019 --> 00:53:34,559
falling as much as I could during my

1636
00:53:32,219 --> 00:53:36,118
travels but two week period it wasn't it

1637
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:37,800
felt like it went by so quick yeah it

1638
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:42,000
really wasn't long enough it was 15 days

1639
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:44,579
right okay 15 days and you're smoking

1640
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,260
every day in that 15 day period you're

1641
00:53:44,579 --> 00:53:48,660
eliminating stuff right off the bat like

1642
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:50,940
there's stuff that just got eliminated

1643
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:52,558
you know I got it down to 10 and then

1644
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:53,880
those I would smoke one and then wait

1645
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:55,680
two hours because I want to feel the

1646
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:57,300
effect yeah it was about the effect but

1647
00:53:55,679 --> 00:53:59,098
also about the flavor right and you

1648
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:01,260
don't want to kill your palate and if

1649
00:53:59,099 --> 00:54:04,318
you're smoking every day you gotta drink

1650
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:05,700
a ton of water uh you know and then what

1651
00:54:04,318 --> 00:54:07,858
you're doing is you're comparing one to

1652
00:54:05,699 --> 00:54:09,659
the next one to the next and at the end

1653
00:54:07,858 --> 00:54:11,699
sometimes I'd fire both of them up back

1654
00:54:09,659 --> 00:54:13,139
and forth and go okay well I like the

1655
00:54:11,699 --> 00:54:16,078
way this tastes or I like the way this

1656
00:54:13,139 --> 00:54:18,299
this doesn't burn uh and I'm using rice

1657
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:20,160
paper so I do a reverse roll with rice

1658
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:21,720
paper yeah yeah I feel like that gives

1659
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:24,000
you a little more neutral this is

1660
00:54:21,719 --> 00:54:26,338
actually a raw paper I like raw papers

1661
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:30,358
too but as far as like for the for the

1662
00:54:26,338 --> 00:54:32,400
no burn I like the rice nice so it's

1663
00:54:30,358 --> 00:54:34,259
also subjective too you know it is

1664
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,400
that's a again it is but I think there's

1665
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:37,559
some things like to your point if you

1666
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:40,318
did early elimination I'm I'm willing to

1667
00:54:37,559 --> 00:54:42,059
Guess that those are ones that were kind

1668
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:44,099
of obvious in nothing I'm sure everyone

1669
00:54:42,059 --> 00:54:46,079
great on efforts but they probably

1670
00:54:44,099 --> 00:54:48,119
failed somewhere along post Harvest

1671
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:50,460
right so something just wasn't I think

1672
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:51,720
the contest was rushed to be 100 honest

1673
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:54,838
we gave people seeds in December

1674
00:54:51,719 --> 00:54:57,598
expected them to have flour from seed in

1675
00:54:54,838 --> 00:54:58,799
June that's and if you if you waited a

1676
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:00,900
little bit too long to pop those seeds

1677
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:03,420
you're having a harvest early yeah and

1678
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:05,460
that was the main culprit I think for

1679
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:06,900
the problem is people had to harvest a

1680
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:08,699
little early even then some of the stuff

1681
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:10,500
that we've tested you know like we've

1682
00:55:08,699 --> 00:55:12,838
popped some of the seeds since we have

1683
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:14,400
something that finishes super early but

1684
00:55:12,838 --> 00:55:15,659
not everything's like that and then you

1685
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,160
know with growing conditions and

1686
00:55:15,659 --> 00:55:19,618
environments you just never know like

1687
00:55:17,159 --> 00:55:21,000
even people grow in closets if it's

1688
00:55:19,619 --> 00:55:22,619
extra cold it's going to take a little

1689
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,199
bit longer you know if you don't have

1690
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:26,640
your environmentals dialed in

1691
00:55:25,199 --> 00:55:29,159
but yeah so we're going to be doing

1692
00:55:26,639 --> 00:55:31,379
another contest here in a couple months

1693
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:32,940
should be super exciting we love to

1694
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:34,500
sponsor again man is stoked when you hit

1695
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:36,599
me up I mean I know I know you're a fan

1696
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:38,219
like you said I I do the same thing too

1697
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:40,260
I did the Pepsi challenge before I came

1698
00:55:38,219 --> 00:55:41,639
on and obviously drank the Kool-Aid yeah

1699
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:43,380
through and through and been nothing but

1700
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:44,699
stoked with the product but when you

1701
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:46,200
reached out and said hey this is why I'm

1702
00:55:44,699 --> 00:55:47,639
doing this what I want to do that's what

1703
00:55:46,199 --> 00:55:50,399
we want to support that's something that

1704
00:55:47,639 --> 00:55:52,379
I've made very clear I I love my CEO he

1705
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:54,838
he gives me the freedom that I desire to

1706
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:56,220
to make it be successful

1707
00:55:54,838 --> 00:55:58,259
um but I was very clear and adamant

1708
00:55:56,219 --> 00:56:00,598
about how I'm Community First you know I

1709
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:01,980
mean this is and again you don't have to

1710
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:03,720
be from NorCal you don't have to be

1711
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:06,358
brought up by hippies to be culturally

1712
00:56:03,719 --> 00:56:08,219
inclined or or to respect the craft but

1713
00:56:06,358 --> 00:56:09,598
when it is kind of instilled in you it's

1714
00:56:08,219 --> 00:56:13,318
easier for you to know what the right

1715
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:15,420
decisions are in in life and I'm so

1716
00:56:13,318 --> 00:56:16,679
fortunate that again you know he allows

1717
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:18,180
that but that's what we're trying to do

1718
00:56:16,679 --> 00:56:20,578
more of is supporting the community

1719
00:56:18,179 --> 00:56:22,199
because they need it more so than ever I

1720
00:56:20,579 --> 00:56:23,539
mean it was like you talked about so you

1721
00:56:22,199 --> 00:56:26,699
went to the head I went up to the hill

1722
00:56:23,539 --> 00:56:27,838
and I thought I'd see more Growers these

1723
00:56:26,699 --> 00:56:30,000
guys aren't coming out and it's tough

1724
00:56:27,838 --> 00:56:32,219
times right now you the industry is

1725
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,440
going micro macro and I talked to you

1726
00:56:32,219 --> 00:56:35,759
earlier about how you can easily compare

1727
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:38,338
the Canadian Market to the California

1728
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:40,020
Market because both of them came out

1729
00:56:38,338 --> 00:56:41,578
guns Ablaze and didn't necessarily do

1730
00:56:40,019 --> 00:56:43,559
things right you had the wrong guys that

1731
00:56:41,579 --> 00:56:45,359
were pushing all the weight now the the

1732
00:56:43,559 --> 00:56:46,680
craft guys the culture guys are the ones

1733
00:56:45,358 --> 00:56:48,598
that are coming up because they can

1734
00:56:46,679 --> 00:56:49,980
stand through storms whereas others

1735
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:51,359
can't right especially when the money

1736
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:53,059
pulls out when everything eventually

1737
00:56:51,358 --> 00:56:56,639
comes full circle

1738
00:56:53,059 --> 00:56:58,559
into Canada it's like LPS and then even

1739
00:56:56,639 --> 00:57:00,179
LP's coming into California though there

1740
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:01,920
was a lot of LPS in California they were

1741
00:57:00,179 --> 00:57:04,799
in the beginning yeah there was a move

1742
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:06,358
especially during covid man a lot of the

1743
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:09,000
lp a lot of the Canadian money was

1744
00:57:06,358 --> 00:57:10,619
coming in and I mean even like wanna I

1745
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,539
would have never thought in a you know

1746
00:57:10,619 --> 00:57:14,400
love obviously what Nancy and the team

1747
00:57:12,539 --> 00:57:15,480
of Joe hodus I go way back over there

1748
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,280
marketing

1749
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:19,318
but I was kind of surprised you know

1750
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:22,319
like some of the inequality was so rough

1751
00:57:19,318 --> 00:57:24,539
yeah and then compared to places like

1752
00:57:22,318 --> 00:57:27,058
Colorado and Washington that legalized

1753
00:57:24,539 --> 00:57:28,318
first yeah their markets stabilized I

1754
00:57:27,059 --> 00:57:29,880
mean they've done a whole nother round

1755
00:57:28,318 --> 00:57:32,159
of consolidation though over the last

1756
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:33,599
year it's really struggled during covet

1757
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:35,879
everybody had a good covet and so the

1758
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:37,680
ones that over expanded really had a

1759
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:39,358
rough time during the consolidation the

1760
00:57:37,679 --> 00:57:41,578
ones that are still around are yeah you

1761
00:57:39,358 --> 00:57:43,619
know it's improved yep yeah and it is

1762
00:57:41,579 --> 00:57:45,539
you're right it's very and as long as it

1763
00:57:43,619 --> 00:57:47,400
isn't uh Federal we're going to talk it

1764
00:57:45,539 --> 00:57:49,980
at this level but I did just do a Show

1765
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:52,019
recently in Oklahoma and it was not good

1766
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:54,240
like they're going through a hard reset

1767
00:57:52,019 --> 00:57:57,179
but then I also you don't want to be

1768
00:57:54,239 --> 00:57:58,379
critical but I'm still a baffled man

1769
00:57:57,179 --> 00:58:00,000
being in Colorado and it's weird

1770
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:01,559
everyone's like you got the business in

1771
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,119
Colorado and you're from California but

1772
00:58:01,559 --> 00:58:04,920
it was a good experience to cut my teeth

1773
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:06,838
in a market like that yeah because I

1774
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:09,180
brought the experience but also saw how

1775
00:58:06,838 --> 00:58:10,980
it was for a market that wasn't familiar

1776
00:58:09,179 --> 00:58:13,139
with legal is because we legalized a lot

1777
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:14,639
of people I mean we legalized prop P you

1778
00:58:13,139 --> 00:58:16,739
know which San Francisco is a city and

1779
00:58:14,639 --> 00:58:18,960
county but prophe was legalized in 1990

1780
00:58:16,739 --> 00:58:20,519
so people think 96 for medical we

1781
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,440
technically have no medical since the

1782
00:58:20,519 --> 00:58:25,619
beginning since we were in high school

1783
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:27,720
that way and so going to a market like

1784
00:58:25,619 --> 00:58:28,920
Colorado and to your point like I felt

1785
00:58:27,719 --> 00:58:30,118
like they did it pretty well they had to

1786
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:31,559
rework it and all the rest of it but

1787
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:32,880
then Washington oh we'll kind of do it

1788
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:34,440
our way we're a little different I

1789
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:37,039
didn't agree with how they oh you don't

1790
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:37,039
need medical anymore

1791
00:58:38,358 --> 00:58:43,679
my one of my aunts she's she is Medical

1792
00:58:41,699 --> 00:58:45,539
in Washington and she was a medical

1793
00:58:43,679 --> 00:58:47,039
grower growing for herself and to tell

1794
00:58:45,539 --> 00:58:48,838
her that she can't grow anymore that she

1795
00:58:47,039 --> 00:58:51,960
has to go buy it from somebody yep she's

1796
00:58:48,838 --> 00:58:52,980
been pushing Organics since the 90s you

1797
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:56,639
know she's one of the longest living

1798
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:58,260
survivors of AIDS in HIV wow and I just

1799
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:00,539
did the walk here in San Francisco over

1800
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:02,339
the weekend it's a pretty wild you know

1801
00:59:00,539 --> 00:59:03,960
and she's been a cannabis consumer for a

1802
00:59:02,338 --> 00:59:06,659
long time but to tell her that she can't

1803
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:08,519
she can no longer grow legally you know

1804
00:59:06,659 --> 00:59:10,318
which I guess they allow a small amount

1805
00:59:08,519 --> 00:59:11,699
of plants but it's like they they

1806
00:59:10,318 --> 00:59:12,900
technically know I mean that's I tell

1807
00:59:11,699 --> 00:59:14,098
people like Washington is one of those

1808
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:16,019
states where it's not even people like

1809
00:59:14,099 --> 00:59:17,760
really and I'm like yeah like not

1810
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:20,219
everyone's doing it absolutely right say

1811
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,660
well Oregon Oregon Limitless license and

1812
00:59:20,219 --> 00:59:23,039
then all of a sudden guys I'm growing

1813
00:59:21,659 --> 00:59:24,539
hemp and pushing all that stuff to the

1814
00:59:23,039 --> 00:59:27,000
to the other coast that was a whole

1815
00:59:24,539 --> 00:59:29,099
crazy oh my gosh and then Oklahoma did

1816
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,260
the same I'm like does nobody learn

1817
00:59:29,099 --> 00:59:33,240
money the government's like let's just

1818
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:35,160
give her away so we get as much money as

1819
00:59:33,239 --> 00:59:37,259
possible and as quickly as possible

1820
00:59:35,159 --> 00:59:39,358
that's why I tell people it's short-term

1821
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:41,760
gain or long-term goal and that was very

1822
00:59:39,358 --> 00:59:42,779
selfish of the government to say Hey you

1823
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,520
know we're going to play the extreme

1824
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:47,040
capitalism card we'll get rich along the

1825
00:59:44,519 --> 00:59:49,259
way but what happened let's get rich

1826
00:59:47,039 --> 00:59:50,639
quick instead of like look look at the

1827
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:52,380
long term and invest in it yeah you know

1828
00:59:50,639 --> 00:59:54,298
unfortunately a lot of people are

1829
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:56,400
short-sighted and it happens in every

1830
00:59:54,298 --> 00:59:57,539
aspect of life you know triple they look

1831
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,858
at the immediate and they're like oh

1832
00:59:57,539 --> 01:00:00,838
look how much we can get for these

1833
00:59:58,858 --> 01:00:02,639
licenses let's just get all that money

1834
01:00:00,838 --> 01:00:04,619
and then we'll worry about it down the

1835
01:00:02,639 --> 01:00:06,659
road we can adjust the laws or we can do

1836
01:00:04,619 --> 01:00:07,740
this unfortunately you're getting some

1837
01:00:06,659 --> 01:00:10,379
of those people that are producing

1838
01:00:07,739 --> 01:00:13,199
amazing flour like in California that

1839
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:15,838
there's this barrier for entry to get in

1840
01:00:13,199 --> 01:00:18,179
the legal you know in the legal own

1841
01:00:15,838 --> 01:00:19,739
unfortunately if I pay quarter million

1842
01:00:18,179 --> 01:00:21,838
dollars for his like just to get legal

1843
01:00:19,739 --> 01:00:23,639
from the Shadows phenomenal grower

1844
01:00:21,838 --> 01:00:24,599
phenomenal product in his like Lance it

1845
01:00:23,639 --> 01:00:26,039
cost me a quarter million and everyone

1846
01:00:24,599 --> 01:00:27,720
thinks they have that buried in their

1847
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:28,858
backyard by the way everything said all

1848
01:00:27,719 --> 01:00:30,899
the guys on the Hill are still sitting

1849
01:00:28,858 --> 01:00:33,179
on a million dollars in in you know shoe

1850
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:35,639
boxes no there's a ton of guys that it

1851
01:00:33,179 --> 01:00:37,139
was the barrier for entry and you either

1852
01:00:35,639 --> 01:00:38,818
had shitty quality and you couldn't get

1853
01:00:37,139 --> 01:00:40,139
in or you had great quality but you

1854
01:00:38,818 --> 01:00:43,019
didn't have the money or the resources

1855
01:00:40,139 --> 01:00:45,118
very true so yeah but those guys are

1856
01:00:43,019 --> 01:00:46,798
kind there's some like I still have

1857
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:48,358
friends too they grow amazing flower

1858
01:00:46,798 --> 01:00:49,858
that don't they don't even give a [ __ ]

1859
01:00:48,358 --> 01:00:51,900
they do other things you know I mean so

1860
01:00:49,858 --> 01:00:53,338
it's like the hobbyist grower and some

1861
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:54,480
of the those guys got the best flower

1862
01:00:53,338 --> 01:00:55,798
too and they're making it work they're

1863
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:57,179
smart and then you have the ones who did

1864
01:00:55,798 --> 01:00:58,980
come out and now they're worried to go

1865
01:00:57,179 --> 01:01:00,358
back into the Shadows so a few of those

1866
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:02,280
guys they're doing organic produce and

1867
01:01:00,358 --> 01:01:03,420
going back to farmers markets or GCS

1868
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,619
like I know a couple guys and now

1869
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:06,900
they're normally carry general

1870
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:08,640
contractor dude like you know more about

1871
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:11,818
growing than I know about everything in

1872
01:01:08,639 --> 01:01:13,679
the world like like you are a master but

1873
01:01:11,818 --> 01:01:16,019
they have to be realistic and go hey

1874
01:01:13,679 --> 01:01:18,179
it's just not you know totally so but

1875
01:01:16,019 --> 01:01:20,280
every Market is it's but I was I was sad

1876
01:01:18,179 --> 01:01:21,960
saddened for Oklahoma because it was

1877
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:23,700
It's really hurting you know it's really

1878
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:25,740
hurting out there but well the beauty of

1879
01:01:23,699 --> 01:01:26,879
it is they can change we can change we

1880
01:01:25,739 --> 01:01:28,500
can all change we can all make a

1881
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:30,358
difference we can recognize the problems

1882
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:32,880
and then have solutions to correct those

1883
01:01:30,358 --> 01:01:34,380
problems yeah learn from the wrongs so

1884
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:36,358
where do you see the industry going in

1885
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:38,039
the next five years you know it's oh my

1886
01:01:36,358 --> 01:01:40,619
God we have to stabilize a little more

1887
01:01:38,039 --> 01:01:41,818
yeah I would assume we definitely do you

1888
01:01:40,619 --> 01:01:43,200
know I've been concerned I thought it

1889
01:01:41,818 --> 01:01:45,119
was going to happen at the end of

1890
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:47,279
Trump's term and and some say that

1891
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:49,559
there's a possibility during Biden's

1892
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:51,298
term but I still feel like Federal

1893
01:01:49,559 --> 01:01:52,680
legalization is going to be a political

1894
01:01:51,298 --> 01:01:53,780
Pawn you know I think it's gonna be one

1895
01:01:52,679 --> 01:01:57,118
of us

1896
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:59,760
yeah and this is silly this is pewdata

1897
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:02,700
you guys this is not this is not headset

1898
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:05,520
PDS New Frontier this isn't a niche or

1899
01:02:02,699 --> 01:02:08,578
industry specific analytics or data

1900
01:02:05,519 --> 01:02:10,858
company Pew did a study 85 of the

1901
01:02:08,579 --> 01:02:12,480
populace of this country are okay or

1902
01:02:10,858 --> 01:02:15,000
pro-cannabis at some either medical

1903
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:17,639
right adult use or both so the fact that

1904
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,139
the the old blue hairs on the hill you

1905
01:02:17,639 --> 01:02:20,519
know are still trying to play the

1906
01:02:19,139 --> 01:02:22,078
splitical angle and it's another article

1907
01:02:20,519 --> 01:02:23,699
I wrote like a lot of people like oh but

1908
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:25,440
the big three and for those that don't

1909
01:02:23,699 --> 01:02:28,019
know we're not talking Ford Chrysler

1910
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:30,119
Chevy we're talking about pharmaceutical

1911
01:02:28,019 --> 01:02:32,219
alcohol and tobacco so I wrote Our call

1912
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:33,539
I'll make you guys that all those dudes

1913
01:02:32,219 --> 01:02:36,000
have been in this industry for years

1914
01:02:33,539 --> 01:02:38,159
yeah Farm has been in its I mean the

1915
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,780
this is where the government contradicts

1916
01:02:38,159 --> 01:02:41,159
itself right so it's a schedule one

1917
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:42,780
which didn't even make sense to me when

1918
01:02:41,159 --> 01:02:44,279
I study it in school I'm like you

1919
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:45,480
remember Sesame Street where kids both

1920
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:47,460
grew up on it you know three of these

1921
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:48,780
kids are doing their own doing the same

1922
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:50,639
thing one of these kids are doing their

1923
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:52,380
own when I saw all the schedule one

1924
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:54,358
drugs and then saw weed there as like

1925
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:55,380
there's got to be some sort of story and

1926
01:02:54,358 --> 01:02:57,239
that's when I started learning more

1927
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:59,880
about the the historical prohibition and

1928
01:02:57,239 --> 01:03:02,039
weaponizing it towards minorities but

1929
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:05,220
man it is crazy because this whole

1930
01:03:02,039 --> 01:03:07,739
Federal thing it's it's overwhelming as

1931
01:03:05,219 --> 01:03:10,098
far as how much support but those big

1932
01:03:07,739 --> 01:03:13,500
guys are already here I mean that one so

1933
01:03:10,099 --> 01:03:15,599
GW Pharmaceuticals which got acquired by

1934
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:16,679
Jazz for so GW Pharmaceuticals one of

1935
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:19,559
the biggest Pharmaceuticals in the world

1936
01:03:16,679 --> 01:03:20,699
based out of the UK during covid and I'm

1937
01:03:19,559 --> 01:03:22,980
not conspiracy theorists just

1938
01:03:20,699 --> 01:03:24,179
essentially in the Jazz acquired GW

1939
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:26,460
Pharmaceutical which was the biggest

1940
01:03:24,179 --> 01:03:29,578
Pharma out of Ireland now they're

1941
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:32,338
actually pushing their organic you know

1942
01:03:29,579 --> 01:03:34,200
plant-based cannabinoid Pharmaceuticals

1943
01:03:32,338 --> 01:03:36,539
in Asia but they're the ones who

1944
01:03:34,199 --> 01:03:38,699
technically have the only one registered

1945
01:03:36,539 --> 01:03:41,279
here in the states so out of five that

1946
01:03:38,699 --> 01:03:43,019
use synthetic cannabinoids they have the

1947
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:45,359
FDA approval and a drug that uses

1948
01:03:43,019 --> 01:03:48,179
organic or plant-based pharmaceutical

1949
01:03:45,358 --> 01:03:50,759
right so where things are going to go

1950
01:03:48,179 --> 01:03:52,919
farm is already here alcohol has already

1951
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:55,020
been invested for years tobaccos are

1952
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:56,338
even invested I mean big time invested

1953
01:03:55,019 --> 01:03:58,079
for years both domestic and in Europe

1954
01:03:56,338 --> 01:04:00,599
don't forget I mean that's this isn't

1955
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:02,160
just a domestic thing right I do think

1956
01:04:00,599 --> 01:04:03,660
that Federal will come around I hope it

1957
01:04:02,159 --> 01:04:05,399
is sooner than later because just like

1958
01:04:03,659 --> 01:04:07,199
our education system we're falling

1959
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:09,119
behind yeah like we're really falling

1960
01:04:07,199 --> 01:04:11,578
behind Luxembourg just legalized I don't

1961
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:13,920
know if you saw this morning Luxembourg

1962
01:04:11,579 --> 01:04:15,539
Luxembourg legalized Malta people might

1963
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:17,400
not hold relevance a few hundred

1964
01:04:15,539 --> 01:04:19,739
thousand populists island off the coast

1965
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:20,880
of Italy but Malta legalize and and

1966
01:04:19,739 --> 01:04:22,439
they're starting out private before

1967
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:24,000
current commercial which I have a level

1968
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:26,940
of respect for like people are critical

1969
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,440
of DC but I I give DC credit for that

1970
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:29,818
like it should be hey I grow great weed

1971
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:31,679
and you're a medical patient let me help

1972
01:04:29,818 --> 01:04:34,380
you versus bringing in the suit so it's

1973
01:04:31,679 --> 01:04:36,838
Roots over suits and so Malta took that

1974
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:39,298
approach to your point Luxembourg now

1975
01:04:36,838 --> 01:04:40,798
he's really really rooting for check

1976
01:04:39,298 --> 01:04:43,619
yeah because they decriminalize the drug

1977
01:04:40,798 --> 01:04:45,239
back in the 70s but they are actually

1978
01:04:43,619 --> 01:04:47,099
waiting for Germany now which is

1979
01:04:45,239 --> 01:04:49,019
frustrating because the Czech Republic

1980
01:04:47,099 --> 01:04:50,338
is kind of waiting for Germany what

1981
01:04:49,019 --> 01:04:52,318
happens yeah because Germany is really

1982
01:04:50,338 --> 01:04:54,420
going to set the pace for everybody else

1983
01:04:52,318 --> 01:04:57,599
they are and ever since brexit you know

1984
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:59,579
Germany highest GDP highest population

1985
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:02,640
not huge 80 million they're not I mean

1986
01:04:59,579 --> 01:05:05,700
we're 43 45 whatever here in in this

1987
01:05:02,639 --> 01:05:07,500
state alone but ever since post-brexit

1988
01:05:05,699 --> 01:05:08,578
Germany really has in Germany did take

1989
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:10,380
the torch they had a great prime

1990
01:05:08,579 --> 01:05:12,240
minister during covet and she really did

1991
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:14,099
say hey like EU we can get through this

1992
01:05:12,239 --> 01:05:16,078
so I respect that Germany is like that

1993
01:05:14,099 --> 01:05:17,640
but Germany also overthinks things

1994
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:20,119
they over regulate things in the over

1995
01:05:17,639 --> 01:05:22,798
engineer things right so that's a

1996
01:05:20,119 --> 01:05:24,059
concerns and cars with dogs and cars

1997
01:05:22,798 --> 01:05:25,920
that's great yeah we're overthinking

1998
01:05:24,059 --> 01:05:27,660
over engineering exactly you look at the

1999
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:29,818
German automobiles you know they're

2000
01:05:27,659 --> 01:05:32,039
fantastic yep not saying anything I I

2001
01:05:29,818 --> 01:05:34,338
have a Chevy too so but they over

2002
01:05:32,039 --> 01:05:38,338
Engineers yeah I have German and Chevy

2003
01:05:34,338 --> 01:05:41,039
yeah I'm all you know so but uh

2004
01:05:38,338 --> 01:05:42,420
I definitely

2005
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:44,099
think that Germany is setting the pace

2006
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:45,539
and once Germany goes legal it's going

2007
01:05:44,099 --> 01:05:47,880
to be a lot easier for the other

2008
01:05:45,539 --> 01:05:50,639
countries to follow suit in Europe yes

2009
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:52,680
so yeah it'll definitely happen and

2010
01:05:50,639 --> 01:05:54,539
everyone's poaching itching at the bit

2011
01:05:52,679 --> 01:05:56,460
as over in England I think I saw more

2012
01:05:54,539 --> 01:05:58,318
South Africans at one show than I ever

2013
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:59,940
have because a lot of the South Africans

2014
01:05:58,318 --> 01:06:01,259
were actually you know they want to be

2015
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:02,700
the ones who because it's a great

2016
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:04,980
growing climate I mean so it's Portugal

2017
01:06:02,699 --> 01:06:06,779
so Spain totally but you you look at the

2018
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:08,760
latitude

2019
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:10,140
and in the South Africans have a lot of

2020
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:12,780
potential and they're itching it the bit

2021
01:06:10,139 --> 01:06:14,699
to feed the European market and so is

2022
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:16,619
Colombia and so Israel and so is Canada

2023
01:06:14,699 --> 01:06:19,439
and so yeah places like Germany I think

2024
01:06:16,619 --> 01:06:21,180
they have a cap of uh 20 000 pounds a

2025
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:22,679
year which is nothing right look there's

2026
01:06:21,179 --> 01:06:24,598
companies in California that produce

2027
01:06:22,679 --> 01:06:26,279
that per month yeah or something like

2028
01:06:24,599 --> 01:06:27,599
that it's insane it's insane when you

2029
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:29,220
look at it in in the amount of

2030
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:32,460
consumption you know everyone can have

2031
01:06:29,219 --> 01:06:34,139
their opinion on percentage but um I I

2032
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:35,818
venture to say a fifth of the populace

2033
01:06:34,139 --> 01:06:38,338
of most countries including over in

2034
01:06:35,818 --> 01:06:40,259
Europe are consumers yeah so the demand

2035
01:06:38,338 --> 01:06:41,699
is there and how they're demanding and

2036
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:43,500
demand grows too so it grows

2037
01:06:41,699 --> 01:06:46,199
exponentially you know with legalization

2038
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:47,760
there's people uh you know Colorado it

2039
01:06:46,199 --> 01:06:49,338
was big they were big into Edibles too

2040
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:51,780
oh my gosh

2041
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:54,480
they really kind of dude they're really

2042
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:55,980
insane scene the edible scenes you go

2043
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:57,960
into shops and they got every type of

2044
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:59,818
edible you could possibly imagine stuff

2045
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:01,940
that I never even thought of they'd have

2046
01:06:59,818 --> 01:07:05,038
there and be like whoa yeah

2047
01:07:01,940 --> 01:07:06,599
totally some of it yeah that's that's

2048
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:08,460
another topic you're right I mean is

2049
01:07:06,599 --> 01:07:11,338
that for that you as Incredibles and

2050
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:12,720
wanna and yeah and I mean even like one

2051
01:07:11,338 --> 01:07:14,400
of my favorites was sweet grass kitchen

2052
01:07:12,719 --> 01:07:16,618
because everyone was doing short path

2053
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:18,000
you know they're doing CO2 or BHO and

2054
01:07:16,619 --> 01:07:19,980
Julie went against the grain and she

2055
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,960
went cannabutter she did old school you

2056
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:23,280
know so she wasn't doing the oils she

2057
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:25,260
was doing the can of butter she ran

2058
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:27,059
sueno she actually ran sueno and I was

2059
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:28,859
so impressed because I'm like it's not

2060
01:07:27,059 --> 01:07:30,780
the easiest it's not the quickest but

2061
01:07:28,858 --> 01:07:31,980
man when it comes to if you want to

2062
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:35,099
clean your house or if you want to lay

2063
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:36,719
on the couch when Edibles would go

2064
01:07:35,099 --> 01:07:39,318
through different cultivars that lean

2065
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:43,259
heavy towards you know the Indica

2066
01:07:39,318 --> 01:07:45,659
cerebral yeah get you very now and then

2067
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:47,700
you can go on that equatorial kind of

2068
01:07:45,659 --> 01:07:49,739
where it like wakes you I tropical

2069
01:07:47,699 --> 01:07:52,500
equatorial varieties that lean that way

2070
01:07:49,739 --> 01:07:54,959
with Edibles especially if you do like a

2071
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:56,818
full spectrum edible those things can

2072
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:58,139
either kick your ass or do do whatever

2073
01:07:56,818 --> 01:08:00,119
they have all kinds of different effects

2074
01:07:58,139 --> 01:08:01,858
most people think edible edible yeah

2075
01:08:00,119 --> 01:08:03,119
yeah but really that you know but then

2076
01:08:01,858 --> 01:08:04,500
you have to do something like can of

2077
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:06,298
butter or you know you start using

2078
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:08,338
distillate you're not going to get those

2079
01:08:06,298 --> 01:08:11,280
experience no it's different that's and

2080
01:08:08,338 --> 01:08:14,159
that's it's again uh it's just like the

2081
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:16,140
the race to legalization right sometimes

2082
01:08:14,159 --> 01:08:17,639
in most of the time the fastest isn't

2083
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:19,020
always the easiest and so that's why

2084
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:20,640
it's a pain in the butt for me to make

2085
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:22,739
cannabutter versus one I've been lazy

2086
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:23,940
I've done olive oil base but I love the

2087
01:08:22,738 --> 01:08:25,619
cannabutter because I know I'm gonna

2088
01:08:23,939 --> 01:08:27,298
capture as many of those terpenes not

2089
01:08:25,619 --> 01:08:30,000
just cannabinoids that I can right but

2090
01:08:27,298 --> 01:08:32,939
in in lipitate you know we love more so

2091
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,439
when it comes to the two uptake is so

2092
01:08:32,939 --> 01:08:36,059
much better with butter and fatty than

2093
01:08:34,439 --> 01:08:39,059
it is with oil right because it's oil

2094
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:40,560
and water versus fat right so you start

2095
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:42,239
geeking out and going down these paths

2096
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:45,839
and so fun and that's why it's a

2097
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:48,479
constant education right water soluble

2098
01:08:45,838 --> 01:08:51,059
THC now where you can yeah remember

2099
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:53,159
nanotechnology was a total buzzword but

2100
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:55,500
they to your point 45 minutes to an hour

2101
01:08:53,159 --> 01:08:57,599
no more I have stuff that I consume it's

2102
01:08:55,500 --> 01:09:00,238
a 15 minute onset yeah and it goes away

2103
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:02,100
pretty fast too yeah it does without the

2104
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:04,198
headache because they're actually you

2105
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:05,819
know producing it correctly so yeah yeah

2106
01:09:04,198 --> 01:09:07,858
that's a whole airspace love the Edibles

2107
01:09:05,819 --> 01:09:09,420
well yeah so let's do another podcast

2108
01:09:07,859 --> 01:09:11,279
one of these days and we'll talk about

2109
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:12,600
the the bags and maybe do something for

2110
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:14,339
the contest I think that'll be a lot of

2111
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:17,100
fun maybe send all the people that put

2112
01:09:14,338 --> 01:09:19,380
in entries bags so they can return there

2113
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:20,699
I would absolutely I'd love to do them

2114
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:22,440
and like I said I'd love what you guys

2115
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:24,358
are doing totally support it you know

2116
01:09:22,439 --> 01:09:26,099
these are definitely just I think one of

2117
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:27,660
many opportunities but these are great

2118
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:30,000
these are really really nice by the way

2119
01:09:27,659 --> 01:09:32,519
thanks man I love the skin too this is

2120
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:34,380
it's got the Apple box skin you know did

2121
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:36,420
the soft touch got the little Easter

2122
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:37,980
eggs and the gusset too so that and this

2123
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:40,679
is actually really quick we kind of went

2124
01:09:37,979 --> 01:09:43,139
with this sublimation down there but

2125
01:09:40,679 --> 01:09:44,399
um this is a seven gram so obviously if

2126
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:46,199
you're pushing indoor you can probably

2127
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:48,479
squeeze 10 you know if you're outdoor

2128
01:09:46,198 --> 01:09:49,979
and larfy you know five to seven yeah

2129
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:51,718
but this has the turbo lock technology

2130
01:09:49,979 --> 01:09:53,639
we're gonna do a seed release with these

2131
01:09:51,719 --> 01:09:54,719
we'll do a special seed release you know

2132
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:56,340
I think we're doing some distribution

2133
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:57,719
stuff so it'd be kind of fun working

2134
01:09:56,340 --> 01:10:00,480
with some of these Distributors and

2135
01:09:57,719 --> 01:10:02,579
using this for seeds I think 100 I think

2136
01:10:00,479 --> 01:10:04,859
it'd be really cool and again upcycle it

2137
01:10:02,579 --> 01:10:07,500
man take out the seeds and use it this

2138
01:10:04,859 --> 01:10:08,939
is your stash bag so are you is so like

2139
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:11,159
if I have one for Skittles I'll put

2140
01:10:08,939 --> 01:10:12,839
Skittles in there if I have one for GMO

2141
01:10:11,159 --> 01:10:14,779
I'll put GMO in there the next time so I

2142
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:17,100
kind of try to keep it consistent

2143
01:10:14,779 --> 01:10:18,840
I really like storing everything in them

2144
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:20,280
you know the infinity Dr is like these

2145
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:21,300
they're all right too yeah you know

2146
01:10:20,279 --> 01:10:25,019
there's nothing wrong with the infinity

2147
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:27,119
jars but I I definitely prefer as far as

2148
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:28,800
for long-term storage the trip lock so

2149
