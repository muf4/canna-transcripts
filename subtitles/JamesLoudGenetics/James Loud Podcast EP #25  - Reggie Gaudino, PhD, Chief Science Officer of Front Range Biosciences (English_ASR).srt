welcome man I'm glad you're able to join

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,719
us where are you joining us from uh I

9
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:26,320
live in San Diego so I'm and it's not

10
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:29,598
Sunny so it's been really

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:33,280
cloudy wow the first time I met you was

12
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:35,480
probably around 2012 or 2013 at Steep

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,320
Hill when you're over there in uh

14
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:41,000
emmeryville we we started out in open

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,759
though actually right by the airport so

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,359
well and then it was Halen originally

17
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:47,679
before steep hill and right well there

18
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:50,960
was steep hill and then there was Halen

19
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:54,840
Right so Halen was run by Don land and

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:58,039
camona Cesar uh they came from UC Davis

21
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,719
and and um David lampack had started

22
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:04,079
along with Addison Deora right and and

23
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,359
Steve D'Angelo right um they had started

24
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,000
uh Steve pill so and then right they

25
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:11,599
were they were like the the two big

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,040
competing factions and they combined and

27
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:16,879
that was the history was made so yeah

28
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,360
interesting times it was that was the

29
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:23,359
very infancy of uh genetics and test as

30
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:26,118
far as testing genetics and coas and all

31
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:29,920
that stuff kind of came out of that that

32
00:01:26,118 --> 00:01:32,879
era exactly right and the first sex test

33
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,118
on the market was from Depo um at one

34
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:38,399
point there was a I think it made it a

35
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:40,680
weekend we had a billboard up up on the

36
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:44,359
101 and made it a weekend before they

37
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:47,520
made us tear it down um but you know um

38
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:49,959
sex you know sex your genetics right so

39
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,840
um and then uh we followed that up a

40
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:54,158
year later with the the first CBD test

41
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,719
right so but but all of that was built

42
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,759
on the fact that we had built that

43
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:01,919
chemical database well not not the sex

44
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:04,159
so much as the the sex was we had some

45
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,359
some buddies who who are willing to give

46
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,960
up some males they didn't want so we

47
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:09,639
sequenced those when everybody else was

48
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:11,400
sequencing females right because

49
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:14,079
everybody wanted you know the THC genes

50
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,800
whatever and and we were like well okay

51
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,680
but but about like things like sex

52
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,080
determination doesn't anybody care about

53
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,840
that yeah so now it's an interesting

54
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,560
thing I think once the price gets a

55
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,598
little lower I think it's gonna you know

56
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,120
it's it's already pretty accessible for

57
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:28,598
most people but you know once it gets

58
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,439
even lower everybody's going to use it

59
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:34,878
it just makes sense

60
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:37,560
you know um talking about that right so

61
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:39,878
you know and I think the coid you know

62
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:43,800
pandemic helped right a lot of you know

63
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:45,799
a lot of stuff that was not mass

64
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,800
produced in such quantities because it

65
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,159
wasn't didn't have you know like a

66
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,599
day-to-day use in in everyday life right

67
00:02:51,158 --> 00:02:56,039
you know that whole idea of genetic

68
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:57,439
testing and you know the the RNA testing

69
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:59,158
they use for the co is pretty much a lot

70
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:01,919
of the same kind of work that we do you

71
00:02:59,158 --> 00:03:05,560
know for for like hplvd testing it's

72
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:07,958
it's an RNA virus as well right so so um

73
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,598
you know so now these things are being

74
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:12,799
cranked out and the prices have gone

75
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:15,719
down right so so the the cost of goods

76
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:18,080
that it used to do you know used to to

77
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:20,959
cost us to run those tests has gone down

78
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:24,560
because people are now you know DNA

79
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,840
primers you know for PCR or Diamond

80
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,920
dozen now right so some of that the

81
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,080
prices have really come down yeah um you

82
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:32,759
still you you you still need the people

83
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,239
who know how to interpret the results

84
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:36,399
though right so that's the right

85
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,920
absolutely before Co people didn't even

86
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,000
know what PCR was I mean the average

87
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:42,839
person now everybody knows the the what

88
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,799
PCR stands for exactly right so and and

89
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,239
that's sign of times and it's also a

90
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,760
sign of why the prices are coming down

91
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:53,280
and you know so back in the day um when

92
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:56,280
we first started we we we were at you

93
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,360
know with our with our cost of goods we

94
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,640
had to charge like 15 to 20 bucks for

95
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,920
for the the sex test right people are

96
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:06,158
offering it for seven eight bucks now so

97
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:08,958
so tell me how you got started in the

98
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:12,359
industry it was a mistake really or at

99
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,479
the time my day job was um was the uh

100
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:18,280
senior patent adviser or the senior

101
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:20,238
patent agent for um a biotech company

102
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:22,279
called squin so squin was the company

103
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,959
that had invented prenatal diagnostic

104
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:26,918
testing so they could do a complete

105
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:30,879
fetal carot type from the blood draw of

106
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:33,120
a mother so as a side gig I I did um IP

107
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:36,240
evaluation for other companies and David

108
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,560
lampac happened to be friends with my

109
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,560
cousin um back when they went to high

110
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,560
school in New York and suffer New York I

111
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,439
was like one town over in Muny New York

112
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,879
but I never knew I never knew David

113
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:49,560
right so um so David was talking to my

114
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:51,879
cousin said wow I wish I I had an IP guy

115
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,918
I could trust and my cousin said well my

116
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:55,959
cousin's an IP guy why to talk to my

117
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:58,918
cousin right so that's how I met David

118
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:59,959
lampac and then um that was back in the

119
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:02,279
time I don't know if you guys remember

120
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:05,638
quanan right so quanan was the first

121
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:08,159
near IR like you know instant

122
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,918
non-destructive accurate measure of you

123
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,840
know everybody's doing it these days but

124
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:17,399
but Steve had the first

125
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:20,239
near potency detector or or evaluator so

126
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:24,038
right um so I came in I did the

127
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:26,478
evaluation for their IP and

128
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:28,079
um unfortunately because they were

129
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:30,318
already selling quanan they could no

130
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:33,719
longer patent it right so

131
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:35,639
um and and what I found was is they had

132
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,000
this Treasure Trove of data they had

133
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:40,519
been collecting for already the years

134
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,800
they had been operating you know all of

135
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:45,758
this database of chemotypic information

136
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,759
from different varieties well once you

137
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:51,280
have a database right that's immediately

138
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:53,879
how you start building markers right you

139
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:55,559
look for the differences in the

140
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:56,918
populations right because that's a

141
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,879
segregating that that gives you

142
00:05:56,918 --> 00:06:02,839
segregation of of genes right so so um

143
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:04,240
so I said to them well you can't patent

144
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:05,439
this but have you guys thought about

145
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,960
doing anything with the data you're

146
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:09,120
accumulating because you guys have a

147
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:11,000
huge amount of data here that could be

148
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,399
used for all sorts of stuff and and they

149
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,918
were like well like for what I said like

150
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:16,519
for building breeding markers they were

151
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:18,639
like oh and so they were like well what

152
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:21,839
if we were hire you to do that for us

153
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:25,439
and so um that's how kind of it started

154
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:28,318
so um my background is in you know

155
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:30,000
molecular genetics and biochemistry um I

156
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,639
did a you know that

157
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,959
Jean jock the home line yard so you know

158
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:39,400
I I was at the very Forefront of

159
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:41,038
qpcr so when I started qpcr it was a

160
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,638
stopwatch and three different water

161
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:44,360
water baths at different temperatures

162
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,199
right you just lift your thing in you

163
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:51,800
know instead of having the thing cycle

164
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:54,000
you cycled it so wow um so you know a

165
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,400
lot of the stuff that we do in terms of

166
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,519
our Market design like that is stuff

167
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:01,478
that you know um we have a very strong

168
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,839
foundation for because of either my

169
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:06,399
background or the data that we had

170
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:08,399
already accumulated and and so you know

171
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:11,038
um that's kind of how it started it was

172
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:13,560
kind of an accident right I went for one

173
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:15,959
thing and then when they realized that I

174
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,519
actually had a vision for what they had

175
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:19,758
already accumulated they were like well

176
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:22,639
here let's just hire you to do it and

177
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:25,598
nice so what what kind of markers back

178
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:28,519
then were you guys able to uh identify

179
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:29,918
so the we had the first CBD test in the

180
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:31,719
market so

181
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:34,758
um you know and and not only that but

182
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:37,160
RCB test was the first and for a while

183
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:41,080
was the only one that actually

184
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:42,919
pinpointed the ultra high kind of ratio

185
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:46,478
at the time it was greater than 20 to1

186
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:48,560
like the ACDC class right right so so

187
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:51,959
our marker was actually specific for

188
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:54,959
that class right so it was significant

189
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:57,959
because you know it allowed you to start

190
00:07:54,959 --> 00:08:00,279
going down that farm bill hemp path

191
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:03,680
right so right um

192
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:09,959
we started uh looking for like varen

193
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:12,840
markers um it was a long uh row to hoe

194
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:16,000
um and ultimately phos did a better job

195
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:17,679
than us but we we F faced all sorts of

196
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,079
turmoil you know at steep hill and

197
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,959
that's how we ended up at Front Range

198
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:24,478
and a whole bunch of stagnation kind of

199
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:26,000
thing so um but ironically we found the

200
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:29,000
bkr

201
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,959
marker either around the same time or a

202
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,839
little before anybody else we just

203
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:35,958
couldn't finish validating it because

204
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:38,000
literally we we were in a spot where we

205
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:40,158
were doing very little work because of

206
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,479
very little money and because we were

207
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:44,879
also at the time kind of transitioning

208
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,360
between hemp and going back to the THC

209
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:48,159
markets and now you know the company

210
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,240
that I worked for while it was a big

211
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:52,559
hemp company is no longer hemp focused

212
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,680
right so there's there's always always

213
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:56,958
that well now you got to stop and then

214
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:59,439
pivot right so um there was a lot of

215
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:01,799
that throughout our our history so how

216
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,560
did the transition work from Steep Hill

217
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:06,000
to Front Range I guess you guys were

218
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:10,559
acquired by Front Range at at some point

219
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:14,679
yeah yeah so in

220
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:17,359
2019 right so this is and and this kind

221
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:19,639
of this was forced by you know the a

222
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:23,680
change in the industry right when when

223
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:27,919
when the BCC well the then BCC now DCC

224
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:29,879
rules came out and you know um you know

225
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:34,360
the nature of the game changed right it

226
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:37,159
was very hard for a a Testing Lab making

227
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,720
slim margins to support a full-on R&amp;D

228
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:41,679
program like we were right and at that

229
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,839
time I probably had probably eight or

230
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:49,519
nine people in in just my R&amp;D program

231
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:52,040
right so um so uh Front Range had made

232
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:55,200
an an inquiry because they were looking

233
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:58,120
for that kind of being able to build

234
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,680
markers and and and you know having a

235
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,440
science team to to to drive a

236
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:06,679
science-driven seed development company

237
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:08,560
right so so they uh talked to to steep

238
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:10,599
hill and and there was a deal made for

239
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:13,679
you know some money and some stock and

240
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:17,720
you know they got the IP uh along with

241
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:19,958
us right um we got the Front Range and

242
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,360
it was you know like we hit the ground

243
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:23,399
running right because you know we

244
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,039
already had CBD marker we already had a

245
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:26,799
bunch of stuff we had already had

246
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:29,120
turpine markers and some of and some

247
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:31,278
other pathway markers that were already

248
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,278
you know in development and or either in

249
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:36,559
development or already validated right

250
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:39,559
and so um you know they

251
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:41,838
were um at the time Front Range was you

252
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:44,638
know going down the same road everybody

253
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:48,519
else was which was more CBD is more

254
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:51,839
better right so we want that that higher

255
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:56,759
CBD to THC ratio and everything else be

256
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:58,800
down well um so you know we were able to

257
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:00,519
get in start screening their entire J

258
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:02,359
plas population and then within the six

259
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:05,200
first six months of being there we had

260
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,120
screened everything and already um had

261
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,399
our

262
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:12,039
first cross we got there it was just so

263
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:15,720
happened they were in the process of of

264
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:17,480
getting to do seed um you know seed

265
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,600
increases so they could to sell for the

266
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,480
following year right so so we walked in

267
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,759
and they already had plants ready pollen

268
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,519
plants and and well we did was apply the

269
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:30,039
the screening that we had done with with

270
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:32,519
our markers and then

271
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:34,679
better designed the crosses that they

272
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:37,519
were going to do to be able to hit the

273
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:39,759
mark they wanted to do and and and

274
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,919
within the first seed stock that came

275
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:44,639
out we already had hemp that was

276
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:47,199
performing way better um in terms of a

277
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:49,159
number of parameters right so um and

278
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,480
then and then that year we took all of

279
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:54,000
that stuff and we did the largest field

280
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,879
trial of him probably to this day right

281
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,559
I don't think anybody's done it larger

282
00:11:55,879 --> 00:12:03,278
um we had 27 27 location around the

283
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:05,239
United States um including five

284
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:07,399
University Partners Cornell was one of

285
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,320
them and a few others and then we also

286
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:11,958
went outside the United the the United

287
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:15,839
States we had five locations in in

288
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:20,838
Canada we had Jamaica we had Hawaii we

289
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:23,839
had Colombia in South America so so we

290
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:26,839
we we literally went hhog right and I

291
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:30,600
had aerial flyovers he collects multipal

292
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:32,839
data we did you know Fant testing we did

293
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,240
you know we had field agronomist go out

294
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:37,240
to all the sites and collect data so

295
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,600
like literally we went Whole Hog because

296
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:42,000
if you're gonna were you guys using

297
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:43,839
drone technology for uh yeah we had FL

298
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,600
drones in two locations in one of our

299
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,880
locations in Virginia and one of ourc in

300
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,399
Colorado we used higher perspect Imaging

301
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:51,838
to to look at Fields yeah pretty amazing

302
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,240
the Drone stuff is just kind of

303
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:58,240
mind-blowing for me still so so so you

304
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:02,720
know we put together you know I mean um

305
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:05,120
you know we we designed a big a type of

306
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,560
model right so so to go out there and

307
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,278
and and the only way you're going to you

308
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:11,000
know you

309
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:13,679
talk how often have you heard well yeah

310
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,078
I got shitty hemp seed from I I I called

311
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:17,958
this guy up and you know and he he told

312
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:20,078
me how great his stuff was in his State

313
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:22,559
and but I'm in a different state and

314
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:24,719
right so and it's the truth right so you

315
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,919
know a lot of people can make decent

316
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,759
hemp seed for their one state their one

317
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:31,799
microclimate right but in order to have

318
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:34,000
seed that is successful in multiple

319
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:36,519
locations right you have to do the work

320
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,879
you have to put it there and grow it and

321
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:41,078
observe it right and and you have to

322
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:42,439
take good notes right because the other

323
00:13:41,078 --> 00:13:47,000
thing that you need to do is to figure

324
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:49,560
out because of the huge amount of of

325
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,278
hybridization and and just mishmash that

326
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:55,000
you know some cannabis represents right

327
00:13:52,278 --> 00:13:57,679
there there is you know photo period

328
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,839
sensitivity right like so some stuff

329
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:03,000
when you put it in a short day is not

330
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,600
going to do as good as some other stuff

331
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,559
and vice versa for for short night right

332
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:11,839
so um you know so we learned a lot you

333
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:14,278
know it was a huge undertaking costed a

334
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:17,000
lot of money and I was immediately

335
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:19,838
immediately taken to test by the company

336
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,159
for spending so much I

337
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:26,680
bet right but at the but the next year

338
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:29,439
right when we sold our hemp seed right

339
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:32,599
nobody complained we had have any any

340
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:35,279
complaints so and it's unfortunately at

341
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:38,680
that point that was kind of

342
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:41,078
2021 when they have industry went right

343
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:43,679
so yeah and it's so competitive you have

344
00:14:41,078 --> 00:14:44,958
to have really better seeds I mean

345
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:46,758
marketing just doesn't work anymore

346
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,198
either it's you know it's like there's

347
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:49,720
there's a handful of people producing

348
00:14:48,198 --> 00:14:53,639
really good seeds and there's a billion

349
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:55,278
seeds out there so yeah and and for a

350
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:57,560
while people were just giving the [ __ ]

351
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:59,278
away 10 cents a seed five cents a seed a

352
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:02,559
penny a seed right

353
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:05,958
well when I spent the year before you

354
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:08,319
know couple hundred grand running field

355
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:09,799
trials right that's not gonna fly I

356
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,278
can't you know there's no way to do that

357
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:13,159
so no but at the same time you can

358
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:15,480
justify why your seeds are more

359
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:18,078
expensive sure I feel like that makes a

360
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,879
big difference and moving forward that's

361
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:21,359
what people are gonna have to do yeah

362
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:22,958
that only that only matters to some

363
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,320
right because some people are oh free

364
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:26,879
seed yeah I'll take that right so yeah

365
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,440
yeah and that's good for like the first

366
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:30,799
year and then you really you know that

367
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,480
that's what happened too A lot of people

368
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:33,519
bought cheap seeds and then they

369
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,000
realized why they don't want to buy

370
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,879
cheap seeds yeah you know or they failed

371
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,799
there's a lot of failure over the last

372
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:43,318
couple years a lot of businesses going

373
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:45,519
under and uh you know and it's it's wild

374
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:47,599
Oregon in California and Colorado you

375
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:50,278
know the the production the amount of

376
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,159
production is wild it's very targeted

377
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:56,600
right so if if you look at the USDA um

378
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:58,958
numbers right so we we're still going

379
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,519
down right so they predicted that the

380
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:03,399
hemp industry would rebound by 2023 and

381
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,799
you'd see an increase well we had

382
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:11,120
another two-fold decrease in the number

383
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:13,120
of hemp Acres from 2022 to 2021 to 2022

384
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,759
right so went from 54,000 acres to

385
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:18,318
28,000 Acres right so it's still going

386
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,240
down that's that's that's the actual

387
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:21,559
number of hemp Acres planted in the

388
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:27,600
United States

389
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:29,559
total right wow so yeah know so I mean

390
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,120
you look around there not a lot lot a

391
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:34,039
lot of those hemp companies don't exist

392
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,560
anymore so yeah I mean even some of the

393
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:37,958
biggest ones that you never thought

394
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:39,719
would fail are gone you know I can I can

395
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:42,719
think of a few and it's

396
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,920
like it's it's just amazing but I think

397
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,920
everyone was thinking it was just going

398
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:50,198
to grow grow grow and that's just not

399
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:53,159
how it works yeah and then genetic lines

400
00:16:50,198 --> 00:16:55,879
become the tragedy here right because

401
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:58,240
right as when people are looking to make

402
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:59,519
the most money spend the least amount

403
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,680
because because they're not sure where

404
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,759
they're going to put their product

405
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:05,639
anyway so on and so forth nobody's

406
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:10,759
buying $5 seed that that even though if

407
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:12,360
it's 5% CBC or makes you know 5% cbdv or

408
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:14,038
whatever these things right which

409
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:16,798
actually ends up being the secret to

410
00:17:14,038 --> 00:17:19,240
making compant hint right is the more

411
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:21,679
minor Canales you have the less THC you

412
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,558
make right so right yeah there's been

413
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,319
some interesting Cult of arts created

414
00:17:23,558 --> 00:17:28,720
over the last five to 10 years you know

415
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:30,279
I think Jen can had a zero THC they were

416
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:34,400
working on or

417
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:37,879
had a couple companies um yeah um there

418
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:41,440
was panaka which was a which was a zero

419
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:44,200
there was a pure CBG which

420
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,600
was that organ CBD

421
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,880
with know both of those companies so one

422
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:50,759
was from hemp trading I think they're in

423
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,799
Spain or somewhere in the Europe and the

424
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:57,798
other one was from from either Sweden or

425
00:17:53,798 --> 00:17:59,798
Switzerland some so uh the Varon you are

426
00:17:57,798 --> 00:18:01,480
you guys still working on that at all I

427
00:17:59,798 --> 00:18:02,960
mean I think that's still a Hot Topic a

428
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,679
little bit but it it was you know it

429
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,720
started about five years ago people were

430
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:11,640
really excited about it the cbdv and

431
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:13,319
thcv and so yeah we have I mean I've

432
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,720
we've made cultivars I got a whole bunch

433
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:19,399
of stuff I'm trying to integrate it back

434
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:21,720
into um you know everyday Bud because I

435
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:24,880
think people got a little carried away

436
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:27,720
so yeah I have an 8 to 10% producer as

437
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,640
well but nobody wanted to buy it right

438
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,360
and and I think what we're seeing is

439
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,720
that nobody has really adopted the Varn

440
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:36,839
in any edible products or anything like

441
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,480
it just hasn't grabbed on right but in

442
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:42,879
the old days right you know yeah geran

443
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:47,038
poison right

444
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:49,799
had super high one to one to two% right

445
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:53,000
THV and everybody loved it right so I

446
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:56,400
think there's a place for a good quality

447
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,798
high THC bud with a couple to 3% thcv

448
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,640
that I think is going to be like a good

449
00:18:57,798 --> 00:19:01,759
daytime buzz you know kind of kicking in

450
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,280
the pants kind of thing right so so we

451
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,679
we've been working on a couple of

452
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:07,399
varieties right now one of them is

453
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:08,880
purple actually so um I had done some

454
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:12,600
work with some red Congo a while back

455
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:14,799
and I had um which is phenomenal variety

456
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:16,639
if you've never tried it red cono I love

457
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:18,440
it yeah my my friends grow it in San

458
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,919
Francisco it's amazing it's super it's

459
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:24,080
super strong yeah so super strong same

460
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:27,240
thing with the Durban um so but but we

461
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:29,158
used a red Congo base with our thcv

462
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:33,798
producer and now we have a few lines

463
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:38,360
that are you know between 1 to 3% thcv

464
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:39,639
putting out you know 20 22% THC and I'm

465
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:41,439
gonna see if I can bring back Durban

466
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,240
Poison dude because you know I would

467
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,600
love it if the real one came back I

468
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,880
think there's a lot of people that the

469
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:48,319
problem is is a lot of people what they

470
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,679
think is Durban Poison is actually a

471
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:51,960
hybrid of Durban Poison that's been

472
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,038
crossed with super silver haze y you

473
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,600
know and so everybody thinks it's this

474
00:19:54,038 --> 00:19:59,240
hazy plant and really it's this

475
00:19:56,599 --> 00:20:01,918
musky you know it's it's powerful and

476
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:04,319
but it's not hazy and it's extremely

477
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:07,400
like licorice you know I we we grew up

478
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:09,158
with Alice yeah so so I actually had a

479
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,759
cut so I read with that last year and I

480
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:14,760
I found a cut that had that an Anna

481
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:17,000
smell that lior smell and so so yeah so

482
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:18,759
I'm I'm stoked I can't wait to you know

483
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,798
to to start you know going through that

484
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:24,000
that seed population but um but yeah no

485
00:20:21,798 --> 00:20:25,240
so I'm right with you man everybody

486
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,159

488
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:32,120
terpinolene that's that's not it's got

489
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:34,678
theine L that's no that's not the real

490
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:36,719
Durban Poison I think it's Greenhouse

491
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:38,280
that actually we we can blame Aran and

492
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,120
those guys over at Greenhouse for that

493
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:42,440
you know with the super silver haze but

494
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:43,839
I think yeah it's it's really

495
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,440
interesting what most people think of

496
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:47,038
Durban Poison you know and same thing

497
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,880
with red Congo I've seen a lot of red

498
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:50,679
Congo that's not the real stuff I mean

499
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,760
Redbeard and there's there's a handful

500
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:55,360
of people in Northern California that

501
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:57,798
actually sell the real red Congo you

502
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:59,319
know and I I got to be careful with how

503
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:01,400
much I smoke of the red Congo cuz it's

504
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:03,038
like one of those uh cultivars that

505
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,840
doesn't really have a ceiling so you can

506
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:06,879
keep getting more high and more high and

507
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:09,918
more high from it the more you smoke

508
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,840
whereas a lot of the modern you know the

509
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,559
the modern varieties that we're smoking

510
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:15,240
has a like Skittles has a ceiling you

511
00:21:13,558 --> 00:21:17,678
smoke Skittles you can only get so high

512
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,359
but some of these you know and some of

513
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,960
these land race varieties some of these

514
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:22,558
African varieties especially they just

515
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,640
have no ceiling and you smoke more you

516
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:27,558
can just you know they're almost

517
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:30,278
psychedelic too so right so ironic that

518
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:32,759
you said that I got my red Congo germ

519
00:21:30,278 --> 00:21:34,278
plasm because I was in the Berkeley area

520
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:37,000
with the guys who were growing the real

521
00:21:34,278 --> 00:21:39,558
red Congo back in the day and and and I

522
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,839
saved every seed I ever got from every

523
00:21:39,558 --> 00:21:44,798
ounce I ever bought from

524
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:48,558
them that's awesome so that's how I

525
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:50,558
started and um and I actually had one of

526
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:53,399
one of the seeds that I popped from that

527
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:56,759
red Congo line like I I uh gave some

528
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:58,360
cuts to a buddy of mine uh who's but

529
00:21:56,759 --> 00:22:01,119
used to be a black market grower back in

530
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:03,158
the day and and he said he was he had

531
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:05,158
people tell him that it was like they

532
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:07,760
were tripping on the weed like they like

533
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:09,559
dude what this this a place dude like I

534
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:14,319
I was getting all sort of like no dude

535
00:22:09,558 --> 00:22:16,240
that's just good weed yeah right yeah

536
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:19,158
but some of that gives people like heart

537
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:21,679
pulpits you know it's like it almost

538
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:23,440
gives you an edible edible type effect

539
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:25,480
it's not for the fan of heart right it's

540
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,038
the real red cono some of those African

541
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,839
varieties are are really not for the fan

542
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:30,400
of heart right because they they they

543
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:32,720
they they will push the blood pressure

544
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:36,159
up they will get the heart going they

545
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,759
will they're they're more edgy right so

546
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,720
so but I like that feeling I like I like

547
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:41,919
to feel like I'm jumping out of my skin

548
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,600
so yeah and for me it's like I like

549
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,640
smoking this stuff sometimes not all the

550
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:48,319
time not when I'm doing podcasts I did

551
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,679
that once where we were like uh laughing

552
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:51,439
too much during the podcast I was with

553
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,159
Marlon Asher he's a r singer good friend

554
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,798
of mine and we uh we laughed pretty much

555
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:59,159
for an hour and we had a good time but I

556
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:02,918
think it it wasn't well Reed ceed

557
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:04,360
so cool but yeah so uh are you you guys

558
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:06,640
are working on some modern style

559
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:08,479
genetics I mean gelato is kind of hot

560
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,880
and all these gelato derivatives is

561
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,278
that's mostly what we see in the Bay

562
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:16,679
Area it's got to be purple candy gas

563
00:23:12,278 --> 00:23:18,798
yeah and so so the whole chasing THC is

564
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:20,559
really in my opinion destroying cannabis

565
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:23,158
right so that that whole thing kind of

566
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:24,519
annoys me and and so I thought that I

567
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:27,400
was going to Buck the trend and make

568
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:28,519
something really awesome uh so we have a

569
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,240
few things that came out of some of my

570
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:32,038
righto crosses one of them is called

571
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,400
Watusi and I swear to God it's the best

572
00:23:32,038 --> 00:23:37,679
weed anybody's ever smoked right so but

573
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,840
really but it won't hit above 22 or 23%

574
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,798
so nobody will buy it right but like all

575
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:43,639
these guys who have who are cultivators

576
00:23:41,798 --> 00:23:46,079
for other companies have dude I love

577
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,480
this I just can't sell it I'm like okay

578
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:49,519
well you're not doing me any good right

579
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,120
so but no but but I I learned the hard

580
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:52,960
way dude you can't Buck the trend the

581
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:56,000
industry is the industry and unless

582
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,159
you're playing the game right so so yeah

583
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,720
so now we're doing the gases and doing

584
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:05,000
some of the candy and I got a bunch of

585
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:06,839
purple [ __ ] and so um but it's you know

586
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,679
it's a little disheartening right that

587
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:13,319
that you can't bring forth something

588
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:15,960
that is a superior product because it

589
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:18,000
doesn't test right you know well and I

590
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:21,759
think Market awareness is part of it but

591
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,679
I also think that uh education like the

592
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:25,919
the we have an uneducated market and so

593
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,919
they're really focused on hype

594
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,640
unfortunately uh but that these things

595
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,440
change I feel like everything goes in

596
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:34,038
waves I think the gas is coming back I I

597
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,960
BR I did some breeding with the

598
00:24:34,038 --> 00:24:38,519
shoreline and with the Fort Collins

599
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:40,159
cough and some blue dream stuff and and

600
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:42,359
you know some older genetics with the

601
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,840
hype stuff we did some selections and

602
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:45,359
found stuff that has the look of what

603
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:47,918
people want but with unique flavor

604
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:49,678
profiles that that's that's exactly it

605
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,320
that's what we he right now so we're

606
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,480
gonna have green flour again people are

607
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:55,439
going to be okay with it you know I you

608
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,919
see it more so in like Washington than

609
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,440
you do in California I feel like that

610
00:24:56,919 --> 00:25:01,759
Market's a little more educated same

611
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:03,080
thing with Colorado to a degree well you

612
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:06,038
know what's interesting is that

613
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:09,359
everybody wants purple right but so

614
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:12,720
purple an anthocyanins are a less

615
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:15,678
efficient form of chlorophyll right so a

616
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:21,159
plant that's heavily purple will always

617
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:25,038
test less lower than a plant that is

618
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:26,600
equivalent pathway and green right so so

619
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:28,278
yeah you got to take into account well

620
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:30,278
you have different versions of the

621
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:32,679
optimized pathway and so you have

622
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:35,319
natural variation in cannaboid content

623
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:37,519
anyway right so but all things being

624
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:38,639
equal if you had the same exact genetics

625
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:39,960
in a purple plant the green plant the

626
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,559
green plant would always test higher

627
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:44,159
because it makes more energy because

628
00:25:41,558 --> 00:25:46,519
it's a better chlorophyll that's it

629
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:49,480
right so we as an industry are confused

630
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:53,359
right we want high THC and we want High

631
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:56,798
turps well can't do that right you can't

632
00:25:53,359 --> 00:26:00,398
have the floral the candy those are gpp

633
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:02,558
based Tarpin gpp makes THC right so you

634
00:26:00,398 --> 00:26:07,199
have a competition there right so this

635
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:08,879
is why the high THC varieties tend to be

636
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:12,038
more CES turpy heavy because that's a

637
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,720
different precursor fpp right that is

638
00:26:12,038 --> 00:26:16,480
not in competition to make

639
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:19,558
THC so it's it's as an industry we're

640
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,640
confused we want things that you can't

641
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:24,918
necessarily have because the plant

642
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:27,278
doesn't work that way the American dream

643
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:28,159
it's like I always want stuff we can't

644
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:30,038
have

645
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,760
yeah and I think with education I think

646
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:34,398
these things will change but also like

647
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:35,720
when we're doing feno hunting and we're

648
00:26:34,398 --> 00:26:37,918
going through the selection process I

649
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:40,000
try to give people joints now because I

650
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,559
want to know what their I know what the

651
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,200
it looks like and I'm great at doing the

652
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:45,839
selections but let's talk about the

653
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,200
taste and the effect right and I think

654
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:49,000
it just kind of puts everybody on the

655
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,440
same page instead of giving people bags

656
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,119
of flour my friends bags of flour or

657
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,480
guys were working with bags of flour to

658
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:56,239
look at and they can try it however they

659
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,038
want if you give them a joint it's

660
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,640
pre-rolled everybody's getting the same

661
00:26:58,038 --> 00:27:01,038
thing yeah no yeah and then they don't

662
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,880
they don't get to look at the color I

663
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:05,000
can I can identify if the color is the

664
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,240
the right color or not or well you know

665
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:11,359
what's interesting though

666
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:13,200
so God I I I wish I wish I could sit you

667
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:16,479
in front of all of the people that were

668
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:19,080
naying me before right so I'm like why

669
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,038
do you guys need to see see a COA right

670
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:23,918
like why can't you

671
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:26,038
guys take it smoke it and then make it a

672
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:28,038
termination without seeing a number did

673
00:27:26,038 --> 00:27:30,798
you like it did

674
00:27:28,038 --> 00:27:31,839
do you right did it did you have the

675
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:34,839
right

676
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:36,678
experience and if if it passes that all

677
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:39,278
those tests what the [ __ ] do we care

678
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:42,159
what percent T was back in the day I

679
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:44,519
when I was 12 and 13 years old you know

680
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,960
even 15 and 16 years old smoking Panama

681
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:49,240
Red akaba Gold because that was the [ __ ]

682
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,519
back in the day right like dude none of

683
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:53,919
that stuff ever tested more than

684
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:56,558
12% maybe

685
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:59,080
14% right well yeah but even even Sour

686
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:01,480
Diesel when I had it tested at Halen in

687
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:03,839
2012 I had the highest testing outdoor

688
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,919
sour d so I still have the COA but it

689
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:08,720
was only like

690
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,919
24% was the top that was like the top

691
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,120
that

692
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:14,880
year so yeah people you know and it was

693
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:16,038
amazing stuff and then Sour Diesel only

694
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,159
tests it

695
00:28:16,038 --> 00:28:21,200
14% the stuff we were growing back in

696
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:24,000
the day right right so so clearly we

697
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,840
didn't need astronomical THC numbers to

698
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,640
get a good experience out of cannabis

699
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:31,480
right we didn't right and and and the

700
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:35,960
nature of cannabis is changed right so

701
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:37,640
you know you had you if you you know

702
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,880
it's been a long time and I'm sure you

703
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:42,399
know some of this is rose-colored memory

704
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:45,799
right so um but you know you open up a

705
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:49,719
bag and and there of good weed and there

706
00:28:45,798 --> 00:28:51,679
was a deep complex fragrance right you

707
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:54,519
don't get that anymore you get like a

708
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:58,038
couple of notes because literally you've

709
00:28:54,519 --> 00:29:00,480
only got a a handful of tping

710
00:28:58,038 --> 00:29:03,319
of which one or two of significant

711
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:06,278
content right like you know what when

712
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:10,200
when when when the majority of weed is

713
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:14,480
only one and a half 1.2 to

714
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:18,080
1.8% tpine content and we consider top

715
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:21,839
shelf two and a half% tpin well dude

716
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:25,759
right 2019 what was it the gree monkey

717
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:27,519
had 5% tpin right I I had I had stuff

718
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:28,879
from Outdoors this year that hit three

719
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:31,440
and a half%

720
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,840
tpes like you know so what what are we

721
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,960
doing to ourselves right but whatever so

722
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:39,000
yeah I don't need to derail the

723
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,798
conversation oh that's okay yeah it's a

724
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,159
it's a real interesting world we live in

725
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:45,000
you know and I think yeah like I was

726
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:48,039
saying about the education and and I

727
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,640
think market demand changes over time

728
00:29:48,038 --> 00:29:51,759
but yeah I remember stuff back the the

729
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:54,080
best stuff we had in the 90s was the

730
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:56,319
ugliest it was the cat piss we had this

731
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:59,119
cat piss and the cat piss looked like it

732
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:00,439
was basically br a in a bag and there

733
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:03,759
there might be some stems in there but

734
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:05,640
it was sticky and it the one little gram

735
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:08,640
of it would smell your whole house up

736
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:10,720
right you don't get that anymore and you

737
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,759
know it was $60 an e back then straight

738
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,679
up there was no discounts on it it it

739
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:15,960
was hard to get it would sell out and

740
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:17,000
you wouldn't be able to get it for a few

741
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,600
months

742
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,919
yep well you know whatting about that is

743
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:22,959
that that brings up another point right

744
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:24,960
so we talk about nose we talk about bag

745
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:28,278
appeal right

746
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:32,919
yeah you know things like cat

747
00:30:28,278 --> 00:30:37,880
baby [ __ ] right like so those are

748
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:41,720
the as far as we go in terms of the

749
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:44,640
almost but not quite borderline

750
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:47,079
unacceptable fragrance in our weed right

751
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,840
totally dude body odor you know all

752
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:50,759
these things they're foul to a lot of

753
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:52,798
people but then if as a connoisseur you

754
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:55,839
like that kind of stuff well there are

755
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:58,638
40,000 [ __ ] tpes dude and some of

756
00:30:55,839 --> 00:31:02,638
them smell really bad some of them smell

757
00:30:58,638 --> 00:31:04,759
like vomit some I mean like right so so

758
00:31:02,638 --> 00:31:07,759
and and and so I'm just left thinking

759
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:10,079
about through all of the you know

760
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:12,599
because we we found you know high THC

761
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:14,879
cannabis Going Back 2 200 years in some

762
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:20,240
ancient Chinese Emperor's tomb right

763
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:22,559
okay great so um so when did the

764
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:25,519
selection against really bad smelling

765
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:27,839
cannabis start that's what I want to

766
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:29,880
know right because

767
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:32,678
there's nothing that smells really bad

768
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,960
in cannabis but there are all sorts of

769
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:37,519
genes for Turpin that you would expect

770
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,840
to find right in potentially in cannabis

771
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:42,159
that you know we have some borderline

772
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:43,959
smells right there's like the cheese

773
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:45,679
which kind of you know depending on what

774
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:48,399
it's combined with smells like dirty

775
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:50,600
feet right which is you know border and

776
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:52,119
we still see these Expressions I me we C

777
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:55,480
them out you know but we're still seeing

778
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:57,199
some funky stuff in there I mean even

779
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,399
these Menthol ones I don't I don't

780
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,558
particular like Menthol you know

781
00:31:59,398 --> 00:32:03,719
expressions in my flower but you know I

782
00:32:01,558 --> 00:32:05,879
think there's an interesting side to

783
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:10,038
that too so that's funny a couple years

784
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:11,559
back I so I I I had a cut of meno breath

785
00:32:10,038 --> 00:32:14,480
that

786
00:32:11,558 --> 00:32:16,918
um oh no no it was called tach Tre turp

787
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,360
was it was a stram from orgon but it was

788
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:22,240
from the it was from the meno breath

789
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:24,918
line right um dude it was straight up

790
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,558
[ __ ] benay like literally like the

791
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:29,080
like you broke open the buds and it was

792
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:30,960
like you were benay right and it was the

793
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:33,240
weirdest smoke because it gave you kind

794
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,120
of like this almost like Menthol flavor

795
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:37,480
in your lungs right it was the weirdest

796
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:40,079
yeah know but but but it it's cool

797
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:42,240
because you know the important thing

798
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:44,638
about tpin right is that is that they

799
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:47,359
they kind of set the body up for the

800
00:32:44,638 --> 00:32:49,599
experience right so right right so so

801
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:50,798
the the tpping profiles are really

802
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:53,000
important much more important than I

803
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:55,119
think people really understand sometimes

804
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,159
right so like certain tpin like certain

805
00:32:55,119 --> 00:33:00,199
tpin are actually having physiological

806
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,559
effect in your biochemistry right like

807
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:06,120
Alpha pining is an a inhibitor right

808
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:08,278
which is which leads to increased Focus

809
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:10,479
increased energy right so so literally

810
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:13,038
there are these there is a biological

811
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:15,960
reason why the turpins do affect you the

812
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:18,679
way they do and if we understood that

813
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:21,519
better right like we'd be so much more

814
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:23,559
in tune with what turpins do we have

815
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:26,038
then how much THC do we have right

816
00:33:23,558 --> 00:33:27,678
because you can have high THC we with

817
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:31,319
very low tur

818
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:33,639
and feel the same as lower THC weed with

819
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:35,678
higher tpes right so

820
00:33:33,638 --> 00:33:37,038
right yeah it's pretty wild and then

821
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,320
jumping into that it's like the

822
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:41,519
conversation with indica and sativa and

823
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:43,000
I feel like stimulant versus sedative is

824
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,759
a much better description these days

825
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,759
because everything's so hybridized yep y

826
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:48,200
y you know at one point it made a

827
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:51,398
difference right at one point you

828
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:54,440
generally found sativas tall and lanky

829
00:33:51,398 --> 00:33:56,959
always had a kind of more uplifting

830
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:58,720
cognitive thing and then the short stop

831
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,639
hocky ones generally where made you

832
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:04,159
couch lock and kind of right you know

833
00:34:01,638 --> 00:34:06,199
Stone right so not the case anymore as

834
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,639
soon as as soon people started putting

835
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,119
the tall and the short ones together and

836
00:34:07,638 --> 00:34:11,118
making babies all went out the window

837
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:13,320
there dude so so yeah we got one that

838
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:16,399
looks like Bubba cush but it smells like

839
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:18,159
uh Jack herrer oh nice so that's that's

840
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:20,118
a turpine dominant then so that's pretty

841
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:23,200
cool totally yeah tpine it's got a lot

842
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:24,559
of loning and terpinolene Beauty so but

843
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,719
but it looks like a it looks like a

844
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:27,000
indicia like if you were to take a

845
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:29,598
picture of it and put it in a book

846
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,679
people would think it was some afghanica

847
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:34,720
Inda yeah variety so so you know what's

848
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:37,679
interesting about this is that you know

849
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:39,759
and there are there are kind of like

850
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:41,200
vestigial organs you know like the ones

851
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,839
you don't use anymore there are actually

852
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:47,279
a few vestigial tpine families right

853
00:34:44,838 --> 00:34:49,398
that uh we found through some of our

854
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:53,000
work which are very interesting that are

855
00:34:49,398 --> 00:34:55,039
are like the sativa Gene right like so

856
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,320
literally it's a

857
00:34:55,039 --> 00:35:01,079
terpinolene gene that has this set of

858
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:04,240
minor Turpin that are made out of the

859
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:06,800
same gene that are all strictly sativa

860
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:10,358
three carine Alpha fandr all these

861
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:12,560
things that are hard sativa kind of

862
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:16,039
Turpin right and like we found this one

863
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:18,199
terpinolene gene that made all of them

864
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:20,320
so it's literally like well yeah so we

865
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:23,879
actually can select for a

866
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:25,480
sativa you know kind of phenotype if we

867
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:28,160
if we have this Gene we know it's going

868
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:30,358
to be that type of phen right so it's

869
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:34,039
it's that level of of understanding that

870
00:35:30,358 --> 00:35:38,119
allows us to do really really

871
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:39,960
hardcore predictive breed for effect

872
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:42,039
kind of cannabis now think about that

873
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:44,920
right so now we're not just pheno

874
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:47,279
hunting right we're setting up crosses

875
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,838
with a purpose because we have we we

876
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,240
have known genes that are doing known

877
00:35:48,838 --> 00:35:52,000
functions and we want to carry that

878
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:54,159
through to be able to achieve an effect

879
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,079
right that's that changes the nature of

880
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:57,440
what we do right if you think about it

881
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:59,318
yeah well I mean you can select for it

882
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,838
or you can not select for it because

883
00:35:59,318 --> 00:36:04,480
you've identified it right exactly so so

884
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:06,239
it allows people to actually start to

885
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:09,880
have more confidence when they pick up

886
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:12,919
that pre-roll that says chill or energy

887
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:15,079
you know with that depth of information

888
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:18,039
the people who can now offer those

889
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:20,440
things that will be 100% spoton And and

890
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:22,599
people the majority of people who you

891
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:25,480
know with the right ECS conditions right

892
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:27,838
so because there are there I I have I

893
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:30,000
have a few friends that can convince me

894
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:32,519
that they are wired backwards like stuff

895
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,800
that makes everybody else jump up and

896
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:36,519
down puts them to sleep stuff that

897
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,640
because everybody else asleep makes them

898
00:36:36,519 --> 00:36:42,119
jump up and down right so I'm not sure

899
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:44,000
how that happens you know what what got

900
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:46,318
what got messed up in those people's you

901
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,838
know endoc can aboid system but but for

902
00:36:46,318 --> 00:36:49,800
the most part right you can you can say

903
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:53,119
85% or better of the population will

904
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,920
respond this way and if you were to

905
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:57,680
question those people you'd be able to

906
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:59,280
get responses that indicated that so and

907
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:02,318
we're close to that right and that's

908
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:04,839
where we start to cross over from just

909
00:37:02,318 --> 00:37:08,679
cannabis as a

910
00:37:04,838 --> 00:37:10,960
potential you know healing agent to a

911
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:14,199
yeah I can treat myself for various

912
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,400
things conditions whatever because I

913
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:17,639
understand how this thing plays in my

914
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,440
biochemistry right you know antios

915
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:22,199
reception pain relief there are certain

916
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,920
chemicals in cannabis that that do that

917
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:27,519
job right we know what they are

918
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:30,119
so it's cool I can't wait to see where

919
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:32,440
we are in five years so yeah I mean

920
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:34,200
we're getting closer Israel is so you

921
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,800
know they're they're further ahead with

922
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:38,199
us in a lot of ways but I think we're

923
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,480
definitely catching up well they're

924
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:42,919
definitely ahead on the medical side

925
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:45,719
right so I think in terms of variety

926
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:47,720
creation and and and just the the newno

927
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:50,118
you know like the new hot [ __ ] I think

928
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:51,279
we still have an edge there absolutely

929
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:52,400
yeah there's nothing that compares to

930
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,000
what we're doing here and there's just

931
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,480
so many people you know breeding and

932
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,119
making I don't know if you could even

933
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,679
call it breeding but they're doing seed

934
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,480
production breeding whatever they're

935
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:04,838
making new genetics all over the place

936
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,440
you know on so many levels from the guy

937
00:38:04,838 --> 00:38:07,838
who's doing it at home and it's not like

938
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:10,480
that over in Israel but as far as like

939
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:12,318
drug discovery on the medical side you

940
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,880
know ddy muy the stuff he's doing over

941
00:38:12,318 --> 00:38:17,079
there it's it's it's pretty impressive

942
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,640
yeah I I've have yet to have a

943
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:21,359
conversation literally where daddy's

944
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:24,000
name has not come

945
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:26,159
up yeah I mean I love the guy right so

946
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,800
he's an awesome guy so um it does great

947
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:35,199
work and but but but literally that he

948
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:38,240
is the epitome of making something like

949
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:39,879
you know applied academic research work

950
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:43,679
dude I met

951
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:44,920
ddy at this first canite right and

952
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:48,879
that's when you know he and I became

953
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:51,559
friends since then right so and took me

954
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:54,599
through his lab dude this is 2013 2014

955
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:56,318
maybe right like he already had cell

956
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:59,318
lines immortalized cell lines then he

957
00:38:56,318 --> 00:39:02,440
was already using you know extracts from

958
00:38:59,318 --> 00:39:03,838
different varieties and dude I mean like

959
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:07,679
it you

960
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:11,559
know it's it's well planned wellth

961
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:13,159
thought out science in a regime where

962
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:15,559
yes let's consider this as a medicine

963
00:39:13,159 --> 00:39:17,598
and see what we can do right that's as

964
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:19,880
opposed to there's just so much red tape

965
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:22,559
less less red tape over in Israel than

966
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:24,000
there is here it's just you know and you

967
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:25,920
know we're still having politicians

968
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,610
argue whether it could be medical or not

969
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,200
which is

970
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:30,680
[Laughter]

971
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:31,719
yeah so let's talk about autoflowers a

972
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:33,440
little bit you've done some work with

973
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:35,639
autoflowers over the years and are you

974
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:39,760
guys working on autoflowers now and tell

975
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:43,400
us a little bit about it so we we we did

976
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:45,400
um um it it was our main focus um it it

977
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:48,559
served two purposes it served for us to

978
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:50,639
be able to um develop a mapping

979
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:53,159
population and so that we could start to

980
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:56,159
map that Autoflower Gene right so our

981
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:58,559
flowering time genes in general right so

982
00:39:56,159 --> 00:40:01,000
we we've had a marker for a couple years

983
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:02,559
right you know and it was actually I

984
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,239
ironically we never published on it

985
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:05,920
because we drug dragged our feet we were

986
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:07,318
out to do more work and now that we got

987
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,559
scooped on it and we're gonna have to do

988
00:40:07,318 --> 00:40:12,079
more work to be able to publish what we

989
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:14,318
had in the first place so uh but but

990
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:16,519
yeah so the the Ft Gene that that people

991
00:40:14,318 --> 00:40:19,119
are talking about now you know we had a

992
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:23,239
marker for it probably about two years

993
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:26,440
ago where doing more more work with that

994
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:28,679
marker to kind of see what what Al

995
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:31,358
variants there are you know and and and

996
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:33,919
to kind you know I think we what where

997
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:35,960
we didn't see far enough was we didn't

998
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:39,039
anticipate that there might be a tandm

999
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:40,960
duplication like these guys found so so

1000
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:43,559
so now we know that there's you know

1001
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:46,400
there's potentially a a gene copy number

1002
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:48,799
component to flowering time strains that

1003
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,838
only have one copy are longer flowering

1004
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,880
strains that have two copy are fast flow

1005
00:40:50,838 --> 00:40:56,838
potentially

1006
00:40:51,880 --> 00:41:02,119
autoflow so we tried to a while back

1007
00:40:56,838 --> 00:41:03,880
use uh combined Autoflower and Vons and

1008
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:06,240
um I made a bad choice in one of the

1009
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:08,680
parents so us ho Jo is in fact

1010
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:12,879
Autoflower however it's a shitty plant

1011
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:14,519
to work with it set me back over a year

1012
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:18,160
like literally it set us back like a

1013
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:20,159
year so um we went back and we were

1014
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:24,078
trying we were trying to make Autoflower

1015
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:25,480
cbdv basically right so um and yeah

1016
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:27,519
there's a couple people working on that

1017
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:30,639
I think Nick strongberg was doing some

1018
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:33,358
stuff and yeah yeah yeah yeah so Nick

1019
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:36,000
goes back to Steve Hill so so Nick we

1020
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:39,000
helped Nick way back

1021
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,318
um um because at the time the only way

1022
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
to detect tcv was was Through Chemistry

1023
00:41:41,318 --> 00:41:46,000
and we were the first lab to be able to

1024
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,679
detect thcv actually Steve pill so so we

1025
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
wored with ni ni Nick and I go back a

1026
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:52,078
long way Nick goes back a long way with

1027
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,679
Steve Hill so he you know in fact in

1028
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:56,400
fact at one point I think he may have

1029
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:58,239
worked with either halent or us I'm not

1030
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,800
sure but he had free Rand you know he

1031
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:02,719
used to come in and run samples on our

1032
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:05,440
machines so yeah yeah yeah he wor I mean

1033
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:07,318
he got his degree from Davis so yeah so

1034
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,800
makes sense yeah there were a lot of

1035
00:42:07,318 --> 00:42:11,119
people interested in it back then right

1036
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:13,839
so so we we all had a connection to Doug

1037
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:17,039
Janks who who was the guy who developed

1038
00:42:13,838 --> 00:42:19,960
um you know Doug zon right so which was

1039
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:23,800
that that the the real first I

1040
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:25,838
think talked about high fairly high tcv

1041
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:28,318
and even back then it wasn't that high

1042
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:29,400
it was making like four to 7% but you

1043
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:31,639
know it was a one to one so it was

1044
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:34,720
making about four to 7% THC as well

1045
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:37,639
right so

1046
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:40,039
um um it it was it was a blast of smoke

1047
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:44,679
tasted like crap but dude would hit you

1048
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:46,639
hard man yeah I got some uh some extract

1049
00:42:44,679 --> 00:42:48,838
that was pure thcv that was pretty

1050
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:50,719
interesting oh really it's you hard yeah

1051
00:42:48,838 --> 00:42:52,519
yeah yeah from from Nick actually oh

1052
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:55,558
really so yeah it's interesting where

1053
00:42:52,519 --> 00:42:56,960
all these uh cannaboids are going to go

1054
00:42:55,559 --> 00:42:59,640
in the future

1055
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:02,639
there's there's dude there's so many so

1056
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:05,920
CBC has no you know

1057
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:07,558
uses uh the varens you know with the

1058
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,480
with because it's not only like the

1059
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:11,720
thepress right but but they've already

1060
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:13,880
got um I think it's in mice models or

1061
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:16,519
rat models where they showed like

1062
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:19,000
diabetes type two like in a in a mouse

1063
00:43:16,519 --> 00:43:21,400
model that that t administration of thcv

1064
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,440
helps you know regulate blood sugar and

1065
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:25,160
some other stuff so so dude there's a

1066
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,400
lot of work that can be done with canabo

1067
00:43:25,159 --> 00:43:30,000
right we just need as a country to get

1068
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:32,880
off our [ __ ] asses and and and accept

1069
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
the fact that this is not the demon that

1070
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:38,160
was made out to be it has a lot of good

1071
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,800
uses uh and and and free the plant and

1072
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:42,519
let us do some research right so um

1073
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,440
totally yeah so where do you see the

1074
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:47,559
industry going in the future you know

1075
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:49,838
over the next five years I mean you have

1076
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:51,319
a pretty great perspective from from the

1077
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:53,759
stuff you're working on as far as

1078
00:43:51,318 --> 00:43:57,558
genetics you know I I I thought I did

1079
00:43:53,760 --> 00:44:01,559
but I but I I I don't dude dude I don't

1080
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:03,800
I James let me tell you like I had a

1081
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:06,480
conversation with the CEO of my company

1082
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:08,200
yesterday and not saying what the hell

1083
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,838
do we need to do to get people to buy

1084
00:44:08,199 --> 00:44:14,000
our weed right so

1085
00:44:10,838 --> 00:44:17,000
um so you know the industry is a Fickle

1086
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,760
Beast um but I I think where everybody

1087
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,358
everybody has to go right because at the

1088
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:22,240
end of the day this is farming I you

1089
00:44:20,358 --> 00:44:23,880
know I know nobody likes when I say that

1090
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:25,799
right but this is agriculture right so

1091
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:28,680
so an agriculture becomes commoditized

1092
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:30,680
right so so at the end of the day down

1093
00:44:28,679 --> 00:44:33,598
the line people are going to be

1094
00:44:30,679 --> 00:44:34,399
concerned about their cost to produce

1095
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:37,559
right because they're going to be

1096
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:39,400
squeezed on margins clones are not the

1097
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:41,800
way that happens dude clones are the

1098
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:44,318
most expensive way to cultivate cannabis

1099
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:46,800
that you can do and this is why no big

1100
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:49,480
cash crop well I take that back roses

1101
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:51,559
and some other ornamentals right but for

1102
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:53,719
the most part most things that are grown

1103
00:44:51,559 --> 00:44:58,160
Outdoors or most things that are

1104
00:44:53,719 --> 00:45:00,358
grown in large green houses right are

1105
00:44:58,159 --> 00:45:01,960
not with the exception of things like

1106
00:45:00,358 --> 00:45:04,880
coffee

1107
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:08,720
because every single coffee tree has a

1108
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:10,880
very different flavor profile right so

1109
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:13,439
but but for the most part your your

1110
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:16,519
you're growing stuff from seeds you may

1111
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:19,599
not plant the seed yourself you may buy

1112
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:23,880
your germinated seeds and little things

1113
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:26,519
right that right but but the cost the

1114
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:29,559
cost to produce seed is far cheaper than

1115
00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:31,440
the cost to produce clones right so

1116
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:33,760
where everybody will have to go is to

1117
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,119
stabilize seed because nobody's going to

1118
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,319
want to throw out a thousand seed and

1119
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:43,160
get you know 50 different varieties

1120
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:46,239
right yeah nobody wants that so so so

1121
00:45:43,159 --> 00:45:48,519
further inbred stabilization right so

1122
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:51,959
gentically stable seats yep right which

1123
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:53,440
can which with the the use of snip chips

1124
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:55,039
that are being offered by my company and

1125
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,358
other companies with you know Mark

1126
00:45:55,039 --> 00:45:59,960
assisted breeding you can make do some

1127
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:03,078
real damage and you can get some very

1128
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:06,079
directed kind of Corral germ plasm

1129
00:46:03,079 --> 00:46:08,240
populations to work with right and and

1130
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:10,800
and have a much better chance of

1131
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:13,558
achieving things that you want and and

1132
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:15,280
so now the work begins you either are

1133
00:46:13,559 --> 00:46:17,240
going into an inbreeding program so that

1134
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:20,280
you can now create F1 hybrids that are

1135
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:22,399
have the full you know hybrid Viger that

1136
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,960
we see now when we throw things together

1137
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,039
and say oh my God that thing's [ __ ] a

1138
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:28,920
huge producer well yeah you just did the

1139
00:46:26,039 --> 00:46:31,800
hybrid Viger thing right so

1140
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:33,000
um um and so I I think that's one of the

1141
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,119
things but I think the other thing we're

1142
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,519
gonna have to see is is you know dark

1143
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:42,039
heart was doing it Oregon CBD was doing

1144
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:43,920
it manipulation inace Floy right so yeah

1145
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:45,358
um where you're starting to make

1146
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,960
triploids so that people can't steal

1147
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:48,400
your [ __ ] but more importantly right and

1148
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,280
then I'll get to triploids in in a

1149
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,240
minute and why I think some companies

1150
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:56,359
who ran into it early did it wrong right

1151
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:58,118
so um agreed but then also the whole

1152
00:46:56,358 --> 00:47:01,199
double haid reading thing right because

1153
00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:05,358
you we we are not in a spot where we can

1154
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:08,519
take eight to 12 years to stabilize you

1155
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:11,799
know to to get to an f8

1156
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:14,480
F9 you know right so that we have you

1157
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:15,920
know greater than 90% of the seed

1158
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:18,079
looking the same when you when you throw

1159
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:20,079
them out in the field right so so double

1160
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:22,720
haid reading gets us you know cuts that

1161
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:24,318
down to a year and a half two years

1162
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:26,558
right you know and that includes

1163
00:47:24,318 --> 00:47:29,599
actually trud type testing the fact make

1164
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:30,960
you have the right things right yeah um

1165
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:34,240
I think that's where everybody has to go

1166
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:37,240
otherwi otherwise right you know more

1167
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:39,399
and more people will fail because

1168
00:47:37,239 --> 00:47:42,439
they're paying cutting fees on their

1169
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:45,160
Clon on their moms or they're having

1170
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:47,599
huge mother rooms so that they can have

1171
00:47:45,159 --> 00:47:50,920
get enough cuts to be able to run that

1172
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:53,640
1,400 you know plants in that bay that

1173
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:56,440
time right so uh or they're paying you

1174
00:47:53,639 --> 00:47:58,960
know uh a lot of money to companies like

1175
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:01,800
node and conception and you know for for

1176
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:04,318
clones you know eight1 clone whatever

1177
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:06,119
yeah I mean right so you know so double

1178
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:07,759
haid you want to talk about double haid

1179
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:09,920
a little bit sure yeah for for the

1180
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:13,000
viewers that aren't familiar sure so

1181
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:14,920
double haid breeding is where you take

1182
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,480
it's called anther culture right so you

1183
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:19,519
take so you take whatever variety and

1184
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:21,760
then if it's not a male already you you

1185
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:24,079
make it you make it produce anwers right

1186
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:26,079
so you take that answer and you those

1187
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:27,720
anwers and you culture them you know on

1188
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:31,039
Aug or like tissue culture and you get

1189
00:48:27,719 --> 00:48:33,318
callus and then from there um you know

1190
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:36,239
so now you got to remember that anthers

1191
00:48:33,318 --> 00:48:40,599
the sex parts are hloy they're not

1192
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:43,239
diploid in the cell right so um so you

1193
00:48:40,599 --> 00:48:45,559
you you then take that callus and you do

1194
00:48:43,239 --> 00:48:47,719
somatic embryogenesis and so you get a

1195
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:50,559
regenerate from that just like you would

1196
00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:52,318
from regular tissue culture callus right

1197
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:54,400
um except that because it came from

1198
00:48:52,318 --> 00:48:56,639
anther and not from a diploid tissue

1199
00:48:54,400 --> 00:49:00,358
it's a haid tissue so you get a haid

1200
00:48:56,639 --> 00:49:03,239
plant right so you can then take that

1201
00:49:00,358 --> 00:49:06,639
haid plant right and cross it back to

1202
00:49:03,239 --> 00:49:10,159
itself right that you know or or or

1203
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:11,759
cross to some other haploid plant right

1204
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:13,159
if you don't if you don't cross it back

1205
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:15,400
to yourself then you're not really

1206
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:16,920
making the double haid right so you're

1207
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:19,798
you're just out Crossing in a different

1208
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:22,280
way but um but you cross it back to

1209
00:49:19,798 --> 00:49:26,000
itself and then what you end up with is

1210
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:28,640
a plant that is 100 100% homozygous at

1211
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,119
every low side right so what happens to

1212
00:49:28,639 --> 00:49:32,159
that plant well that plant looks nothing

1213
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:34,240
like the plant you took it from right so

1214
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:36,798
because it's now 100% homozygous at

1215
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:38,919
every at every low side the plant that

1216
00:49:36,798 --> 00:49:41,920
you were

1217
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:43,680
using to you know was not 100%

1218
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,039
homozygous at every low size so now what

1219
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:46,838
you got to do is you got to go through

1220
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:48,358
and you got to find the

1221
00:49:46,838 --> 00:49:50,920
combinations because you're not just

1222
00:49:48,358 --> 00:49:53,078
doing it with one plant right and then

1223
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:55,200
now that you've got these 100%

1224
00:49:53,079 --> 00:49:58,519
homozygous lines that You' created from

1225
00:49:55,199 --> 00:50:00,480
this culture and remember every

1226
00:49:58,519 --> 00:50:01,960
anther is the rule of independent

1227
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,240
assignment right so it's not like you

1228
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:08,119
get one genotype out of an anther right

1229
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:10,598
so because the so so there's still a lot

1230
00:50:08,119 --> 00:50:13,318
of phenotyping the the markers justed

1231
00:50:10,599 --> 00:50:15,440
you know kind of you know selection to

1232
00:50:13,318 --> 00:50:17,639
make sure you have the right things but

1233
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,599
once you then breed those two 100%

1234
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:22,400
homozygous things together you end up

1235
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:26,240
with the best version of an F1 hybrid

1236
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:28,480
right so because it's it and and you see

1237
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:32,199
the kind of hybrid bigger that people

1238
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:34,760
refer to when they say F1 hybrids right

1239
00:50:32,199 --> 00:50:36,558
so what we typically do in cannabis is

1240
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:40,640
not really a true F1 hybrid a true F1

1241
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:43,319
hybrid is is is from inbred lines right

1242
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:46,679
right so totally stable stable lines

1243
00:50:43,318 --> 00:50:48,039
right right so so so that's what what

1244
00:50:46,679 --> 00:50:50,919
Double H breeding allows you to do it

1245
00:50:48,039 --> 00:50:52,960
allows you to cut that inbred line

1246
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:55,159
development which takes a long time into

1247
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:57,639
a very short period of time right but

1248
00:50:55,159 --> 00:50:59,558
there's still a lot of evaluation that

1249
00:50:57,639 --> 00:51:01,558
has to happen right because part of the

1250
00:50:59,559 --> 00:51:05,079
in red line process is picking the best

1251
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:07,000
ones as you go down to to continue doing

1252
00:51:05,079 --> 00:51:09,760
the breeding with right so now that

1253
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:12,159
you've created this population of hloy

1254
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:14,640
genomes right that you're going to now

1255
00:51:12,159 --> 00:51:17,159
make diploid by mating to itself right

1256
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:20,000
you now have to look at well what

1257
00:51:17,159 --> 00:51:22,399
combinations did I get and how do I put

1258
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:25,960
those together to make good seed right

1259
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:29,039
but that seed that comes out is 100 %

1260
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:31,760
identical everything in that population

1261
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:34,039
from that next cross is 100% identical

1262
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:36,359
and so now you get you throw you throw

1263
00:51:34,039 --> 00:51:39,079
your thousand seat out there and

1264
00:51:36,358 --> 00:51:41,519
999 at the very least are looking the

1265
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:44,200
same and that's where we need to get to

1266
00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:45,759
to be able to really drive the price

1267
00:51:44,199 --> 00:51:48,679
down because when you you get to that

1268
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:50,240
point you know even if it's topnotch

1269
00:51:48,679 --> 00:51:51,440
seed right you're going to be you know

1270
00:51:50,239 --> 00:51:53,159
in bulk you're going to be paying a

1271
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:57,599
couple three bucks a SE as opposed to

1272
00:51:53,159 --> 00:51:59,279
eight 10 12 bucks a cut right so yeah so

1273
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:01,039
and then what are your thoughts on AI

1274
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:03,798
for predictive models and stuff like

1275
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:06,358
that so AI is good if you have good

1276
00:52:03,798 --> 00:52:08,880
input data right so so they they tried

1277
00:52:06,358 --> 00:52:10,078
to do a lot of AI modeling with tpin and

1278
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,519
I think they haven't had a lot of

1279
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:14,079
success they've had some success but not

1280
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:16,838
a lot because garbage in equals garbage

1281
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:18,920
out right so unless you have very well

1282
00:52:16,838 --> 00:52:20,679
curated tping data and not everybody

1283
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:23,680
does the same job and all and the same

1284
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:26,879
thing for all that stuff right so so AI

1285
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:29,558
has potential use assuming you have good

1286
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:31,079
input data right and I think the way

1287
00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:32,760
things have been going in the industry

1288
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:34,240
with elevated numbers and so on and so

1289
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:36,720
forth I don't think there's good data to

1290
00:52:34,239 --> 00:52:39,879
be able to really to to do any good AI

1291
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:43,399
modeling right I who have in my my own

1292
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:45,440
data for my own work um which is very

1293
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:47,358
well curated I have a data scientist

1294
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:49,798
whose job is nothing but to tell me what

1295
00:52:47,358 --> 00:52:52,558
is my good data and my Shady data right

1296
00:52:49,798 --> 00:52:54,960
and even he is not at the point where he

1297
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:57,160
thinks we have data that's sufficient

1298
00:52:54,960 --> 00:53:01,639
for AI modeling without heavy

1299
00:52:57,159 --> 00:53:03,719
handholding of the model so uh so so I I

1300
00:53:01,639 --> 00:53:07,239
think it's I think it will get there at

1301
00:53:03,719 --> 00:53:10,798
some point you either need a good amount

1302
00:53:07,239 --> 00:53:14,879
of really outstanding data or you need

1303
00:53:10,798 --> 00:53:18,199
[ __ ] tons of poor data or or mediocre

1304
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:20,720
data right and and and to be able to to

1305
00:53:18,199 --> 00:53:24,000
to work through all of the the the the

1306
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:25,919
falsehoods right so so and I and I don't

1307
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,920
think there's and there may be enough

1308
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:29,280
data like if every lab in the world got

1309
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,440
together and dumped all their [ __ ] into

1310
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:33,400
a big repository and set some AI engine

1311
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:35,480
on it it'd probably do a decent job

1312
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:36,838
right but I but but but we're not at

1313
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:38,480
that level of cooperation where

1314
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:41,440
everybody's just dumping all their data

1315
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:43,400
into single repository yet so yes it's

1316
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,599
it's it's interesting I mean we're we're

1317
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:46,358
just starting to scratch the surface

1318
00:53:44,599 --> 00:53:48,280
with some of this stuff and yeah as I

1319
00:53:46,358 --> 00:53:49,920
was descri describing double haid

1320
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:52,960
reading before I I kind of badmouth

1321
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:54,159
triploid stuff so it's funny because you

1322
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:56,599
know a lot of

1323
00:53:54,159 --> 00:53:58,279
people went and did triploids they

1324
00:53:56,599 --> 00:54:00,920
thought it was the thing to do well

1325
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:02,400
because now you you know you know you

1326
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:05,639
won't get seen

1327
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:07,480
well if your [ __ ] didn't Herm you

1328
00:54:05,639 --> 00:54:10,960
wouldn't need triploids to take care of

1329
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:13,318
that problem right so there right so

1330
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:15,519
there your neighbor sh didn't H them too

1331
00:54:13,318 --> 00:54:19,119
you know and and traditionally triploids

1332
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:22,119
are used at the end of a breeding cycle

1333
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:24,358
right so and because now you've done all

1334
00:54:22,119 --> 00:54:26,960
this work you have your inbred lines

1335
00:54:24,358 --> 00:54:29,239
right you you know what your F1 hybrid

1336
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:32,000
seed's going to look like so now you

1337
00:54:29,239 --> 00:54:33,118
take one of those parents and you make

1338
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,519
it a

1339
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:37,920
quadrio you breed it to the diploid

1340
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:41,599
equip diploid version of it and you have

1341
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:43,440
a triploid seed that exhibits the exact

1342
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:47,119
phenotypic stuff that you needed to

1343
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:50,798
exhibit right yeah so I don't think

1344
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:54,079
anybody had weed of any kind CBD or THC

1345
00:54:50,798 --> 00:54:55,639
dominant that was at that end of the

1346
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:58,200
cycle

1347
00:54:55,639 --> 00:55:01,279
breeding kind of path you know what I'm

1348
00:54:58,199 --> 00:55:05,118
saying right makes perfect sense so so

1349
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:07,280
so it was really used to solve a

1350
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:09,960
problem right that could have been

1351
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:11,920
solved other ways so that's that's my

1352
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:14,480
opinion yeah I don't think we're quite

1353
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:16,119
there with the the triploids yet but

1354
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:18,440
yeah I mean like the concept is great it

1355
00:55:16,119 --> 00:55:20,280
works great for watermelons yeah well

1356
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:24,119
and it's it's a great example right so

1357
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:26,280
so when you make triploids right not so

1358
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:28,240
you know either have complete triploids

1359
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:31,160
or or or partial triploids right like

1360
00:55:28,239 --> 00:55:35,279
like for instance you know Mac one right

1361
00:55:31,159 --> 00:55:36,960
uh is is a partial triploid so so and

1362
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,480
boy was that hard I tried to agree with

1363
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,000
that and I could never figure out till I

1364
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:42,639
figured out that it was a partial trip

1365
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,599
I'm like God damn it why why are 95% of

1366
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:46,239
all my seed in mature [ __ ] Duds like

1367
00:55:44,599 --> 00:55:48,200
I I would I would Harvest like a

1368
00:55:46,239 --> 00:55:51,399
thousand seed and like 50 would be good

1369
00:55:48,199 --> 00:55:52,118
would be mature right yeah sfv is like

1370
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:55,519
that

1371
00:55:52,119 --> 00:55:57,160
too yeah sfv cultivar yeah yeah so

1372
00:55:55,519 --> 00:56:01,119
when you look at fruit that's been

1373
00:55:57,159 --> 00:56:03,000
tripled right y like you have to be

1374
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:07,400
careful like not every triploid is going

1375
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:10,480
to be increased Mass better sweetness

1376
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:13,200
right like you you really have to make

1377
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:15,480
sure that the triploid combination that

1378
00:56:13,199 --> 00:56:18,078
you have is giving you something that

1379
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:20,119
you want right like you know so

1380
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:23,519
otherwise you just have a triploid and

1381
00:56:20,119 --> 00:56:26,160
and and that's not making seed but is it

1382
00:56:23,519 --> 00:56:27,960
really a better plant right like I mean

1383
00:56:26,159 --> 00:56:31,239
the the reason you use triploid is to

1384
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:35,159
get something extra right

1385
00:56:31,239 --> 00:56:38,279
yeah so increased Vigor increased yield

1386
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:40,480
increased flavor no seed exactly right

1387
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:42,280
the no seed part is important yeah but

1388
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,639
if that's all you're using it for then

1389
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:46,160
you're kind of wasting the technology

1390
00:56:43,639 --> 00:56:50,038
right so right

1391
00:56:46,159 --> 00:56:51,078
so yeah they'll be there eventually yeah

1392
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:53,799
there's probably enough people working

1393
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:56,000
on it well we have to right so if if we

1394
00:56:53,798 --> 00:56:57,960
want to survive you know I mean I hate I

1395
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,318
would hate to see this become the future

1396
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:02,159
of the Cannabis industry right but yeah

1397
00:57:00,318 --> 00:57:03,480
you know I'm I'm sure you've heard

1398
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:04,920
people talk about how there's going to

1399
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:06,838
be this split in the industry you're

1400
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:08,720
gonna have like the small craft beer guy

1401
00:57:06,838 --> 00:57:11,318
and you're gonna have the big box beer

1402
00:57:08,719 --> 00:57:13,279
guy right like that already

1403
00:57:11,318 --> 00:57:17,038
happening you think it's happened to age

1404
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:19,119
degree already I think so and I I mean I

1405
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:22,160
personally think so and I I kind of like

1406
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:23,440
to see it going that way with uh Terre

1407
00:57:22,159 --> 00:57:25,598
and stuff like that if we're talking

1408
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,480
about humbled and Menino these guys with

1409
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:29,160
their specific genetics that they grow

1410
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:31,519
that are specific to that region and

1411
00:57:29,159 --> 00:57:32,399
make it more like wine and beer I mean I

1412
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:35,679
like that

1413
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:38,200
model so yes so so as long as that model

1414
00:57:35,679 --> 00:57:41,239
is well regulated right because just

1415
00:57:38,199 --> 00:57:43,719
because right you know you you can't

1416
00:57:41,239 --> 00:57:45,639
take some dirt from Humble go to La and

1417
00:57:43,719 --> 00:57:47,598
grow it in LA and say oh this is humble

1418
00:57:45,639 --> 00:57:49,759
grown no it's not because now

1419
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:51,599
temperature is different humidity is

1420
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:55,920
different you know insulation is

1421
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:57,838
different right like you know so so

1422
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:59,119
remember this was few years ago they

1423
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:00,599
were talking about this stuff and they

1424
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:02,480
wanted you know for sure that they

1425
00:58:00,599 --> 00:58:05,440
wanted to have the Terre map of of the

1426
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:09,000
humble you know the the Emerald Triangle

1427
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:12,159
up there and you know they had asked me

1428
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:14,318
to to consult on that whole program you

1429
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:16,639
know um when I was with

1430
00:58:14,318 --> 00:58:18,119
ncia and I was like H you guys don't

1431
00:58:16,639 --> 00:58:20,159
want me to consult because I'm I'm gonna

1432
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:21,880
ruin everybody's party dude because you

1433
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:24,358
guys want you you guys want to be able

1434
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:26,798
to say oh yeah it's this variety you

1435
00:58:24,358 --> 00:58:28,159
know grown under licensed by this guy

1436
00:58:26,798 --> 00:58:30,159
and I'm like well that's not that's not

1437
00:58:28,159 --> 00:58:32,358
Terre that has nothing to do with it

1438
00:58:30,159 --> 00:58:35,558
dude that I mean terar means you grow it

1439
00:58:32,358 --> 00:58:37,400
in that spot this is your region and you

1440
00:58:35,559 --> 00:58:38,640
can't grow it outside that region right

1441
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:41,440
because if you grow it outside that

1442
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:44,159
region it changes it right so so yeah so

1443
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:46,159
anyway um you know because terar is very

1444
00:58:44,159 --> 00:58:50,159
it's so complicated dude it's it's it's

1445
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:51,960
soil microbes it's mineral content it's

1446
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:53,639
it's it's so many things humidity

1447
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:57,599
elevation all these things come into

1448
00:58:53,639 --> 00:59:00,759
play for sure so um the idea is a great

1449
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:03,200
idea it's a great idea if it's done

1450
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:07,000
right if they do it like they do

1451
00:59:03,199 --> 00:59:08,399
provinces in France for wine right like

1452
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:12,079
like literally you can grow the same

1453
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:14,358
grape in and two provinces that are next

1454
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:16,359
to each other in fact one there is this

1455
00:59:14,358 --> 00:59:20,000
is actually what happens there's a wine

1456
00:59:16,358 --> 00:59:22,960
called make vage and another um wine

1457
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:25,880
called Pui right and literally it's the

1458
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:27,280
same grape the two places are next to

1459
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:30,960
each other on the

1460
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:33,839
map yep right but because they have a

1461
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:36,400
line down the middle and there is a

1462
00:59:33,838 --> 00:59:39,519
slight difference in the I think it's

1463
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:41,920
the acidity or some mineral content um

1464
00:59:39,519 --> 00:59:44,759
you know this county has more of one

1465
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:46,798
thing than this County does literally

1466
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:49,280
right different wies can't call them the

1467
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:50,920
same so yeah and Canabis will do the

1468
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:52,839
same thing if you had the same growing

1469
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:54,280
techniques in two regions right next to

1470
00:59:52,838 --> 00:59:56,480
each other one that was up a little

1471
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:58,960
higher or lower you're going to get

1472
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:03,719
different expressions and so this leads

1473
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:06,440
to something else right why brand

1474
01:00:03,719 --> 01:00:08,919
names need to go and I know nobody's

1475
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:11,200
gonna like to hear that right so

1476
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:12,639
absolutely right but but it's based on

1477
01:00:11,199 --> 01:00:15,159
what you just said the chemistry right

1478
01:00:12,639 --> 01:00:17,719
so you take blue dream and you grow it

1479
01:00:15,159 --> 01:00:19,719
up in Humble and you grow it in LA do

1480
01:00:17,719 --> 01:00:23,679
you expect to have the same chemical

1481
01:00:19,719 --> 01:00:26,519
output no right because it's phenotype

1482
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:31,440
is equal to genotype plus environment

1483
01:00:26,519 --> 01:00:33,318
right right so literally blue dream may

1484
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:35,358
not look like blue dream if it's grown

1485
01:00:33,318 --> 01:00:37,519
in two different places right so you

1486
01:00:35,358 --> 01:00:39,679
yeah you'll get a different

1487
01:00:37,519 --> 01:00:41,599
expression yeah well and then besides

1488
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:44,879
that it's like so these guys are selling

1489
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:46,079
packs of seeds right the these retailers

1490
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,440
including myself but you're you're

1491
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:49,760
selling a pack of seeds and somebody

1492
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:51,240
pops one and they call it blue dream and

1493
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:53,079
then someone pops another one from that

1494
01:00:51,239 --> 01:00:54,558
same pack they also call it Blue Dream

1495
01:00:53,079 --> 01:00:55,920
you're getting a different expression

1496
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:57,280
blue dream's a bad example because it's

1497
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:59,639
a little more stabilized but like a lot

1498
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:01,319
of this gelato you know CU Blue Dream

1499
01:00:59,639 --> 01:01:03,558
you get basically with the s1's you're

1500
01:01:01,318 --> 01:01:05,119
getting for Expressions that's pretty

1501
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:06,839
much it they lean towards one of these

1502
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:09,200
four Expressions but with something like

1503
01:01:06,838 --> 01:01:11,759
gelato 33 you put it you know you self

1504
01:01:09,199 --> 01:01:13,318
gelato 33 you pop 10 seeds you get 10

1505
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:14,680
different Expressions hell yeah dude you

1506
01:01:13,318 --> 01:01:15,880
pop 20 seeds you're probably gonna get

1507
01:01:14,679 --> 01:01:18,558
20 different

1508
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:21,000
Expressions so and that's and that's the

1509
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:22,440
problem right so everybody you know so

1510
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,798
don't get wrong I don't say it's a

1511
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:26,679
problem but it's a challenge right but

1512
01:01:24,798 --> 01:01:29,960
it's also what leads

1513
01:01:26,679 --> 01:01:31,399
to such amazing diversity that we see

1514
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:32,880
everybody's always got every year

1515
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:35,838
there's always something new coming out

1516
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:38,920
right so yeah so so it it helps us in a

1517
01:01:35,838 --> 01:01:40,880
way right but we we we have to be

1518
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:45,000
careful about whether or not we're over

1519
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:47,559
hybridizing everything right and we'll

1520
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:50,559
eventually lose distinctions right so

1521
01:01:47,559 --> 01:01:53,440
how H how many Bakery products do we

1522
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:56,079
need right like you know

1523
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:58,400
all ice creams do we need right and

1524
01:01:56,079 --> 01:02:00,318
they're and and they're all made by

1525
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:02,240
banging the same plants together right

1526
01:02:00,318 --> 01:02:05,400
and so that's where we start to have

1527
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:07,598
problems with you know genetics and and

1528
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:09,079
who knows right some of these we're not

1529
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:11,440
we don't study this kind of stuff

1530
01:02:09,079 --> 01:02:13,839
because nobody really studies anything

1531
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:15,639
to any depth in gene in cannabis because

1532
01:02:13,838 --> 01:02:19,239
we you know to bus trying to make money

1533
01:02:15,639 --> 01:02:21,400
right so um but how much inbreeding

1534
01:02:19,239 --> 01:02:23,879
depression have we already

1535
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:26,798
seen right and it's contributing to some

1536
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:29,798
of these hard to grow strains and and

1537
01:02:26,798 --> 01:02:31,480
hard to work with strains because right

1538
01:02:29,798 --> 01:02:33,038
literally we have been banging the same

1539
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:35,119
[ __ ] together over and over and over and

1540
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:38,359
over again right so right things like

1541
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:39,880
hop plate and verid you know I think

1542
01:02:38,358 --> 01:02:41,798
yeah hop plate and verid has been a hot

1543
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:44,358
topic for the last couple years but

1544
01:02:41,798 --> 01:02:45,759
especially now it's like it's decimating

1545
01:02:44,358 --> 01:02:47,358
some people and it's you know it might

1546
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:50,839
Express on a branch it might Express on

1547
01:02:47,358 --> 01:02:52,519
a plant or a row or a whole room yeah

1548
01:02:50,838 --> 01:02:54,199
but uh you know and that's a problem but

1549
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:56,318
I mean I think and correct me if I'm

1550
01:02:54,199 --> 01:02:58,159
wrong wrong but uh you know with with

1551
01:02:56,318 --> 01:03:00,358
all this genetic depression that's going

1552
01:02:58,159 --> 01:03:01,118
on from inbreeding a lot of people don't

1553
01:03:00,358 --> 01:03:02,838
think they're inbreeding they're

1554
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:04,680
Crossing this with that but then the

1555
01:03:02,838 --> 01:03:07,038
plant's more susceptible to things like

1556
01:03:04,679 --> 01:03:10,440
hlate and viroid and different pests and

1557
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:13,480
other pathogens there's some evidence

1558
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:15,519
that different cannabis lineages have

1559
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:17,838
different levels of resistance to Hops

1560
01:03:15,519 --> 01:03:19,759
and viid right so yeah I don't think

1561
01:03:17,838 --> 01:03:21,719
anybody's got a real handle on it but

1562
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:23,760
you know what we we've done a lot of

1563
01:03:21,719 --> 01:03:25,199
work with it and we've we've actually

1564
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:28,680
you know point when we were a hem

1565
01:03:25,199 --> 01:03:31,239
company we we we were running a a

1566
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:32,598
cleaning program we would you know we

1567
01:03:31,239 --> 01:03:34,879
had some of our varieties that we were

1568
01:03:32,599 --> 01:03:36,920
working with um we put them into our

1569
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:39,200
tissue culture program and and actually

1570
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:41,880
ran you know some thermal

1571
01:03:39,199 --> 01:03:44,519
cleanings and and were able to

1572
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:46,119
show significant decreases in the level

1573
01:03:44,519 --> 01:03:48,038
of hops slate and vroid after one

1574
01:03:46,119 --> 01:03:52,079
cleaning like one of the pl one of the

1575
01:03:48,039 --> 01:03:54,359
lines was 75% reduced one was 60%

1576
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:57,559
another one was like 40% and there were

1577
01:03:54,358 --> 01:04:00,639
some lines you could not clean at all at

1578
01:03:57,559 --> 01:04:03,319
all right so so clearly there are

1579
01:04:00,639 --> 01:04:06,960
genetic differences that if we

1580
01:04:03,318 --> 01:04:10,519
understood better we could in fact work

1581
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:13,519
with to produce more resistant plants

1582
01:04:10,519 --> 01:04:17,079
now whether that resistance is due to

1583
01:04:13,519 --> 01:04:18,838
like a a pathogen kind of gene or

1584
01:04:17,079 --> 01:04:21,920
whether it's because it's producing

1585
01:04:18,838 --> 01:04:23,480
certain Turpin or not right and remember

1586
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:25,440
Turpin are in fact kind of like the

1587
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:28,278
plant's immune system right so it's

1588
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:30,838
definitely an Avenue that we we should

1589
01:04:28,278 --> 01:04:35,039
be looking at now the way you're saying

1590
01:04:30,838 --> 01:04:39,318
it is is are we seeing less resistance

1591
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:41,000
to hplvd because we have been doing all

1592
01:04:39,318 --> 01:04:43,159
this damage to the genetics through in

1593
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,400
breeding and depression that's a great

1594
01:04:43,159 --> 01:04:47,639
question and I don't know if anybody's

1595
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:51,278
ever thought of it that way right but

1596
01:04:47,639 --> 01:04:53,838
the more we've started to focus on the

1597
01:04:51,278 --> 01:04:56,719
gelato or the gorilla glues and the

1598
01:04:53,838 --> 01:04:59,318
cookie ke and breeding those lines

1599
01:04:56,719 --> 01:05:01,278
suddenly we're seeing this increase in

1600
01:04:59,318 --> 01:05:03,639
hplvd it's it's almost like it's

1601
01:05:01,278 --> 01:05:05,760
occurring at the same time so while I

1602
01:05:03,639 --> 01:05:07,960
don't know for sure that there's any

1603
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:09,839
support for that it certainly fits the

1604
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:11,159
available observation right so there's

1605
01:05:09,838 --> 01:05:13,480
definitely seems to be a correlation

1606
01:05:11,159 --> 01:05:16,199
between you know there's been a much

1607
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:17,318
bigger Spike but you could also

1608
01:05:16,199 --> 01:05:19,558
potentially attribute that much bigger

1609
01:05:17,318 --> 01:05:22,519
Spike to the now it's legal in so many

1610
01:05:19,559 --> 01:05:27,359
states dude I so when when my company

1611
01:05:22,519 --> 01:05:29,960
licensed panaka from hemp trading in

1612
01:05:27,358 --> 01:05:33,278
Spain the first thing we did when we got

1613
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:37,960
the cuts was run hplvd test on it they

1614
01:05:33,278 --> 01:05:39,480
came to us from Spain with hpbd wow yeah

1615
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:40,960
and it's transmissible through clones

1616
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:42,679
and even seeds I mean they're they're

1617
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:45,199
proving that you know now that it's

1618
01:05:42,679 --> 01:05:47,159
transmissible through seed as well yeah

1619
01:05:45,199 --> 01:05:49,118
so so did they change that number I

1620
01:05:47,159 --> 01:05:50,960
haven't read up by that recently but the

1621
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:53,838
last time I heard it was like 8 to 10%

1622
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:55,720
transmission is is it still that low or

1623
01:05:53,838 --> 01:05:57,880
they people that's what I've heard is

1624
01:05:55,719 --> 01:05:59,759
I've heard 8 to 10% yeah yeah yeah so

1625
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:02,278
yeah which is still a good percent right

1626
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:04,319
like so that means what if you if you're

1627
01:06:02,278 --> 01:06:06,079
dealing with two infected plants that

1628
01:06:04,318 --> 01:06:08,358
means one out of every 10 seeds has the

1629
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:12,240
potential to start bad right like that's

1630
01:06:08,358 --> 01:06:13,598
that's not good so yeah and I mean I

1631
01:06:12,239 --> 01:06:15,959
think a lot of people aren't testing for

1632
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:17,440
it either and they're just assuming and

1633
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:20,400
you know ignoring it and something that

1634
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:21,480
needs to be identified and you know I

1635
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:23,480
think that's another thing with

1636
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:24,880
awareness you know people you know they

1637
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:26,519
start seeing and the thing is is a lot

1638
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:28,358
of these cultivators they see it on one

1639
01:06:26,519 --> 01:06:30,278
branch right so you see it on one you

1640
01:06:28,358 --> 01:06:32,880
get a dted branch no big deal then you

1641
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:36,039
start seeing dted plants and you have to

1642
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:38,318
co those but you know and it can it's

1643
01:06:36,039 --> 01:06:40,680
funny because unless you're using bleach

1644
01:06:38,318 --> 01:06:41,920
to sterilize your tools if you have it

1645
01:06:40,679 --> 01:06:43,919
in your room you're just going to spread

1646
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:45,599
it everywhere yeah you know even with

1647
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:47,159
with irrigation if you're if it's

1648
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:48,880
passing through the water from one plant

1649
01:06:47,159 --> 01:06:52,358
to the next you could spread it that way

1650
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:55,680
so yep so you know and then and what was

1651
01:06:52,358 --> 01:06:57,400
it Kevin from genomics just like two

1652
01:06:55,679 --> 01:07:00,358
days ago had the paper that leaf Hoppers

1653
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:03,039
are carriers right so they they gra some

1654
01:07:00,358 --> 01:07:06,558
Leaf Hoppers and found the virus the

1655
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:09,520
viroid in in the leaf Hopper right so so

1656
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:11,839
and so think about this though right so

1657
01:07:09,519 --> 01:07:14,000
the main mode of transmission previously

1658
01:07:11,838 --> 01:07:15,278
was mechanical right you snip a plant

1659
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,798
you don't wash them good you snip

1660
01:07:15,278 --> 01:07:19,880
another plant bang right well who's

1661
01:07:17,798 --> 01:07:23,639
washing the mandal parts of the insects

1662
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:25,920
eat biting our plants right so now you

1663
01:07:23,639 --> 01:07:27,639
you you you find it on Leaf ho you find

1664
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:29,480
it in leaf Hoppers right well what about

1665
01:07:27,639 --> 01:07:32,798
all the other plants that happily munch

1666
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:35,278
on cannabis right it's not a virus right

1667
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:37,239
it's not like it has to go in and infect

1668
01:07:35,278 --> 01:07:41,559
and then get protein coat and then lice

1669
01:07:37,239 --> 01:07:44,558
the cell right it's literally an RNA an

1670
01:07:41,559 --> 01:07:45,880
infectious RNA it gets in if it you know

1671
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:48,798
through some sort of mechanical

1672
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:50,240
transmission so if a bug is on a dirty

1673
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:52,798
plant and hops to a clean plant and

1674
01:07:50,239 --> 01:07:55,838
bites that clean plant why wouldn't its

1675
01:07:52,798 --> 01:07:57,719
mandibles or or prascus or whatever it's

1676
01:07:55,838 --> 01:08:00,159
sticking in the plant to eat right why

1677
01:07:57,719 --> 01:08:01,959
wouldn't it potentially have the same

1678
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:05,480
ability to transfer that the scissors

1679
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:08,920
that we're using to cut do right like

1680
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:10,679
and before there was no Bonafide insect

1681
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:12,519
you know transmitter now we know that at

1682
01:08:10,679 --> 01:08:15,078
least there's one right so now it's time

1683
01:08:12,519 --> 01:08:17,880
to keep our eyes open I grow I grow I

1684
01:08:15,079 --> 01:08:20,359
grow at tourist dude I find I find

1685
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:22,838
crickets like huge crickets like happily

1686
01:08:20,359 --> 01:08:25,759
muching all my cannabis right so oh yeah

1687
01:08:22,838 --> 01:08:27,719
you know can cricket carry it too like

1688
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:31,479
if it bites a bad plant will it transmit

1689
01:08:27,719 --> 01:08:33,000
to a good plant so yeah well and I think

1690
01:08:31,479 --> 01:08:34,399
if you have a tissue culture lab if

1691
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,079
you're if you're blessed enough to be a

1692
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:38,798
cultivator that has a tissue culture lab

1693
01:08:36,079 --> 01:08:40,278
and you can keep clean germ plasm you

1694
01:08:38,798 --> 01:08:41,960
know it's it's going to make a huge

1695
01:08:40,279 --> 01:08:43,400
difference moving forward yeah I work

1696
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:45,640
with apical biotech I'm not sure if

1697
01:08:43,399 --> 01:08:47,559
you're familiar with them with who

1698
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:49,759
apical biotech from Justin from apical

1699
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:51,600
biotch and they they do remediation and

1700
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:53,880
they do a really good job with it and

1701
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:55,319
you know they have they have tests that

1702
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:58,039
prove that they're actually remediating

1703
01:08:55,319 --> 01:09:00,319
with Mir stem excision so there's so

1704
01:08:58,039 --> 01:09:02,119
much misinformation disinformation and

1705
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:04,400
lack of information right and we need to

1706
01:09:02,119 --> 01:09:07,079
change that so drastically so

1707
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:09,479
drastically um you know in order to you

1708
01:09:07,079 --> 01:09:12,278
know we we want to be legitimate right

1709
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:14,358
we we want to be a self-sustaining

1710
01:09:12,279 --> 01:09:15,920
industry that doesn't have every year

1711
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:17,079
more and more people dropping out

1712
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:19,759
because they're losing their shirts

1713
01:09:17,079 --> 01:09:22,158
because something with regulations or

1714
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:24,479
something with you know uh Finance or

1715
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:27,399
whatever is is is kicking their ass dude

1716
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:29,399
so yeah I'm I'm speaking from personal

1717
01:09:27,399 --> 01:09:32,879
experience right now

1718
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:35,119
so yeah the industry is wild we the Wild

1719
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:37,600
Wild West still but but it's evolving

1720
01:09:35,119 --> 01:09:40,399
and it's it's growing in some ways and

1721
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:42,239
you know I think it's stabilizing in

1722
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:45,719
other ways which I think is really

1723
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:48,358
great so yeah no once again let's

1724
01:09:45,719 --> 01:09:50,838
celebrate that that one step closer to

1725
01:09:48,359 --> 01:09:53,880
Safe banking dude that that's gonna make

1726
01:09:50,838 --> 01:09:56,479
so much difference so much difference

1727
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:57,840
yeah so we went we went back a couple

1728
01:09:56,479 --> 01:10:01,879
years back and we started doing a bunch

1729
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:01,880
of land R stuff like pack said J

1730
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:07,039
Kush so dude let me tell you the stuff

1731
01:10:05,399 --> 01:10:11,319
that we started to get out of that the

1732
01:10:07,039 --> 01:10:14,279
tpine profiles and just just amazing

1733
01:10:11,319 --> 01:10:15,639
stuff so um you know there's something

1734
01:10:14,279 --> 01:10:17,359
to be said for the old school genetics

1735
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:19,640
man you know land races old school

1736
01:10:17,359 --> 01:10:21,880
genetics there there's some power back

1737
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:24,119
there still so well now with like

1738
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:25,679
Thailand opening up and Asia opening up

1739
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:28,439
there's a whole

1740
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:30,560
new uh group of tping that we can start

1741
01:10:28,439 --> 01:10:32,879
going after and and flavor profiles if

1742
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:34,880
you talk about you know green tea ice

1743
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:35,960
cream or Fried Chicken Fried Chicken

1744
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:37,840
most people don't want to smoke stuff

1745
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:39,679
that smells like fried chicken but you

1746
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:42,760
you take it over there and they like

1747
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:44,359
Savory more than sweet I think Y and so

1748
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:46,600
you know South Korea goes online we're

1749
01:10:44,359 --> 01:10:47,839
gonna have some kimchi swing cannabis

1750
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:52,440
it's going to be

1751
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:55,640
amazing that'll be awesome dude you know

1752
01:10:52,439 --> 01:10:58,719
so there's been such a bottleneck in

1753
01:10:55,640 --> 01:11:01,640
yeah in US genetics right like like if

1754
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:03,920
you know I I'm I'm geeky this way so I I

1755
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:06,320
started to create a chart I was using

1756
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:09,399
the the seedfinder.eu

1757
01:11:06,319 --> 01:11:11,439
docomo um yeah so I started to go back

1758
01:11:09,399 --> 01:11:13,920
and and I start to make a chart of like

1759
01:11:11,439 --> 01:11:17,839
all of the crosses of the stuff that

1760
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:20,920
that was popular today right you know GG

1761
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:23,279
and right so when these are just said

1762
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:25,760
crosses I think a lot of people I think

1763
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:28,238
a lot people take the data on seedfinder

1764
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:29,840
as fact and I know for a fact a lot of

1765
01:11:28,238 --> 01:11:31,479
it is incorrect just because somebody
