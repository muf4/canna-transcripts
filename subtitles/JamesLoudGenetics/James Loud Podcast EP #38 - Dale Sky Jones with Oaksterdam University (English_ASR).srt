a rare breed you don't to keep up with

42
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:45,319
the likes of us is and you know I'm like

43
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:48,560
okay 5:00 a.m. I'm ready to work uh I do

44
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:50,319
my seriously 8 a.m. on the East Co and

45
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,280
she's already been rocking for an hour

46
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:53,639
seriously and you know it's like I do my

47
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,799
cold Plunge in the morning and I get

48
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,359
ready to go I I do it religiously every

49
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,600
day cold plunge game changer for me I

50
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:01,478
don't drink coffee first thing in the

51
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:03,919
morning now I do that and I feel like

52
00:02:01,478 --> 00:02:05,239
I'm more productive so that's you know

53
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,159
and it's so interesting talk about

54
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:10,639
Different Strokes for different folks

55
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:12,959
because I have something called cylic

56
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:15,238
vomiting syndrome oh wow and one of my

57
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,199
triggers is cold really so that would

58
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:19,680
put me in the hospital if I did on cold

59
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:21,518
Plunge in the morning that would not be

60
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,920
a good day for me well cold plunge is so

61
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:24,800
interesting because I feel like I know

62
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:26,159
the science is is there I just

63
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,000
personally can't but the first time I

64
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,120
looked at the water I was like that is

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,519
going to kill me there's no way I'm go

66
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,280
in there and be okay if you stay in

67
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,879
there long enough it will hypothermia

68
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,959
but not not not what you're doing yes

69
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:39,639
and no but I do 15minute plunges

70
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:42,360
sometimes and I go a they say three to

71
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:44,359
six minutes and I've pushed it to 15

72
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,640
because I'm like this guy Rick rubben he

73
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:50,159
does 30 minutes Joe Rogan he does 20 I

74
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:52,079
can do 15 and I don't feel like I get

75
00:02:50,158 --> 00:02:53,919
more benefit from doing 15 minutes than

76
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,560
I do from doing eight and so I sit

77
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:59,559
around 8 minutes and it's 45° right now

78
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,680
so I was doing colder and now I settle

79
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,519
around there I feel really good

80
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,080
afterwards MH you found your sweet spot

81
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,480
yeah and everyone's body chemistry is

82
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,599
different it's kind of how cannabis

83
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:11,919
works I feel like there's no one

84
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:13,318
specific cultivar that works for

85
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,798
everybody across the board I mean I

86
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:17,439
think cannabis in general like in

87
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:20,200
generally speaking works for pretty much

88
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:23,079
everybody but there are nuances to it

89
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:25,518
and certain people like uh stuff that's

90
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,000
sedative and some people like stimulants

91
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,759
well I would also add the method of

92
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,280
ingestion matters yeah uh how you can

93
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:34,598
assume it really affects your experience

94
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,400
and uh it's something that's really I

95
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:40,798
think under under discussed uh there's a

96
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:43,080
lot of localities and states that are

97
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,640
afraid of smoke they're afraid even of

98
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,799
vapor there they've outlawed any type of

99
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:49,399
com combustion and they they drive

100
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:52,000
everyone towards edibles but that's

101
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,560
there's a whole another issue with

102
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,639
Edibles that uh folks don't seem to

103
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,239
understand when your liver metabolizes

104
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:02,719
versus your bloodstream so right uh yeah

105
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:06,200
you can be more like tripping on acid uh

106
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:07,719
you hear the the the funnest or funniest

107
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:10,039
stories of people thinking they're

108
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:13,359
melting or dead I always go back to the

109
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:14,759
cop that called 911 telling them you

110
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,160
taken our class you'd have known better

111
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:20,879
but uh yeah uh that that it truly is uh

112
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,639
metabolized 11 hydroxy THC is is more

113
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:26,918
psychoactive yeah uh and and you really

114
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:28,720
it can melt you in that same way I feel

115
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:31,719
like it's stronger than LSD in a lot of

116
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,720
ways like for me person brownies it is

117
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,919
yeah well in in back in the day we

118
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,919
didn't really measure what we were

119
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:38,279
taking there wasn't like milligrams we

120
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:40,519
were like okay we're going to put this

121
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:44,159
much in this amount of butter high but

122
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:46,359
that's also I I dare say how we bred CBD

123
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,439
out of so many varietals is because

124
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:52,160
folks were passing around how high was

125
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:54,000
the measure and what was you know they

126
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,919
they' basically throw it away to

127
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,759
patients and patients are like holy [ __ ]

128
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:59,758
this is really helping me yeah and and

129
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,319
it wasn't until around 2007 when when we

130
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,639
finally started testing for it that it

131
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:05,560
was like oh oh there's this whole other

132
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:06,759
thing going on here that totally no one

133
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,120
understood and these are still

134
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:10,720
underground labs oh yeah well and then

135
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,959
Reggie Gino he's been on the show he

136
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,880
wrote the forward for my book so he kind

137
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:17,399
of paved the way for some of that stuff

138
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:20,240
and yeah it's really interesting testing

139
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:23,159
and and also the market in we're still

140
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,439
in uneducated Market in the whole of the

141
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,080
market I feel like it's getting there

142
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:29,879
it's getting better I see improvements

143
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:32,918
but as far as like we're still focused

144
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:34,360
on THC we're still focused on look you

145
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:37,000
know I'm excited for the day where we

146
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,360
can sell you the joint the pre-roll

147
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,639
where it's all pre-roll driven like

148
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,120
brands are pre-roll driven where you

149
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,280
don't even need to look at it it does it

150
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,800
make you feel good does it taste great

151
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:47,198
that those are the two important things

152
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,160
in my opinion because some of the best

153
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,160
stuff that gets overlooked it it's not

154
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,280
aesthetically pleasing some some of my

155
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,680
favorite things over the years have been

156
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:58,638
absolutely the ugliest strains oh let's

157
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,280
talk about Aesthetics shall we uh I

158
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,840
would love to jump on this bandwagon

159
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:05,638
especially uh before we turn this on you

160
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:08,399
said not not a lot of women join the

161
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:10,079
podcast and and I think uh there's

162
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:13,159
there's a few different things going on

163
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:17,198
with with looks and part of the problem

164
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:19,400
is just North American bias that what we

165
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,400
are accustomed to at least what we're

166
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:24,198
accustomed to saying looks good and is

167
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:26,038
worth money uh is is generally what

168
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:29,240
we're accustomed to seeing from NorCal

169
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:31,318
and those tight nugs in the jar uh but

170
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,400
that has to do with you know where it

171
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:35,639
was grown on the Earth where Northern

172
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:37,198
latitude and then folks go oh well I was

173
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:39,759
in the islands and it was all stringy

174
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,680
and ugly but wow it smoked nice I'm like

175
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,680
yeah that's cuz it's great quality

176
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,959
cannabis it just doesn't look like what

177
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:50,079
you're expecting and I think this the

178
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:54,000
same concept around like body image that

179
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:56,719
you had to be stick thin white tall

180
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,279
skinny to be beautiful for years and now

181
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,720
it's like you got booty that is

182
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:02,159
beautiful well it was always always

183
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,400
beautiful it's just what aesthetic are

184
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,840
you putting forward and what is most

185
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:07,878
familiar what are you seeing on the

186
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:10,239
magazines what are you seeing out there

187
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:11,240
as held up as beautiful and I think it's

188
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,680
just continuing to have the

189
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,240
conversations like you are about what

190
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,199
makes quality what makes the best

191
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,439
experience yeah it's all about defining

192
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,400
quality and and perspective and it's

193
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,598
like uh Instagram hasn't really been

194
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:26,439
helpful in that regard when is Instagram

195
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:28,000
ever help no it's it's it's so difficult

196
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:30,038
you know it's it's I have a LoveHate

197
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,279
relationship with Instagram and it's I'm

198
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:35,318
aun driver at best I yeah yeah it's

199
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:37,439
tough well and you know especially for

200
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:39,479
for cannabis and for flow you see the

201
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:41,639
stuff that looks amazing and most of the

202
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:42,918
stuff that looks really amazing and

203
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:45,158
especially the stuff that's super high

204
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:46,719
THC doesn't necessarily taste the best

205
00:07:45,158 --> 00:07:48,240
or give you the best effect in my

206
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,479
opinion you know everybody has their

207
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,360
opinion some people are chasing the high

208
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:53,839
and they want to get as high as possible

209
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,158
and flavor doesn't really matter they

210
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:58,560
just want to be high and that's okay too

211
00:07:56,158 --> 00:08:01,360
so it's all subjective to the individual

212
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:06,639
well but ironic Ally when you blind

213
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:09,400
taste test M the highest THC is not

214
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:12,478
usually the winner of what makes people

215
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:14,519
feel no it's the best and yeah and it's

216
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:17,038
not always the strongest that's you know

217
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:19,839
that's my point yeah tpin

218
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:21,360
flavonoids uh what's the new term for

219
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:23,399
abstract Tech I don't know if you saw

220
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,120
that the they so they just put out some

221
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:28,318
white papers I think six white papers

222
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,560
about basically fils and really

223
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,960
interesting I mean I think we've known

224
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,519
about THS I've known about THS since

225
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:35,958
2018 we've been reading about them and

226
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:38,240
their importance and you know that's

227
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:40,079
what gives you the gas and the skunk and

228
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,000
some of the offensive smells I really

229
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,038
like offensive smelling weed so it's

230
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,278
kind of like cilantro right it's either

231
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:50,278
soap or delicious exactly I feel that

232
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:52,399
way about diesel so like not so much I

233
00:08:50,278 --> 00:08:55,159
don't feel like licking a gas tank thank

234
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:58,000
you yeah yeah burnt Tire latex gloves

235
00:08:55,159 --> 00:09:00,600
you know no that yeah that chem smell no

236
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,399
it's but that yeah you you give me any

237
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,839
Haze and I will follow you to the ends

238
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:08,559
of the Earth so yeah it's and you know

239
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:10,760
bring that back to humans uh part of

240
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:12,359
what we've always taught your nose knows

241
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:14,200
yeah and what's remarkable is when we

242
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,278
break down the science and then start to

243
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:19,879
correlate that to the effects on what

244
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:21,240
are your symptoms you know not even what

245
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:23,838
what's the disease but just what are you

246
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,519
suffering from yeah uh and and we start

247
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:29,399
to to take a look at different things

248
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:31,078
and we the doctors that have now collect

249
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:32,399
hundreds and thousands of testimonials

250
00:09:31,078 --> 00:09:36,000
are starting to also see those

251
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:38,639
correlations where their nose Nos and

252
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,639
it's it is what is actually helping them

253
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:43,039
and that goes back to maybe why it

254
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:45,958
became about the numbers we no longer

255
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:48,319
have Apothecary style it's nearly

256
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:50,879
obsolete you can no longer go in and

257
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,839
sniff before you buy right it's really

258
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:53,919
sad so it's just and and now you also

259
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:56,440
you're not even allowed to package in a

260
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:58,759
lot of places so all you can say is the

261
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,079
label yeah that's it and so what do you

262
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:02,120
have to look at well the one thing

263
00:10:00,078 --> 00:10:04,479
you're familiar with what's the THC how

264
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,879
high or the brand name yeah cookies or

265
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,079
whatever well you're definitely paying

266
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:10,799
for the brand name in a lot of the

267
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:13,838
brands yeah and I think is it quality is

268
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:16,078
it consistency that is the question it's

269
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,839
hard state by state well and the thing

270
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:19,199
is is what's going to happen in a more

271
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,519
mature Market is we're going to start

272
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,640
trusting brands that we know and you go

273
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,799
bu you know from one company you buy

274
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,879
their brand three or four times and you

275
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:28,879
have a product you like you're going to

276
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:31,120
trust that company you're going to tell

277
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:33,399
their people about it and the next time

278
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,560
you go in as long as it maintains the

279
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,759
quality that you're looking for you know

280
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:38,638
and that's the future of the industry

281
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:40,399
too like that the trusted brand because

282
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,720
I think there's been a lot of Brands

283
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,360
where they're associated with the

284
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,720
celebrity or influencer driven and

285
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,240
that's still yeah and and that's still

286
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,200
okay but as long as it's paired with a

287
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,560
good product because you have one time

288
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,759
with a customer right if you if you have

289
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:55,199
you I'm not going to name any name

290
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:58,360
celebrity Brands but some of these guys

291
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,120
put out really [ __ ] in the beginning and

292
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,000
you know I think they learn their lesson

293
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,360
because you get your customer to buy it

294
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,278
once and maybe you have this big surch

295
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,159
in the beginning but they're not going

296
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:07,439
to buy the product again if it's garbage

297
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:09,480
especially not for the price you're

298
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,920
charging for your name no and the thing

299
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,278
is is after taxes people paying $65 for

300
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:16,838
an eighth and it's like if you're a real

301
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:19,278
smoker an eth doesn't go very far no so

302
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:21,160
no that doesn't fill is that an eth yeah

303
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:23,200
those are those are 3.5 Grandam joints

304
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:25,679
yeah just eyeballing in there yeah yeah

305
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,240
and it's like and I prefer the eighth

306
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:29,479
size joint and if you have really good

307
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,039
flour you smoke it down to the roach you

308
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,000
could put that out five or six times and

309
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:35,360
it's still going to taste good yeah so

310
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,320
and you that's my determining Factor

311
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,600
especially now when the I give flour out

312
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,000
to my friends because we're trying new

313
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,480
phenotypes they don't get the flour they

314
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,278
get joints so it's because it puts

315
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,519
everybody on the same playing field and

316
00:11:46,278 --> 00:11:50,120
then when you do that you get honest

317
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:52,360
feedback from people and I feel like

318
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,120
it's the feedback that I'm looking for

319
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,519
so it it's said you know you get one guy

320
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,600
who has a bong and one guy who has a

321
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,039
joint and one guy who does this or that

322
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,320
and he has a glass pipe and it's dirty

323
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:03,240
you you never know what you're going to

324
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,360
get as far as feedback so I feel like

325
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:08,000
it's a truer way to get honest feedback

326
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,959
well and it's also one of the safer ways

327
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,639
to consume cannabis yeah yeah well

328
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:14,559
depending on how you feel about germs

329
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:18,680
you know if you're sharing well no that

330
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:20,518
for you alone absolutely yeah yeah it's

331
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:22,679
h the puff puff pass has become

332
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:24,959
questionable at best yeah I mean

333
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:26,958
probably always was we're just a lot

334
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,958
more conscien I mean we used to get the

335
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:31,119
cup cough we'd go to Amsterdam and come

336
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:32,679
back with the c used to I just everyone

337
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,078
just came back from MJ biscon and

338
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:36,559
they're all telling me how sick they are

339
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:38,679
it's like yeah the they need more cold

340
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:40,198
plunging that's that's I feel like

341
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:43,000
stressing your body out is you know it's

342
00:12:40,198 --> 00:12:45,000
good for your immune system so some D3

343
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
yeah D3 is a great yeah I take a lot of

344
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,600
D3 so I also have Crohn's disease it's

345
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,720
been so Angela also has Crohn's yes but

346
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,399
I've cured my Crohn's through cannabis

347
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,720
and I believe cold plunging and I think

348
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:58,559
those two pieces are the determining

349
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:01,079
Factor um I was on biologics where I had

350
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,559
to give get injected with the drug every

351
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:05,519
two months I had to get an infusion in

352
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:08,479
my blood and I'm off that for it'll be a

353
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,198
year next week which is pretty amazing

359
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:23,198
oaksterdam what what have you guys been

360
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,399
up to lately oh my goodness what haven't

361
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:27,519
we been up to lately I'm so proud of my

362
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:32,720
team it is just it's phenomenal where do

363
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:34,240
I begin uh we just graduated a cohort in

364
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,360
the state of Connecticut so we were

365
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,519
hired by the state of Connecticut social

366
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,720
Equity Council a year ago and we uh got

367
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,919
to work actually a year and a half ago

368
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,839
uh and uh we had a cohort go through a

369
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:50,519
full-blown accelerator and this is the

370
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:52,560
first time a state has truly invested in

371
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:56,600
from beginning to end Soup To Nuts what

372
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:59,919
an operator needs to be a startup and

373
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:02,600
the fact that uh we were given the time

374
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:04,078
uh with each participant uh we got all

375
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,680
the way through from teaching the

376
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:07,638
business of cannabis and the supply

377
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:10,000
chain then we went into an

378
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:12,039
entrepreneurial coaching program where

379
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,360
we had professionals work with them to

380
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:16,198
build business plans then we worked with

381
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:20,039
arcview so it's kind of like having the

382
00:14:16,198 --> 00:14:21,679
Shark Tank uh coach before you go pitch

383
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:24,319
uh and then we brought a bunch of

384
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:26,679
investors together in Connecticut uh and

385
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,440
had our graduates pitch to real live

386
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:31,278
investors and in fact on the way here

387
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,959
I just got notice that one of our

388
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:38,278
participants just got funded so like

389
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:40,559
Soul Marine I'm con you wonderful I'm

390
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:43,480
over the moon uh just the the

391
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:45,239
opportunity to see them uh grow and

392
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:48,240
Thrive and

393
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:50,480
especially you know we had both 100%

394
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,159
owners where they were on their own solo

395
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,639
making it happen and we had some that

396
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:57,719
were partnered with msos and I got the

397
00:14:54,639 --> 00:15:00,720
chance to speak with one of the MSO

398
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,600
partners who just described the change

399
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,720
in that participant like you know they

400
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,240
were quiet in the room they had nothing

401
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,240
to say and by the time they were done

402
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,839
with this accelerator they were a true

403
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,759
partner in the business and not that

404
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,079
second class partner that so many social

405
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:18,480
Equity participants are relegated to and

406
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:19,919
true change is is happening so that's

407
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,199
awesome when you hear success stories

408
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,958
like that it's just you know and they're

409
00:15:22,198 --> 00:15:25,519
there there are there's a lot of success

410
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:27,119
stories and you know it's a tough time

411
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,799
in the industry so people need to hear

412
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,600
those kind of success stories I think

413
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:33,838
let me be your head of hope James I have

414
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,519
yes I have many uh and and we were

415
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,839
recently hired by the New Jersey

416
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,078
Economic Development Authority to do uh

417
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,959
not quite as Grand a program but to uh

418
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:44,120
to definitely help launch some of the

419
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:45,758
participants that are getting a grant uh

420
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,560
from the state uh we've been working

421
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:50,039
with the city of Los Angeles for over

422
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:51,638
three years now um working with the the

423
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:54,679
social Equity participants down there

424
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:56,919
and the City of Oakland uh Palm Springs

425
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:58,198
uh Monterey County The Growers out there

426
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:59,679
there's a couple of really phenomenal

427
00:15:58,198 --> 00:16:02,198
Growers that are managing to get

428
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:04,318
permanent licenses so helping Legacy

429
00:16:02,198 --> 00:16:06,559
secure their space in in the new

430
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:08,159
industry uh is also really gratifying

431
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:10,479
important it is so important these are

432
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:11,679
the shoulders we stand on yeah and it's

433
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,079
it's like they the people that help

434
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:16,278
build the industry are the people that

435
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:18,439
deserve a place here indeed I just I I

436
00:16:16,278 --> 00:16:20,159
can't talk about it enough I just you

437
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,560
know and coming from the Legacy market

438
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:24,399
and coming from the traditional side of

439
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:28,000
things you know it's like it's changed

440
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,679
so much in the last the the landscape

441
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,600
has changed so so much and the barrier

442
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:34,000
for entry has changed so much uh you

443
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:38,040
talked about New Jersey and that's a

444
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:41,120
that's a tough nut to crack as as far

445
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:42,559
as to get into that industry yeah it's

446
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,399
it's one of those ones if you hard than

447
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:47,198
New York yeah it's way harder than New

448
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:49,360
York they really limited the licenses

449
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:50,919
and you know and there's nothing wrong

450
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,720
with that I think limiting the licenses

451
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:55,000
is good to a degree but it's like

452
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,959
depending on how far you limit them but

453
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,519
uh you know I have mixed feelings about

454
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:00,599
New Jersey but I think New York is

455
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:02,399
really impressive and and we're all

456
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,920
learning from each other like Oregon

457
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,838
they they overdid it and they allowed

458
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:08,399
too many licenses and so there there's

459
00:17:06,838 --> 00:17:10,558
got to be a fine balance and you know

460
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,798
I'm not an expert on the subject but uh

461
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:15,119
I I just I have some experts on that

462
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,439
subject and there's a yeah there's

463
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,078
there's there's really there's

464
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:20,400
fascinating arguments and I think this

465
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:23,558
is you know go- go gadget federalism

466
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,559
this is the 10th Amendment at at at work

467
00:17:23,558 --> 00:17:28,000
uh and I'm I'm actually look up the

468
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:30,440
states act if you get the chance because

469
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,160
it just dropped yesterday the states act

470
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:36,038
2.0 uh to deschedule because right now

471
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:39,320
we're talking about uh rescheduling and

472
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:42,160
uh no no schedule three uh but you know

473
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:45,439
the the yeah the we could go off on so

474
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:48,240
many tangents James which way so we

475
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,798
definitely need I had Andrew D'Angelo

476
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,240
and we've had other guests on talking

477
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:55,798
about reschedule versus deschedule it I

478
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,919
am very anti- reschedule and I am very

479
00:17:55,798 --> 00:17:59,918
Pro deschedule completely we're going to

480
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,400
get along just fine yeah I I can't even

481
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,600
imagine trying to reschedule at this

482
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,679
point I it's not right um there wrong if

483
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:07,959
you work with the pharmaceutical

484
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,519
industry maybe yeah it's like let's res

485
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,400
mean the ones that have been paying

486
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:13,400
millions and billions to keep it illegal

487
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,240
while they furiously study how to make

488
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,720
money off it yeah and it's well can we

489
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,200
walk in chum at the same time listen it

490
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,480
needs to be pharmaceutical IED we need

491
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,038
to be able to utilize this in medicine

492
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,880
and doctors and nurses need to be able

493
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:27,919
to call up you know 10 cc's of whatever

494
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,760
for folks that are suffering through

495
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:33,038
radiation chemotherapy whatever that is

496
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:35,798
uh we definitely need to find ways for

497
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:40,000
the FDA like let's legalize researching

498
00:18:35,798 --> 00:18:41,359
would do that uh and and decriminalizing

499
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,519
and that's the other half of this is

500
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:47,678
just taking the teeth out of the

501
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:50,879
criminality uh and at this point um I

502
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:53,759
have folks argue of of like it's just a

503
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,240
softer gentler prohibition yeah and and

504
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:57,400
it's like but but I think a lot of

505
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:59,000
people are condition you know I we had

506
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,000
Brandon from inh House genetics and he

507
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,279
said it really best is like people are

508
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,720
like well schedule 3 is better than

509
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:07,240
schedule one and it's like is it really

510
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:10,038
you know and he he argued the fact and

511
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,200
he agrees 100% it's like it's it's not

512
00:19:10,038 --> 00:19:13,359
and there's a lot of people are saying

513
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,000
well it's not schedule one but that's

514
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:16,079
true but is it better no I don't think

515
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,119
it's I don't think we understand the

516
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:20,918
ramifications of USDA and FDA and and

517
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:24,158
the the folks mucking around and not

518
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:26,038
letting who's doing it keep doing it

519
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:27,559
yeah yeah well and these are all

520
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:29,480
difficult conversations and things that

521
00:19:27,558 --> 00:19:31,798
need to be talked openly and we need to

522
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,200
have some hard conversations about

523
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:34,918
really what are we looking for out of

524
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,558
this stuff you know and who are we

525
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:40,200
supporting by saying that schedule three

526
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:43,119
is okay so indeed and you know full full

527
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,279
disclosure I I sit on a committee with

528
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:47,479
with several folks that that have these

529
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:51,480
conversations with uh law enforcement

530
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:53,558
Action Partnership leap uh uh she's

531
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,038
actually on our board as well the

532
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:58,399
executive director Diane Goldstein um

533
00:19:56,038 --> 00:20:00,558
and and we also Americans for Prosperity

534
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:04,120
it uh reason there are several groups

535
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:06,359
that uh have these conversations and

536
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:08,879
again we can go back to the

537
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:11,959
pharmaceuticalization of of the various

538
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,840
medicinal aspects and research but we

539
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:16,240
need to start from a

540
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:18,599
deschedule uh footing it needs to be

541
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,120
removed from the drug enforcement agency

542
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:23,279
and the controlled sub Substances Act uh

543
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:26,839
first and foremost and I don't fault the

544
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:28,798
folks that are willing to settle I'm not

545
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:30,798
right I'm not willing to take that trade

546
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:34,158
I'm not willing to trust it no it

547
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:35,879
through through actions and a stack of

548
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,440
evidence we have a lot of reason not to

549
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:41,039
trust it indeed and and that's why I I

550
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,558
keep mentioning the states act 2.0 is

551
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:45,400
because what we also need is an

552
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:48,000
alternative to point2 yeah and right now

553
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:50,798
to have the rescheduling schedule three

554
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,359
on the table without a what else it just

555
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:56,038
becomes a yes no and what we need is an

556
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:59,479
also and and an option and the state's

557
00:20:56,038 --> 00:21:01,759
act 2.0 offers the option of

558
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:04,360
descheduling and it's not going to be

559
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:07,400
you know a a flip that a switch that

560
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:10,399
flips overnight we're talking about uh a

561
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:13,320
a slow painful process uh that also has

562
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,798
to happen in nearly every state or or

563
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:16,678
Commonwealth in the nation there's I

564
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:18,599
think Virginia didn't adopt the failed

565
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:20,400
federal policy schedule everybody else

566
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:23,000
has a lot of work to do uh state by

567
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,480
state as well um so this is it's not

568
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,798
going to happen overnight but nothing

569
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:31,159
good ever does no it's not

570
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:33,158
indeed so let's take a step back and

571
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:35,159
talk about Oaker Dam University and how

572
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:38,520
you got involved with Oaker Dam and

573
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:41,799
where the start came about well the the

574
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:44,599
area named oaksterdam uh Oakland and

575
00:21:41,798 --> 00:21:47,839
Amsterdam was really founded by my

576
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:50,798
husband Jeff Jones and he was the first

577
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:53,639
to work with the city of Oakland he was

578
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:55,558
permitted uh and and helped dispense

579
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,080
medical cannabis to the necessity

580
00:21:55,558 --> 00:21:59,678
patients back in the 90s he actually

581
00:21:57,079 --> 00:22:01,240
started before the law was passed um and

582
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:04,159
and worked you know he sat at the feet

583
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:07,720
of Dennis Peron and and learned uh many

584
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:11,400
things and decided to go the route of a

585
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:14,360
a a medical cannabis dispensary versus a

586
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:16,038
club yeah that uh he he really wanted to

587
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:18,119
take on the mantle that would be

588
00:22:16,038 --> 00:22:20,759
adoptable in South Dakota where he was

589
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:23,000
from and and where he lost his dad uh he

590
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:26,359
was frustrated by the Clinton

591
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,679
Administration uh wound up um winning in

592
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:32,119
the ninth circuit so it was legal I have

593
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:34,880
a picture of him uh handing a legal bag

594
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:37,239
of cannabis to a medical patient uh he

595
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,120
was legal for about six weeks before the

596
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,798
stay that took him to the Supreme Court

597
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:43,879
and the battle that that took over his

598
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:46,440
life uh his grower who he had moved out

599
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:48,000
from Texas named Richard Lee uh went

600
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,400
ahead and picked up the permit and

601
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,519
picked up the mantle and it was Richard

602
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,278
who founded oaksterdam University in

603
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:57,038
2007 now I was a fly on the wall uh just

604
00:22:55,278 --> 00:22:58,319
starting to date Mr Jones falling in

605
00:22:57,038 --> 00:23:00,640
love with both of them at the the same

606
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:02,480
time this the oaksterdam concept of a

607
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,520
school because I come from a corporate

608
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,360
training background and and just uh

609
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:09,400
vocational adult learning helping people

610
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:12,119
be the best them that they can be and

611
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:14,600
the uh the school I when I first started

612
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:16,000
I came in working with doctors so I

613
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:17,599
immediately looked for well where's the

614
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,960
education what do you mean there isn't

615
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:24,240
any yeah so the only Educators I found

616
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:26,720
were well it they all worked with Jeff

617
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,599
uh because he was the one that was

618
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,000
trying to teach patients

619
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:33,639
um how to be safe and responsible how to

620
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:37,278
find medicine and uh while he couldn't

621
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:39,960
dispense it himself uh and I started

622
00:23:37,278 --> 00:23:44,400
volunteering um I showed up to the first

623
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:46,440
class in LA to help make coffee and um

624
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,120
again just the fly on the wall I was

625
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,240
obsessed with the concept of training

626
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:52,879
but because I worked with doctors I

627
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:56,240
would have been the bridge to ating and

628
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,640
a betting a felony um so crazy I

629
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,759
couldn't yeah I couldn't like put my

630
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:02,400
name on anything because I I was

631
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:04,319
representing them uh the doctor though

632
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:08,840
uh that was supposed to teach that day

633
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:11,158
got lost in Compton and oh man the yeah

634
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:13,399
uh he was fine but the long and short of

635
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:15,559
it was they didn't have a teacher and so

636
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,120
the facilitator ran up and said hey do

637
00:24:15,558 --> 00:24:18,639
you think you work with patients do you

638
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:20,319
think you could cover this material and

639
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,360
I looked at it and it was almost

640
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:25,839
verbatim What I talked to patients and

641
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:28,839
doctors about like sure I can do that

642
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:32,119
never missed a class uh replaced myself

643
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:34,079
at the doctor's office and became uh

644
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:37,678
Chancellor of LA and then eventually uh

645
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:39,960
got involved with a campaign that I

646
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,960
accidentally became the spokeswoman of

647
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,000
um I say that because I kept thinking I

648
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,720
was going to go back to Corporate

649
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,359
America I wasn't ready to come out I was

650
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,640
just behind the scenes you know prodding

651
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:51,079
everybody else to do it right uh but

652
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,120
there was nobody else to do it and um

653
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:56,000
when Richard decided to put his money

654
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:58,959
where his mouth was and pay for the

655
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,079
first legalization campaign in 30 years

656
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:05,720
um the the first elected official That

657
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:09,960
was supposed to show up um was suffering

658
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:11,159
from his chemo treatments and frankly

659
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,399
the voter initiative would have been

660
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:16,600
Dead on Arrival and so I said well do we

661
00:25:14,398 --> 00:25:18,239
have what he was gonna say can't you

662
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:21,359
know half of this is print media anyway

663
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:24,759
just read it they're like okay read it

664
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:26,839
I'm like no not me right so as they

665
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:29,440
shoved me from behind in front of a bank

666
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:31,879
of cameras for my first uh full-blown

667
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,360
press conference um suddenly I was the

668
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:36,320
spokeswoman for the pr 19 campaign yeah

669
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:38,398
and uh and then I became the legislative

670
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:39,839
leaz on and the community leaz on

671
00:25:38,398 --> 00:25:41,959
because we were just a small rag tiag

672
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:44,519
group of rebels just trying to make a

673
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:46,120
point and then suddenly we were winning

674
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:48,200
and then then the next thing we know

675
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:49,798
everyone's you know they start taking

676
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:53,558
you seriously when you're at you know

677
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:56,720
54% in the polls you're a threat uh so

678
00:25:53,558 --> 00:25:59,359
we got not one but two October surprises

679
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:02,759
um we had the Governor Schwarzenegger

680
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:04,079
signed the well it was uh vetoed four

681
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:06,079
times it was the largest

682
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:09,798
decriminalization measure in history for

683
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:12,119
California and the result of that was

684
00:26:09,798 --> 00:26:13,960
87% James that's nine out of 10 people

685
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:15,359
that didn't go to jail the very next

686
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,679
year because we pressured him into

687
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:18,759
signing that DM measure here in

688
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:20,440
California and more effective than any

689
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:22,720
other state that just legalized because

690
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:25,399
they only legalized for 21 and up we

691
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,839
decriminalized for everyone and so that

692
00:26:25,398 --> 00:26:31,079
was the biggest win um the second was

693
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:33,199
just sparking the conversation and the

694
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:35,439
debate internationally because we were

695
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,798
the only thing to talk about in 2010

696
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:41,480
yeah so while we had every living DEA uh

697
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:45,599
every living drugs are and the president

698
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:48,278
of the no on campaign was our our former

699
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:51,000
um Senator Diane Feinstein and our

700
00:26:48,278 --> 00:26:53,119
current vice president KLA Harris wrote

701
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,119
The Ballot argument against us I mean

702
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:58,558
these are the good old days my friend oh

703
00:26:55,119 --> 00:27:03,000
yeah uh that uh we we really did um our

704
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:06,200
Coalition of NAACP and unions and

705
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,359
doctors and environmentalists and yes

706
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,558
Legacy people went on to change the law

707
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:13,359
in a lot of these other states and I

708
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:16,119
cannot say enough about our students who

709
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:19,119
are it's not the secret to Our Success I

710
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:22,038
shout it from the rooftops they are um

711
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:23,879
behind the success of so much change

712
00:27:22,038 --> 00:27:26,000
because we taught them advocacy and it

713
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,278
was them that went out to their neck of

714
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,398
the woods and changed the law from city

715
00:27:28,278 --> 00:27:33,798
council to state to Nation whether it's

716
00:27:31,398 --> 00:27:35,839
Germany we're we're seeing changes in

717
00:27:33,798 --> 00:27:39,798
Thailand and and then I get emails for

718
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:42,839
my students it's like oh my that was you

719
00:27:39,798 --> 00:27:44,960
like that was us holy crap pretty wild

720
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:47,038
we really have changed the world yeah

721
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,759
it's mindblowing well pioneering

722
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:50,278
education and then you know the

723
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:52,519
influence from all the students that

724
00:27:50,278 --> 00:27:54,558
have come through it's just amazing and

725
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:55,960
you know you guys were kind of the

726
00:27:54,558 --> 00:27:57,798
gateway to the industry for a lot of

727
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:00,919
people yeah and we were willing to let

728
00:27:57,798 --> 00:28:03,119
the cameras in yeah and I look back just

729
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:06,278
how bananas like

730
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:07,759
so oh the stories I can tell um but

731
00:28:06,278 --> 00:28:10,759
letting the cameras in I think was

732
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:12,640
really important and then also just

733
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:15,200
seeing a dude in a wheelchair and a

734
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,759
pregnant redhead of you know like that's

735
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,919
oh that's not that scary drug dealer in

736
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:21,240
the corner you knowt like wait a minute

737
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:23,559
who who's that and you know people make

738
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:26,359
fun of chich and Chong and you know I'm

739
00:28:23,558 --> 00:28:28,879
certainly guilty of that uh having met

740
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:31,119
Tommy several times now I realize how

741
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,679
intentional he was to always portray

742
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:35,678
cannabis in positive light I knew that

743
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,960
he was an intelligent and Brilliant

744
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:40,200
writer and comic but I didn't understand

745
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:43,558
the intentionality of like yeah it was

746
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:45,840
dumb fun but it was never evil or scary

747
00:28:43,558 --> 00:28:48,398
or dangerous it was always fun and

748
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:50,119
uplifting and funny uh but the only

749
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:52,759
folks that were willing to come out were

750
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:55,079
the ones that you know your mama didn't

751
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:57,200
want you to grow up to be like yeah and

752
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:58,960
so it wasn't that you know cannabis made

753
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,278
you stupid it was just stupid people

754
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,399
enjoy cannabis and they were the ones

755
00:29:00,278 --> 00:29:05,679
willing to talk about it out loud and

756
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:07,959
get busted right uh and so I we stupid

757
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:10,240
or crazy it's hard to say but it really

758
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:12,600
took folks that just like look look like

759
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,440
Middle America that were not we not

760
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:16,759
scary we're just like to normalize it

761
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:18,480
yeah and destigmatize yeah and it's

762
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:19,798
funny how normalized it's become it

763
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,079
still has a long ways to go in some

764
00:29:19,798 --> 00:29:26,158
regards but oh we're not no but but I

765
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:29,639
feel like Sanjay gupa did a lot when he

766
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:32,120
went on 60 Minutes and said that uh kids

767
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,799
that have seizures have now been cured

768
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:36,199
from their seizures or they've had a lot

769
00:29:33,798 --> 00:29:38,240
less seizures from CBD he's an amazing

770
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:41,159
example of evolution he also by the way

771
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:44,319
came out against Pro 19 uh and and you

772
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:47,320
know little Charlotte Fiji was changed

773
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:49,720
his life and ours um across the board

774
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:52,558

778
00:29:56,359 --> 00:30:01,398

00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:10,879
and the ability to have that

782
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:12,158
conversation on CNN the ability you know

783
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,080
I didn't tell my friends at the time but

784
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:17,039
the ability to go talk about it on Fox

785
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:19,439
all the time yeah you know that's that's

786
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:22,319
half of America and if you've got

787

steuart Varney talking about the money

788

789
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,840
Wall Street not just K Street um and and

790
00:30:28,278 --> 00:30:31,919
we've already convinced I think Main

791
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:34,599
Street in most

792
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,519
places he was our troan horse he was the

793
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:38,158
voice for all of us in some regards you

794
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:40,960
know and it's like telling my parents

795
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:44,278
all these years that cannabis isn't bad

796
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,960
and them kind of arguing with me and you

797
00:30:44,278 --> 00:30:48,319
know I I think after seeing that they

798
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:50,720
completely changed like that one

799
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:52,759
60-minute episode like literally an hour

800
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,079
changed lives of so many people because

801
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:57,759
you can't argue when you have kids you

802
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:59,678
know it's like you can't argue that

803
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:01,158
people need you know they should have

804
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,120
the right as long as it's not hurting

805
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:05,960
them to do whatever they want to make

806
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:09,239
them better I and How brave are

807
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:11,319
Charlotte's parents and and she also

808
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:14,440
passed in 2020 a lot of people don't

809
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:17,278
realize that um her parents you know

810
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:20,080
risked losing her and this is a threat

811
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:21,558
still everywhere even here in California

812
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:23,398
people are still losing their children

813
00:31:21,558 --> 00:31:26,038
over cannabis they're still splitting up

814
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:28,038
families and it's sick it's it's really

815
00:31:26,038 --> 00:31:29,679
it's sick like they that you could do

816
00:31:28,038 --> 00:31:32,319
that and or that you have to go to some

817
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:34,440
other state to save the life of your kid

818
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:36,079
exactly that you are a medical Refugee

819
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,558
we're not even going to get abortions or

820
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:39,240
anything like that that that's a whole

821
00:31:37,558 --> 00:31:41,839
another shitty conversation but it's

822
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:43,319
like these laws and you know I have my

823
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:44,638
own opinion other people that watch the

824
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:46,599
show you have an opinion and there's

825
00:31:44,638 --> 00:31:49,638
nothing wrong with that but

826
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:52,000
like when it comes to your kids

827
00:31:49,638 --> 00:31:55,079
especially like I I don't understand how

828
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,880
we can do that so and for our pro-life

829
00:31:55,079 --> 00:32:00,000
friends I I have the argument that if

830
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:03,159
you are pro-life then you had better be

831
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,960
Pro cannabis uh because because Pro

832
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:07,880
cannabis is pro-life and and for the

833
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:10,519
rest of us yes we just uh hope to to

834
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:13,399
have the freedom uh if we need medical

835
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:15,960
attention right yeah yeah at the end of

836
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:17,599
the day it's about freedom and this is

837
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,278
the conversation across the board it's

838
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:21,519
the freedom to be able to protect

839
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:23,398
yourself with the Second Amendment uh

840
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:25,638
which also has been stripped from

841
00:32:23,398 --> 00:32:27,439
Cannabis consumers you know there's just

842
00:32:25,638 --> 00:32:30,158
about every amendment in the first have

843
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:33,399
been subjugated by the War on Drugs by

844
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:36,200
prohibition and you know these are these

845
00:32:33,398 --> 00:32:38,959
are largely the people we serve we've

846
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:41,080
we've always taught it's I can't even

847
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,399
believe some of the the titans of the

848
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:45,720
industry but the the ones that I choose

849
00:32:43,398 --> 00:32:48,239
to talk about most often tend to be

850
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:50,558
those that uh were Justice involved that

851
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:53,159
did spend time in jail you know the king

852
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:54,319
of weed on hate Street uh you know he's

853
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:56,799
always been the king of weed on hate

854
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:58,839
Street for like 30 years now uh and Sean

855
00:32:56,798 --> 00:33:01,720
rich Rich has has has been there doing

856
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:05,480
it uh now he's the legal king of weed on

857
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:08,519
hate Street and we get the asterisk at

858
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:09,839
oan line and now he's balling man I mean

859
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:12,720
people are paying him just to be on

860
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:15,480
their boards like it's his experience is

861
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,558
far beyond Legacy his experience now is

862
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:20,399
in the boardroom uh not just the

863
00:33:17,558 --> 00:33:21,798
courtroom so he's he's really you know

864
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,239
and it's there's so many firsts that

865
00:33:21,798 --> 00:33:26,119
have come through and that are yet to

866
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,120
come because there are states that

867
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:31,638
aren't there yet businesses yet to be

868
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:33,879
founded um and it's you know there's

869
00:33:31,638 --> 00:33:35,519
this is the argument for maybe free

870
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:38,360
market is there's yals that should get

871
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:41,798
the hell out too um and the free market

872
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:43,158
pushes out often those that uh are less

873
00:33:41,798 --> 00:33:46,638
than I just had a conversation with

874
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:48,880
someone from Oregon uh saying it rocks

875
00:33:46,638 --> 00:33:51,240
because the you know the losers get out

876
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:54,000
yeah I you know you can having that low

877
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:56,319
barrier to entry uh is is one of the

878
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,599
best equalizers out there and so you

879
00:33:56,319 --> 00:34:01,158
look to Oklahoma

880
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:04,398
and it's you know just organically more

881
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:08,000
Equitable because there are no barriers

882
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:11,559
to entry now are they all good operators

883
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,280
no absolutely not no there should be

884
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:17,159
standards there should be training there

885
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:19,760
should be more better yes MOA MOA yeah

886
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:21,320
for sure like in Oregon it's a perfect

887
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,240
example but it's so competitive in

888
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,838
Oregon and that the price is so cheap

889
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:27,000
and then nobody wants to pay the higher

890
00:34:24,838 --> 00:34:28,878
price for the the product yeah and I

891
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,838
wouldn't say nobody because you know you

892
00:34:28,878 --> 00:34:32,639
got you always got the folks that just

893
00:34:30,838 --> 00:34:34,639
want to show how much they paid for a

894
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,440
product yeah and I'm all about the

895
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,559
quality so at the end of the day like I

896
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,918
I don't I don't really I don't shouldn't

897
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:41,599
say that I don't care what it costs

898
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:43,319
because I think cost is important for

899
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,679
people but for me it's about an

900
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,200
experience a lot of times and I I'll pay

901
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,639
something more for a special experience

902
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,439
and I I might not smoke that all the

903
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,200
time but I'm all about I'm chasing that

904
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,599
experience yeah you know there's guys

905
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:56,078
chasing the dragon they want to get as

906
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:58,320
high as they can flavor Chasers and I

907
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:00,160
chase the flavor to but I feel like I'm

908
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,640
I'm chasing that experience and I'm I'm

909
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:03,480
trying to find something new always

910
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:04,838
trying to find something new is and that

911
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,039
kind of goes along with

912
00:35:04,838 --> 00:35:08,920
breeding you know so like we're looking

913
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:10,679
for that new gem something that's

914
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,079
slightly different or completely

915
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:13,639
different I want I would love to find

916
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:16,720
something that's completely different

917
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:20,000
show me some uh you know some green tea

918
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:23,118
flavor or some red bean ice cream yeah

919
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,559
soing like a trino hunter yeah I'm I was

920
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:28,119
looking for weird stuff but so what have

921
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:30,440
you seen as far as like uh as far as new

922
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:33,599
genetics and new new flavors you you

923
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:34,960
love sativas and you love that stimulant

924
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,519
for it for the effect but also the

925
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,920
flavor I see yeah it's I I'll just say I

926
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:42,599
trust my nose it's hard to say um you

927
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:46,280
know I I am awful with these

928
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:48,519
conversations because I married a grower

929
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:52,400
and so whenever folks ask me like what's

930
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:55,719
my favorite um Mr Jones

931
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:57,639
finest what whatever he's doing uh is

932
00:35:55,719 --> 00:36:00,000
got right now yeah

933
00:35:57,639 --> 00:36:02,598
um he did finally after years of of

934
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,960
looking um he found a haze and we just

935
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:07,640
have a small garden we're not you know

936
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,318
this which everybody should have yeah

937
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:11,519
this is you know next to the tomatoes

938
00:36:09,318 --> 00:36:14,800
and the basil Abol and we've got

939
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:17,358
chickens too so we get the yeah uh but

940
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,880
the yeah it's uh it just takes so damn

941
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:20,838
long that you can't find it on the

942
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,599
market is the problem because like the

943
00:36:20,838 --> 00:36:26,199
super silver haze it's if if you can

944
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:28,480
turn over this many crops in a year

945
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:30,159
versus this many crops in a year you

946
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,318
know it's it's you know three to five is

947
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:34,480
a huge difference on to pull the money

948
00:36:32,318 --> 00:36:37,279
out of it eight and a half week super

949
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:39,440
silver so it's really good I'm sorry

950
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,280
yeah so I'll talk to Jeff about that one

951
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,159
one more time yeah it's a short

952
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,720
flowering super silver we and a cross

953
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:48,679
bread with with a uh go ahead it's just

954
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:49,838
a short flowering version it's good okay

955
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:51,799
it's really good but there's you know

956
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:53,078
and then there's all kinds of stuff out

957
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,318
there I think there's some really good

958
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:56,480
hazes that are is a cross with an

959
00:36:54,318 --> 00:36:58,679
Autoflower or was it is it I don't know

960
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,599
no it's good it's really good it just

961

mean so and then people have gone

963
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:05,719
through a lot of things to find stuff

964
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:08,358
like that I'm sure it's crossed with

965

00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,800
back to some Classics though like the

973
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:25,719
piff and the Cuban black I've been

974
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,359
enjoying those quite a bit lately but

975
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:28,919
yeah I I enjoy a little bit of

976
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:31,039
everything so I like some stuff to wake

977
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,318
me up and I like some stuff to make me

978
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:34,279
tired and I'm always looking for

979
00:37:32,318 --> 00:37:36,599
something different but yeah no and we

980
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:38,760
enjoy salads I think that's also the the

981
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:40,800
bigger reason that I struggle on you

982
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:42,760
know what's my favorite because we we

983
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:46,000
like to blend it's just a better

984
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:49,280
experience uh overall over time and yeah

985
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,639
it's uh the the good news is is he is so

986
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:56,200
good at what he does um and he is your

987
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:58,960
horiculture faculty not me so we uh well

988
00:37:56,199 --> 00:38:01,480
we have several uh Joey oretta uh has

989
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,039
been uh just worldwide at this point

990
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,400
it's it's phenomenal the folks that

991
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:06,880
started you know just coming into our

992
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:10,000
classroom and teaching people how to

993
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:12,760
grow or now Masters of the Universe it's

994
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,159
it's phenomenal yeah well and it's a

995
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:16,160
repetition thing too like learning how

996
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:18,519
to grow and I [ __ ] it up oh am I

997
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:20,239
allowed to curse C you can [ __ ] it up

998
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:22,159
all you want already did it's too late

999
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:24,879
for that you can totally curse on the

1000
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:26,879
show we we appreciate cursing it's okay

1001
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,358
but yeah I think and that goes for

1002
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,280
everything in life you should [ __ ] it up

1003
00:38:28,358 --> 00:38:32,598
a bunch like figure it out do experiment

1004
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,839
you got to [ __ ] it up and then get back

1005
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:37,440
up you really learn who you are in the

1006
00:38:34,838 --> 00:38:39,358
grow room outside the grow room uh by

1007
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,838
making mistakes and I've made plenty of

1008
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:43,279
mistakes I've made mistakes my whole

1009
00:38:40,838 --> 00:38:45,239
life and learned from them especially

1010
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,960
growing and making seeds you know it's

1011
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:48,519
like I've made seeds where I didn't have

1012
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,000
pollen ready and my reversals didn't

1013
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:52,880
work and screwed up everything well and

1014
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,440
what I try to share you know with my

1015
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,318
kids with my class is just you know try

1016
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:01,039
not to make the same mistake over it

1017
00:38:57,318 --> 00:39:02,679
make new fresh mistakes each time yeah

1018
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:04,838
as as a chef I would allow people to

1019
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:06,440
make mistakes one time you know you make

1020
00:39:04,838 --> 00:39:07,719
the mistake one time oh you can make

1021
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,559
different mistakes that's okay that's

1022
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:11,639
part of the learning process exactly and

1023
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:13,480
I think with cannabis and with

1024
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:14,639
cultivation it's really good to make

1025
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,519
mistakes because if you never make

1026
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:18,039
mistakes you never learn because that's

1027
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:20,639
that's the best way to learn is to screw

1028
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:22,759
stuff up indeed and making room for that

1029
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:24,519
is is important and coming from

1030
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:27,280
hospitality and working with a multitude

1031
00:39:24,519 --> 00:39:30,039
of chefs uh I know you now yeah all

1032
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,800
right I see

1033
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:35,880
yeah but yeah the whole Chef mentality

1034
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:38,119
and it's like uh get the job plus also

1035
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:39,960
you got you have to have your stuff in

1036
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:41,480
place everything in its place and I

1037
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,838
think that's super important to be

1038
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:46,318
prepared whether it's scheduling

1039
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:47,679
scheduling is important but also do you

1040
00:39:46,318 --> 00:39:49,318
have all the things on hand that you're

1041
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:50,919
going to need today or do you have to go

1042
00:39:49,318 --> 00:39:52,759
three times to the grow shop to get what

1043
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,920
you need you know it's all proper

1044
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:56,200
planning and and if you start applying

1045
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:58,720
those things to life your life's going

1046
00:39:56,199 --> 00:40:00,439
to be become much easier indeed it's uh

1047
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:02,279
I've gotten in the habit of of like

1048
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,800
asking each day when I'm looking at my

1049
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,599
schedule and what I'm doing am I moving

1050
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:08,400
myself closer to my goals or further

1051
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:11,640
away yeah uh because it is really what

1052
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:14,519
you do that cumulatively turns out as

1053
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:16,239
your life yeah those little choices

1054
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:17,920
really add up yeah and what you do

1055
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:20,318
throughout the day is what you do all

1056
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,119
the time you know like it it everything

1057
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:23,838
is so repetition based I think for most

1058
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:26,640
of us if you're lazy part of the time

1059
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:28,400
you're lazy all the time in my opinion

1060
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:31,199
yeah and but then how do you also break

1061
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:34,920
out of your own because as much as

1062
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:38,239
repetition is is vital how do you also

1063
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:41,119
break out of your own habits you know I

1064
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:45,239
I talk about to do this every day this

1065
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:48,318
industry is hard yeah I mean at Capital

1066
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:50,479
H it is so difficult it gets harder

1067
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:52,679
every day uh for new and different

1068
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:55,599
reasons um and even just what's going to

1069
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:59,118
happen next week uh with with the FED

1070
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:02,200
just every yeah it's it's so tumultuous

1071
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:04,680
and being able to both enjoy change take

1072
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:07,759
it as you stress versus distress and you

1073
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:09,799
know be able to stay Dynamic uh but I

1074
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:13,280
try to like how do you get out of bed

1075
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:15,560
every day and and keep it not not just

1076
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,440
on the days you feel inspired days you

1077
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:20,559
don't well I got a little secret it's uh

1078
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:23,358
put one foot in front of the other yeah

1079
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:25,639
right and that's it's tenacity and you

1080
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:27,078
know there's day yeah it's doing stuff

1081
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:29,159
on the days that you don't want to do it

1082
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:32,200
that's what'll kind of Define you you

1083
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:34,399
know what I what I tell people is that I

1084
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:35,838
I don't only get up that day but I get

1085
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,000
up at 4 in the morning that day and what

1086
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:40,799
is your competition doing yeah and it's

1087
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,719
the days you don't want to do it exactly

1088
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:45,240
yeah exactly and I think it's just it's

1089
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:46,598
it's a lot about discipline but it's

1090
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:47,919
like doing stuff that you don't want to

1091
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:49,559
do that's like cold plunge is the

1092
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,480
perfect example I don't really going to

1093
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:53,799
bed at eight and going to bed at well I

1094
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,920
wish I went to bed at 8 well I go to bed

1095
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:58,640
at 8 I just get cranky after 8 cuz I get

1096
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,519
up at for yeah right yeah and well and

1097
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:02,799
we need our sleep that's something that

1098
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:04,719
I I appreciate sleep a lot more than I

1099
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,000
used to well and it's what is in your

1100
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:07,598
control and that's what I finally

1101
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,400
realized a few years ago and I think it

1102
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,240
was actually Ariana Huffington that made

1103
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:13,000
it okay to talk about but you know I

1104
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:16,159
used to pride myself on how much work

1105
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
and how little sleep and and I realized

1106
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:21,519
like at a certain point never mind

1107
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,480
having a family and needing to find some

1108
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:25,599
trade-offs but are you putting yourself

1109
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:27,358
in an early grade like for whom where

1110
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:29,119
who's going to build a [ __ ] statue

1111
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:31,558
like what are you do so the one thing I

1112
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:33,559
can control is how I eat and if I sleep

1113
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:34,839
and so yeah I try to well and we all

1114
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:37,440
need different amounts of sleep I think

1115
00:42:34,838 --> 00:42:39,440
to a degree but sleep is super important

1116
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,039
and quality sleep is more important than

1117
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,760
sleep in my opinion yeah what do they

1118
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:44,800
say you're only at 70% if you don't get

1119
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:47,359
enough yeah yeah so you just walk around

1120
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,800
a dumbass all day yeah yeah totally I

1121
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:51,519
don't want to be an idiot or an [ __ ]

1122
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,519
so I try to get enough sleep yeah and

1123
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:55,159
yeah for sure sleep is so important so

1124
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:57,599
let that

1125
00:42:55,159 --> 00:42:59,159
be smoke too I used to smoke right

1126
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,960
before I go to bed and I don't do that

1127
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:03,358
anymore you know what I just discovered

1128
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,119
I'm gonna out myself right now because

1129
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:06,719
you know I've been I taught the damn

1130
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:09,680
science class like this methods of

1131
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:12,118
ingestion is my jam and um the science

1132
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:15,358
of cannabis and why this works but I

1133
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:16,440
could never consume Edibles like I would

1134
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:19,719
it was just

1135
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:23,039
like done like it could be you know

1136
00:43:19,719 --> 00:43:25,838
Saturday morning ready to go and just

1137
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:28,920
I'm ready for a nap if if you even like

1138
00:43:25,838 --> 00:43:31,719
wait edible under my nose kind of thing

1139
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:35,079
uh and yet I suffer from insomnia of the

1140
00:43:31,719 --> 00:43:38,879
worst degree and I just finally figured

1141
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:41,240
out Edibles for sleeping uh is it like

1142
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,640
two and a half milligrams uh yeah I oh a

1143
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:46,358
little itty bitty like whatever edible

1144
00:43:43,639 --> 00:43:48,440
whatever little Gummy it takes me like

1145
00:43:46,358 --> 00:43:50,880
five days if I just kind of gnaw little

1146
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:53,039
it little that and that was it is I just

1147
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,960
I was having too much and it yeah I'm

1148
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:56,759
the same way I'm AB so I did well you

1149
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,599
know how I learned it was Delta so

1150
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:00,160
delta8 when I was because I I go through

1151
00:43:58,599 --> 00:44:02,200
insomnia bouts and I'm sleeping really

1152
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:04,318
well right now but for me it's like

1153
00:44:02,199 --> 00:44:07,318
exercise Cal plunge all these things by

1154
00:44:04,318 --> 00:44:09,960
the time yeah I don't sleep as much as I

1155
00:44:07,318 --> 00:44:12,800
probably should but I sleep really good

1156
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:14,000
like when I sleep I sleep but if I am

1157
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,559
going to take a sleeping pill I was

1158
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,559
taking Delta eights but really Delta

1159
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:21,720
eight is just 20% strength of Delta 9

1160
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:24,040
THC so you can just take less Delta 9

1161
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:25,838
and you get the same effect yeah and I I

1162
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:27,318
think that it's but it's you know shake

1163
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:29,358
it a little try stuff you haven't tried

1164
00:44:27,318 --> 00:44:30,880
in a while it's well it's experimenting

1165
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:32,440
and knowing your body and I don't think

1166
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,760
I think a lot of people rely on doctors

1167
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:36,800
to tell them what they need when I think

1168
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:39,040
doctors should be able to guide you this

1169
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,000
is not taught in medical school no no

1170
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:42,599
they don't even teach about the

1171
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,318
endocannabinoid system no they don't and

1172
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:45,599
I think but but like knowing your body

1173
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:47,880
the only one who's going to know your

1174
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:49,800
body is you know you can rely on doctors

1175
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:52,480
for stuff but you should know your body

1176
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:54,119
better than any doctor and what you need

1177
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,358
this is truly the difficulty I think

1178
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:58,280
with cannabinoids and cannabis first off

1179
00:44:56,358 --> 00:45:00,400
it's not water soluble and all the easy

1180
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:02,200
drugs are water soluble right so the the

1181
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,280
fact that it's it's hydrophobic is not

1182
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:05,679
helpful for really anything testing all

1183
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,720
that you've got to like burn it to test

1184
00:45:05,679 --> 00:45:09,598
it in a lot of ways how hard it is to

1185
00:45:07,719 --> 00:45:12,039
work with you know and Equipment gets

1186
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:14,680
sticky everything it's it's uh it's it's

1187
00:45:12,039 --> 00:45:17,039
not friendly um the way you know say the

1188
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:18,919
bark of a willow tree is which you know

1189
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:22,440
fun fact women used to get burned at the

1190
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:24,280
steak over and now it's aspirin um so

1191
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:26,559
the the fact that it's so hard to to

1192
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:27,640
work with number one but uh number two

1193
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:29,880
because it affects each of us

1194
00:45:27,639 --> 00:45:33,318
differently and I think of a pendulum

1195
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:35,119
right and you know each each of us our

1196
00:45:33,318 --> 00:45:37,000
pendulum swings differently how much

1197
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:39,880
sleep did you get how much coffee did

1198
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,318
you drink water exercise did your spouse

1199
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:44,599
or partner just piss you off what you

1200
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:46,239
know all kinds of things did the

1201
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:47,838
cherries just pop in your rear view you

1202
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:50,358
know all of these things can affect your

1203
00:45:47,838 --> 00:45:53,279
state of mind and how cannabis affects

1204
00:45:50,358 --> 00:45:56,318
you right from day to day hour to hour

1205
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,640
so the same dose or uh whatever it is

1206
00:45:56,318 --> 00:46:00,358
you're consuming can affect you

1207
00:45:57,639 --> 00:46:03,838
differently even from Thursday to Friday

1208
00:46:00,358 --> 00:46:05,920
yeah uh and so for for for you to find

1209
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:08,679
homeostasis for you to find that Center

1210
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:10,720
of your own swinging pendulum um it's

1211
00:46:08,679 --> 00:46:13,159
it's really we we've always focused on

1212
00:46:10,719 --> 00:46:15,039
just teaching titration um and

1213
00:46:13,159 --> 00:46:16,399
moderation you know you're you're also

1214
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:18,599
just wasting your money if you're

1215
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:21,639
smoking too much like save it for the

1216
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:23,760
next guy but uh yeah just um you know

1217
00:46:21,639 --> 00:46:25,519
taking unless you are the type of

1218
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,240
medical patient where cannabis you know

1219
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:30,239
if you have Ms or Parkinson's where you

1220
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:33,318
really can't function without it but if

1221
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:35,838
if you're someone who is just you know

1222
00:46:33,318 --> 00:46:38,119
consuming commonly as much for adult use

1223
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:40,078
as for medicine just even taking a break

1224
00:46:38,119 --> 00:46:42,519
every once in a while and listening to

1225
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:45,119
your own body because Canabis is so

1226
00:46:42,519 --> 00:46:48,719
effective across different symptoms and

1227
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:51,559
systems I worry for just a delay of

1228
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:54,000
diagnosis that something that is wrong

1229
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:56,480
with you is being treated by cannabis

1230
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,800
but not cured and what are you ignoring

1231
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,159
because the only doctor you go to is

1232
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:02,200
your pot dock yeah yeah and that's why

1233
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:04,039
good pot docks at least touch you you

1234
00:47:02,199 --> 00:47:05,960
know they take your pulse they look for

1235
00:47:04,039 --> 00:47:09,239
these things Dr Frank Leo he just

1236
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:12,318
retired sir I'm so sad he is a giant he

1237
00:47:09,239 --> 00:47:15,959
T years ago yeah I mean I've been seen

1238
00:47:12,318 --> 00:47:18,199
Frank since 2000 I think maybe 99 to get

1239
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:20,800
my first I'll introduce you to Dr T Rand

1240
00:47:18,199 --> 00:47:22,558
maybe he'll pick you up as a yeah Frank

1241
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:25,119
Frank Lucio he's quite quite the

1242
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:27,119
character and a really really great guy

1243
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:29,640
and uh good luck in your retirement I

1244
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:32,039
just I think yeah Che cheers to cheers

1245
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:36,159
to luo I mean yeah he was such a game

1246
00:47:32,039 --> 00:47:38,759
changer and he wrote a recommendation

1247
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:42,318
for cannabis for my friend's younger

1248
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:44,000
brother who was 14 he was willing to do

1249
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:45,599
it yeah he was willing to do it and he

1250
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,039
was the only one willing to there was

1251
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:49,160
nobody else that would do anything like

1252
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:52,880
that and he was quite and this this is

1253
00:47:49,159 --> 00:47:56,799
back in 1999 yeah 98 maybe actually when

1254
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:58,800
he wrote that um he was very brave yeah

1255
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:01,920
yeah indeed and it was it was Dr Todd

1256
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:04,640
marcaria who passed away in 2007 that

1257
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,880
was uh you know help found the medical

1258
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:09,159
cannabis Association who helped push for

1259
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:11,200
that early testing that finally helped

1260
00:48:09,159 --> 00:48:14,679
us realize that I mean it's like the

1261
00:48:11,199 --> 00:48:16,480
Amazon rainforest in this in this one

1262
00:48:14,679 --> 00:48:18,679
plant and now it's just chased the

1263
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:20,000
varietals and and try to say we don't

1264
00:48:18,679 --> 00:48:21,960
even know what we don't know we're just

1265
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,358
unconsciously unskilled about all of

1266
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:26,519
this Scrat surface and that's what's so

1267
00:48:24,358 --> 00:48:29,279
exciting is what next totally and we got

1268
00:48:26,519 --> 00:48:31,119
guys like ddy mu in Israel which he's

1269
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:33,760
really you know he's paved the way for a

1270
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:36,358
lot of people and and you know we got

1271
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:38,200
front- range biosciences and we've got

1272
00:48:36,358 --> 00:48:40,400
you know medicinal genomics and guys

1273
00:48:38,199 --> 00:48:42,239
really going on the the genetics side

1274
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,519
which are really impressive but what

1275
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:45,558
they're doing over in Israel is really

1276
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:47,599
impressive because there's way less red

1277
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:50,798
tape so they can do actual testing and

1278
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:52,000
this all comes back toed research yeah

1279
00:48:50,798 --> 00:48:55,039
which is

1280
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,199
crazy so we can do it we can do yeah

1281
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:57,798
we're getting there and we're going to

1282
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:59,279
do it there's no way we're not going to

1283
00:48:57,798 --> 00:49:00,519
do it it just blows my mind that we're

1284
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,040
not there yet we just have to keep

1285
00:49:00,519 --> 00:49:05,679
demanding it and yeah which and and you

1286
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:08,400
know it's it's hard because Biden he is

1287
00:49:05,679 --> 00:49:10,798
not our biggest fan and I don't you know

1288
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:14,559
it's uh well so silly because I mean I

1289
00:49:10,798 --> 00:49:17,239
know whose fan he is a fan he's a fan of

1290
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:19,720
and it's not us no so

1291
00:49:17,239 --> 00:49:22,399
unfortunately uh but you know things

1292
00:49:19,719 --> 00:49:24,439
change and we evolve and the thing is is

1293
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,559
like the younger generation is so much

1294
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:28,838
more educated about can and so many more

1295
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:30,640
people have tried cannabis and people

1296
00:49:28,838 --> 00:49:33,078
it's it's normalized to the younger

1297
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:35,519
generation so over time things will

1298
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:38,079
change indeed and it is uh and this is

1299
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:39,960
why education is so important uh because

1300
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:43,440
good Lord our children will inherit the

1301
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:47,039
earth and uh you know the the fear the

1302
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:49,039
stigma uh it for so long in California

1303
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:50,960
we were trying to convince people that

1304
00:49:49,039 --> 00:49:52,679
the sky will not fall Chicken Little

1305
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,159
like cats won't sleep with dogs and if

1306
00:49:52,679 --> 00:49:56,000
they do that's cute like nothing bad

1307
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:58,199
happens it's it's everything going to be

1308
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,039

not you know and marijuana Madness I

1310
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:06,318

1311
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:09,838
marketing campaigns ever yeah uh and and

1312
00:50:06,318 --> 00:50:13,159

1313
00:50:09,838 --> 00:50:15,358
false uh but it's it's hard to get out

00:50:42,519 --> 00:50:46,798
have young people walk up to me and

1328
00:50:45,159 --> 00:50:50,279

1332
00:50:55,798 --> 00:51:00,039

1333
00:50:57,358 --> 00:51:04,199
old it is their whole life yes good

1334
00:51:00,039 --> 00:51:07,920
genetics um but it's yeah Irish uh they

1335
00:51:04,199 --> 00:51:10,000
don't remember when it was more

1336
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:14,480
dangerous to get

1337
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:16,599
caught uh it it's and and so many you

1338
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:18,920
know just don't don't understand and

1339
00:51:16,599 --> 00:51:21,200
don't appreciate and how lucky that they

1340
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:24,599
don't have to think about it the problem

1341
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:26,679
with that though is we're not there yet

1342
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:28,559
no and we're still ripping babies from

1343
00:51:26,679 --> 00:51:31,838
their mother's breasts we're still

1344
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:34,319
arresting 17-year-old Hispanic kids

1345
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:36,519
because that's who's getting pulled over

1346
00:51:34,318 --> 00:51:38,719
is black and brown and Indigenous no

1347
00:51:36,519 --> 00:51:41,318
matter where you live that they're still

1348
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:43,798
more likely to get shaken down for

1349
00:51:41,318 --> 00:51:46,199
whatever it is uh and and go to jail now

1350
00:51:43,798 --> 00:51:48,159
because they're underage uh you know we

1351
00:51:46,199 --> 00:51:50,960
we really need to take the teeth out of

1352
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:52,558
the criminality so that because you know

1353
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,240
the cops that I've met in the field by

1354
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:56,359
and large you know the frothing

1355
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:57,798
prohibitionists or the LOB lists they're

1356
00:51:56,358 --> 00:52:00,159
the ones that represent the police

1357
00:51:57,798 --> 00:52:02,318
officers associations most cops on the

1358
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:03,920
street you want a good laugh ask them

1359
00:52:02,318 --> 00:52:05,838
about the last marijuana bus that they

1360
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:08,440
were scared for their life yeah you know

1361
00:52:05,838 --> 00:52:11,078
there that is not their biggest concern

1362
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:12,760
out there it is a tool in their toolbox

1363
00:52:11,079 --> 00:52:14,880
they're like if you take this tool out

1364
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:16,720
I'll simply use another tool I just need

1365
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:19,119
to know where the damn line is and tell

1366
00:52:16,719 --> 00:52:21,639
me what what matters to you community

1367
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:23,200
and then once we change that line you

1368
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:24,920
know that our cops here in California

1369
00:52:23,199 --> 00:52:27,439
are still being taught police officer

1370
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:29,880
standard training post training is still

1371
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:33,838
the training of the 90s that we're all a

1372
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:36,280
bunch of just druggy drug addled idiots

1373
00:52:33,838 --> 00:52:37,519
and and you should go crack some skulls

1374
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:40,480
and all of this is just a bunch of

1375
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:43,039
[ __ ] they're still being taught the

1376
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:44,639
old standard and so we also have to

1377
00:52:43,039 --> 00:52:46,599
demand at the same time that we're all

1378
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:48,358
educating ourselves and and good Lord

1379
00:52:46,599 --> 00:52:50,960
come out to your mom if you haven't yet

1380
00:52:48,358 --> 00:52:52,838
that you are a Canabis consumer yeah uh

1381
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:55,599
that you know that have the conversation

1382
00:52:52,838 --> 00:52:58,119
with the people that love you of why you

1383
00:52:55,599 --> 00:53:01,160
choose this and

1384
00:52:58,119 --> 00:53:03,680
and what happens uh you know show them

1385
00:53:01,159 --> 00:53:07,798
your success not not just your your

1386
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:10,480
goofy side but you know it's it's just

1387
00:53:07,798 --> 00:53:13,039
continuing the conversation and

1388
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:14,798
remembering that there are folks on the

1389
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:16,199
right side of prohibition but there are

1390
00:53:14,798 --> 00:53:17,960
still folks on the wrong side of

1391
00:53:16,199 --> 00:53:20,159
prohibition and and that again we're

1392
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:23,838
just we're not done yet there are still

1393
00:53:20,159 --> 00:53:26,358
people sitting in prison as we speak on

1394
00:53:23,838 --> 00:53:28,960
this issue more than you can possibly

1395
00:53:26,358 --> 00:53:30,798
imagine yeah and we're not it's just for

1396
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:33,280
nonviolent drug offenses nonviolent and

1397
00:53:30,798 --> 00:53:35,679

1398
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:39,519
were Rico cases my friend they weren't

1399

00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,960
some of the stuff in Texas well and and

1446
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:26,000
I'll wrap this back to the beginning of

1447
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:28,159
the conversation uh cuz I'll do that for

1448
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,880
you which is you know the the Christian

1449
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:33,399
conservative right so Richard's mom and

1450
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:35,559
Lee founded ramp Republicans against

1451
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:38,000
marijuana prohibition and so she is

1452
00:55:35,559 --> 00:55:39,839
showing up to CAC over the years and

1453
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,798
having this conversation and then all of

1454
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:44,199
a sudden you know rep boner is now

1455
00:55:41,798 --> 00:55:46,599
repping cannabis so you know there's

1456
00:55:44,199 --> 00:55:48,000
there's a lot of change that uh comes

1457
00:55:46,599 --> 00:55:50,440
from both sides of the aisle and this is

1458
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:53,358
one of the things that we can all agree

1459
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:55,639
on we can sit around that campfire

1460
00:55:53,358 --> 00:55:57,199
probably won't sing Kumbaya uh but at

1461
00:55:55,639 --> 00:55:58,400
the end of the day but that's okay

1462
00:55:57,199 --> 00:56:00,719
depending on where you live it's the

1463
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:03,798
Dems that are standing in the way so you

1464
00:56:00,719 --> 00:56:06,598
know this isn't a red or blue issue and

1465
00:56:03,798 --> 00:56:10,038
and frankly um it it it's an American

1466
00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:12,480
issue yeah Agreed 100% it's an American

1467
00:56:10,039 --> 00:56:14,400
issue and we as Americans should be

1468
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:16,318
addressing it it doesn't matter what

1469
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,798
side you're on left or right you know

1470
00:56:16,318 --> 00:56:21,079
it's like it just needs to be addressed

1471
00:56:18,798 --> 00:56:22,920
by all of us and at least thought of

1472
00:56:21,079 --> 00:56:24,599
Thoroughly by all of us I think if

1473
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:26,240
because if you thoroughly think about it

1474
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:28,920
you'll understand that it's not a bad

1475
00:56:26,239 --> 00:56:32,038
thing and legalization is the best thing

1476
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:34,760
for all of us a lot of folks say

1477
00:56:32,039 --> 00:56:36,599
James it's weed like this is not my top

1478
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:38,039
10 yeah I don't it's I've got so many

1479
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:39,440
other things to worry about all right

1480
00:56:38,039 --> 00:56:41,760
well what is in your top 10 and let's

1481
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:44,000
talk about how marijuana prohibition has

1482
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:45,960
[ __ ] that up right you know is it your

1483
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,280
kids is it your schools because right

1484
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:50,000
now we're more interested in putting

1485
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:51,400
people in jail still than in school uh

1486
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,358
you know where are all these resources

1487
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:56,599
going uh and and what are the cops

1488
00:56:53,358 --> 00:56:58,960
focused on you know there we have rape

1489
00:56:56,599 --> 00:57:01,039
kits that have sat on shelves for over a

1490
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:02,920
decade because they're so focused on

1491
00:57:01,039 --> 00:57:05,160
testing that green [ __ ] in that little

1492
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:07,639
bag finding out whether or not it's what

1493
00:57:05,159 --> 00:57:10,920
something that's never killed anyone

1494
00:57:07,639 --> 00:57:13,318
except for one recently uh that and that

1495
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:15,838
I think is more of a Workforce issue

1496
00:57:13,318 --> 00:57:17,880
dust it's not that was asthma

1497
00:57:15,838 --> 00:57:20,000
related exactly I just wanted to

1498
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:22,920
acknowledge her death because uh it was

1499
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:26,798
attributed officially to cannabis um but

1500
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:26,798
you know at the end of the day it's it's

1501
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:35,200
we uh used to say it takes it takes

1502
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:37,680
about a ton um to to kill you um falling

1503
00:57:35,199 --> 00:57:40,480
from about 10 feet know that you have to

1504
00:57:37,679 --> 00:57:42,480
be crushed physically by the Cannabis

1505
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:44,358
yeah I mean I've tried it just didn't

1506
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:47,400
well you have to they say if you smoke

1507
00:57:44,358 --> 00:57:48,920
um five pounds uh or 10 pounds in five

1508
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,480
minutes I think so like smoke the

1509
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:51,838
telephone pole outside in under five

1510
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:55,039
minutes but it's not even the Cannabis

1511
00:57:51,838 --> 00:57:57,000
that kills you it's the CO2 poisoning um

1512
00:57:55,039 --> 00:57:59,160
lack of O exactly and you can't eat

1513
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,519
enough you'll split your gut before the

1514
00:57:59,159 --> 00:58:03,598
Cannabis itself can kill you so you know

1515
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:06,759
and it is a conversation to have is we

1516
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:09,880
are moving so much of this into Labs

1517
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:12,440
especially to to like subjugate the law

1518
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:15,160
you know that we we've been contorting

1519
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:17,639
CBD and hemp you may feel like you want

1520
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:20,118
to die from overc consuming but it is

1521
00:58:17,639 --> 00:58:23,598
not gonna kill you not GNA kill you but

1522
00:58:20,119 --> 00:58:25,119
we but there there there are now and and

1523
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:28,000
you know I'm not I'm not here to be an

1524
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:29,838
alarmist but but there are these are new

1525
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,838
constituents that are being created and

1526
00:58:29,838 --> 00:58:33,759
we we don't fully understand the safety

1527
00:58:31,838 --> 00:58:36,279
profile or how long it stays in the

1528
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:39,200
system again we just have to understand

1529
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:43,480
like what you are doing in the lab to

1530
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:45,159
convert delta8 what what what magic are

1531
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:46,240
you doing behind the scenes because you

1532
00:58:45,159 --> 00:58:47,798
know a lot of the stuff it's not you

1533
00:58:46,239 --> 00:58:49,598
know vaporizing is one of the healthiest

1534
00:58:47,798 --> 00:58:51,559
ways to consume Canabis but not if

1535
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:53,039
they're adding vitamin E acetate to make

1536
00:58:51,559 --> 00:58:55,480
it more viscous and give you a bigger

1537
00:58:53,039 --> 00:58:57,440
puff of smoke that could kill you so

1538
00:58:55,480 --> 00:59:00,639
what are we adding how cheap is that

1539
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:03,440
metal uh that you're heating up and

1540
00:59:00,639 --> 00:59:05,118
and Main Ling to your brain is Delta a

1541
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:08,200
bad for you we don't know we don't know

1542
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:09,838
we probably probably not if you're using

1543
00:59:08,199 --> 00:59:12,480
good starting material you know it's if

1544
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:14,679
we're talking about an enzyme using

1545
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:17,119
enzymes as a pathway to convert it I

1546
00:59:14,679 --> 00:59:20,719
mean it and we know as well and this is

1547
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:23,838
I think a larger issue is is that

1548
00:59:20,719 --> 00:59:25,679
because cannabis and hemp same plant are

1549
00:59:23,838 --> 00:59:28,159
bioaccumulator

1550
00:59:25,679 --> 00:59:30,318
that a lot of folks are buying what they

1551
00:59:28,159 --> 00:59:32,759
can find which is Industrial Hemp which

1552
00:59:30,318 --> 00:59:34,400
is not fit for human consumption and

1553
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:36,599
because it's a bioaccumulator where was

1554
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:38,000
that grown if it was grown in China or

1555
00:59:36,599 --> 00:59:40,680
Russia because we were the number one

1556
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,719
importers for from Russia up until

1557
00:59:40,679 --> 00:59:45,399
recently uh and China as a matter of

1558
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:47,239
fact of hemp uh and and what is that

1559
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:48,639
grown in what kind of heavy metals

1560
00:59:47,239 --> 00:59:50,719
radioactivity

1561
00:59:48,639 --> 00:59:52,199
Chernobyl now the good news of that is

1562
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:54,439
Reclamation you know we've had students

1563
00:59:52,199 --> 00:59:56,239
come in from Japan after Fukushima

1564
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:58,760
having whole conversations about how

1565
00:59:56,239 --> 01:00:01,318
hemp can help reate that soil because it

1566
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:04,359
can right and so this is what I think is

1567
01:00:01,318 --> 01:00:05,960
like the biggest travesty of like wow

1568
01:00:04,358 --> 01:00:09,038
aside from prohibition this is what we

1569
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:12,599
really got wrong we have we we've

1570
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:14,119
whiffed on the benefits of hemp and and

1571
01:00:12,599 --> 01:00:15,798
there was this brief moment where there

1572
01:00:14,119 --> 01:00:18,119
was a gold rush towards hemp but they

1573
01:00:15,798 --> 01:00:20,400
forgot oh [ __ ] we got to process it and

1574
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:21,920
and oh we need a market to sell it to

1575
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,680
like oops you know we you forgot to

1576
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:26,079
build out the full supply chain but so

1577
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:30,318
close mhm but in the meanwhile all of

1578
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:32,920
the opportunities for for fiber and Fuel

1579
01:00:30,318 --> 01:00:35,440
and building materials and all everybody

1580
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:37,119
wants to do is go convert Delta 8 like

1581
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:39,159
that's all that matters is let's go

1582
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:40,838
compete with the legal cannabis market

1583
01:00:39,159 --> 01:00:44,318
and meanwhile the legal cannabis Market

1584
01:00:40,838 --> 01:00:47,920
is struggling under all these B the the

1585
01:00:44,318 --> 01:00:50,960
taxes and and the burdens and then is

1586
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:53,159
selling the same [ __ ] at Circle K right

1587
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:55,679
yeah it's it's a tough one and you know

1588
01:00:53,159 --> 01:00:58,399
there's so many uses for for hemp it's

1589
01:00:55,679 --> 01:01:00,440
unbelievable you know hemp cre bio

1590
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:02,400
remediation soil remediation it's the

1591
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:05,039
largest just growing in the ground it is

1592
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:08,838
the largest carbon sink crop we can

1593
01:01:05,039 --> 01:01:11,079
plant yeah like we can do it people yeah

1594
01:01:08,838 --> 01:01:13,558
just we have the knowledge let's just

1595
01:01:11,079 --> 01:01:15,680
apply it Con Johnny apple seed James

1596
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:17,280
just give me the seeds all spread across

1597
01:01:15,679 --> 01:01:19,639
yeah that's what I'm saying like let's

1598
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:22,200
go you get the helicopter I'll see you

1599
01:01:19,639 --> 01:01:24,118
in South Dakota right come on chrisy

1600
01:01:22,199 --> 01:01:27,038
I'll see you soon yeah I mean I saw

1601
01:01:24,119 --> 01:01:30,480
something on a Indian Reservation that

1602
01:01:27,039 --> 01:01:31,799
that's got funded for uh hemp creete and

1603
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:34,119
so they're going to be doing hemp creete

1604
01:01:31,798 --> 01:01:35,759
which I think is great it is so exciting

1605
01:01:34,119 --> 01:01:39,000
yeah when you start to really study with

1606
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:43,319
building materials and what that can do

1607
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:44,798
to to start to offset carbon which is

1608
01:01:43,318 --> 01:01:47,199
all we keep talking about and the longer

1609
01:01:44,798 --> 01:01:49,000
it sits there the more carbon it

1610
01:01:47,199 --> 01:01:50,679
continues to accumulate from what I

1611
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:54,119
understand as well it it and it just

1612
01:01:50,679 --> 01:01:55,639
gets stronger over time um yeah there's

1613
01:01:54,119 --> 01:01:57,798
it's

1614
01:01:55,639 --> 01:02:00,358
we've really got to figure out how to

1615
01:01:57,798 --> 01:02:02,038
unstick this stuck and again I've got to

1616
01:02:00,358 --> 01:02:04,598
go back to

1617
01:02:02,039 --> 01:02:08,039
descheduling because I don't

1618
01:02:04,599 --> 01:02:10,680
see again I get incremental but you've

1619
01:02:08,039 --> 01:02:13,680
got to shoot for the flipping stars to

1620
01:02:10,679 --> 01:02:15,519
catch the moon or next door yeah right

1621
01:02:13,679 --> 01:02:17,838
and if we just keep settling for good

1622
01:02:15,519 --> 01:02:20,880
enough we're never going to get to good

1623
01:02:17,838 --> 01:02:22,679
yeah we we can do is a bad thing and you

1624
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:24,559
know at at the end of the day I just I

1625
01:02:22,679 --> 01:02:26,318
hope people just keep showing up and and

1626
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:28,798
this is something we one of the things I

1627
01:02:26,318 --> 01:02:31,038
try to leave uh are graduates which I

1628
01:02:28,798 --> 01:02:32,639
call Oaker Dam grad Gladiators uh

1629
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:34,799
they're the first through the wall

1630
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:37,278
sometimes get bloody make money you're

1631
01:02:34,798 --> 01:02:39,000
trained fighter right and uh you've got

1632
01:02:37,278 --> 01:02:41,599
to advocate for yourself for your

1633
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:44,079
business for your choice uh for your

1634
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:47,559
freedom and that means showing up to

1635
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:50,400
vote and showing up for jury duty and

1636
01:02:47,559 --> 01:02:51,920
look I get that same like a God damn it

1637
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,000
every time I get the jury duty and then

1638
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:56,480
I remind myself you know it still goes

1639
01:02:54,000 --> 01:03:00,480
down California uh what what's going on

1640
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:04,240
in Arkansas and the ability to get on a

1641
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:07,278
a jury that is trying a marijuana case

1642
01:03:04,239 --> 01:03:10,519
and you know jury immunity is something

1643
01:03:07,278 --> 01:03:11,639
that a lot of us uh missed in Civics

1644
01:03:10,519 --> 01:03:13,400
that you're not just judging the

1645
01:03:11,639 --> 01:03:15,519
defendant you're judging the very law

1646
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:18,278
that put him there and you can hang that

1647
01:03:15,519 --> 01:03:22,480
jury uh because marijuana isn't a crime

1648
01:03:18,278 --> 01:03:25,880
right yeah totally so if you had one

1649
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:27,838
piece of advice for yourself going back

1650
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:31,200
to the younger self that was in the

1651
01:03:27,838 --> 01:03:33,199
industry for one year or two years what

1652
01:03:31,199 --> 01:03:39,000
would that one piece of advice

1653
01:03:33,199 --> 01:03:43,000
be get over yourself uh I was I was in a

1654
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:47,159
position to have even more

1655
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:48,559
conversations than I did in rooms with

1656
01:03:47,159 --> 01:03:50,920
uh you know i' I've had a lot of

1657
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:53,599
conversations with powerful people but

1658
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:56,318
I've also been in rooms with with folks

1659
01:03:53,599 --> 01:04:00,160
that I just didn't want to

1660
01:03:56,318 --> 01:04:03,000
ask I had a hard time asking for help

1661
01:04:00,159 --> 01:04:04,278
and having that conversation and just

1662
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:08,440
getting over the

1663
01:04:04,278 --> 01:04:11,079
no I I wish I had asked more yeah uh

1664
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:13,880
because I I I regret those things I

1665
01:04:11,079 --> 01:04:16,920
don't regret most of the stuff I've done

1666
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:20,119
I regret those missed opportunities

1667
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:24,000
because by not asking by not talking it

1668
01:04:20,119 --> 01:04:26,760
wasn't no yeah I never opened my mouth

1669
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:29,119
uh so yeah I think just you know tell

1670
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:31,278
your story and and don't don't be afraid

1671
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:32,920
you're bothering people I still feel

1672
01:04:31,278 --> 01:04:34,519
that way like I'm not going to bother

1673
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:37,278
them they don't even talk to me and then

1674
01:04:34,519 --> 01:04:39,038
later on like damn it why didn't I just

1675
01:04:37,278 --> 01:04:42,079
go shake their hand and thank them for

1676
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:43,119
their trouble so yeah I would say just

1677
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:46,680
get over

1678
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:49,039
yourself I feel you it's hard it's hard

1679
01:04:46,679 --> 01:04:51,919
to get over yourself isn't it sometimes

1680
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:54,920
sometime yeah sometimes it can be hard

1681
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:58,278
um so now where do you you see yourself

1682
01:04:54,920 --> 01:05:00,480
in five years with still with Oaker Dam

1683
01:04:58,278 --> 01:05:03,159
doing your thing with oaksterdam and I

1684
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:06,039
bleed green and gold that's awesome yeah

1685
01:05:03,159 --> 01:05:07,838
this um so we were rated in 2012 and

1686
01:05:06,039 --> 01:05:09,559
that was by the uh the Obama

1687
01:05:07,838 --> 01:05:12,920
Administration yeah and that's when I

1688
01:05:09,559 --> 01:05:14,519
took over the school um this is Legacy

1689
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:16,760
at this point for me it started with my

1690
01:05:14,519 --> 01:05:22,440
husband almost 30 years ago and it came

1691
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:24,839
back to our family um we you know I

1692
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:25,880
still see myself talking to to Congress

1693
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:27,358
I've had the opportunity to talk to

1694
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:29,920
several other governments of other

1695
01:05:27,358 --> 01:05:34,480
countries but I still um need to be on

1696
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:38,480
the on the on that that floor and and

1697
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:40,199
the be again we're we're not done yet

1698
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:42,679
and and the good news about education

1699
01:05:40,199 --> 01:05:44,399
James is we're never done there's always

1700
01:05:42,679 --> 01:05:45,879
more to learn and whatever the

1701
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:48,240
government decides to do there's more to

1702
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:51,039
do and whatever state you live in uh

1703
01:05:48,239 --> 01:05:53,278
whatever country you live in uh whatever

1704
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:56,079
it is you love about the plant you know

1705
01:05:53,278 --> 01:05:58,318
it's there's I know genetics and growing

1706
01:05:56,079 --> 01:06:01,440
cultivation I strongly recommend that

1707
01:05:58,318 --> 01:06:03,960
everyone like plant a seed and try it uh

1708
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:06,679
you know and and the development that we

1709
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:09,639
are doing with the school um you know

1710
01:06:06,679 --> 01:06:11,798
they they made a movie about it uh

1711
01:06:09,639 --> 01:06:15,159
there's documentary out now um that you

1712
01:06:11,798 --> 01:06:17,559
can catch in various film festivals uh

1713
01:06:15,159 --> 01:06:20,239
that that really captures the the

1714
01:06:17,559 --> 01:06:23,519
history of of the end of prohibition it

1715
01:06:20,239 --> 01:06:26,439
captured legalization uh in the journey

1716
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:29,318
uh nearly nearly there and so also just

1717
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:33,798
making sure that folks catch the that

1718
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:36,000
fire see the film take a class um and

1719
01:06:33,798 --> 01:06:37,880
and find ways to to better themselves

1720
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,159
whether it's just as a patient trying to

1721
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:42,039
understand how this affects them or

1722
01:06:40,159 --> 01:06:44,558
their nephew coming out of school and

1723
01:06:42,039 --> 01:06:47,359
looking for a new career uh I think

1724
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:49,599
Workforce Development and uh helping

1725
01:06:47,358 --> 01:06:52,239
people rise in their careers which

1726
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:53,559
ironically is how I started in life and

1727
01:06:52,239 --> 01:06:56,199
now I'm doing it for the Cannabis

1728
01:06:53,559 --> 01:06:59,440
industry and it's just beautiful to see

1729
01:06:56,199 --> 01:07:02,798
and hear the governments that I now work

1730
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:05,679
with spewing the same thing that I was

1731
01:07:02,798 --> 01:07:08,239
saying with a microphone in 2007 when

1732
01:07:05,679 --> 01:07:11,278
people thought we were [ __ ] crazy

1733
01:07:08,239 --> 01:07:14,598
yeah it is amazing uh to to see the

1734
01:07:11,278 --> 01:07:18,199
change and and we try to encourage

1735
01:07:14,599 --> 01:07:19,400
people to be lifelong Learners and uh

1736
01:07:18,199 --> 01:07:22,558
it's it's really just where do you want

1737
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:24,559
to grow from here yeah yeah well the

1738
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:27,278
second you get rid of ego you realize

1739
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:29,319
that there is there's no Mastery it's

1740
01:07:27,278 --> 01:07:31,159
all Improvement it's a practice it is

1741
01:07:29,318 --> 01:07:33,358
and it's if you love it you get up and

1742
01:07:31,159 --> 01:07:34,759
you do it and you learn from what you're

1743
01:07:33,358 --> 01:07:36,759
doing every day you need learn from

1744
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:39,359
other people and it's also ever evolving

1745
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:41,160
and changing so it is amazing that you
