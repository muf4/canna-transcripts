go there where there's a lot of them

23
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:55,039

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,960
internet you know it it's uh they're all

28
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,560
giving people seeds and sharing seeds

29
00:01:03,878 --> 00:01:08,478
and genetics and we're doing a book

30
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,600
signing there on Friday of next week so

31
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:12,359
that should be fun incredible I think

32
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:14,319
that's one thing that unites us is that

33
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:16,680
support for the community the people at

34
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:18,519
home Growers all over the world people

35
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,720
wanting to elevate the game of cannabis

36
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:22,319
I think that's what brings us together

37
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:23,879
well and supporting the stores is huge

38
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:25,599
too just because OB you know we know

39
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:27,319
that this industry is quite the roller

40
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:29,319
coaster ride yeah when you're basing

41
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:32,039
your business like a retail store going

42
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:33,599
on that ride year to year you know

43
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,079
that's a challenge so to be there and

44
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:36,319
make sure that they know that we still

45
00:01:35,078 --> 00:01:37,319
care about them we're thinking about

46
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:39,279

56
00:01:55,879 --> 00:02:01,560

the show briefly and we get another one

60
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,679
coming up with him but yeah so Royal

61
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,239
gold with the age-old that was the the

62
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:15,878
secret mix right that was a long time

63
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:17,640
Ace in the Hole that was it it was you

64
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:20,719
want good weed that's that was the

65
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:22,039
ticket right and it's so basic and uh

66
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:23,359
some people don't even believe that it's

67
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:25,719
good because it's so basic and it's like

68
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,280
no you got good soil you've got good

69
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:31,000
food it's a perfect marriage it's very

70
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,598
simple and you get I mean just those two

71
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,199
elements alone you're going to get good

72
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:38,159
flower Simplicity is the key I think

73
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:40,598
that a lot of times get lost you know

74
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,639
when we visit facilities for our podcast

75
00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:44,598
Royal grown radio we go through tons of

76
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:46,639
facilities all over and for Royal gold

77
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:48,518
touring and yeah the people that are

78
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,119
doing the craziest things are usually

79
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:52,039
having the most problems the people who

80
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,878
are simple streamlined straight and

81
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:56,799
efficient those are the people who are

82
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:59,280
smashing totally yeah I like vital and I

83
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,560
like uh Royal gold the Kings mix is

84
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,719
great you you know it's like it's a

85
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,400
classic it's nostalgic just thinking

86
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:05,639
about and so I actually planted I had

87
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,360
some bags of Kings makes at the house

88
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:10,839
and I actually planted uh some cat piss

89
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,799
crosses that a guy named Rich gave me

90
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,120
return of the cat piss so he brought

91
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:15,319
some plants by so I put them in my

92
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,519
backyard we can't do them in the

93
00:03:15,318 --> 00:03:20,280
facility we don't bring soil in here

94
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,759
right uh so it's only cocoa and rock

95
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,560
wool keep it just to keep it clean we

96
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:26,919
have the nursery model going on we have

97
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,158
tissue culture we're pheno hunting but

98
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:30,399
we try to keep it clean we don't want

99
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:31,919
bugs in the facility and so makes it

100
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,120
difficult I love growing in soil but I

101
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,318
also love cocoa and Rockwell so yeah and

102
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,759
you know that's the Hallmark of what we

103
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:40,119
do is starting with the Coco so yeah I'm

104
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,639
a big fan right yeah yeah the Kings mix

105
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,120
has really taken off for us last you

106
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:45,399
know three or four years especially I

107
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,878
think it's been out maybe I think we're

108
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,080
working on seven or eight but yeah the

109
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:52,239
last three or four years it definitely

110
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,040
seems to have made its way finally into

111
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,480
a lot of Growers facilities whether it's

112
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:56,959
you know in their greenhouse and pulling

113
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:58,560
their light dep or even in their indoor

114
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,719
if they want a little less maintenance

115
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,959
yeah but yeah we're there and I'm like

116
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:05,158
seeing it this year especially where our

117
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,759
Kings MC Sales are doing F fantastic

118
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:09,000
rebounding from the years where

119
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:10,078
everybody kind of felt that low right

120
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,598
you know yeah it's been it's been

121
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:14,680
exciting well then Co years were good

122
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:16,798
for you guys Co years were good but an

123
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,720
ultimate Challenge in trying to keep up

124
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,519
trying to you know punch above your

125
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,759
weight class and create more soil we had

126
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,280
more demand than we'd ever seen we were

127
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,199
trying to keep up and give everybody

128
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:29,519
what they needed and it got really

129
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,960
difficult and then when it stopped it

130
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:34,359
just dried up all at once and that's

131
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:36,159
when everybody was feeling it so it it

132
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,759
gave us some really unique challenges

133
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,880
which have helped us grow immensely as a

134
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:44,199
company as a team as a brand and allowed

135
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:46,240
us to improve our products improve our

136
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:49,280
material flow improve our quality

137
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,600
control so it was a blessing and a curse

138
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,279
there were some struggles we felt like

139
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,199
we lost millions of dollars in sales

140
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:56,519
that we just couldn't make enough soil

141
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:58,079
but in the end it was really great for

142
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:59,478
our business yeah we're all selling out

143
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:01,599
of seeds all the genetics guys that were

144
00:04:59,478 --> 00:05:03,758
making bulk seeds everybody kind of blew

145
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,800
through their seed stock wow pretty

146
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,479
amazing you know during Co in Co it was

147
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:11,319
like this yeah Skyrocket and the thing

148
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:12,879
is is the three months before covid it

149
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:14,120
was a struggle like I wasn't sure if

150
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,360
there was going to be a good season or

151
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,160
not I really didn't think it was going

152
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,000
to be good because the previous year was

153
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,319
a little slow yeah 19 was tough 19 was

154
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,279
tough and then really it just marches

155
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,400
like we started getting phone calls and

156
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:29,839
then you know I think everyone was

157
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:32,478
excited about cannabis and uh we were

158
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:34,000
able to sell cannabis as a whole you

159
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:35,318
know and recreational it wasn't like

160
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,918
they were shutting down dispensaries so

161
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:40,759
people were smoking a lot more weed and

162
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:42,159
uh buying more soil buying more seeds

163
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:44,038
buying more lights buying more

164
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,880
everything I feel like it was in a a

165
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:47,478
pretty amazing time considering that it

166
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:49,279
was so bad in other way it's interesting

167
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:52,399
though because I remember at the end of

168
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:54,359
2019 going like October November where

169
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:56,918
we generally slow down a little bit as a

170
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,680
soil company ters are you know year

171
00:05:56,918 --> 00:06:01,159
round Powerhouse right tuers definitely

172
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,959
you know made its way in its name for

173
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,039
itself in the industry but there was

174
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:06,198
something that was going on where we

175
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:09,079
could see the transition where we

176
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:11,840
weren't just going to be uh you know a

177
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:14,000
quieting down and maybe you know um you

178
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:15,598
know less you know drop a day or two off

179
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,918
of production because of the winter

180
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:19,279
months you know especially going through

181
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:20,959
the holidays in December I remember we

182
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:23,399
started popping off tuer especially down

183
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:25,399
in the LA area on a different level yeah

184
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:26,679
and it was very you know Regional you

185
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:29,079
know a little bit Oklahoma but

186
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,598
definitely super hard in La out in the

187
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:34,198
desert pal Springs Desert Hot Springs we

188
00:06:31,598 --> 00:06:35,478
were sending you know 20 trucks a month

189
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:37,439
through those months where we hadn't

190
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:39,199
ever seen anything with tuer

191
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,719
specifically to that area before it

192
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,080
really really popped for some reason

193
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,199
amazing yeah it's it's so funny from

194
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:48,519
year to year you can you almost can't

195
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:49,919
predict it uh because the years you

196
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:51,519
think it's going to be good it sucks and

197
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:53,639
then the years you think it sucks all of

198
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:55,198
a sudden it's good yeah yep you have

199
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:56,639
some pandemic pop out of nowhere and

200
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,520
you're like woohoo we're [ __ ] doing

201
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,918
this yeah I mean we they kept saying

202
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:01,359
over production is going to be so bad

203
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:04,159
for California over production for

204
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,598
California and yeah uh I think we need

205
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,160
interstate commerce for cannabis I think

206
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:11,159
that's a must have for our industry

207
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,639
that's going to benefit everybody you

208
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,599
know being able to export out of

209
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,160
California into places like North Dakota

210
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:18,319
although I heard North North Dakota just

211
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,319
put on their ballot they're they're

212
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,439
trying to pass I heard that wreck again

213
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,319
which I think is amazing yeah you know

214
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:26,240
them going wreck is one thing right

215
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,319
popping up dispensaries everywhere

216
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,319
that's fantastic across the country it's

217
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,879
when it's not federally legal and every

218
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,680
state has to come up with a plan to

219
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:35,840
cultivate in that state in order to sell

220
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,079
it in that state if they could just get

221
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:40,399
you know forward to this point where we

222
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:42,478
what are we at 34 states I want to say

223
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:45,638
at this point we're so close I mean just

224
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:47,758
moving past that that goal line finally

225
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:49,560
so that California can actually get a

226
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,240
lot of that cultivation business back

227
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,879
yeah Oregon California Washington I feel

228
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,598
like they're all great places to

229
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:59,919
cultivate and I just I look forward to

230
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:02,878
the day where we can see California

231
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:04,158
cannabis in New York in Florida in other

232
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,840
even though New York and Florida they

233
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:07,519
have cultivations out there but I would

234
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:09,959
like to see it you know also New York

235
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:11,918
Flor why not have it in California yeah

236
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:13,598
accessibility to everybody and I I think

237
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:15,120
as much as it's a huge benefit for

238
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:17,719
California and the west coast to be able

239
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:21,360
to export the product yeah that's huge

240
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:23,919
but I think for the emerging States it

241
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,598
would benefit them so much to have the

242
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:28,839
quality product coming from the west

243
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:30,560
coast to force competition and Elevate

244
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:33,158
the consumer level cannabis that's

245
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,080
entering these facilities and give

246
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:37,278
people an indication of what true

247
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:40,399
quality cannabis is because you see it

248
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:42,000
in every Emerging Market it's just boof

249
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,440
there's so much there's the struggle to

250
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,278
figure it out just so much poor quality

251
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,800
and it's it's sad in one way I'm glad

252
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:51,399
people have access and it's likely

253
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:54,519
better than the you know Cress swag they

254
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:56,639
had years past but to be able to help

255
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:59,039
Elevate that national game again it's

256
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:01,679
about community and elevating the plant

257
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:04,000
the flow power right to me that's where

258
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:05,879
it all starts so I think it serves Dual

259
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,799
Purpose some of of the the industry

260
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:10,240
seems to be like Instagram driven right

261
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:13,399
everybody knows what the visuals are you

262
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,919
can be in in you know [ __ ] know Iowa

263
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:16,440
and have a good idea what really really

264
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:18,159
good weed is supposed to look like it's

265
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,360
the taste and smell that carry through

266
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:22,399
that sure you may not get in that that

267
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,079
presentation you know so yeah get

268
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,159
getting turned on as Z States go legal

269
00:09:24,078 --> 00:09:27,719
to good quality high quality cannabis

270
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:30,078
coming from California Oregon or

271
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,320
Washington like you said in messed up

272
00:09:30,078 --> 00:09:33,879
cannabis though they kind of did a

273
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,519
little bit I think so I think I think

274
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:38,200
the problem with it is is people look

275
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:41,440
for the it's it's the visual side of it

276
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,160
and I grew up smoking weed in the 90s

277
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,040
and some of the best weed I ever smoked

278
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:47,639
in my entire life was also the ugliest

279
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:49,639
weed You' ever seen so true and now

280
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:52,319
people are so fixated on the look that

281
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:55,159
it's almost prioritized above effect

282
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,879
above flavor it's got to have bag appeal

283
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:58,360
and it almost should be the exact

284
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:01,039
opposite it shouldn't matter really what

285
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,879
it looks like uh I'm looking forward to

286
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:06,039
pushing pre-rolls into the wreck markets

287
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:07,559
uh with cultivation partners that you

288
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:09,480
don't actually get to see the flower

289
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:12,278
you're going by taste you're going by

290
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,120
effect and that's it and uh I I think

291
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,799
that's the future of cannabis 2o to a

292
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,600
degree taking a step back and like let's

293
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:19,519
just take the look out of it and give

294
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,879
people joints of really high quality

295
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,799
flour that's exactly what they want yeah

296
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:23,879
you know at the end of the day that's

297
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:25,159
really what they want even though they

298
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:27,078
don't know they want it yet well and

299
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:30,078
that's why pre-rolls sell so well at all

300
00:10:27,078 --> 00:10:33,078
the dispensaries they the [ __ ] on

301
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:35,359
the shitty 99% of them are just

302
00:10:33,078 --> 00:10:36,799
cardboard these days and like there's

303
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,519
some good players I'm not trying to say

304
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:40,759
there aren't good pre-rolls out there

305
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:42,799
but I appreciate that effort to elevate

306
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:44,360
that pre-roll game because when I buy

307
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:46,719
from a dispensary it's normally because

308
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,600
I'm out of my own or traveling and just

309
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,320
need something quick easy and I'm going

310
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,120
for a pre-roll it's all convenience

311
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,720
that's why pens and pre-rolls do so well

312
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,720
it's convenient you don't you don't have

313
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,639
to have a pipe to smoke it or a bong or

314
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,480
what or dab rig now you got your pens

315
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:02,159
and these pens are pretty good too these

316
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,839
you know we got Rosen carts that are

317
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:07,519
just incredible they've gotten so much

318
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:10,079
better I so much better from 2010 you

319
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,200
know what I mean the version one the 1.0

320
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:16,000
that they had the wick in them and I

321
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:18,278
mean all CO2 yeah and propine glycol and

322
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,120
that's not good to smoke no you know

323
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:22,639
it's like it's it's wild that you know

324
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:25,720
the stages we've go we've gone through

325
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:27,839
over the years yeah um from the 90s and

326
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,399
I mean even the hash that we're making

327
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:33,240
now compared to then you know science

328
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,200
took over about 10 years ago and really

329
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,799
dived in and they started experimenting

330
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,240
scientists got excited about it started

331
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:41,599
figuring stuff out on another level

332
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,720
there been a couple guys like K from TR

333
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,000
technologies that have been doing it

334
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,278
since the late 90s but really once we

335
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,839
got this Collective effort of people

336
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:51,838
elevating each other uh now we have

337
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,880
Rosen cards which I think it's

338
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,160
incredible thank the Lord for rosin

339
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:58,039
carts I will say as as a consumer I

340
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:59,879
judge the emerald cup for two years in a

341
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:04,639
row in the cartridge category and so I

342
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:08,200
saw that complete spectrum of fake turps

343
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,639
glycol junk that are you know big brands

344
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:13,320
that are out there on the market all the

345
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:15,440
way to that topnotch arcade of fire and

346
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:18,519
like a lot of those guys that are doing

347
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,639
true live Ros and cartridges that it

348
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:22,919
tastes like you're licking a flower it's

349
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,759
so incredible the first time I fully

350
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:28,599
experience that besides bubble has was

351
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:30,319
with holy water in 2013 the guys from

352
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:34,079
holy water

353
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,680
uh that was uh so there was NL and Mike

354
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:38,039
and all all the guys from holy water

355
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:40,039
back when they were all together um they

356
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:42,319
had spoiled Patient Collective also did

357
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:44,360
it but the that was like the first sauce

358
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,160
right and that stuff you could pour it

359
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,600
in the rig or however you wanted and

360
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:51,719
that tasted like uh the flower on

361
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,360
steroids and I knew they were something

362
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,920
they were on to something at the cup we

363
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,120
entered some of their stuff at the cup

364
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:00,078
in Denver and we had judges apologizing

365
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,679
to us that said we should have won but

366
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:04,319
they didn't know how to categorize us

367
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:06,679
with the extract wow you know and so and

368
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,040
since 2013 it's just gotten better every

369
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:12,198
year you know with the live resin uh

370
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,439
just the processing the the

371
00:13:12,198 --> 00:13:14,838
understanding of the genetics even now

372
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,639
we're getting into more of the genetic

373
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:19,000
side of it like what washes well what

374
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,959
turps are good you know I still love

375
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,078
Skittles when you talk about uh dabs and

376
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:26,359
extract I love like the candy stuff as

377
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:28,439
much as I love the gassy stuff and the

378
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,199
Honey bananas and the Honeys the all

379
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,079
these new varieties these bananas are

380
00:13:30,198 --> 00:13:34,399
pretty amazing too yeah and that's a

381
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:36,559
really unique note to hit you know I

382
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,799
hear some extractors talk about you know

383
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:40,759
oh banana it's all right it's kind of

384
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:42,399
easy to hit some people are like papaya

385
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:45,278
uh I just make papaya all day whatever

386
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,879
it's an easy note to catch but I like

387
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:48,639
that the industry is getting to that

388
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,759
point where they can be selective and

389
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,680
they're like let's find some new Nuance

390
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:55,199
let's find some corners of the tur

391
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:57,838
profile and the volatile softare

392
00:13:55,198 --> 00:14:00,159
compounds and all that haven't been

393
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,560
explored and now we're talking we before

394
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:04,240
we just talk about banana now it's like

395
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:06,919
is it a banana chip is it a plantain is

396
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,360
it a unrip banana is it a sweet banana

397
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:10,639
is it banana custard banana pie what

398
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,159
kind of banana is it does it taste like

399
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,600
banana runs candy I have a banana

400
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:16,399
Skittles that I made that is pretty

401
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,240
special House of cultivar in Seattle is

402
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,879
running it uh and uh we made some

403
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,600
crosses with it and did some really fun

404
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:24,759
stuff but like it is candy banana but

405
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,000
then you look at some of the crosses

406
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:28,120
that we made like with the Fort Collins

407
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,879
cough I got the so basically the banana

408
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,879
cough and that one has some funk in it

409
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:36,360
and you get some banana chip and you get

410
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:38,198
some like sweet floral banana there's

411
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,000
some really interesting things in there

412
00:14:38,198 --> 00:14:42,838
I love that he just rolled off all those

413
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,559
banana like obviously a fan reminded me

414
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:48,240
of that that shrimp scene and Forest

415
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:50,119
Gump oh yeah yeah I do that with strange

416
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,680
too I can go on for hours about all the

417
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,278
old genetics I mean I've been around for

418
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:54,919
a while and I've seen a lot of the stuff

419
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:58,320
and I've been excited about genetics for

420
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:59,799
a long time uh and it's just it's fun to

421
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,079
talk about it's funny to talk about with

422
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:02,439
guys that like talking about it

423
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:03,679
sometimes you're in a room where there

424
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,759
people that don't like talking about it

425
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,599
that's a different story but I feel you

426
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,519
on the way down here I was you know

427
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,079
kicking back relaxing on the drive down

428
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,639
from Humbolt and I was just thinking

429
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:15,198
back knowing we're coming to sit with

430
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,320
you and talk genetics and I'm like where

431
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:20,198
did I start and like thinking about to

432
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:22,560
Growing the original skunk one the

433
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:25,958
Amsterdam skunk one the original

434
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:28,278
Northern Lights Off one G13 the original

435
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:31,439
shivas Shiva Shanti 1 and two and the

436
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:35,600
Shiva skum and like the all of those you

437
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:38,240
know mid to late 90s Amsterdam genetics

438
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,759
and the original us versions of some

439
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,959
that you know went over and got

440
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:45,000
stabilized in different ways you know

441
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:47,638
the Amsterdam skunk got sweet where the

442
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,720
US skunk stayed dirty I don't so I

443
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:53,879
haven't seen real skunk in over 20 years

444
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,920
me and the real 90s skunk and so you

445
00:15:53,879 --> 00:16:00,240
know going to Grateful Dead shows going

446
00:15:56,919 --> 00:16:02,318
to you know to shows in General but also

447
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,480
going down to Santa Cruz there was a

448
00:16:02,318 --> 00:16:04,360
skunk that we used to get that was

449
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,560
called the strawberry because it was

450
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,240
strawberry sized nuggets but it was

451
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:10,000
skunk that was a skunky as you could get

452
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,079
and you would get three nuggets maybe

453
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,120
four depending on but they were all

454
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:16,039
strawberry nice beautiful strawberry

455
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,159
nuggets in the bag and they called it

456
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:19,318
the strawberry but it was skunk it funny

457
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:20,919
that they were calling it anything CU

458
00:16:19,318 --> 00:16:24,639
back then it was like it just all fell

459
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:26,679
under the dank weed category humbal kind

460
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,360
was like every strain grown in humbal

461
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:32,719
yeah was this was probably early 9s 92

462
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,120
93 94 is and so Santa Cruz they did have

463
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,920
names on some of the stuff and people

464
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,759
named the stuff crazy stuff too just to

465
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:40,879
market it better yep yeah I guess I

466
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:43,199
didn't come out here till 94 I did

467
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:45,039
summer tour 94 did the whole breakdown

468
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:47,639
and humble thing like everybody else and

469
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:49,759
then never left you know nice yeah

470
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:51,759
humble's an interesting place you know

471
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,519
there's there's a lot of good flower up

472
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,759
there a lot of good genetics have come

473
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,360
from up there maybe they didn't even get

474
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,278
credit for coming up there but really

475
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,159
did it's been a lot it's definitely been

476
00:17:00,278 --> 00:17:04,720
up and down over the the years and

477
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:07,599
decades yeah you know it's uh it went

478
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,400
through that that massive boom you know

479
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,798
the gold rush you know the green Rush

480
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,480
all over again where it attracted people

481
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:15,879
from all over yeah and obviously with

482
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,640
anything like that there's always going

483
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,400
to be the negative impacts you know

484
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,240
whether it's in the watersheds and

485
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,240
environmental issues um obviously just

486
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,519
the you know just blown up the entire

487
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,279
Market on every level right um and it's

488
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:30,679
interesting now to see it it's kind of

489
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:32,119
gone back it's we weighted a little bit

490
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:35,200
MH you know where you have the people

491
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:36,639
that have been there for 30 40 years and

492
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,480
the people that have always had you know

493
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,919
great intentions they really care about

494
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,880
the flower they care about their

495
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,480
Community they care about keeping their

496
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,960
money from Cannabis in their Community

497
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,519
right um and that's it's been really

498
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,120
nice it's kind of thinned out a little

499
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:53,119
bit you know and and The Angst the

500
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:55,319
people that are maybe not so you know go

501
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:58,079
you know cannabis everything they're not

502
00:17:55,319 --> 00:18:00,000
so angry and walking around there The

503
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:01,599
Divide seems to it you know it's kind of

504
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,558
subsided a little bit it's been pretty

505
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:05,599
nice and pleasant lately it's been tough

506
00:18:03,558 --> 00:18:07,960
humble's had a hard time throughout the

507
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:10,158
years you know it's it's been it's been

508
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,919
a fight an uphill battle probably since

509
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:13,600
the

510
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:15,159
70s uh you know for the communities to

511
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:16,759
get used to the people growing cannabis

512
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:18,919
and then it become that was the

513
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:21,960
community it became the mecca it became

514
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:24,960
the Mecca and it really W the community

515
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,798
was based around cannabis and the money

516
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,558
coming into the community was based on

517
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:30,359
cannabis yeah whether people wanted to

518
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:32,399
believe it or not and they believe it

519
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:35,199
now yeah they believe it now and and

520
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,280
then once wreck happened the regulations

521
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,519
they they made it really hard to deal

522
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:42,000
with Stephen humble and to to be able to

523
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:44,558
step into the legal market for the guys

524
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,798
that had done it for 20 or 30 years yeah

525
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:49,639
yeah I I moved out there in 2001 I grew

526
00:18:47,798 --> 00:18:51,798
up in Michigan was cultivating back

527
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,400
there full black market no legality

528
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:55,480
that's why we had all these underground

529
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,240
great genetics because there weren't a

530
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,558
bunch of pollen Chuckers out there and I

531
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,679
moved to humble and was just I feel kind

532
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:05,200
of the beginning of it really taking

533
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:07,240
over where every house in Arcada had a

534
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,919
grow room and you know the city was

535
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,640
trying to figure out how to fix the

536
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:12,720
housing crisis because there was one

537
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,840
person living in half of the houses and

538
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,120
the rest of the bedrooms were grow and

539
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:19,279
from that point it it blew up it got out

540
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:21,439
of hand there were pollen Chuckers

541
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:23,678
everywhere 10,000 plus grows in the

542
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:28,840
hills and it it has

543
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:31,759
subsided so much there's you know easily

544
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:34,798
10% is left of what there was in that

545
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:37,000
peak in the like kind of the mid2 07

546
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:38,038
through 12 I would say is when it just

547
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,960
kind

548
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:43,558
of populated itself I think I remember

549
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:47,279
back then when outdoor you know I would

550
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:49,440
say pre 2000s mid 2000s outdoor was as

551
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:51,359
expensive as indoor for for the top

552
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,279
shelf outdoor it maybe even more

553
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:56,199
expensive you know $4,500 a pound for

554
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:57,440
some some outdoor sour diesel especially

555
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,519
back in the early 2000 there wasn't a

556
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,038
lot of indoor the indoor you know in the

557
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:04,359
late 90s if you were doing two four

558
00:20:02,038 --> 00:20:06,400
lights that was it was all small stuff

559
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:08,158
where people were going big outside back

560
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,038
big time yeah yeah but yeah you're right

561
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,840
it was still pretty much 45 to five

562
00:20:10,038 --> 00:20:15,359
grand a pound across the board no matter

563
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:17,119
no matter what Josh Freeman he $4500 for

564
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:19,038
his freaking Sour Diesel back in the day

565
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:22,119
and it was probably worth every cent it

566
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:23,519
was ridiculous and it was sticky and it

567
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:25,759
had that Sour Diesel punch where you

568
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:27,079
open the bag and it hits you in the face

569
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:29,079
we used to drive up to Humble to get

570
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:30,639
crazy weed too where it was don't see

571
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:33,558
that stuff anymore you don't see the

572
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,080
stuff where you the skunks the real uh

573
00:20:33,558 --> 00:20:36,319
potent stuff I mean there's not that

574
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:38,480
there's not great weed there's really

575
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:40,519
good stuff but I remember the stuff

576
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,480
where you open the bag and it would

577
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:45,558
punch you in the face with smell and

578
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,400
Aroma uh and then the stuff was sticky

579
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:49,879
and Cur was so resinous and you still

580
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,600
see stuff that's resinous and you still

581
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,679
see stuff that smells and smokes great

582
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:56,240
but I feel like it's just different man

583
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,880
there is that time period late 2000s mid

584
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:03,519
to late 2000s where you're 100% right it

585
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:05,240
was headbands yeah ogs sour some train

586
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:06,679
wrecks and some like Heritage Humbolt

587
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,079
stuff the Salmon Creek big bud and

588
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:11,679
things like that were out there but it

589
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:13,519
was all so much pure gas and there

590
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,919
wasn't pure gas coming from anywhere

591
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:17,038
else in the country like that there was

592
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:18,720
some like like Hindu Kush there was the

593
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:21,558
HK that was coming down out of the

594
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,360
mountains yeah yeah and these things

595
00:21:21,558 --> 00:21:24,519
punched you in the face too but it was

596
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:27,759
like there was some stuff that it was

597
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:29,558
sweeter or M more musky but man I I

598
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:32,519
don't know if it was the seagull [ __ ]

599
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:34,599
the guano the soil that was better back

600
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:36,480
then the genetics combination of all of

601
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:38,240
them a lot of seeds I feel like back in

602
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,200
the 90s when I first started up there

603
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,519
everybody went from seed every single

604
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,080
season there was no Mass buying of

605
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:47,240
clones no and there's a Viger there that

606
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:49,319
you're losing every time you know as it

607
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,120
went more commercial and more more Farms

608
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:53,359
were were popping up with multiple green

609
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:55,599
houses on each one you got to go from

610
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:57,558
clone well people probably bred away

611
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:59,199
from the turps too bred away from the

612
00:21:57,558 --> 00:22:00,879
smell because it was could get you in

613
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,360
trouble sure you I think there was a

614
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,240
point where like you didn't want your

615
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:07,119
stuff to smell so strong yeah you know

616
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:10,120
the chem dog was so strong that you you

617
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:12,199
could smell that from for forever away

618
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:14,079
driving up to your proper yeah down Road

619
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,880
10 miles or five miles sometimes like in

620
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:18,439
the right wind you'd be like [ __ ] all

621
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:20,200
right we're getting close yeah exactly

622
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,679
yeah train wreck was like that I had a

623
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,919
whole field of train wreck one time and

624
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:25,720
then people on the highway yeah friends

625
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:29,559
be like man like we can smell it from

626
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:32,159
the highway and that's not [ __ ] good

627
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:33,678
yeah I remember driving down you know 40

628
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,320
miles of dirt road that would take you

629
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:39,320
half a day to get down to go to the farm

630
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:41,278
and you'd smell it way you know five

631
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:42,839
miles out four miles out sometimes yeah

632
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:45,440
and you could never someone else's but

633
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:46,798
yeah am I passing on farms should I just

634
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,679
stop here

635
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:52,119
totally yeah good times you know things

636
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,159
were different back then things were and

637
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:55,959
that's where like it's really a unique

638
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,080
and interesting time in the industry now

639
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:00,880
and that we're able to sit here on a

640
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:02,240
podcast miked up camed up and talk about

641
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,760
these things that you were scared to

642
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,120
talk about in a restaurant back then

643
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:07,240
yeah you didn't want anybody overhearing

644
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:09,519
this stuff you know and we're talking

645
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,519
about it very freely and that's the

646
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:12,918
beauty of legalization yeah you know

647
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:15,918
whether you some people don't like it

648
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:17,000
some people hate on legalization I think

649
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,640
that it's silly that we should have

650
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
people in prison for cannabis that's

651
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,520
just the the bottom line is non-violent

652
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,679
crime don't put people in prison for

653
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:27,759
that [ __ ] and and treat it like alcohol

654
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,519
treat it like tobacco and it's way safer

655
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:31,720
than both of those

656
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:33,519
100% at the end of the day legalization

657
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:36,079
doesn't have to be a bad thing it's just

658
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:37,079
unfortunate that as theyve especially

659
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:39,918
you know

660
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:41,439
California it's over taxed and over

661
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,000
regulated and the Hoops that you're

662
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,360
making everybody that's already been in

663
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,839
the game yeah you know go through the

664
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:49,558
compliance stuff just they're constantly

665
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:51,359
moving the goalpost or you can do

666
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:52,558
compliance work and then they they tell

667
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:54,278
you one more thing and then all of a

668
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:55,798
sudden you're a quarter million invested

669
00:23:54,278 --> 00:23:58,200
into your F that you've already been on

670
00:23:55,798 --> 00:23:59,960
and growing at for 10 15 years to find

671
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,440
out actually no your property is not

672
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:06,519
going to work right you know sorry yeah

673
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:09,120
totally good luck yeah right yep yeah

674
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:11,960
yeah it's unfortunate it's definitely

675
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:13,519
uh you know keeping people out of jail

676
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,600
as somebody who's you know didn't grow

677
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:18,200
up with a dad because he was busted for

678
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:21,480
for marijuana in New York in 1979 it's

679
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:24,120
like you know to to have families ruined

680
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,079
to have people never be able to qualify

681
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:27,199
for financial aid to get an education at

682
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:28,720
some point when they you know down the

683
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,200
road it's like oh there's so many things

684
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,480
that are just used to kind of break down

685
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,120
society and and the family structure and

686
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,960
to make people's lives especially people

687
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:40,278
with color as we know that you know

688
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:43,360
always been you know directed in a

689
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:45,119
different way to to eradicate that while

690
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:47,719
still allowing some sort of free market

691
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:50,000
business and and let people you know

692
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:52,679
conduct you know what they with any

693
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,038
other uh manufacturing you know when

694
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:56,240
when it comes to wine or alcohol I mean

695
00:24:54,038 --> 00:24:59,038
you look at the wine industry alone just

696
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,599
apples to oranges right you know mean

697
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:04,079
and and taking it further to start to

698
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:05,678
quantify the agriculture as agriculture

699
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:07,278
let alone the manufacturing and

700
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,640
processing and things like that I think

701
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:11,798
is incredibly important there's no crop

702
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:15,000
regulated even tobacco isn't regulated

703
00:25:11,798 --> 00:25:18,319
like cannabis nothing nothing no food no

704
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,558
food none of it and I think that is a

705
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:23,079
positive for at least those who are

706
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:25,759
aware and paying attention to that that

707
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:29,480
we can improve those practices for food

708
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:31,440
for other crops and for just general en

709
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:33,360
cultivation of all things regenerative

710
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,240
agriculture I feel like has gotten a

711
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:38,000
huge Boost from the Cannabis Community

712
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:39,359
how many people got into Organics

713
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,919
because they wanted to smoke organic

714
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:43,038
weed and then were like oh maybe I

715
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:46,038
should get organic broccoli yeah you

716
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:48,519
know it's it's really a Gateway crop in

717
00:25:46,038 --> 00:25:51,759
a big way for sure I love that gateway

718
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:53,679
gateway crop that's you guys need yeah

719
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:55,519
trademarket put it on shirts I think the

720
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:59,080
Gateway crop yeah I think that's a

721
00:25:55,519 --> 00:26:00,918
that's a great one dm yeah

722
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:02,918
here first yeah we'll do a collab

723
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:05,038
t-shirt yeah now we're We Print T-Shirts

724
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:07,159
in the building now you do well we don't

725
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:09,960
have a printer we use the film and then

726
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:11,679
we do heat press sweet and so it's super

727
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,600
easy because then you have each size of

728
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,360
your shirts you don't have to stock the

729
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:18,359
pre-printed ones and you do them to

730
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:20,000
order and you know that's just for our

731
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:21,678
mostly for giveaways but for our basic

732
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,119
t-shirts that we have so everybody could

733
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,840
have shirts and we got a hat press now

734
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:28,558
too so we press hats epic talk about

735
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:30,720
vertical integration yeah I think for us

736
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:32,240
it's like uh saving time and space and

737
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,480
yeah we could pay to have them printed

738
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,640
and sure you know but but we have a

739
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,278
fulfillment room and we use our

740
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:40,960
fulfillment room fully so that's a great

741
00:26:38,278 --> 00:26:43,240
idea I like it yeah and it's easy take

742
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,360
super easy and it's fun I never thought

743
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:48,038
I'd be in the t-shirt business but you

744
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:50,639
know yeah life twists and turns doesn't

745
00:26:48,038 --> 00:26:52,879
it absolutely yeah especially in this

746
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:56,080
industry you know it's like we move in

747
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,640
dog years oh big time and that's what

748
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:59,158
really excites me about the current time

749
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,880
too is that I feel like we're starting a

750
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:03,799
new dog year so to speak you know coming

751
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:06,039
out of pandemic we had some leveling

752
00:27:03,798 --> 00:27:09,038
back out and kind of restructuring of

753
00:27:06,038 --> 00:27:11,398
the industry but it seems like this year

754
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:14,240
grow stores are busy again people are

755
00:27:11,398 --> 00:27:16,359
cultivating at home again in a new way

756
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,839
and some of the commercial facilities

757
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:20,678
are like actually I'm I'm doing better

758
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:22,439
now running the same program I was two

759
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:24,159
years ago than I was two years ago if

760
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:27,000
you're still around you're probably

761
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:29,000
doing okay I notic that there's a lot of

762
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,119
change over yeah some of the facilities

763
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,558
some of the maybe the bigger

764
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:34,839
msos um that you know they didn't make

765
00:27:33,558 --> 00:27:36,639
it but they had their facilities were up

766
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:38,398
and running and and and sort of tight

767
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,240
for the most part you got people that

768
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:42,158
were running a facility somewhere else

769
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,079
and being successful taking over the

770
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,679
other ones now I'm seeing a lot more of

771
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,798
that well you can jump in for pennies on

772
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,240
the dollar now because you have all

773
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:52,079
these built out facilities that are

774
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:54,120
going up for sale with licenses yep well

775
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:56,319
if your Sops are dialed in and and you

776
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:57,959
can show some investors even like Hey

777
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:59,480
listen I got this other facility up here

778
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:01,360
where doing fine we're just going to

779
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,919
carry everything over the same program

780
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:04,879
yeah it's easier to get money than you

781
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:06,240
were 5 years ago and you're like we've

782
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,440
never actually done anything like this

783
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,240
on this scale but believe in me I've got

784
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,159
you that hasn't that didn't work out

785
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,720
very well for a lot of people for sure

786
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,080
not all money is good money that's a

787
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,759
good lesson you know and I think people

788
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:19,158
you'll you'll learn learn it sooner or

789
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:21,679
later if you're working with investors

790
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:23,039
but yeah not all money is good money and

791
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,399
people come in in from other countries

792
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:28,119
trying to invest into our businesses is

793
00:28:25,398 --> 00:28:31,439
not always good no if they don't have

794
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:33,719
their head wrapped around really a

795
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,480
positive intention right it ends up

796
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,319
getting convoluted and people start

797
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,798
chasing their about money right if it

798
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:40,839
becomes only about money you're not it's

799
00:28:39,798 --> 00:28:42,599
going to be really tough to be

800
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:43,720
successful if you're only focused on

801
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:45,719
money because then you got to be the

802
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,839
biggest you got to be the biggest and

803
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,399
you got to yield the heaviest and so it

804
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:51,519
takes a lot of the best genetics out of

805
00:28:49,398 --> 00:28:52,719
the picture for you it changes the way

806
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:54,640
you cultivate and I'm not saying you

807
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,278
have to sacrifice quality the things

808
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,759
that we don't sacrifice you know being

809
00:28:56,278 --> 00:29:00,398
small business owners cutting costs

810
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:03,319
cutting costs definitely has helped

811
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:06,398
Drive the quality of our of the flower

812
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:08,038
coming out yeah drastically you know I

813
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:09,398
mean and I get it the market drives it

814
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:11,798
you got to you got to pay attention to

815
00:29:09,398 --> 00:29:14,199
those things but it did it in such a way

816
00:29:11,798 --> 00:29:16,918
where the quality literally just

817
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,679
diminished to a great degree no matter

818
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:21,200
what state you were cultivating in well

819
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:22,798
a lot of these guys uh celebrities early

820
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,840
on that wanted to slap their name on a

821
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:26,879
cannabis brand because they got excited

822
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:29,558
it ruined their name for cannabis

823
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,000
because they had a in inferior product

824
00:29:29,558 --> 00:29:33,319
I'm not going to name any names but I

825
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,720
think it was really sad seeing some of

826
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:36,240
these people that I really respect and

827
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,159
then they have a shitty product on the

828
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,679
market it's like [ __ ] you know now

829
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:42,640
that's that's kind of changing I think

830
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:45,399
everybody kind of learns from each

831
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,320
other's mistakes and uh so now things

832
00:29:45,398 --> 00:29:48,639
have changed a little bit but the

833
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:52,200
quality has definitely improved in wreck

834
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:54,080
in California like night and day night

835
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,319
and day from from

836
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:58,639
2018 yeah and even over the last three

837
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:01,319
years from 21 to now I like there's been

838
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,200
a drastic improvement still drastic and

839
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:05,200
the availability of good product has

840
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,120
improved I mean I remember there was a

841
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,840
time where I wouldn't smoke anything

842
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:10,398
that you could get in dispensary it was

843
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:13,199
just I'd rather smoke stuff from all my

844
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:15,119
friends you know and then now things

845
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,038
have changed and there's good stuff in

846
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:19,000
some of the dispensaries I mean small

847
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:21,319
percentage of the products but small is

848
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,480
better than none you go to the grocery

849
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:25,319
store there's a small organic section

850
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:28,399
right the same idea I think some of that

851
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:30,480
quality too probably comes from you know

852
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:32,558
working out some of the Kinks in drro

853
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,599
yeah right when when there's such a lag

854
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:36,119
in the drro man half of what you're

855
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:37,599
getting on those first couple of years

856
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:40,439
have been sitting around for way too

857
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:42,038
long and and for sure 100% I think I

858
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,720
think the farm to table model is like

859
00:30:42,038 --> 00:30:45,398
learning the distribution model to where

860
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,319
you can improve it to get more of a

861
00:30:45,398 --> 00:30:49,959
farmtable approach and that's why I'm

862
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:52,278
such a big advocate of being able to go

863
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:55,120
bu cannabis from the Farms up in Humble

864
00:30:52,278 --> 00:30:57,278
up in mesino up in somoma to be able to

865
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:59,839
go shop at your you know get learn learn

866
00:30:57,278 --> 00:31:01,519
the story of the flower how it was grown

867
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:03,798
go talk to the farmer and then be able

868
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,319
to buy it right there you know besides

869
00:31:03,798 --> 00:31:07,319
the Terre and all this other stuff

870
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:09,359
that's great but I think having that

871
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:11,678
model where it's like direct from the

872
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:13,079
farmer you can get it fresh and the good

873
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,480
Farms that are going to sell through it

874
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,879
really fast yeah so you're going to get

875
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,319
a really fresh product and they're going

876
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:20,039
to store it correctly and all the other

877
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:22,158
things but yeah and even if it's not

878
00:31:20,038 --> 00:31:24,359
fresh it's been stored correctly like

879
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:27,240
you said and that the drro model I think

880
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:30,759
that was the broken piece MH that so

881
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:33,000
much great great quality cannabis got

882
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:34,798
ruined completely and was you know B

883
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,359
minus by the time it got to Consumers

884
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:39,720
and so much of the B minus when it went

885
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:41,079
into drro yeah fail it was just trash

886
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,480
when it was moving out of dro and

887
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:46,240
through dispensaries and it it set the

888
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,440
retail Market in California back in a

889
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,319
huge way because people didn't want to

890
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,200
shop for that they would rather go back

891
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:53,319
to their original Black Market plugs and

892
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:56,440
get something that they could count on

893
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:58,960
tasting good right tasting good giving

894
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:01,360
you the eff of yeah I mean it's it's uh

895
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,600
it's interesting Lumpy's brand I'm not

896
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:06,839
sure where they're at right now but when

897
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:08,599
they were medical before wreck the

898
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:10,638
flower was amazing and I was like I was

899
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:13,038
excited to get a [ __ ] jar yeah and

900
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:15,038
then I I was at Harborside one time and

901
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:19,119
I saw the flower there and I had a

902
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:22,000
meeting and uh this is in W and I bought

903
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:23,558
it and I was so disappointed it wasn't

904
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,919
their fault though I mean it wasn't

905
00:32:23,558 --> 00:32:27,319
Lumpy's fault right so it was actually

906
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,840
the fact that he had been on the shelves

907
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:30,638
for six months

908
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:32,638
and not stored in a temperature

909
00:32:30,638 --> 00:32:34,678
controlled environment it was in a jar

910
00:32:32,638 --> 00:32:36,879
and so what what do you expect when that

911
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:38,639
kind of stuff happens and we're figuring

912
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,559
it out and it's one thing when that

913
00:32:38,638 --> 00:32:43,119
happens to you you know you've been in

914
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:46,398
the industry a long enough time to have

915
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:48,918
to understand why but so many new

916
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:51,518
consumers in a new Emerging Market don't

917
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:53,840
know why and that first experience from

918
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,919
a distro tainted product now moves them

919
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:58,158
off that brand forever likely totally

920
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:00,720
and but it's a real interesting thing

921
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:03,360
because you can get stuff that's cheaper

922
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,038
that's fresher that's better than the

923
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:07,000
product that's been on the Shelf longer

924
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:08,440
and sometimes you can like get a brand

925
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,440
where you're like oh man I see this

926
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:12,000
stuff and the product's then garbage and

927
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,080
you never want to smoke it again and it

928
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,278
just ruins it for you but really it

929
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:18,558
wasn't necessarily the Brand's fault it

930
00:33:16,278 --> 00:33:20,119
was the fault of I don't I don't know

931
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:22,240
whose fault it is it's the system really

932
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:24,479
it's the system right I I love to blame

933
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,399
the system yeah it's always a good go-to

934
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,000
we just blame the system right no doubt

935
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:29,798
right

936
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,599
yeah so let's take a let's take a dive

937
00:33:29,798 --> 00:33:33,558
back into your history how you guys got

938
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:36,519
started how do you guys meet all that

939
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:38,519
good stuff oh wow all right so I already

940
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:40,679
told you I broke down in a bus on dead

941
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:43,000
tour and you know hooked up with a girl

942
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:44,840
almost got married started a life in

943
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,638
Humble you know originally from from New

944
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:50,199
York City yeah um you know place where

945
00:33:47,638 --> 00:33:51,759
there wasn't farmer markets and nature

946
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,360
other than Central Park or something

947
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:55,798
like that you know so yeah I found humbo

948
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:58,359
and was like man this place is just

949
00:33:55,798 --> 00:34:00,000
absolutely incredible and uh just

950
00:33:58,359 --> 00:34:01,678
something just pulled on my heartstrings

951
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,278
in in a way that I'd never felt before I

952
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:07,000
was 22 23 years old yeah um right maybe

953
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:09,800
20 or 21 something like that who knows I

954
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
was pretty high back then but um yeah

955
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:14,879
man I just I just never left you know

956
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,239
then obviously the whole culture of Back

957
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:18,679
To Nature you know I mean growing up in

958
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:21,118
a place like New York City you have no

959
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:23,200
connection to your food I never knew how

960
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:25,639
vegetables were grown I didn't know how

961
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:27,118
how meat was killed and processed or

962
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:29,000
anything like you just buy it on a on a

963
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,838
on a shelf of of a store and that's it

964
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,960
yeah so I was really really interested

965
00:34:30,838 --> 00:34:35,440
in just being so connected to that part

966
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,199
of life and learning becoming more

967
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,240
sustainable you know all these things

968
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:41,480
that I just never even heard of you know

969
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:43,279
coming up in New York right and then

970
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:45,039
obviously there was the Cannabis culture

971
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,359
that really lured me in you know my

972
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:49,279
first grows that I was able to you know

973
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:51,519
be a part of in '94

974
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,000
995 you plant that I had been smoking

975
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:55,280
for a while and it was a little dabbling

976
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,760
on the East Coast but highly illegal and

977
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,760
after what had happened to my dad I was

978
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,920
like man I I can't do that to my mom you

979
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:03,160
know right so it wasn't until I was out

980
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:05,880
here that I was like wow man like just

981
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:07,838
really Blown Away by the plant like

982
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:10,640
Beyond smoking and consuming it and

983
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:13,880
having it Lift Me Up um you know from

984
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:15,679
the inside being watching the plant grow

985
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,838
you know learning its

986
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:20,199
characteristics talking to it playing

987
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:22,279
guitar and singing to my girls and and

988
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:24,199
like and feeling that connection and

989
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:26,480
then I'm pretty sure that you know when

990
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:28,078
I would consume it it would almost come

991
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,119
back to me there was like this cycle

992
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,880
that was happening and I just got so

993
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:35,838
overwhelmed with the joy of growing weed

994
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,720
that uh yeah that was it for me nice

995
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:38,880
yeah and my upbringing was a lot

996
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:42,239
different I grew up in Southwest

997
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:44,200
Michigan so we were right along Lake

998
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:46,399
Michigan I could walk out to the lake

999
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:48,039
and walk in the dunes and the forest and

1000
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,119
it's nothing like the Wilderness we have

1001
00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:53,279
in California but it it was a connection

1002
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:56,760
that was really unique and you know I

1003
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,680
started working on farms uh you know

1004
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,359
just like gassing corn and picking

1005
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:01,960
potatoes and things like that when I was

1006
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:05,358
young CU I was looking for a job and

1007
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:06,720
trying to just get money easy money when

1008
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:10,078
you're work working in high school and

1009
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:11,959
in summers when you're 14 15 and then

1010
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:15,640
started going to see The Grateful Dead

1011
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:18,119
and it all blew up for me there and

1012
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:20,078
started you know smoking herb eating

1013
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:21,838
mushrooms things like that and came back

1014
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:24,760
and immediately started growing weed and

1015
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:27,358
was you know growing weed by '94 in

1016
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:29,520
Michigan and it was again highly illegal

1017
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:32,078
and could only trust a couple people and

1018
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:33,759
it it built this camaraderie among a

1019
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:35,680
small group of people like you had one

1020
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:38,200
buddy that knew and then he had one

1021
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:39,838
buddy that he like started warming up

1022
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:43,719
enough to to include and then you know

1023
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:45,759
it just the circle stacked yeah and I

1024
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:47,318
ended up you know seeing the Grateful

1025
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,680
Dead having a great time with that

1026
00:36:47,318 --> 00:36:52,559
started growing herb growing dead seed

1027
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:54,399
nice you know picking up bags at every

1028
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:56,519
show I went to it was like chasing the

1029
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,280
kind bud at Dead shows how many eths can

1030
00:36:56,519 --> 00:36:59,838
I get of different things

1031
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:02,000
take home hopefully I find a seed in

1032
00:36:59,838 --> 00:37:05,000
this or a seed in that and growing it

1033
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,920
out and that was really my intro and you

1034
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,119
know so I chased around Black Market

1035
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:14,440
cultivation in Michigan until basically

1036
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:16,680
2000 and it started getting hot hot in

1037
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,119
Michigan for all of our team and that's

1038
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:19,279
when I moved to California I was like

1039
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:21,358
I'm either going to go to prison or I'm

1040
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,319
going to California so California seemed

1041
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:25,078
like a much better choice totally I was

1042
00:37:23,318 --> 00:37:28,000
a big fan of the Michigan skunk which

1043
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:30,000
was a skunk number one feno I it for

1044
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,159
years it was it was one of the true

1045
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,838
special ones yeah for sure yeah we did

1046
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:35,719
some breeding with it back in the day I

1047
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:37,880
did some feno hunting with some of the

1048
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:39,480
crosses but yeah it was special for sure

1049
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,720
it really was and that bubble gum that

1050
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,880
ended up in Michigan that yeah like we

1051
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:44,838
chased it down and got it out of

1052
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,760
Tennessee it was originally an Oklahoma

1053
00:37:44,838 --> 00:37:49,920
seed and it's it's so funny the story

1054
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,359
surrounding that and the the confusion

1055
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,039
the Indiana bubble gun that same bubble

1056
00:37:52,358 --> 00:37:56,000
gum exactly whether it was from Indiana

1057
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:58,480
or wherever it was from it started in

1058
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,159
Oklahoma Oklahoma that's where the seeds

1059
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:03,639
from that gray area um Cannabis Cup

1060
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:05,159
winning bubblegum went to Oklahoma yeah

1061
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:06,759
guys started growing it people had a

1062
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:09,639
falling out somebody went and stole

1063
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:12,040
cuting off of an outdoor plant and then

1064
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:14,920
it like got drifted out to Tennessee

1065
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:17,400
yeah I smoked it on fish tour in 1997

1066
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,639
and was like I will find this plant yeah

1067
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,920
and it took me a year and a half to

1068
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:23,199
track it down to a guy in uh in

1069
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,838
Tennessee and we got cuting took it to

1070
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:27,279
Georgia brought it back up to Michigan

1071
00:38:24,838 --> 00:38:30,440
it spread into Indiana from there yeah

1072
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:34,119
they blew it out in Amsterdam yeah

1073
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:37,720
literally uh Simon from Sirius Tony from

1074
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:40,318
SE Martha Adam Dunn all had their

1075
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:43,719
versions versions of it yeah and it's

1076
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:45,159
still a great base genetic and it's one

1077
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:48,519
of the coolest things about that bubble

1078
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:50,559
gum and kind of sidelining here but is

1079
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:52,159
that it was the first strain to me that

1080
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:53,799
I learned the difference between how

1081
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:56,440
things trickle into flower outdoor and

1082
00:38:53,800 --> 00:39:00,599
indoor indoor it's quick it stays small

1083
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:04,200
it's 56 is days super glossy smaller

1084
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:05,680
nuggets but like chunky and hard and ply

1085
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:07,799
when we started growing it outdoor we're

1086
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:11,799
like wow it's not finishing

1087
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:13,839
quickly it's stacking big giant tops and

1088
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:16,640
it all came down to the trickle into

1089
00:39:13,838 --> 00:39:20,480
flow and it really kind of opened my

1090
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:22,400
eyes to how that Dynamic of how things

1091
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,280
shift into flower whether it triggers

1092
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,680
all at once at 1212 or if it's a slow

1093
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,359
all right I'm kicking pre- flowers but

1094
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:30,679
I'm still stretching and building that

1095
00:39:28,358 --> 00:39:32,598
structure really opened my eyes to the

1096
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:34,879
way cannabis plant build structure and

1097
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:36,800
some of the equatorial plants how they

1098
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,838
go in and out of veg and they can keep

1099
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,720
taking double or triple or quadruple

1100
00:39:38,838 --> 00:39:44,119
size grow into flower yeah absolutely

1101
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:45,838
and like some of the original hazes were

1102
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:48,039
like that yeah especially the stuff

1103
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:51,000
coming out of Florida in the late 90s

1104
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:53,039
that those were the true true hazes all

1105
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,880
the Nevels and stuff like that and oh

1106
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:58,039
yeah that stuff would double triple all

1107
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:00,000
day long oh yeah and put out some

1108
00:39:58,039 --> 00:40:03,559
amazing smoke I still like smoking that

1109
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,800
stuff oh yeah yeah I mean those are the

1110
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:07,239
strands that when you walk into even a

1111
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:10,000
concert and somebody smoked a joint

1112
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:12,000
you're like where's that Haze at totally

1113
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,760
yeah that's that's a hard feno to find

1114
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,440
or a hard super Sil yeah yeah I mean

1115
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:19,640
it's around the the super silver is but

1116
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,880
again it drifted sweet A5 finding stuff

1117
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:24,679
like Neville's A5 stuff like that that

1118
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:26,400
was kind of ammonia almost yeah you know

1119
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:27,838
not catpiss but it was still am it was

1120
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,200
the closest thing to cat piss that I saw

1121
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:32,119
in Europe when people were like oh cat

1122
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:33,679
piss is like this and I I'm like what

1123
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:35,838
kind of that's a [ __ ] straight

1124
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:37,399
ammonia you know that was like ammonia

1125
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:38,920
Haze is what they should have called it

1126
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,400
yeah I love that you were saying you're

1127
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,960
working with the cat piss on the way

1128
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,559
down here we were talking about how much

1129
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:46,760
I miss the cat piss and cheetah piss

1130
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:49,119
isn't it like I like the cheetah piss

1131
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:51,440
but but it's not like the cat there's

1132
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:52,800
nothing that I've seen in 20 years

1133
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,000
that's the real cus I don't care what

1134
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,760
people say I'm growing some stuff out

1135
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,318
hoping it is but we're filming a

1136
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,760
documentary talking about the stories

1137
00:40:57,318 --> 00:41:00,960
and then also part of the documentary is

1138
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,480
recreating it and potentially using some

1139
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,599
of these Blends and stuff that we find

1140
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,838
that has interesting traits but you know

1141
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:08,480
we got super silver we got Northern

1142
00:41:06,838 --> 00:41:10,119
Lights and we're putting those together

1143
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,318
and we're doing some skunk with that and

1144
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:13,440
we're going to find some interesting

1145
00:41:11,318 --> 00:41:16,119
stuff along the way maybe we find it

1146
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,679
maybe we don't but cat piss is a

1147
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:20,480
description of a smell and Aroma and so

1148
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:22,078
there's multiple cat pisses even though

1149
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,000
people are like sure I had the real

1150
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,240
catus well you probably did and so did

1151
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,838
this guy and so did this guy and they

1152
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:29,399
could have all been different because

1153
00:41:26,838 --> 00:41:32,159
it's the description of an aroma not

1154
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:34,160
blue dream or not Romulan or something

1155
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:36,318
like that it's a very specific name that

1156
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:38,519
goes along with something sure yeah and

1157
00:41:36,318 --> 00:41:41,559
for me the original cat piss as I was

1158
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:43,880
told when I first started accessing it

1159
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:46,078
the Colorado cat piss was an nl5

1160
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:48,358
blueberry huh just like the cough is

1161
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:52,400
what that nl5 ha that Fort Collins yeah

1162
00:41:48,358 --> 00:41:55,400
right and it was that true F1 nl5 that

1163
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:58,240
circulated pretty wildly in the mid 90s

1164
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:00,800
that became breeding magic for everyone

1165
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:03,439
those lanky long arms that just were

1166
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,920
like the basis of what you could do to

1167
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,079
something that like put without little

1168
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:10,000
peanuts or it gave you structure and

1169
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:12,280
dependability to some of these more

1170
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,920
nuanced things yeah I still see NL

1171
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,640
popping up in all kinds of stuff we feno

1172
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,920
hunting that that doesn't necessarily

1173
00:42:15,639 --> 00:42:19,400
have it in its lineage but it's

1174
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:22,440
definitely NL you know unmistakably

1175
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:24,039
Northern Lights characteristics yeah U

1176
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:27,280
it got in there it got in the Jee pool

1177
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:30,279
heavy that's still a favorite of mine I

1178
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:32,160
into some from Eden Farms um shortly

1179
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,040
right after they won the emerald cup

1180
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:36,920
nice was it five or six years ago or

1181
00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:39,358
something and uh man I I sucked on that

1182
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,838
for for weeks I wouldn't share it with

1183
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:43,920
anybody I was I

1184
00:42:40,838 --> 00:42:47,000
was I was I know I told you that I had

1185
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:49,838
it and I was like I'm already

1186
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,920
out yeah that's I feel you I do that too

1187
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:53,119
I stash it to you know nobody including

1188
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:56,519
my wife can find

1189
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:57,800
it so and then yeah once I get attached

1190
00:42:56,519 --> 00:42:59,039
to something I want to smoke all of it

1191
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,160
and I don't mind sharing with my friends

1192
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:02,920
tooo CU I feel like that's the beauty of

1193
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:04,279
it is to be able to especially my

1194
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,800
friends that are super passionate it's

1195
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:07,079
like oh man I got to share I gota either

1196
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:09,039
smoke it with him or give this guy a

1197
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:11,318
little bit to smoke man you know I found

1198
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:13,400
myself in in my later years here where

1199
00:43:11,318 --> 00:43:15,480
like some strains really resonate well

1200
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:18,440
with me yeah and a lot of the newer

1201
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:21,400
stuff I I just just doesn't doesn't work

1202
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:24,240
well for me how about gelato you know

1203
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:25,838
not not a huge fan everything's gelato

1204
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:28,118
yeah I know I mean I feel like the

1205
00:43:25,838 --> 00:43:30,960
majority 80% of what's on the market is

1206
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:33,039
gelato based it's like the gelato is the

1207
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,880
foundation and maybe cookies even in

1208
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:36,838
with that yeah but the gelato

1209
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:39,280
characteristics are across you know it's

1210
00:43:36,838 --> 00:43:41,960
like the desserts we're in the the era

1211
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,960
of desserts yep right and I think I

1212
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:45,920
think it's beautiful and it's sad all at

1213
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:47,440
the same time the beautiful side is that

1214
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,720
we get people trying cannabis that

1215
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,318
probably wouldn't have normally smoked

1216
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:52,679
[ __ ] like catpiss right or skunk yeah or

1217
00:43:51,318 --> 00:43:54,358
any of that stuff you give that to them

1218
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:56,039
and they'd be like I'm not even touching

1219
00:43:54,358 --> 00:43:57,159
stuff that smells like that that's gross

1220
00:43:56,039 --> 00:43:59,519
then you give stuff that smells like

1221
00:43:57,159 --> 00:44:01,558
like candy or like cheesecake I mean we

1222
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:03,679
had some cheesecake Back in the Day Josh

1223
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:07,839
Freeman another guy that was his he had

1224
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:09,199
a cheesecake um but it wasn't so heavy

1225
00:44:07,838 --> 00:44:12,400
on the market you couldn't get stuff

1226
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:15,639
that tasted like papaya and mango and

1227
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:17,480
Skittles and whatever else Lucky Charms

1228
00:44:15,639 --> 00:44:20,159
there's some new lucky charm [ __ ] that's

1229
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:22,240
smells pretty serial like yeah I mean

1230
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:24,159
even the bubble gum didn't really smell

1231
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:25,719
like bubblegum back then it did on the

1232
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:27,440
plant like when you grew it it smell

1233
00:44:25,719 --> 00:44:29,679
like Bubblegum and then like when you

1234
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,920
smoked it it wasn't like you got fake

1235
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:32,919
bubble gum turps because that's really

1236
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:35,000
what bubble gum is is like that fake

1237
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:37,720
kind of bubble gummy smell that Booka

1238
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,280
you know yeah the Bazooka Joe yeah and

1239
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:40,719
that's that was my big disappointment

1240
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:44,920
over the years with bubble gum is it

1241
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:47,639
just didn't transfer to Aroma and flavor

1242
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:49,119
in the jar um some of the crosses did

1243
00:44:47,639 --> 00:44:51,199
much better with that but that original

1244
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:53,000
Bubble Gum as special as it was that was

1245
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:54,719
one of my biggest complaints about it

1246
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,639
right totally and I think it's a good

1247
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:58,919
breeder I think my buddy Rick from

1248
00:44:56,639 --> 00:45:01,159
Moscow KRA he's done some cool crosses

1249
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:03,079
with it he's a good guy he is he's been

1250
00:45:01,159 --> 00:45:04,920
on the show before okay yeah we're good

1251
00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:06,880
friends and we've done spannabis

1252
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:09,760
together a bunch and yeah he comes out

1253
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:13,079
and visits and good guy he's a foodie as

1254
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:14,839
well so it's funny that you really see

1255
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:17,079
people that get into cannabis turps are

1256
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:20,039
Foodies because we're we're living life

1257
00:45:17,079 --> 00:45:23,039
through the you know yeah old factory

1258
00:45:20,039 --> 00:45:24,480
senses it's like exactly TP Chasers yeah

1259
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:26,719
good chasing yeah we're just chasing

1260
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:28,679
flavors yep good wine good beer I love

1261
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:31,039
it yeah I mean I don't drink as much

1262
00:45:28,679 --> 00:45:34,239
beer anymore even though I love

1263
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:36,239
Lanas yeah it's tough man I yeah I used

1264
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:38,078
to work with lanus oh cool another

1265
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:40,239
company that was founded on the Grateful

1266
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:42,200
Dead yeah you know yeah I feel like we

1267
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:44,118
all have that Grateful Dead influence

1268
00:45:42,199 --> 00:45:45,838
absolutely a lot of us in the Cannabis

1269
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:48,760
industry do and other things you know I

1270
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:50,960
feel like Lanas is the perfect example

1271
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:53,160
you know Tony McGee Jeremy Marshall

1272
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:56,679
doing their things but like dead heads

1273
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:58,759
at heart and uh you know the the the

1274
00:45:56,679 --> 00:46:01,759
stuff they learned on either on tour or

1275
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:03,559
going to the shows or whatever kind of

1276
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,040
passed on and got carried in through

1277
00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:06,760
their business and we're like the

1278
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:08,880
evolution of the Grateful Dead in so

1279
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:10,760
many ways you know we're not musicians

1280
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,119
but we're we're carrying on a legacy

1281
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:15,240
that's much bigger than our own that was

1282
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:18,400
so well said I I I

1283
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:20,838
feel 100% the same that euphoria that

1284
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,800
moment that captured people at Grateful

1285
00:46:20,838 --> 00:46:25,159
Dead concerts became contagious and we

1286
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:27,200
wanted to take a piece of that home yeah

1287
00:46:25,159 --> 00:46:30,358
and share it with our community and and

1288
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:34,598
kind of live in that blist out moment of

1289
00:46:30,358 --> 00:46:37,000
you know a top quality eyes but you had

1290
00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:38,280
to find different ways to do it yeah

1291
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,318
well that's one of those things too like

1292
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:42,760
I mean they were part of a a bigger

1293
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:45,440
scene as well you know while obviously

1294
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:47,599
they were a Next Level and and proven

1295
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,880
themselves you know for five decades

1296
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:51,960
since they you know started out right

1297
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:53,559
you know but so much of that and where

1298
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:56,920
they came from and where they got their

1299
00:46:53,559 --> 00:46:58,760
magic from was this greater thing this

1300
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:01,159
greater love that was exploding through

1301
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:03,920
Northern California out of the summer

1302
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:07,118

1305
00:47:11,838 --> 00:47:16,960
yeah you got to see things you can't

1306
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:20,160
onse you know but like that that kind of

1307
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:23,079
stuff has because of that we are a

1308
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:26,480
direct effect of what happened in the

1309
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:29,280
60s and 70s it evolved into where we are

1310
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:30,599
this ation right now we can contribute

1311
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:33,079
part of this conversation that we're

1312
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:35,079
having to things that happened in the

1313
00:47:33,079 --> 00:47:36,800
60s and 70s thanks to the Grateful Dead

1314

there's going to be an amazing event

1328
00:48:03,719 --> 00:48:08,279
like a lot of the original prankster

1330

1331
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:16,480
like Mark Karan and some of those you

1332
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:18,358
know uh deepr rooted Grateful Dead

1333
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:20,679
connected musicians so it's going to be

1334
00:48:18,358 --> 00:48:22,679
special but those stories are going away

1335
00:48:20,679 --> 00:48:24,279
yeah and it's we really have to capture

1336
00:48:22,679 --> 00:48:25,838
them that's one reason I love what

1337
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:27,680
you're doing here thank you yeah and

1338
00:48:25,838 --> 00:48:29,279
that's one of the reasons do it is

1339
00:48:27,679 --> 00:48:30,879
because I feel like the oral history of

1340
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:33,440
cannabis we talk about this a lot but I

1341
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:36,240
feel like it's so important to capture

1342
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:38,079
the oral history of cannabis on the the

1343
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:39,879
levels that we can you know there's so

1344
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:41,599
many different levels and so it's not

1345
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:43,119
all about genetics it's not all about

1346
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:44,880
soil it's not all about lighting it's

1347
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:47,440
not all about any one of these things

1348
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:49,519
the cultivators it's all about us as a

1349
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:52,039
community but the individuals in the

1350
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:53,358
community and and the guys that were you

1351
00:48:52,039 --> 00:48:55,679
know we're on the shoulders of these

1352
00:48:53,358 --> 00:48:58,078
Giants that started the community and

1353
00:48:55,679 --> 00:49:00,598
those guys areow slowly dying off each

1354
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:04,440
one of them you know because you know

1355
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:05,798
time is so uh limited and so short and

1356
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:07,559
if we don't get it now we're not going

1357
00:49:05,798 --> 00:49:09,880
to get it you know and it's it's a

1358
00:49:07,559 --> 00:49:11,440
beautiful thing to be able to become

1359
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:13,318
part of a community that's so much

1360
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:16,280
bigger than yourself and you know this

1361
00:49:13,318 --> 00:49:17,920
energy force which we all are part of

1362
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:19,559
it's that Catalyst I feel like you know

1363
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,880
we get some of that feedback from our

1364
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:23,720
podcast for all grown radio where you

1365
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:25,960
know we've got subscribers

1366
00:49:23,719 --> 00:49:28,759
internationally yeah in Africa and in

1367
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:31,400
Europe that really you know they know

1368
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:33,160
cannabis from you know here and there

1369
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:35,519
but they don't they don't know the rich

1370
00:49:33,159 --> 00:49:36,279
history in Northern California running

1371
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:38,719
from

1372
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:40,680
helicopters you know the the the bush

1373
00:49:38,719 --> 00:49:42,358
era of you know breaking down people's

1374
00:49:40,679 --> 00:49:44,118
Gates and stuff like that I mean they

1375
00:49:42,358 --> 00:49:46,159
they there those stories to them they're

1376
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:48,358
like holy [ __ ] you guys really have been

1377
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:49,759
dealing with this for decades I think

1378
00:49:48,358 --> 00:49:51,960
people don't even understand the whole

1379
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:54,079
reason we grow inside now is because of

1380
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:55,760
the cops and the helicopters and people

1381
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:58,079
hiding from the cops like we'd probably

1382
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,599
still be growing outside 100% you know

1383
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:02,680
if if it wasn't like that in the in the

1384
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:04,880
late 70s or early 80s we would probably

1385
00:50:02,679 --> 00:50:07,399
still do the majority of our cultivation

1386
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:09,400
Outdoors it wouldn't be an indoor thing

1387
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:12,720
yeah well I'll I'll say something I

1388
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:16,639
never thought I would say thank you

1389
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:18,598
Reagan totally right I mean he drove it

1390
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:21,400
indoor and underground in a big way with

1391
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:23,000
the green sweep and like just attacking

1392
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:25,000
from the federal government standpoint

1393
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,798
and funding the state governments to

1394
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,318
attack it in the same way I can't I

1395
00:50:26,798 --> 00:50:30,318
can't wait to meme that later just a

1396
00:50:28,318 --> 00:50:31,558
little quick video of him being like

1397
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:33,920
thank you Reagan people are going to

1398
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:35,240

classic that's awesome I totally agree

1403
00:50:43,239 --> 00:50:48,159
man and indoor is great and it's how I

1404
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,838
was lucky enough to get started because

1405
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:52,000
we couldn't grow outdoor in Michigan you

1406
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:53,480
would you had five plants even in a

1407
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,079
cornfield and they would land a

1408
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:57,760
helicopter to kill five plants wow it

1409
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:59,160
was insane

1410
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,319
and you know but you could get away with

1411
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:03,679
a couple HIDs in the

1412
00:51:01,318 --> 00:51:05,199
basement yeah exactly know going back to

1413
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:06,358
the Grateful Dead you know one of the

1414
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:08,039
cool things when I first got to

1415
00:51:06,358 --> 00:51:10,119
California I got to I got invited to

1416
00:51:08,039 --> 00:51:13,119
live in this old Community intentional

1417
00:51:10,119 --> 00:51:14,559
Community commun if you have it yeah and

1418
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:17,160
and it was originally started by the

1419
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,599
Digger family in San Francisco you know

1420
00:51:17,159 --> 00:51:20,440
the people that started the human being

1421
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:22,680
and the and the open door clinics and

1422
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:24,000
the the the food kitchens for all the

1423
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:25,879
homeless kids that were flooding into

1424
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,239
San Francisco during the summer love and

1425
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:29,358
and Beyond

1426
00:51:27,239 --> 00:51:31,039
and I remember you know finding out from

1427
00:51:29,358 --> 00:51:33,318
some of the elders that had started it

1428
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:36,199
you know 25 years before I got there

1429
00:51:33,318 --> 00:51:38,639
that you know Janice The Grateful Dead

1430
00:51:36,199 --> 00:51:41,159
businesses in San Francisco some uh you

1431
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:43,639
know Hollywood stars had donated money

1432
00:51:41,159 --> 00:51:45,039
they put up money to buy this place to

1433
00:51:43,639 --> 00:51:48,039
kind of you know push in that direction

1434
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:49,679
of the Back To Nature movement and and

1435
00:51:48,039 --> 00:51:52,039
here I was living in this community

1436
00:51:49,679 --> 00:51:53,399
getting to know these people and and it

1437
00:51:52,039 --> 00:51:55,000
was for the first time you know being a

1438
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,639
dead Ed from New York City all of a

1439
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,920
sudden being like wow man I'm in nor

1440
00:51:56,639 --> 00:52:02,199
California and I'm like hanging out with

1441
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:03,960
people who are directly you touched by

1442
00:52:02,199 --> 00:52:05,519
the band by The Grateful Dead and by

1443
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:07,440
maybe what happened in San Francisco

1444
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:10,199
during that that really powerful era in

1445
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:12,599
our history and and like you said you

1446
00:52:10,199 --> 00:52:15,598
know there's like a like an honor of

1447
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:18,119
being a part of something greater than

1448
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:19,680
who we are as individuals you know and

1449
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:22,960
it's it's almost been like a

1450
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:24,598
responsibility to live differently like

1451
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,519
you know better intentions be a good

1452
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:28,079
person you know take care of your

1453
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:30,920
Community like there's those things

1454
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:32,519
where you know just that little you know

1455
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:34,680
I love what you always say germ of an

1456
00:52:32,519 --> 00:52:36,798
idea that started in in San Francisco

1457
00:52:34,679 --> 00:52:38,960
back whenever you know probably Beyond

1458
00:52:36,798 --> 00:52:40,719
San Francisco but uh maybe with those

1459
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,119
sunshines you know and then it just

1460
00:52:40,719 --> 00:52:44,199
keeps blossoming and spreading and

1461
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:46,720
spreading and spreading here I was 25

1462
00:52:44,199 --> 00:52:49,318
years ago butterfly yeah it was just

1463
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:53,239
such a beautiful powerful thing I felt

1464
00:52:49,318 --> 00:52:55,239
honored and so uh fortunate to be this

1465
00:52:53,239 --> 00:52:57,959
kid living in this you know community

1466
00:52:55,239 --> 00:53:00,318
that was started right from the roots of

1467
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:03,559
the very scene that I cherished and was

1468
00:53:00,318 --> 00:53:05,519
chasing around the country you know yeah

1469
00:53:03,559 --> 00:53:07,640
I mean there's a I have a lot of

1470
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:09,400
gratitude and I I try to live in

1471
00:53:07,639 --> 00:53:11,759
gratitude you know with so many things

1472
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:13,599
in the world going crazy and bad it's

1473
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:16,200
like there's so many things to still be

1474
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:17,798
grateful for you know I think that was

1475
00:53:16,199 --> 00:53:19,399
kind of the things one of the things I

1476
00:53:17,798 --> 00:53:21,159
learned from the Grateful Dead one of

1477
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,400
the things I learned from the music was

1478
00:53:21,159 --> 00:53:24,639
to always be

1479
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,240
grateful U you know no matter what's

1480
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:27,279
going on there's always a bright side to

1481
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:29,598
it

1482
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:32,880
yeah and I think for me part of it was

1483
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:35,960
learning to be accountable to myself to

1484
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:38,680
try and carry on the work of the legends

1485
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:40,440
that inspired me yeah right like it

1486
00:53:38,679 --> 00:53:42,639
creates this sense of responsibility

1487
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:44,240
you're like wow these guys did so much

1488
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:46,558
work to change the culture I wouldn't

1489
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:48,519
have gotten to live the joyous life I've

1490
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:50,920
gotten to live if they hadn't worked so

1491
00:53:48,519 --> 00:53:53,400
hard and struggled through getting rid

1492
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:55,920
in New Orleans and you know all of these

1493
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:58,960
crazy things the Timothy L's the Albert

1494
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:01,280
Hoffman like changing the world through

1495
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:04,318
deep dedication to their

1496
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:07,000
craft it inspires me to work harder and

1497
00:54:04,318 --> 00:54:09,318
to elevate the things that I feel

1498
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,159
nuanced about and I think that's really

1499
00:54:09,318 --> 00:54:13,159
a cool thing that's happened to this

1500
00:54:11,159 --> 00:54:15,639
industry over the last five to seven

1501
00:54:13,159 --> 00:54:17,598
years because of the way it exploded

1502
00:54:15,639 --> 00:54:20,279
you've taken your inspiration and moved

1503
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:22,960
it into genetics along with other things

1504
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:24,640
my my inspiration took me into soil

1505
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,798
science and like understanding what's

1506
00:54:24,639 --> 00:54:30,279
happening in the soil to grow better

1507
00:54:26,798 --> 00:54:32,639
cannabis and led me down this road of oh

1508
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:34,119
wow cocoa fiber is more sustainable oh

1509
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:36,598
wow there's a local company that just

1510
00:54:34,119 --> 00:54:38,160
started up trying to create cocoa fiber

1511
00:54:36,599 --> 00:54:39,880
mediums I'm going to go work with them

1512
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:44,159
because I feel like I can have a

1513
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:46,079
beneficial impact to myself to my peers

1514
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:49,838
to to cannabis in general in the

1515
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:53,798
industry and maybe find A New Path out

1516
00:54:49,838 --> 00:54:56,400
of this and it's really that ability to

1517
00:54:53,798 --> 00:54:58,599
like hone in on the microcosm of what in

1518
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,519
inspires you that I think builds

1519
00:54:58,599 --> 00:55:04,760
greatness in whatever it

1520
00:55:00,519 --> 00:55:06,599
is that you dedicate yourself to yeah

1521
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:08,000

00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:09,559
is short you know appreciate your

1575
00:57:07,719 --> 00:57:11,159
friends and family and make sure you

1576
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:15,160
tell the last thing he said was I love

1577
00:57:11,159 --> 00:57:17,078
you bro and so it's important say it to

1578
00:57:15,159 --> 00:57:19,118
the people that you care about say it as

1579
00:57:17,079 --> 00:57:20,680
often as you can don't feel cheesy don't

1580
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:23,280
feel like you can't say I love you to

1581
00:57:20,679 --> 00:57:25,719
your Bros it's important I cooked Wago

1582
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:28,000
steak for him so I went up there and so

1583
00:57:25,719 --> 00:57:29,439
so my partner was like you should see if

1584
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,199
there's anything on his bucket list you

1585
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:33,200
can help him out with and I'm thinking

1586
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:34,960
bucket list I got to ask him there's

1587
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:36,480
anything he he needs me to bring up

1588
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:39,639
there so I started like going down the

1589
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:41,679
list of you know cavr this or whatever

1590
00:57:39,639 --> 00:57:44,838
and you know can I cook for you and he's

1591
00:57:41,679 --> 00:57:47,000
like yes I was like have you had wagu

1592
00:57:44,838 --> 00:57:49,078
and he's like well I bought wagu at

1593
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:52,079
Costco and I'm like no that's not wag

1594
00:57:49,079 --> 00:57:54,440
yeah and so we got some A5

1595
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:56,160
bms2 and I brought that up there for him

1596
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:58,358
he lived in Japan but this was in the

1597
00:57:56,159 --> 00:58:01,480
80s early 80s so it wasn't the same you

1598
00:57:58,358 --> 00:58:03,400
know and the the wagu today is just it's

1599
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:04,599
like eating butter right and so I don't

1600
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:07,599
even personally like it that much

1601
00:58:04,599 --> 00:58:10,519
anymore I I got we blew out through Co

1602
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:12,000
we ate too much of it and so we'd had

1603
00:58:10,519 --> 00:58:13,880
parties at my house and I would cook it

1604
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,199
and I I didn't eat too much of it

1605
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:16,559
typically but a lot of my friends did

1606
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:19,439
but eating it so many times you just

1607
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:20,798
don't appreciate it as much and I'm big

1608
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,039
on like getting one or two bites of it

1609
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:23,679
and then I'm good for the night I don't

1610
00:58:22,039 --> 00:58:27,000
need it to sit on my stomach and make my

1611
00:58:23,679 --> 00:58:29,519
stomach upset yeah right uh but man it's

1612
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,280
uh it was special so I cooked we did two

1613
00:58:29,519 --> 00:58:32,880
podcasts one on Friday and then one

1614
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,119
again on Saturday he he only had enough

1615
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:36,920
energy to do about an hour and a half

1616
00:58:34,119 --> 00:58:39,680
for each one and I cooked wagu after

1617
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:41,079
each one and so we enjoyed a meal

1618
00:58:39,679 --> 00:58:43,598
together and he was there with his

1619
00:58:41,079 --> 00:58:46,519
family when he passed and just an

1620

1624
00:58:53,519 --> 00:58:57,480
just Next Level I mean passionate about

1625
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:59,760
the plant though yeah I met him at the

1626
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:02,119
first canacon we've at Royal gold has

1627
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:04,200
done yeah I think almost every single

1628
00:59:02,119 --> 00:59:06,599
canacon we've supported them since the

1629
00:59:04,199 --> 00:59:08,038
very beginning and you know great guys

1630
00:59:06,599 --> 00:59:11,079
they've they've done a great job of

1631
00:59:08,039 --> 00:59:13,280
helping get the word out helping nurture

1632
00:59:11,079 --> 00:59:15,880
um developing markets emerging markets

1633
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:17,400
and good Grassroots events you know

1634
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:20,240
putting on really good Grassroots events

1635
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:21,680
and there's not a lot of them um there's

1636
00:59:20,239 --> 00:59:23,038
been a handful of people that have put

1637
00:59:21,679 --> 00:59:24,639
on good events over the years and

1638
00:59:23,039 --> 00:59:27,680
they've done a great job with it yeah

1639
00:59:24,639 --> 00:59:31,000
big shout out to Dave man good work you

1640
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:33,598
inspired a lot of people yeah yeah I

1641
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,798
mean it's it's just amazing and then it

1642
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:39,079
just makes you realize how short life

1643
00:59:35,798 --> 00:59:40,960
really is U and how blessed we are to

1644
00:59:39,079 --> 00:59:41,880
have health yeah you know because

1645
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,920
without

1646
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:46,680
Health you don't have

1647
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:49,400
anything oh man I just turned 50 you

1648
00:59:46,679 --> 00:59:51,318
it's something all of a sudden it's like

1649
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:53,559
what they say is you get older you know

1650
00:59:51,318 --> 00:59:55,440
it happens something triggers I think

1651
00:59:53,559 --> 00:59:57,039
they call it like midlife crisis even

1652
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,358
you know sure I think I had my midlife

1653
00:59:57,039 --> 01:00:01,240
crisis when I was like

1654
00:59:58,358 --> 01:00:04,558
35 honestly

1655
01:00:01,239 --> 01:00:06,598
yeah so yeah I just but but you know

1656
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:09,240
it's it's funny because as we get older

1657
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:11,039
we become better storytellers so we can

1658
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:12,919
pass on I think it's genetics so we can

1659
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:14,920
pass on the stories and also we have

1660
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:16,318
stories to tell sure as we're older but

1661
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:18,440
like we're able to pass this stuff on to

1662
01:00:16,318 --> 01:00:20,519
the younger generations and you know

1663
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:22,838
it's a pretty cool thing yeah and you

1664
01:00:20,519 --> 01:00:24,920
know feeling that homage to people like

1665
01:00:22,838 --> 01:00:26,920
Dave people like pety it inspires us to

1666
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:28,519
do better work like you want to get

1667
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:30,358
involved in your community when you see

1668
01:00:28,519 --> 01:00:32,199
somebody like that pass and realize that

1669
01:00:30,358 --> 01:00:34,038
the work they were doing was so

1670
01:00:32,199 --> 01:00:35,719
Monumental and it's not happening

1671
01:00:34,039 --> 01:00:37,920
anymore because they're gone and who's

1672
01:00:35,719 --> 01:00:39,719
going to carry that torch and someone

1673
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:42,358
needs to step up and there's not always

1674
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:45,199
someone to step up unfortunately so

1675
01:00:42,358 --> 01:00:47,358
there's a a younger generation that us

1676
01:00:45,199 --> 01:00:49,199
that that really is getting exposed

1677
01:00:47,358 --> 01:00:51,838
right now or has been exposed for a few

1678
01:00:49,199 --> 01:00:54,199
years and they have the benefit of

1679
01:00:51,838 --> 01:00:56,400
generations of work that went into

1680
01:00:54,199 --> 01:00:59,038
making better cannabis better genetics

1681
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:00,599
better knowledge for them to take it to

1682
01:00:59,039 --> 01:01:03,280
the next level still and I'm really

1683
01:01:00,599 --> 01:01:05,838
excited to continue to have my mind

1684
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:08,119
blown by the younger generation new new

1685
01:01:05,838 --> 01:01:10,400
genetics new combinations of genetics

1686
01:01:08,119 --> 01:01:12,640
like the new blood I'm looking forward

1687
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:15,318
to it too and I I I think there are a

1688
01:01:12,639 --> 01:01:17,118
lot of lazy kids out there but there are

1689
01:01:15,318 --> 01:01:18,519
a lot of good ones too in the younger

1690
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:20,200
generation there's lots of lazy ones I

1691
01:01:18,519 --> 01:01:22,719
think my parents thought of the same

1692
01:01:20,199 --> 01:01:24,598
thing about my generation probably each

1693
01:01:22,719 --> 01:01:26,038
generation's gotten a little lazier

1694
01:01:24,599 --> 01:01:27,079
because of convenience and other things

1695
01:01:26,039 --> 01:01:29,039
for sure you don't even want to roll

1696
01:01:27,079 --> 01:01:31,119
joints anymore they want to do dabs you

1697
01:01:29,039 --> 01:01:33,359
know but but you know you heard that we

1698
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:36,200
walk to school both ways uphill in the

1699
01:01:33,358 --> 01:01:39,798
snow Barefoot right absolutely but no I

1700
01:01:36,199 --> 01:01:42,118
really did oh but but my grandfather's

1701
01:01:39,798 --> 01:01:43,679
generation they were tough on a

1702
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:45,960
different level my father's generation

1703
01:01:43,679 --> 01:01:48,159
was tough too like my father wouldn't

1704
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:50,079
take [ __ ] off anyway I've seen my father

1705
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:51,480
fight a lot you know fist fight and

1706
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:52,720
these younger guys they don't understand

1707
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:55,039
what that's all about now everyone has

1708
01:01:52,719 --> 01:01:57,358
guns and knives and stuff sure you you

1709
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:58,880
there was no internet talk [ __ ] on and

1710
01:01:57,358 --> 01:02:00,880
you didn't talk [ __ ] because if you did

1711
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:02,559
you end up learning real quick how that

1712
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:04,160
was going to go down oh yeah you know

1713
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:05,960
either you were going to get beat up

1714
01:02:04,159 --> 01:02:08,038
knocked out or you were going to be the

1715
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:09,720
one beating somebody up yep that's how

1716
01:02:08,039 --> 01:02:11,079
you settled stuff back in the day that's

1717
01:02:09,719 --> 01:02:12,598
just how it went down yeah you didn't

1718
01:02:11,079 --> 01:02:14,079
use knives you didn't go to jail you

1719
01:02:12,599 --> 01:02:15,798
didn't murder anybody you just went out

1720
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:17,480
and duked no one got in trouble you get

1721
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:18,960
in fights we got in fights too we never

1722
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:21,278
got in trouble I mean I wouldn't say I

1723
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:23,159
got in trouble a lot when I was a kid

1724
01:02:21,278 --> 01:02:24,639
but it wasn't the same like you weren't

1725
01:02:23,159 --> 01:02:28,078
going to get locked up for getting in a

1726
01:02:24,639 --> 01:02:30,639
fist fight yeah so yeah and you know I

1727
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:32,359
think now it's really kind of taken the

1728
01:02:30,639 --> 01:02:35,118
fight to I'm just going to outperform

1729
01:02:32,358 --> 01:02:37,558
you in whatever it is that's that I do

1730
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:40,119
and it has some benefits long term

1731
01:02:37,559 --> 01:02:42,278
you're like no screw you I'm G to grow

1732
01:02:40,119 --> 01:02:43,599
better streams than you I'm GNA develop

1733
01:02:42,278 --> 01:02:45,239
better genetics we're going to make

1734
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:46,640
better soil I don't like your soil I'm

1735
01:02:45,239 --> 01:02:48,358
gonna make it better yeah I don't need

1736
01:02:46,639 --> 01:02:49,759
to talk [ __ ] I just need to do the best

1737
01:02:48,358 --> 01:02:51,480
I can do at the end of the day I'm not

1738
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:54,278
in competition with anybody else doing

1739
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:55,838
genetics I don't see them as competition

1740
01:02:54,278 --> 01:02:57,519
uh if they see me as competition would

1741
01:02:55,838 --> 01:03:00,000
whatever I don't care but I'm just going

1742
01:02:57,519 --> 01:03:02,000
to be the best I can be and sometimes

1743
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,400
that stuff gives like the haters give me

1744
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,480
motivation to work harder wake up in the

1745
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:08,559
morning and get out of bed and work you

1746
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:10,519
know like that's what gets me going

1747
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:12,720
sometimes is the hate and I'm okay with

1748
01:03:10,519 --> 01:03:14,000
that yeah you know Finding motivation

1749
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:16,278
and so your enemies can make you

1750
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,798
stronger man when I came over to Royal

1751
01:03:16,278 --> 01:03:20,480
gold from a grower to uh to working with

1752
01:03:18,798 --> 01:03:22,759
the the soil that I was using as a

1753
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:24,559
grower it was interesting because I'm

1754
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:26,000
not I'm a lover I don't I don't get in I

1755
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:27,400
don't get caught up in any of that stuff

1756
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,440
and I just remember the other competing

1757
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:32,000
soil brands that were out there like you

1758
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:34,920
know trade shows and vendor days at grow

1759
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:37,278
stores and stuff I mean they were blown

1760
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:38,480
away you know with i' I'd come into

1761
01:03:37,278 --> 01:03:40,559
their booth and say what's up and

1762
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:41,760
introduce myself and you know talk to

1763
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:43,079
them for four minutes and then give them

1764
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,599
a hug and go back to my booth and they

1765
01:03:43,079 --> 01:03:46,599
would just stand there like the hell

1766
01:03:44,599 --> 01:03:48,318
just happened yeah you know and and

1767
01:03:46,599 --> 01:03:50,079
there was there was so much of that it's

1768
01:03:48,318 --> 01:03:52,558
a a lot different now and I think that

1769
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:54,559
that's kind of changed miraculously

1770
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:55,920
across the board with with you know most

1771
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:57,519
companies I think at this point we're

1772
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:59,519
all kind of out there as family even the

1773
01:03:57,519 --> 01:04:01,318
competing companies yeah and you know

1774
01:03:59,519 --> 01:04:03,559
we've all made it through this huge

1775
01:04:01,318 --> 01:04:05,558
tough time right this Whirlwind where a

1776
01:04:03,559 --> 01:04:07,079
lot of people fell off yeah and aren't

1777
01:04:05,559 --> 01:04:08,839
around anymore their companies don't

1778
01:04:07,079 --> 01:04:11,519
exist so if you're still around I think

1779
01:04:08,838 --> 01:04:13,440
there's a lot more support for people U

1780
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:16,159
also a lot of us have been around for

1781
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:18,599
quite a while so there's the we've been

1782
01:04:16,159 --> 01:04:21,278
to events for so long and the genetic

1783
01:04:18,599 --> 01:04:22,920
side is still weird people you egos oh

1784
01:04:21,278 --> 01:04:24,199
yeah you get especially with genetics

1785
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:25,838
these guys and that aren't even real

1786
01:04:24,199 --> 01:04:27,639
breeders talking like they're real

1787
01:04:25,838 --> 01:04:29,278
readers and it's like whatever dude like

1788
01:04:27,639 --> 01:04:32,118
I and I don't judge whatever you want to

1789
01:04:29,278 --> 01:04:34,440
do I just put out the best genetics that

1790
01:04:32,119 --> 01:04:36,798
I possibly can and I try to inform

1791
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:38,880
people the best that I can and hopefully

1792
01:04:36,798 --> 01:04:41,679
that's good and hopefully I'm successful

1793
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:43,240
at it you know yeah and 100% And you

1794
01:04:41,679 --> 01:04:45,558
look back to some of these genetics that

1795
01:04:43,239 --> 01:04:48,679
we were just talking about earlier yeah

1796
01:04:45,559 --> 01:04:51,680
it wasn't a master breeder necessarily

1797
01:04:48,679 --> 01:04:53,838
that ended up with the skunk one or bag

1798
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:56,759
seed that stumbled on what became

1799
01:04:53,838 --> 01:05:00,558
Northern Lights dog yeah that's the best

1800
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:02,799
example I mean Grateful Dead show 91

1801
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:04,519
yeah and and people took that

1802
01:05:02,798 --> 01:05:07,599
inspiration they're like wow this is

1803
01:05:04,519 --> 01:05:10,079
incredible how can I make it better or

1804
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:12,440
shape it in this way and so you know in

1805
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:14,318
a big way those are the people that

1806
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:17,400
inspire you your competition is the

1807
01:05:14,318 --> 01:05:19,480
people that brought you in energetically

1808
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:21,119
to the world yeah that you're like wow

1809
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:23,240
these guys are doing this thing this is

1810
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:25,160
cool I'm growing in this soil it could

1811
01:05:23,239 --> 01:05:26,519
be better what what could be better

1812
01:05:25,159 --> 01:05:28,038
about it

1813
01:05:26,519 --> 01:05:29,679
but really you got to pay homage because

1814
01:05:28,039 --> 01:05:32,920
you wouldn't be where you are without

1815
01:05:29,679 --> 01:05:34,879
that path through their products

1816
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:36,559
100% you know there's something to be

1817
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:39,798
said for give respect where respect is

1818
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:42,359
due as well but how do you guys get your

1819
01:05:39,798 --> 01:05:44,759
start with soil well was it just a

1820
01:05:42,358 --> 01:05:46,440
Immaculate Conception something that was

1821
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:48,000
like one day you decide because I know

1822
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:50,920
there there's been holes in the industry

1823
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,480
for me it was you know the seasons got

1824
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:54,760
harder and harder right I mean there was

1825
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:56,199
that window in Humble where you know

1826
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:58,559
there was an element of violence that

1827
01:05:56,199 --> 01:05:59,960
was coming out of the hills MH a lot of

1828
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:01,559
lot of shootouts in the middle of the

1829
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:03,798
night just firing into the darkness

1830
01:06:01,559 --> 01:06:05,798
across a creek you know and arming your

1831
01:06:03,798 --> 01:06:07,838
18-year-old trimmers and laborers that

1832
01:06:05,798 --> 01:06:11,599
are up there there's that element that I

1833
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:14,318
didn't sign up for um the ups and downs

1834
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:16,400
of the industry finding good workers

1835
01:06:14,318 --> 01:06:18,880
good people to help you run a farm on a

1836
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:20,720
hill that was always a challenge once

1837
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:23,200
once you paid them out that that first

1838
01:06:20,719 --> 01:06:24,639
dep they they'd fall off once everybody

1839
01:06:23,199 --> 01:06:26,358
got a little taste of that money like

1840
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:27,598
that was it they'd be at bar they'd be

1841
01:06:26,358 --> 01:06:29,400
up on top of the mountain at the full

1842
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:30,640
moon Rave I mean like or they get enough

1843
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:32,278
money they could do it on their own

1844
01:06:30,639 --> 01:06:34,798
right and there was a lot of that for

1845
01:06:32,278 --> 01:06:38,318
sure right and you know I have three

1846
01:06:34,798 --> 01:06:39,759
young kids uh my wife and I and I had

1847
01:06:38,318 --> 01:06:43,759
been working with royal gold since their

1848
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:45,278
first or second year and um it just you

1849
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:47,079
know I just kind of got tired of it I

1850
01:06:45,278 --> 01:06:50,440
needed something I just felt like I was

1851
01:06:47,079 --> 01:06:51,960
ready I had bad season um kind of hered

1852
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:52,880
out a bunch of stuff from a genetic I

1853
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:55,079
got from

1854
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:56,640
Oregon and I just felt like it was time

1855
01:06:55,079 --> 01:06:58,000
I was like you know what you know I can

1856
01:06:56,639 --> 01:07:00,358
still do a little something something on

1857
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,199
the side but I'm going to do what I feel

1858
01:07:00,358 --> 01:07:05,038
like you know I need to do for my family

1859
01:07:02,199 --> 01:07:06,879
to be more consistent have a steady pay

1860
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:08,760
I felt like I you know I loved the

1861
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:10,358
company so much I loved everybody when

1862
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:12,480
when we were already friends at that

1863
01:07:10,358 --> 01:07:14,038
time you know I think when I first

1864
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:15,358
started it was funny because I was like

1865
01:07:14,039 --> 01:07:17,160
you know kind of jumping around and

1866
01:07:15,358 --> 01:07:18,480
doing all kinds of stuff and he came

1867
01:07:17,159 --> 01:07:20,879
back from a sales trip he was the only

1868
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:23,079
sales guy for the entire company

1869
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:24,200
Nationwide and uh and I'm on a forklift

1870
01:07:23,079 --> 01:07:25,798
and he's like you know he knows I'm a

1871
01:07:24,199 --> 01:07:26,919
customer he's like hey re he's like dude

1872
01:07:25,798 --> 01:07:28,278
you can't just be loading your own [ __ ]

1873
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:30,599
you got to go off the forklift to know

1874
01:07:28,278 --> 01:07:33,039
and I was like no man I got a job bro

1875
01:07:30,599 --> 01:07:35,480
I'm working for Royal gold now yeah and

1876
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:37,359
uh he was like oh really he's like I

1877
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:39,440
have I have a better idea and he was

1878
01:07:37,358 --> 01:07:42,400
like I need to grow the sales team and

1879
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:44,880
you're perfect and that's how it happen

1880
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:47,160
yeah for me the soil is where it really

1881
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:50,400
all started like I've been growing since

1882
01:07:47,159 --> 01:07:53,399
like 94 and there weren't soils

1883
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:54,880
available like there are today we would

1884
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:56,880
get promix and we'd have to mix all of

1885
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:58,358
the individual amendments in ourselves

1886
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:00,079
and there wasn't a lot to pick from

1887
01:07:58,358 --> 01:08:01,400
there wasn't it was Pete Moss and there

1888
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:03,599
was really shitty stuff that you could

1889
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:06,599
get at like the Home Depot or the home

1890
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:10,760
base back then yeah or I think you could

1891
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:13,318
get a black gold yeah not out east not

1892
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:15,039
not out east was not available and fox I

1893
01:08:13,318 --> 01:08:18,920
remember the first bag of fox farm I

1894
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:21,719
even saw was in like 99 or 2000 wow so

1895
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:24,199
we'v been making all of our own soils

1896
01:08:21,719 --> 01:08:26,880
for years and years and you know I was

1897
01:08:24,198 --> 01:08:29,000
not the best student in in high school I

1898
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:32,960
was too busy Chasing The Grateful Dead

1899
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:35,640
and you know taking acid on the beach

1900
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:38,119
and so I wasn't going to graduate and I

1901
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:39,440
was like oh no so I had to take College

1902
01:08:38,119 --> 01:08:42,559
correspondence course and I'm like what

1903
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:45,798
can I do that's not going to just be

1904
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:49,039
painful and I took a soil science class

1905
01:08:45,798 --> 01:08:50,880
yeah and it absolutely blew my mind a

1906
01:08:49,039 --> 01:08:52,479
plant and soil science class that I

1907
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:54,798
started to understand the relationship

1908
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:56,158
with nutrients and everything related

1909
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:59,238
back to what I was doing and building

1910
01:08:56,158 --> 01:09:01,559
soils and cannabis and understanding oh

1911
01:08:59,238 --> 01:09:03,559
my God that crop five crops back where I

1912
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:05,839
had this issue that was pottassium that

1913
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:09,039
was phosphorus I was having calcium

1914
01:09:05,838 --> 01:09:11,679
issues and it just blew my mind I was

1915
01:09:09,039 --> 01:09:14,759
like oh there is some validity to this

1916
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:17,199
formal education business and you

1917
01:09:14,759 --> 01:09:19,640
know later on down the road I ended up

1918
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:21,318
in California growing and more soils

1919
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:23,079
were available but I was never happy

1920
01:09:21,319 --> 01:09:25,199
with them we were bringing things out

1921
01:09:23,079 --> 01:09:27,479
mixing trying to you know find something

1922
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:29,198
that was consistent which is the number

1923
01:09:27,479 --> 01:09:31,838
one issue I see with most soils out

1924
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:33,639
there is the consistency batch to batch

1925
01:09:31,838 --> 01:09:35,198
how do you build programs around

1926
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:37,239
something that's not the same every

1927
01:09:35,198 --> 01:09:39,439
single time became a really big

1928
01:09:37,238 --> 01:09:41,639
challenge for me and the sustainability

1929
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:44,238
of Pete Moss became a big concern for me

1930
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:46,920
as I started to you know done a lot of

1931
01:09:44,238 --> 01:09:48,079
environmental work and engagement over

1932
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:49,759
the years and that was something that

1933
01:09:48,079 --> 01:09:52,559
spoke to me I'm like oh man we got to

1934
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:55,640
stop draining Wetlands releasing all the

1935
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:57,480
carbon like this isn't serving the

1936
01:09:55,640 --> 01:10:00,440
purpose that I want to serve and cocoa

1937
01:09:57,479 --> 01:10:02,439
fiber became the thing so I learned that

1938
01:10:00,439 --> 01:10:03,439
there's a cocoa fiber company being

1939
01:10:02,439 --> 01:10:05,678
started

1940
01:10:03,439 --> 01:10:08,039
locally um when I was at the grow store

1941
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:10,239
and saw a bag of Royal gold clear bag

1942
01:10:08,039 --> 01:10:12,560
with a sticker on it it was just like

1943
01:10:10,238 --> 01:10:15,559
broken up bales of cocoa shoveled into a

1944
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:17,199
bag hand sealed and you know gentleman

1945
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:19,719
uh named chip had started the company at

1946
01:10:17,198 --> 01:10:21,639
the time and when I I was like oh I know

1947
01:10:19,719 --> 01:10:23,800
him from you know being in the hills and

1948
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:26,000
trimming and all that stuff and so I

1949
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:29,320
went and got a job there ran the

1950
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:31,000
research Gardens for a while and at that

1951
01:10:29,319 --> 01:10:32,960
same time the current owner of Royal

1952
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:35,640
gold Chad was there and we hit it off

1953
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:37,960
and you know had a vision together along

1954
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:40,320
the way of how much better it could be

1955
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:41,960
and how we could improve the soil

1956
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:46,158
industry as a whole through better

1957
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:47,760
testing better understanding better

1958
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:49,879
consistency

1959
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:51,320
Sops because we wanted to improve our

1960
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:53,800
grows and we wanted to improve other

1961
01:10:51,319 --> 01:10:56,679
people's grows yeah and that's really

1962
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:59,480
where it caught for me and you know so

1963
01:10:56,679 --> 01:11:01,319
much respect to Chad and and really chip

1964
01:10:59,479 --> 01:11:03,879
both they they gave me a platform to

1965
01:11:01,319 --> 01:11:05,519
Chase my passion sure and you know got

1966
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:06,840
to work in research and development

1967
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:10,080
helped do a bunch of the research for

1968
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:12,640
tuer helped lead the Kings mix research

1969
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:15,519
team blending up hundreds of different

1970
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:17,600
how much has Kings mix changed over the

1971
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:20,040
very little overall there's been some

1972
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:22,199
minor changes in the amendment package

1973
01:11:20,039 --> 01:11:24,960
from the first couple years and there's

1974
01:11:22,198 --> 01:11:28,079
been some changes as we started to have

1975
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:30,039
to hold our suppliers more accountable

1976
01:11:28,079 --> 01:11:34,119
yeah for their products specifically

1977
01:11:30,039 --> 01:11:36,800
perite Coco like what you got from these

1978
01:11:34,119 --> 01:11:39,679
big suppliers wasn't the same every

1979
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:41,560
single time and you had to hold them to

1980
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:43,920
that higher standard like no look we're

1981
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:45,920
taking core samples of our peite totes

1982
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:47,719
right look at look at this core sample

1983
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:49,440
there's all these fines there's this

1984
01:11:47,719 --> 01:11:51,439
problem there's that problem the Coco

1985
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:52,919
was all over the board with salt content

1986
01:11:51,439 --> 01:11:55,839
so we had to learn how to buffer it

1987
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:57,880
ourselves right so we rinse grind buffer

1988
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:59,679
looked at the science like okay this is

1989
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:01,760
what makes it good this is when it's

1990
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:04,239
within reason this is when it's outside

1991
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:06,560
of acceptable and we just hone those

1992
01:12:04,238 --> 01:12:08,039
Sops a bit at a time a bit at a time so

1993
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:10,080
those changes that you've seen in Kings

1994
01:12:08,039 --> 01:12:12,519
mix have largely been just improvements

1995
01:12:10,079 --> 01:12:16,479
in raw materials yeah more than a

1996
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:18,480
specific recipe change nice um which

1997
01:12:16,479 --> 01:12:20,399
again it's all about consistency once we

1998
01:12:18,479 --> 01:12:22,718
call something something and create an

1999
01:12:20,399 --> 01:12:24,759
expectation we want it to be stable we

2000
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:26,600
want you to be able to do the same thing

2001
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:28,719
with it every single time if you feed it

2002
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:30,920
day three we want you to feed it day

2003
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:32,639
three yeah you know well you guys used

2004
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:33,960
to have an organic I mean I still

2005
01:12:32,639 --> 01:12:35,800
consider your product organic even

2006
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:38,279
though it doesn't say organic on the the

2007
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:40,360
bag anymore you guys used to be organic

2008
01:12:38,279 --> 01:12:42,399
on the bag it said natural and organic

2009
01:12:40,359 --> 01:12:43,920
and that's a state labeling issue and

2010
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:46,198
what what you're allowed to say and how

2011
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:49,039
you're allowed to say it in labeling is

2012
01:12:46,198 --> 01:12:51,678
a freaking nightmare yeah age-old same

2013
01:12:49,039 --> 01:12:53,960
thing it's the exact same thing you know

2014
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:56,760
and those are some of my favorite prod

2015
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:58,439
yeah the the Royal gold yeah and and

2016
01:12:56,760 --> 01:13:00,440
I've learned it's about cleanliness not

2017
01:12:58,439 --> 01:13:01,919
about these certifications we're testing

2018
01:13:00,439 --> 01:13:04,000
for pesti doesn't matter about the name

2019
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:05,520
for me as much as it does the end result

2020
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,198
right at the end of the day it's

2021
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:09,239
something I feel good about consuming I

2022
01:13:07,198 --> 01:13:10,599
feel good about my friends consuming

2023
01:13:09,238 --> 01:13:12,399
yeah and you may not be certified

2024
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:13,880
organic in your breeding programs but

2025
01:13:12,399 --> 01:13:17,599
your products are clean and you're

2026
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:19,520
making sure it's consistent and up to

2027
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:21,159
your own standard yeah and I'm not going

2028
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:24,000
to call my stuff organic even though a

2029
01:13:21,158 --> 01:13:25,439
lot of it is yeah and that certification

2030
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,960
if somebody's an actual certif certified

2031
01:13:25,439 --> 01:13:28,759
organic farm then they have to use

2032
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:30,719
certified organic inputs abolutely

2033
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:32,400
outside of that I mean you know soil

2034
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:34,239
company with its own lab testing all of

2035
01:13:32,399 --> 01:13:36,119
its batches doing all of its hourly

2036
01:13:34,238 --> 01:13:39,238
production samples we keep it up to a

2037
01:13:36,119 --> 01:13:40,479
year to reanalyze it if needed like I

2038
01:13:39,238 --> 01:13:42,158
don't think anybody out there is going

2039
01:13:40,479 --> 01:13:44,158
through the kind of level of

2040
01:13:42,158 --> 01:13:46,119
accountability and quality control that

2041
01:13:44,158 --> 01:13:48,198
we are right there's plenty of organic

2042
01:13:46,119 --> 01:13:50,158
products out there that have tons of

2043
01:13:48,198 --> 01:13:51,719
contaminants because because it says

2044
01:13:50,158 --> 01:13:54,479
organic on the bag doesn't mean there's

2045
01:13:51,719 --> 01:13:57,439
not pesticides fungicides herbicides and

2046
01:13:54,479 --> 01:14:00,039
other contam Min you can take chicken

2047
01:13:57,439 --> 01:14:02,759
manure out of a regular chicken farm

2048
01:14:00,039 --> 01:14:05,439
compost it down and now it's organic

2049
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:07,159
composted chicken manure well those

2050
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:08,919
chickens were fed all sorts of crazy

2051
01:14:07,158 --> 01:14:10,759
things there's mitti sdes for their

2052
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:12,359
feathers that get the birds get treated

2053
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:14,600
with that all goes into the litter all

2054
01:14:12,359 --> 01:14:16,359
gets composted down those are persistent

2055
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:17,159
organic pollutants they don't go away

2056
01:14:16,359 --> 01:14:19,399
they

2057
01:14:17,158 --> 01:14:20,920
concentrate right so we audit our raw

2058
01:14:19,399 --> 01:14:23,198
materials and it was really at the

2059
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:25,639
beginning of 64 when they started

2060
01:14:23,198 --> 01:14:28,198
rolling out all of the new Cannabis

2061
01:14:25,639 --> 01:14:29,920
Testing guidelines that were like okay

2062
01:14:28,198 --> 01:14:31,399
well we need to test our soil like these

2063
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:33,119
people are going to test their flour to

2064
01:14:31,399 --> 01:14:36,839
make sure that we're

2065
01:14:33,119 --> 01:14:39,158
not failing people that they depend on

2066
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:41,600
us and we depend on them I saw a lot of

2067
01:14:39,158 --> 01:14:44,319
that going on too people failing their

2068
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:46,520
test because of their soil buying so

2069
01:14:44,319 --> 01:14:48,238
much soil that it broke their company

2070
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:50,360
I've saw that happen twice where they

2071
01:14:48,238 --> 01:14:52,599
bought their company got broken from

2072
01:14:50,359 --> 01:14:55,279
heavy metal specifically in the soil

2073
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:57,880
yeah you know one of the first the first

2074
01:14:55,279 --> 01:15:01,039
outdoor farm in Oakland it was uh you

2075
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:02,800
know was out by the water and uh it was

2076
01:15:01,039 --> 01:15:06,600
from the soil yeah and they bought

2077
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:08,400
shitty soil and they got shitty results

2078
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:10,560
and it sometimes is in the native soil

2079
01:15:08,399 --> 01:15:12,920
you know you're in Oakland there this is

2080
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:16,560
an industrial Wasteland Right Around The

2081
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:19,319
Bay what's gone on from an enironment

2082
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:22,039
yeah you just never know it's narley and

2083
01:15:19,319 --> 01:15:23,679
even like Selenas and Santa Barbara like

2084
01:15:22,039 --> 01:15:25,600
all these people were growing flowers

2085
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:27,399
and different crops that you could spray

2086
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:30,480
all sorts of pesticides herbicides

2087
01:15:27,399 --> 01:15:33,519
fungicides toxic toxic business that

2088
01:15:30,479 --> 01:15:34,799
then accumulates in the soil you know 30

2089
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:36,159
40 years later we're going to grow

2090
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:38,600
cannabis and people are failing their

2091
01:15:36,158 --> 01:15:41,238
testing from what people did literally a

2092
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:42,800
generation earlier that will always be

2093
01:15:41,238 --> 01:15:45,439
in that soil so we service a lot of

2094
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:47,320
farms that would like to grow in the

2095
01:15:45,439 --> 01:15:49,599
ground but they can't because their

2096
01:15:47,319 --> 01:15:52,279
ground's contaminated yeah there's a lot

2097
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:54,560
of contaminated soil especially Agland

2098
01:15:52,279 --> 01:15:56,559
yeah DDT DDT is still detectable

2099
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:59,400
everywhere yeah yeah and that's been

2100
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:01,960
banned since the early 70s y yeah that's

2101
01:15:59,399 --> 01:16:04,319
a big part of that whole organic versus

2102
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:07,480
clean you know conversation that we've

2103
01:16:04,319 --> 01:16:10,319
really been driving for 16 years we feel

2104
01:16:07,479 --> 01:16:12,678
like our entire my entire existence is

2105
01:16:10,319 --> 01:16:14,840
at this company has always been waging

2106
01:16:12,679 --> 01:16:17,639
an education campaign about why Coco is

2107
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:19,199
better why this is an issue and it's you

2108
01:16:17,639 --> 01:16:21,199
know we're just trying to elevate all

2109
01:16:19,198 --> 01:16:23,479
chips together right and then coming

2110
01:16:21,198 --> 01:16:25,799
from a community where we're all Growers

2111
01:16:23,479 --> 01:16:28,039
our communities are you know our kids go

2112
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:29,760
to school with you know other kids whose

2113
01:16:28,039 --> 01:16:30,679
parents are also Growers we're all just

2114
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:32,639
so

2115
01:16:30,679 --> 01:16:34,960
interconnected that was the the thing

2116
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:36,679
that I loved about the company the most

2117
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:39,520
was that it seemed like and still to

2118
01:16:36,679 --> 01:16:41,639
this day if something comes up where it

2119
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:45,080
becomes apparent that we could maybe do

2120
01:16:41,639 --> 01:16:47,480
it better we do it right it's always

2121
01:16:45,079 --> 01:16:49,920
done it's always like let's make sure

2122
01:16:47,479 --> 01:16:52,039
this never comes up again even if it

2123
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:53,800
happens one time you know what I mean

2124
01:16:52,039 --> 01:16:55,639
like if if the you know a bigger

2125
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:57,520
particle gets through and it comes you

2126
01:16:55,639 --> 01:16:58,800
know it comes in as a complaint well

2127
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:01,920
we're going to figure out how to you

2128
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:04,079
know make an extra layer of screens or

2129
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:06,399
you know put a magnet to collect you

2130
01:17:04,079 --> 01:17:08,479
know a screw or something like that like

2131
01:17:06,399 --> 01:17:10,359
every every single time for the last 12

2132
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:12,678
years since I've been been with the

2133
01:17:10,359 --> 01:17:15,439
company it's like every single thing

2134
01:17:12,679 --> 01:17:17,399
that becomes apparent that we can fix

2135
01:17:15,439 --> 01:17:19,238
it's always done well how you do one

2136
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:22,119
thing is how you do everything and you

2137
01:17:19,238 --> 01:17:25,119
start falling off yep so that's a great

2138
01:17:22,119 --> 01:17:27,079
point Y yeah and again I think it comes

2139
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:29,960
down to intention and that's one thing I

2140
01:17:27,079 --> 01:17:31,800
think that 100% it's all about intention

2141
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:35,239
Consciousness you know at the end of the

2142
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:37,679
day it's like uh conscious living and

2143
01:17:35,238 --> 01:17:40,000
being conscious of the choices and the

2144
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:42,520
decisions you make around you yeah being

2145
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,600
aware is half the battle we don't know

2146
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:46,719
what we don't

2147
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:49,719
know the goal is to educate and learn

2148
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:52,359
and better yeah and try to make the

2149
01:17:49,719 --> 01:17:54,000
right decision right and and learn from

2150
01:17:52,359 --> 01:17:56,119
each other CU I mean things that we

2151
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,600
thought were right 20 years ago weren't

2152
01:17:56,119 --> 01:18:02,079
right yeah the margarine and the butter

2153
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:04,159
debate over the years it's like so much

2154
01:18:02,079 --> 01:18:06,198
stuff though like in seed oils now

2155
01:18:04,158 --> 01:18:08,519
that's the big you know yeah do you

2156
01:18:06,198 --> 01:18:10,638
avoid seed oils seed oils are bad oh my

2157
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:13,040
God my wife every every time she listens

2158
01:18:10,639 --> 01:18:14,480
to a podcast and it reverses and all the

2159
01:18:13,039 --> 01:18:16,198
oil that we just bought over the last

2160
01:18:14,479 --> 01:18:17,879
two months is now in the trash and we're

2161
01:18:16,198 --> 01:18:21,238
doing going a different direction I'm

2162
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:22,800
like that's just change every two months

2163
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:25,559
the only thing constant has changed

2164
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:27,920
pretty much yep just do best every day

2165
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:29,719
that's all we can really aspire to

2166
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:32,800
totally and and you know try to have fun

2167
01:18:29,719 --> 01:18:34,679
doing it you know I think not taking

2168
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:36,520
life too seriously in some ways but

2169
01:18:34,679 --> 01:18:38,760
being serious about whatever you're

2170
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:40,719
passionate about I I feel like that's

2171
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:45,239
one of the biggest lessons that cannabis

2172
01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:48,399
taught me yeah is to slow down enjoy

2173
01:18:45,238 --> 01:18:51,799
that moment use it to reflect and move

2174
01:18:48,399 --> 01:18:53,920
forward in a better way yeah cannabis

2175
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:55,639
really lets you see your true self let

2176
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:56,920
you look in the mirror see who you are

2177
01:18:55,639 --> 01:18:59,960
and that's that's one of the beauties of

2178
01:18:56,920 --> 01:19:02,199
it too so the real smokers you really

2179
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:03,760
smoke you're looking at the your true

2180
01:19:02,198 --> 01:19:04,719
self and that's why some people don't

2181
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:07,800
like

2182
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:09,520
smoking yeah it can be a little scary to

2183
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:10,920
delve through our past traumas and we

2184
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:14,000
all have them we've all been through

2185
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:16,239
things that we' rather not admit rather

2186
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:19,198
not remember but confronting them face

2187
01:19:16,238 --> 01:19:21,959
to face and learning from them that's

2188
01:19:19,198 --> 01:19:24,919
the goal yeah well every experience from

2189
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:26,719
the moment you're born puts a filter

2190
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:29,119
over your eyes of that experience right

2191
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:30,319
and that that makes you who you are and

2192
01:19:29,119 --> 01:19:32,198
some of that can be good some of that

2193
01:19:30,319 --> 01:19:34,359
can be bad but we we all have past

2194
01:19:32,198 --> 01:19:36,039
trauma right and so that's one of the

2195
01:19:34,359 --> 01:19:38,439
beauties of being able to do

2196
01:19:36,039 --> 01:19:39,920
psychedelics and smoking cannabis I feel

2197
01:19:38,439 --> 01:19:42,079
like you can lift some of those filters

2198
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:45,000
back you lose some of that

2199
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:48,079
ego and uh ego is built off of that

2200
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:49,679
whole layers of filter as well you know

2201
01:19:48,079 --> 01:19:52,519
so if you can lift those off and see the

2202
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:55,440
world how it truly is it can be really

2203
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:57,280
eye openening it can be really scary but

2204
01:19:55,439 --> 01:19:59,719
it's also a great way to live when

2205
01:19:57,279 --> 01:20:01,599
you're seeing the world as it truly is

2206
01:19:59,719 --> 01:20:04,359
yeah it's puts you more in the moment a

2207
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:07,679
lot of times that's it for sure it's all

2208
01:20:04,359 --> 01:20:10,198
about presents living in the present

2209
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:11,560
yeah giving presents making people happy

2210
01:20:10,198 --> 01:20:12,359
and your friends around you you know

2211
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:15,880
it's

2212
01:20:12,359 --> 01:20:17,519
like yeah life's short yeah and and it's

2213
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:19,679
funny that birds of a feather flock

2214
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:21,840
together in this way and you know you

2215
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:23,600
you start to instantly connect with

2216
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:25,319
those people that feel that way like

2217
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:27,440
we've been crossing paths

2218
01:20:25,319 --> 01:20:29,319
probably for 15 years in the industry in

2219
01:20:27,439 --> 01:20:31,198
California but we didn't really

2220
01:20:29,319 --> 01:20:34,479
officially meet till last year and

2221
01:20:31,198 --> 01:20:37,399
instantly we were like just hit it off

2222
01:20:34,479 --> 01:20:38,879
and there was no pretext to it just like

2223
01:20:37,399 --> 01:20:40,839
wow I appreciate what you do and where

2224
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:42,039
you're coming from and you know 45

2225
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:43,719
minutes later even though there were

2226
01:20:42,039 --> 01:20:45,399
tons of people crowding around coming

2227
01:20:43,719 --> 01:20:48,439
after you for seeds we were just like

2228
01:20:45,399 --> 01:20:52,920
chitchatting so it's like I I really

2229
01:20:48,439 --> 01:20:54,439
respect that yeah it's funny how uh like

2230
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:55,719
there's there's alignment with people

2231
01:20:54,439 --> 01:20:57,759
and like we have a bunch of mutual

2232
01:20:55,719 --> 01:21:00,560
friends yeah and uh I mean that's how

2233
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:02,639
the industry is as a whole it's like all

2234
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:05,400
the people I meet I'm constantly meeting

2235
01:21:02,639 --> 01:21:06,960
new people and a lot of them even though

2236
01:21:05,399 --> 01:21:08,920
I don't know them I'm friends with

2237
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:10,960
friends that people they've known for 10

2238
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:13,279
or 15 years and I've known those same

2239

2240
01:21:13,279 --> 01:21:18,238
Alex yeah yeah yeah he's a great example

2241
01:21:15,719 --> 01:21:19,760
of somebody like I didn't know him till

2242
01:21:18,238 --> 01:21:22,079
he was on the podcast and we talked a

2243
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:24,000
couple times on the phone but him and I

2244

have a handful of mutual friends that

2245
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,800
have been friends for a long time with

2246
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:29,639

cross PA but like him and I hit he's

2248

2249
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:35,399
around for a long time y he know he

2250
01:21:33,319 --> 01:21:37,479
knows everybody totally that that's we

2251
01:21:35,399 --> 01:21:39,879
we talk about it a lot man the web

2252
01:21:37,479 --> 01:21:42,279
that's been created through cannabis

2253
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:44,319
it's deep it's deep I mean you know 20

2254
01:21:42,279 --> 01:21:46,519
30 years like it's amazing that

2255
01:21:44,319 --> 01:21:48,039
separation it's small these days I mean

2256
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:50,199
you if you get into talking to anybody

2257
01:21:48,039 --> 01:21:51,479
in the Cannabis industry at this point

2258
01:21:50,198 --> 01:21:53,479
you you know good luck getting 10

2259
01:21:51,479 --> 01:21:55,599
minutes in before making that connection

2260
01:21:53,479 --> 01:21:57,919
like wait you know what you you lived

2261
01:21:55,600 --> 01:22:00,960
where vetting out breeders and Growers

2262
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:02,560
is actually is fairly easy yeah because

2263
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:05,439
of the connections and because we're

2264
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:07,039
also interconnected you know even on an

2265
01:22:05,439 --> 01:22:09,479
international scale there's only a

2266
01:22:07,039 --> 01:22:11,760
handful of people at the top and doing

2267
01:22:09,479 --> 01:22:14,638
this stuff all on a commercial level as

2268
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:16,639
well so yeah and as a breeder I'm I

2269
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:18,800
can't imagine that that's a really

2270
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:20,679
unique place to be connected into the

2271
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:23,440
community through and you know looking

2272
01:22:20,679 --> 01:22:26,840
at you know some of the Giants the SAS

2273
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:29,759
the jackers like those people defined

2274
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:31,560
the industry for a lot of us um even

2275
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:34,880
before we knew what the industry was or

2276
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:37,520
where it was going and you know I never

2277
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:40,880
met s but I was lucky enough to meet

2278
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:42,120
Jack a long time ago and som's a good

2279
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:44,840
friend of mine we just talked about it

2280
01:22:42,119 --> 01:22:46,719
on the last podcast wow he's he's quite

2281
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:48,880
the character and a really good yeah

2282
01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:50,279
he's like family what an inspiration I

2283
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:52,239
mean for me as a kid when I was

2284
01:22:50,279 --> 01:22:54,238
cultivating looking at his Soma beds and

2285
01:22:52,238 --> 01:22:56,678
focusing on all Organics and breeding it

2286
01:22:54,238 --> 01:22:58,000
him I was a dreadlock hippie was like

2287
01:22:56,679 --> 01:22:59,520
all you need to do is fly to Amsterdam

2288
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:01,520
you can go hang out with someone all

2289
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:04,199
right literally all you have to do I

2290
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:06,400
he'd love to meet you he's very

2291
01:23:04,198 --> 01:23:08,559
inclusive of people in the community

2292
01:23:06,399 --> 01:23:10,039
especially if you like smoking is the

2293
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:11,239
one thing that I can guarantee that's

2294
01:23:10,039 --> 01:23:13,840
going to happen when you go to S house

2295
01:23:11,238 --> 01:23:16,919
is you're gonna smoke a lot sign me up

2296
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:18,840
yeah yeah he he had a N9 foot long beard

2297
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:23,399
at one point and you know 17 foot long

2298
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:24,760
dreads at one point and 50 some odd cats

2299
01:23:23,399 --> 01:23:26,559
but and he has the most amazing house

2300
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:29,199
and he's

2301
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:31,880
just yeah and he was the inspiration for

2302
01:23:29,198 --> 01:23:34,319
me before I met him as well and I knew

2303
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:35,920
his genetics before and he's just a

2304
01:23:34,319 --> 01:23:38,719
allaround

2305
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:42,480
character um you know I'd love to go

and just a amazing amazing time we we've

2340
01:24:48,479 --> 01:24:52,839
been talking about you know since before

2341
01:24:50,359 --> 01:24:55,479
the pandemic and obviously not having

2342
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:57,480
the ability to get our soils over sees

2343
01:24:55,479 --> 01:24:59,759
you know definitely makes it a little a

2344
01:24:57,479 --> 01:25:01,519
little um interesting is trying to

2345
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:03,760
figure out what what's the where's the

2346
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:04,960
worth you know um other than being an

2347
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:06,280
international brand getting your

2348
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:08,319
branding out there half the people that

2349
01:25:06,279 --> 01:25:10,599
go there obviously from the States from

2350
01:25:08,319 --> 01:25:12,479
what I've heard y um we are opening up a

2351
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:15,039
facility currently in South Carolina

2352
01:25:12,479 --> 01:25:16,759
which is going to change the the

2353
01:25:15,039 --> 01:25:19,039
direction of the company going forward

2354
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:20,719
yeah you know so I'd love to go yeah

2355
01:25:19,039 --> 01:25:22,238
it's amazing how many inquiries we get

2356
01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:24,039
from over there of people wanting our

2357
01:25:22,238 --> 01:25:26,039
product but shipping soils around the

2358
01:25:24,039 --> 01:25:27,679
globe is a challenge doesn't make sense

2359
01:25:26,039 --> 01:25:29,560
really it doesn't really necessarily

2360
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:31,399
make sense and as much as we'd love to

2361
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:33,440
service those people that's not

2362
01:25:31,399 --> 01:25:37,599
necessarily the the best decision for

2363
01:25:33,439 --> 01:25:39,198
all of us yeah well we have facilities

2364
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:40,880
buying our product now and paying more

2365
01:25:39,198 --> 01:25:43,158
to ship it than the actual cost of the

2366
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:44,840
material I believe and they're doing it

2367
01:25:43,158 --> 01:25:46,759
and they're excited about the fact that

2368
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:48,279
they're going to be able just you know a

2369
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:50,400
few months I think we're looking at like

2370
01:25:48,279 --> 01:25:51,920
sometime in summer we should be able to

2371
01:25:50,399 --> 01:25:54,118
you know be up and running and producing

2372
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:56,600

2373
