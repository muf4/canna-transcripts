you here you know we actually have a lot

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,920
of mutual friends we you know they go

11
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,080
back into the 90s turns out we do huh

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,759
pretty crazy right yeah it's about it's

13
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:34,738
it's funny talking to people before the

14
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,079
show and then you you realize that [ __ ]

15
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:39,479
we had Direct connection with a lot of

16
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,399
people you know I think both being from

17
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:43,259
the area and then the connection to the

18
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,878
Rave scene you know which kind of

19
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:46,558
evolved into the Cannabis scene to a

20
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,419
degree I agree I mean a lot of those

21
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,399
players a lot of our old friends are now

22
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,439
you know big players yeah I mean even

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,480
when the first time I saw your logo it

24
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:56,640
reminded me of a rave flyer and then

25
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:57,898
also Panhandle records my friend Elijah

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,359
Mayhew from back in the day is like one

27
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,280
of my best friends growing up he had the

28
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,260
Panhandle with the muni style logo and I

29
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,299
love the it's it's just you see it you

30
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,340
recognize it it's ingrained it's like if

31
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,720
you're from the bay you know that logo

32
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,579
right Elijah was definitely an

33
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:13,920
inspiration by the way I always loved

34
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:15,719
his brand I love the ESD J Co brand that

35
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,519
was another totally another old school

36
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:19,679
brand that was around but yeah talking

37
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:22,199
to you one thing that I realized ever

38
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,759
more is that the big ogs have been

39
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,439
around for a minute and most of us

40
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,478
haven't done anything but cannabis right

41
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,099
yeah I think that's why we grow such

42
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:32,158
good weeds yeah we've all been smoking

43
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:34,259
forever you know like the one thing I

44
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,479
can say is that the weed back in the bay

45
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,159
in the 90s was [ __ ] amazing

46
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:41,039
absolutely it was really really really

47
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,020
good stuff it was incredible uh you know

48
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,840
people talk about how great the flower

49
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:47,519
is now and I mean I think the stuff that

50
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,240
we would get even the stuff on average

51
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:53,158
the indoor stuff was up to par with the

52
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:54,478
best stuff today I agree and it was it

53
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,118
was different right it was not as

54
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:59,219
homogeneous as today it wasn't all

55
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:00,478
gelato right and you got you meet a guy

56
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:03,000
and he gives you something that you've

57
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,259
never smelled or tasted before also

58
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,519
because I think the Breeders weren't

59
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,500
hanging out as much with each other

60
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:09,000
right so there was less

61
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,618
cross-pollination absolutely and people

62
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,939
were popping seeds and and getting

63
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:13,378
genetics you know there's a handful of

64
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:15,180
people popping seeds and you could get

65
00:02:13,378 --> 00:02:17,579
clones from certain places but it's like

66
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,080
there was still stuff you know I mean

67
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,239
we're getting European stuff we were

68
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,800
getting stuff from South America there

69
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:24,599
was like a mix of all kinds of different

70
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,160
stuff Durbin was going around yeah a lot

71
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:28,500
of land races yeah that was the beauty

72
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,659
back then a lot of land races and a few

73
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,479
land race Cali wheat crosses for sure

74
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:35,400
Calio yeah you know Chris that was

75
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:37,619
another one that I really liked yeah

76
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,000
yeah I mean we had stuff that was going

77
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,739
in the 70s that you just don't see

78
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,080
anymore like the Calio for example right

79
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:45,719
like I think because it vegged so long

80
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,060
people weren't and at a certain point

81
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:49,939
everything became an eight-weeker yeah

82
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,959
that's when we lost everything

83
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:53,579
became an eight week yeah we got

84
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,200
scariest when it went to six weeks yeah

85
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,000
like the four minutes you know for a

86
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,859
minute yeah Lamb's bread was one of

87
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,620
those somebody tried to send sold us a

88
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:03,360
lamb's breath cut like six weeks the

89
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,580
thing was done you were scoping it and

90
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,200
you're like no way crazy so we did

91
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,580
produce that for a minute I still have a

92
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:10,018
cut of that so I should that's awesome

93
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,659
I'll give you one of them oh yeah

94
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:15,060
great I love Lamb's red orange Hill

95
00:03:12,658 --> 00:03:17,878
those Jamaican varieties are super

96
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,620
special I agree and uh the other thing

97
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:21,179
in the in the bay is back in the day I

98
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,640
realized like you had Growers that

99
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,519
really really concentrated and

100
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:27,779
specialized in one thing like the GDP or

101
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:29,819
then you'd meet someone that was only

102
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,280
growing hazes but had the haze Market

103
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:34,259
sort of on lockdown or the OG guy and

104
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,878
that's all he grew was OG and he

105
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:37,259
probably got a pound per light with the

106
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:38,878
older yeah but nobody [ __ ] with him

107
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:40,560
nobody went and grew the same thing that

108
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:42,479
there was like this unwritten law of

109
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,340
this is my strain what I'm known for is

110
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:45,899
what you're known for right and we were

111
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,120
all kind of complimenting each other's

112
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,459
packs not trying to sell the whole box

113
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,599
for sure I think a lot of people got

114
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,680
into breeding that way because they

115
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:54,238
wanted something that was different than

116
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,920
everybody else wanted to do something of

117
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,599
their own I mean we love Sour Diesel and

118
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,339
so I wanted my own Sour Diesel because I

119
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:02,818
love all my friends grew sourdie so we

120
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:05,819
we love Saturday yeah the real Sour is

121
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:07,378
is super special yes it is so yeah or

122
00:04:05,818 --> 00:04:08,818
you have a room hermed out and next

123
00:04:07,378 --> 00:04:10,919
thing you know you got cookies you know

124
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:13,259
that could happen too good company some

125
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:14,699
of these guys you know they're like oh

126
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:15,798
yeah we got a million seeds what are we

127
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:20,060
gonna do with them

128
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:20,060
don't worry about checking them or yeah

129
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,120
you know and I mean early on I learned

130
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:26,759
my lesson selling stuff that was

131
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,918
untested once and then you know that it

132
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:31,680
was good I learned it early on you know

133
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:33,719
and now it's like even still I will sell

134
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,918
stuff that has intersex trades but I

135
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,540
want to make people aware if you go to

136
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:38,039
my website you look there's a couple of

137
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,360
the genetics that we saw on there they

138
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,879
have intersex trades but I think that's

139
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,020
special but I'm aware of it and I'm like

140
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:44,759
you know and if you're gonna buy it

141
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:47,279
you're also aware of it you know the

142
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:48,600
contest winner uh we'll see we're

143
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,459
announcing our contest winner on

144
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,500
Thursday we loud Loops we sent out 100

145
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:55,258
packs of seeds a little over 100 in

146
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,519
December we got 18 entries back I've

147
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:59,160
narrowed it down to ten we're gonna

148
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:01,319
smoke two of them today but I feel like

149
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,060
some of the people got intersex traits

150
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:04,978
and maybe part of it is by putting them

151
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,839
into flour too early also it's in the

152
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:08,180
genetics but I feel like the genetics

153
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:10,739
are so special when you smoke this stuff

154
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:13,379
you'll give me your opinion I'm sure but

155
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,540
uh man it's sometimes it's it's worth it

156
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:17,399
and other times it's not I agree I think

157
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,199
as long as it's disclosed right so we've

158
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:20,819
been we've been growing the gummies for

159
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,978
about two years now has a lot of

160
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:25,439
intersex trades yeah it's not very

161
00:05:22,978 --> 00:05:28,019
stable but when it is to your point it's

162
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:29,579
unbelievable yeah I mean exotic genetics

163
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:32,279
I feel like Mike has made a whole

164
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:33,959
company based on stuff that may or may

165
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:35,638
not have intersex trades but it's all

166
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:37,439
phenomenal and I love exotic by the way

167
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:38,939
we definitely are always down to pop and

168
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:41,279
try totally a point because when you do

169
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:42,779
find something it's usually just fire

170
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,679
well yeah and one thing I can say about

171
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:48,119
exotic that I appreciate is something

172
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,160
that he does is he'll take something and

173
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,379
he'll work it into something better so

174
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,539
his red pop I wasn't a huge fan of the

175
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:56,519
red pop because it has this purple punch

176
00:05:54,538 --> 00:05:57,899
kind of like let down when I was growing

177
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:59,579
it I was growing it and I was doing some

178
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:01,079
crosses with it and I'm like smelling

179
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:03,359
I'm like oh [ __ ] this is like Cherry

180
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:05,639
Cola this is really really good this is

181
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,620
a special one right and then we at the

182
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:09,180
end I had one of my friends flower some

183
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,639
out and I went to smoke it and I'm like

184
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:14,519
oh it's purple punch yeah but then

185
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,019
purple punch but it was one cross away

186
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:17,819
from being special he crossed it with

187
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:20,038
the runts and had that that was what the

188
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:22,199
red runs was and then the red ones runs

189
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:23,939
was amazing like really really really is

190
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:26,759
that what red ones was red runts is that

191
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:28,500
red pop times runs and it's I think it's

192
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:30,240
great I mess with your orange Blow Pop

193
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,579
loved it totally smelled like orange

194
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,960
crush I grew it and I called all my

195
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:36,538
girls and like this [ __ ] smells like

196
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:39,120
orange crush like actual oranges oh yeah

197
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:42,060
that's a sweet sugary you know Exotics

198
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,100
is yeah his stuff is sugary a lot of it

199
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,600
checks the boxes well we have a

200
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,300
different taste in the bay though yeah

201
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,860
very very particular taste than the veg

202
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,720
we keep going back to Skittles which

203
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,220
that's okay yeah I like Skittles have

204
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,979
you ever tried the Polly Shore the

205
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,840
Polynesian so I I'll give you a cut of

206
00:06:55,978 --> 00:07:00,000
that it's a it's one of those super old

207
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:02,038
school 90s strains we were talking about

208
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,759
wow probably takes about eight to nine

209
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:07,379
weeks at least

210
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:09,419
yeah totally but when you smoke it just

211
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:11,100
the smoke alone is so thick yeah like

212
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:15,839
wow okay this is a really special smoke

213
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:18,240
has like notes of cinnamon earthy and

214
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:19,799
then some weird funk I always call it

215
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,259
the dog [ __ ] terpene because I can't

216
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,598
really put a better name yeah we always

217
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:27,060
had cat piss back in the day the smoke I

218
00:07:24,598 --> 00:07:28,500
mean that stuff was I cat pissed in the

219
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,180
90s was amazing that was another one

220
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,538
that only few people grew and there was

221
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,538
a catfish

222
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:37,680
you got your cat piss from him and only

223
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:39,840
him you know it's like mine was a guy

224
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,939
named Gus and my buddy Steve but they

225
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:44,519
they all got it from the same exact guy

226
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:46,978
and uh it was 60 a straight up we'd buy

227
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:49,139
ounces for 480 dollars the good old time

228
00:07:46,978 --> 00:07:50,339
good old times yeah and it looked like

229
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:52,560
[ __ ] in the bag that's the other thing

230
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:55,560
the cat piss that we got was not chunky

231
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,939
fat buds it was like shredded calyx

232
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,680
sometimes but you opened the bag and

233
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:00,000
you're like God damn you didn't know it

234
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,038
happened you didn't open the bag you

235
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,478
knew that you know I was like it would

236
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:05,339
be in your pocket or it would be in a

237
00:08:03,478 --> 00:08:07,680
backpack or be in 10 bags yeah the money

238
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:10,859
on that was strong so strong though yeah

239
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,418
it wasn't like so my experience with

240
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,860
catfish it wasn't gassy like a lot of

241
00:08:12,418 --> 00:08:16,258
people try to say gassy it was Styles

242
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,300
but it was skunk files like real like

243
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:20,160
when you talk about roadkill skunk

244
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,660
that's the closest to roadkill skunk

245
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,520
that there is I always thought it had

246
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:26,400
more of a pungent sort of blue cheese

247
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:28,500
kind of it was it was so pungent in

248
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,120
their nostrils yeah exactly yeah I mean

249
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,560
I think a lot of people didn't even like

250
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,418
the smell of it they were like no they

251
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,740
didn't yeah absolutely I mean like I

252
00:08:33,418 --> 00:08:36,120
have friends like oh this is gross and

253
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,940
then they would immediately packable

254
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:41,879
yeah well I remember when the European

255
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:44,640
genetics really started coming into uh

256
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:47,100
the bay in the 90s we started getting

257
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:49,199
through the third floor through some of

258
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,120
the what was the one in Oakland there

259
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,278
was the it was the blue something the

260
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,720
Blue Sky Cafe Blue Sky Cafe and the

261
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:56,519
Clones in the back yeah you get the

262
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,620
clown from the guy Cafe great clones I

263
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:01,139
think that's where we got the blue dream

264
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,720
clone from the guy was like uh our

265
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:05,399
Buddy's dad went to buy clones and the

266
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,259
guy's like give me something that that

267
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:09,419
not everybody grows and he's like I got

268
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:11,039
this really sad looking plant here and

269
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:13,259
it was blue dream and our buddies dad

270
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:15,059
took it to his house a little finicky

271
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:17,338
and veg but then it just [ __ ] got

272
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:18,719
crushed Blue Dream yeah that's how we

273
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:21,240
were we were some of the people that

274
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,000
hoard out blue dreams as far as Blue

275
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,940
Dream is the apical of structure yield

276
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,139
all those things Blue Dream is it checks

277
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,760
the boxes maybe it doesn't check the

278
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:31,500
boxes on the terpene profile or the

279
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:32,939
effect but when it came out it did

280
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,940
everybody wanted to do a dream it was

281
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,380
going for 30. I mean I think people

282
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,540
still like it they just don't want to

283
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:41,159
admit they like it sure sure but yeah

284
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:42,778
and you know it's a milder effect so

285
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:44,278
it's definitely a lighter sativa I feel

286
00:09:42,778 --> 00:09:46,019
like that was the one if we're going on

287
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:47,100
a hike or if we're going bowling or

288
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,899
whatever we were doing back in the day

289
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,519
that would be like okay let's smoke some

290
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:51,720
blue that was my road trip we'd if I

291
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:53,240
have to drive for eight hours I don't

292
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,259
want to get too tired

293
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,879
you're good to go you're smiling the

294
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:59,759
whole time yeah we had that and green

295
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:01,320
crack and do the Green Crack was they

296
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:02,639
they'd grow because the flowering time

297
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,720
was very similar on those so you could

298
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:05,100
grow them together in the same room

299
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,540
because I liked harvesting all my stuff

300
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,040
I didn't want to have to harvest they

301
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,719
wait two more weeks or three more weeks

302
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:11,579
have happened to them two rooms oh yeah

303
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,560
yeah seriously wasting your electricity

304
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,180
so I grew them together and the Green

305
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:17,278
Crack was good for like the first couple

306
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:19,259
weeks because you get super ripped but

307
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:20,458
then your tolerance would go so high it

308
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:22,620
wouldn't even get you high yeah you'd

309
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:23,759
smoke big old bats of it and then the

310
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,139
next thing you know [ __ ] it's not

311
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:26,759
getting you high I feel that way about a

312
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:28,259
lot of the current strains yeah and I

313
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:30,419
think also the reason people mix up

314
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:32,399
strain so much is because they all have

315
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:33,479
a ceiling right you get pretty immune

316
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,039
when most people don't notice it because

317
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,720
they switch so much right but yeah I

318
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:38,338
think most most of the genetics do have

319
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,860
ceilings but when you when you test it

320
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:42,779
when you test for yourself dude to judge

321
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,940
if you like the flower my usual rule is

322
00:10:42,778 --> 00:10:46,919
I'll only smoke an ounce of this no

323
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,660
other weed for the next two days and of

324
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:50,338
course if I like it then I really like

325
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:52,139
it if I can smoke an ounce in two days

326
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:54,120
and not want to smoke anything else then

327
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:56,039
that's a good strain to me yeah it's

328
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,539
it's hard to find yeah those kind of

329
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:58,740
genetics especially even just the

330
00:10:57,539 --> 00:11:00,958
genetic side but then also the

331
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:03,539
cultivation and the guys growing I mean

332
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:06,000
there's a lot of flour out there there's

333
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:07,500
not a lot of amazing flour out there

334
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,299
it's easy to go read it's hard to grow

335
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,159
good weed right that's kind of what it

336
00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:12,899
is but I think the auto problem is the

337
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:15,059
automation the fertigation everything

338
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:16,980
everybody is buying the same [ __ ] from

339
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:19,679
the same people now so you really it

340
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:22,740
kind of loses that Personal Touch right

341
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:24,479
um as well as just back in the day if we

342
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:26,759
had houses that were closer to the beach

343
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,620
in the sunset that would guaranteed be

344
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:30,179
done three four days earlier and have a

345
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,100
completely different different

346
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:34,739
expression than the ones that were up on

347
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,420
the hill say Mom same Cuts absolutely so

348
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,759
that's the that's you know that's kind

349
00:11:36,419 --> 00:11:40,259
of one thing I miss is just the it's

350
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:42,360
sort of like wine when you're in Napa

351
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:44,220
when when you have multiple wineries

352
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,899
grow in the same grapes or even similar

353
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:50,820
clones but just their locations

354
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:52,620
right yeah yeah I remember especially

355
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,180
with outdoor weed

356
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,560
I mean there was a point where outdoor

357
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:56,939
was more expensive than indoor I

358
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:58,739
remember those days I remember the sour

359
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,660
diesel days that were but it was like

360
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,100
you get sour diesel from specific people

361
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:03,480
and it would come out even though it was

362
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,560
the same cut it would come out two

363
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,820
different ways from two different people

364
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:07,199
right and the buyer's like that's not

365
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:09,300
the same yeah it's not even the same

366
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,440
yeah yeah we had a lot of that because I

367
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:12,000
think that's when the whole name game

368
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,339
started was you know all the way back

369
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,899
then but yeah so let's dive into some of

370
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:18,000
these

371
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:20,879
um

372
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,059
is a proper doing snow pun intended

373
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:23,059
oh

374
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:37,919
so these ones

375
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,540
I have identified as soil grown

376
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:42,500
I believe they're soil ground based on

377
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:42,500
the effect the Cure

378
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:50,039
and the guys who entered this contest

379
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:51,778
um

380
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:53,819
narrowing it down to the top ten these

381
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:55,860
guys all grew amazing flower you know

382
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,899
some you could tell we're like more of

383
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,459
the cocoa Grill I don't think we got any

384
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:01,139
rock wool although

385
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:02,759
we'll find out when I start asking more

386
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:05,100
questions

387
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:07,740
do the contestants disclose it oh you

388
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:10,079
know but I'll I'll ask

389
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:12,720
it's not a it's not a Fair competition

390
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:14,278
where you give everybody the same clone

391
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,680
someone's gonna win the lottery and get

392
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:18,958
better genetics that that person may or

393
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:23,059
may not be the best cultivator we'll see

394
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:23,059
this is kind of a unique test

395
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,519
so what is this smoking right here so

396
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:32,459
this is loud Loops so it's uh zerios

397
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:35,339
times zbx and zeros is a zerbert times

398
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:37,319
cereal milk and then zbx is uh the

399
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:39,000
Skittles back cross with the gelato 41.

400
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,339
okay so there's a good amount of

401
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,379
difference here yeah yeah yeah there's

402
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:46,139
for sure I there's a little candy chirp

403
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:49,259
but I think so I've been smoking these

404
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:51,360
for a week and a half now and what I'm

405
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:53,159
finding is like a lot of the cereal milk

406
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,399
expression is dominant and then you're

407
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:57,958
finding a little Skittles here

408
00:13:55,399 --> 00:14:00,360
sherberty and cereal milk and sherbet

409
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:01,919
kind of have similar like that musky

410
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,839
profile a little bit that I feel like

411
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:05,219
cereal milk is a little is a little

412
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,079
heavier and shorter it's a little

413
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:09,959
brighter yeah like has a little bit more

414
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:12,479
citrus or yeah and so you're getting a

415
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:14,879
lot of that and then the unicorns are

416
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,740
more of the Z ones and I feel like

417
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:18,240
It's associated with the structure too

418
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:20,100
like the ones that don't have quite as

419
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,899
much structure like as nice of a

420
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:24,659
structure those ones are going to have

421
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:26,100
more Skittles Terps sure so it just goes

422
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:27,719
hand in hand sharp has a lot of

423
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:30,420
structure I remember she does have a lot

424
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:33,420
of I remember it I was in the sunset and

425
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:35,099
somebody one of my buddies said take now

426
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:37,259
Mario might have had a landlord

427
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,360
inspection or something but this guy was

428
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:40,740
holding some Mom's room yeah and I went

429
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,240
over there and I looked at it and I'd

430
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:46,980
never seen a Sherwood cup before it's

431
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:49,079
like 2004 five oh wow oh no 2012 sorry

432
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,860
2012. yeah that sounds more like it 12.

433
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:51,239
yeah

434
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,459
um and I go into this guy's house and

435
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,079
it's gray it's purple it's orange it's

436
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:57,299
just got this bud structure that's

437
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:59,399
bubbly but still little fox Taylor I

438
00:14:57,299 --> 00:15:01,559
mean it was literally what we consider

439
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:03,419
designer weed today right and I looked

440
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:05,219
I'm like dude what the [ __ ] is this yeah

441
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:06,958
it's just called Sunset shirt remember

442
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:08,759
it was called Sunset Sherbert in the

443
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:11,338
very beginning and then it turned into

444
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:12,778
sharbinsky and into Sherbert and I think

445
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:14,639
Mario is phenomenal by the way he's

446
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:15,379
always been super kind to me he's a

447
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,759
character

448
00:15:15,379 --> 00:15:20,639
yeah I used to get packs off them back

449
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:22,439
in the day and I ended up getting uh

450
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,299
this guy Travis some of the packs a

451
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:27,180
whole Seed Company there was one seed

452
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:29,159
and that one seed built his seed company

453
00:15:27,179 --> 00:15:30,359
over in Europe I mean at the beginning

454
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:31,679
of it all it takes you know that's all

455
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,180
it takes was that one to get him on the

456
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:35,458
map I mean he did a lot of stuff beyond

457
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:37,019
that but that was like that one seed was

458
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:39,059
a game changer you know I love that

459
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:41,459
though those are the best stories some

460
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:43,198
backseat that turns you into into a name

461
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:45,599
in the Cannabis industry good for you

462
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:47,399
seriously especially when the genetics

463
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,259
weren't super prevalent over there

464
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:51,240
I think we I remember when we were in

465
00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:53,519
college and I would go home to visit I

466
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,620
grew up two hours outside of Amsterdam I

467
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,720
would drive to Amsterdam and get as much

468
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:59,698
like Euro weed as I could and literally

469
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,639
fly it back with me in like the 90s yeah

470
00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:05,399
through SFO because back then there was

471
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,959
more flavors in in Holland than we had

472
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:08,759
here right it was like the exact

473
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,559
opposite of today where the now that's

474
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:12,240
on a completely flip we have totally

475
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:15,599
thousands of flavors and they're still

476
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,278
grown Amnesia Haze so they've renamed

477
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,440
Amnesia Haze Tech different things two

478
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:21,240
million times probably by now

479
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,860
um we also sold a lot of blackjack back

480
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,899
in the Legacy yeah I like that was

481
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:27,240
another one of our kind of signature I

482
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:30,059
haven't seen that since the 90s yeah for

483
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,680
sure but in on ease in 2017 I think our

484
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:34,698
Blackjack was the number one selling

485
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:36,739
flower really yeah well that's amazing

486
00:16:34,698 --> 00:16:39,719
black domino

487
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:42,899
our Blackjack was black dominant and uh

488
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:45,180
and Jack yeah just the expression was so

489
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:46,799
was it it was dark too yeah yeah it was

490
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:48,439
they had some color it was like a

491
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:51,539
grayish purple foreign

492
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:53,220
really nice grayish purple Hue and it

493
00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:55,379
was really uppity most people call it

494
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:58,560
their workout weed in the city nice yeah

495
00:16:55,379 --> 00:17:00,179
yeah it's you know I think red Congolese

496
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:03,000
is kind of made a comeback over the last

497
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:04,259
like four years on and off I've you know

498
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,058
there's a couple of people growing it

499
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:07,500
and it had hoplite and veroid that was

500
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:10,199
another The Hop late and beer has [ __ ]

501
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:12,720
up a lot of genetics so many in

502
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:14,339
California right now we went back to

503
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,140
popping hella seeds right now yeah

504
00:17:14,338 --> 00:17:18,178
because but even with seeds it's

505
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:20,160
transmissible we have old seeds yeah

506
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:22,500
nice there you go we have Knights

507
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,419
heirloom seeds that we've been that

508
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,919
we've been hoarding and collecting which

509
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,959
probably give you some of those better

510
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,299
yeah

511
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,980
I mean there's yeah I mean I love the

512
00:17:30,298 --> 00:17:33,599
genetics and story as long as you store

513
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:35,099
them they're good for a long time if you

514
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:37,619
store them correctly right if you just

515
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:39,959
put them in your drawer yeah good luck

516
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:42,119
yeah good luck if you live in anywhere

517
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,740
past Oakland you're probably going to be

518
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:45,119
in trouble you live in Sacramento you're

519
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,919
[ __ ] oh it gets too high unless you

520
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:48,839
have air conditioning so and even even

521
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:50,759
then when with that fluctuation in

522
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:53,038
temperature your seeds know the humidity

523
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:56,160
you recommend for storing seeds so

524
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:58,019
humidity low low I put desiccants in my

525
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,880
the drier you store them the better we

526
00:17:58,019 --> 00:18:01,740
use lab fridges that has zero humidity

527
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,860
in there you know but like they're

528
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:07,140
they're in glass jars and the I mean

529
00:18:04,859 --> 00:18:08,639
I've seen charts and it's like the

530
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,679
longer you plan on storing them the

531
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,020
lower you want that humidity right does

532
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:15,120
that make sense sure but I mean your

533
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:18,298
facility is unreal dude this is really

534
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:20,279
really impressive yeah awesome thank you

535
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:22,679
very much appreciate it yeah we put some

536
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:26,279
work into this and I think this is just

537
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:28,380
accumulation of my partner and I and all

538
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:30,779
the stuff we've learned along the way to

539
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:32,760
actually put it into a facility you know

540
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:34,859
of this scale doing what we're doing

541
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:36,240
kind of trying to change the game not

542
00:18:34,859 --> 00:18:38,819
just doing what everybody else is doing

543
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,038
you know it's like research and

544
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:43,500
development we're more of a biotech

545
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:44,819
company than we are a nursery or a

546
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,319
breeding facility or anything yeah

547
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:48,240
that's definitely the impression that

548
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:50,220
yeah when you walk in right but we're

549
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,480
not trying to be anything but ourselves

550
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,980
right we're just trying to do the best

551
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,480
we can and trying to push the bar the

552
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,460
best way we know how

553
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,839
so yeah it's a lot of fun though it's

554
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,759
you know and then coming into this place

555
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:01,319
every day is not the worst way to go

556
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:03,240
well that's what I say every day when I

557
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:05,700
walk into my manufacturing spot I'm like

558
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,620
if I told my 16 year old self that I

559
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,240
have a hash Factory one day totally I'm

560
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:10,979
growing my own weed and it's all legal

561
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,319
it's [ __ ] no way this is the dream

562
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,819
come true to an extent but it's also a

563
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:16,619
nightmare with the way that some things

564
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:18,960
in our industry are right which is like

565
00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:21,058
was like the main reason that I decided

566
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,860
to really be active and try to be the

567
00:19:21,058 --> 00:19:24,418
chairman of the San Francisco oversight

568
00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:26,099
committee and of the state Advisory

569
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:28,140
Board because I thought people like you

570
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:31,259
and me that have actually seen this [ __ ]

571
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:33,299
for 25 [ __ ] years we're not getting a

572
00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:35,160
seat at the table we weren't there's a

573
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:36,900
bunch of lobbyists and outdoor

574
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,340
cultivation groups which I don't think

575
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:40,919
they shouldn't have a seat at the table

576
00:19:38,339 --> 00:19:43,019
but they weren't going after the old guy

577
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:45,720
selling you know hundreds of pounds over

578
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:47,339
you know in the 90s already so

579
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,200
um I do think California is really

580
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:51,058
unique and then letting somebody like me

581
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,038
sit at that table and listening to us

582
00:19:51,058 --> 00:19:54,418
but I also realize right now in the

583
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:56,160
industry the way it's going a lot of

584
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:57,900
corporates going out of business with

585
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,720
[ __ ] that's happening with herbal right

586
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:02,280
you see the med man debt the harbor side

587
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,200
that's like oh yeah maybe you should

588
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:06,178
listen to us more we had an existing

589
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,759
industry we had an existing craft beer

590
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:11,038
industry that was crushing it you could

591
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:12,779
have had a thousand anchors teams and

592
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:14,279
you went for five Budweisers and now

593
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:15,960
you're surprised at this [ __ ] yeah

594
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:17,579
you're surprisingly results and it's

595
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,200
like yeah you know I think we talked to

596
00:20:17,579 --> 00:20:20,639
I've talked a little bit about Anchor

597
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,679
Steam with some of the guests but they

598
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,720
kind of we're here in part because of

599
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:27,120
anchor Steve yeah San Francisco you know

600
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,160
Fred Maytag right so Fred Maytag who

601
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:32,159
wanted to start his own microbrewery in

602
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,960
the 70s so uh John from Cutting Edge

603
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,179
Uncle John was telling me the story yeah

604
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,740
in the 70s he wanted us then they said

605
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:39,900
no you need to join one of the big four

606
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:41,579
and he was like no that's not happening

607
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:44,100
I'm not gonna do it so he got dirt on

608
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:45,418
all the politicians he had pis following

609
00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:47,579
the politicians around and it was like

610
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:49,860
one of the fastest Bills ever changed uh

611
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:51,659
he's still allowed him yeah and so it's

612
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:53,339
that kind of change that got us to where

613
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,538
we are today I feel like and it's great

614
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:56,038
being part of the whole thing in San

615
00:20:54,538 --> 00:20:57,900
Francisco it's funny to say and Christy

616
00:20:56,038 --> 00:20:59,879
when people come to our facility I

617
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:03,000
always go we kind of consider ourselves

618
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:04,799
the anchors team yeah of of cannabis we

619
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,359
can do Craft on a pretty industrial

620
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:07,859
scale totally that's just because we

621
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:09,418
love what we're doing it's like over all

622
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:11,279
these years you figure it out right I

623
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:13,860
mean like I see what you do here it

624
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:15,960
looks more impressive than most biotech

625
00:21:13,859 --> 00:21:17,939
companies and people don't realize that

626
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,500
yeah if you want clean good genetics

627
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,779
they have to come out of a place like

628
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:24,779
this they have to yeah there's no

629
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:26,579
exception and I think we're going into

630
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:28,798
the direction that everybody's gonna

631
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:30,000
have to go into it's not like we're

632
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:32,220
doing something that's going to be you

633
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
know once Federal legalization goes in

634
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:37,380
and there's changes and we have the FDA

635
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,480
uh you know and these organizations

636
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,679
coming in they're going to change it and

637
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,779
make it really hard for a lot of people

638
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:44,038
so we're I mean we're gearing up for

639
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:46,019
that that's what I said when we built

640
00:21:44,038 --> 00:21:47,940
our facility I got to build it on a

641
00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:49,980
level that it'll pass a pharmaceutical

642
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:52,200
grade not because I want to people think

643
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:54,599
it's like ego and you're doing it for

644
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:57,480
like Aesthetics it's like no dude this

645
00:21:54,599 --> 00:22:00,119
was built so there's no microbiological

646
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,980
you know hazards here so there's that's

647
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:03,719
why you do it but yeah I think yeah it's

648
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:05,279
impressive what you've built and thank

649

you cool to be here man thanks for

650
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:08,460
having me so let's talk a little bit

651
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:09,599
about your company and how you guys got

652
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,919
your start

653
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:12,899
um yeah we started growing weed in

654
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:14,700
college my my partners and I met first

655
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,200
day of freshman year at USF a bunch of

656
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,360
18 year olds that couldn't pay for weed

657
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,640
so we started growing they started

658
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:22,199
growing I was moving a lot of it

659
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,000
um and then

660
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,340
I think that's kind of how we know a few

661
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,179
of our common friends in the Rave scene

662
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:32,399
started moving packs when I was about 20

663
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:34,620
um the my crew got popped by the feds

664
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,538
most of us got popped nobody said

665
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:38,819
anything everybody walked

666
00:22:36,538 --> 00:22:40,740
um I was on probation for a few years my

667
00:22:38,819 --> 00:22:42,538
buddies were still growing because

668
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:44,640
thankfully they didn't they didn't get

669
00:22:42,538 --> 00:22:47,038
popped um probation for a few years

670
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,538
finished probation super traumatized

671
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:50,940
didn't want anything to do with weed

672
00:22:48,538 --> 00:22:52,980
right uh moved back to Germany for like

673
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:54,659
five six years and that's when medical

674
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,700
really took off here and I mean I was

675
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:58,500
back three times a year hanging out with

676
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,179
my boy so it wasn't like I wasn't coming

677
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,880
home but yeah

678
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:05,159
um yeah so I was like

679
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:07,740
2010 my buddies came to Germany said

680
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:09,419

683
00:23:11,819 --> 00:23:15,899

684
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,919
go back to our old Heights so awesome

685
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:21,960
sort of what we did and um then when

686
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:24,419
2016 came around we saw the writing on

687
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:26,400
the wall so decided to really Lobby

688
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:28,200
first eat at the table to be heard

689
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,059
because we didn't have a warehouse like

690
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,919
we were growing in 30 houses in the

691
00:23:30,058 --> 00:23:33,779
sunset we didn't totally we have a

692
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,919
warehouse we weren't zoned yeah and you

693
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:36,480
know at that point to your point you

694
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:38,100
already had a company like gold seal

695
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,740
that was growing red Congo and that had

696
00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:42,899
a warehouse there was a Betty project oh

697
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:45,058
yeah SF cultivators you had a couple of

698
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:47,759
outfits that were definitely in the bay

699
00:23:45,058 --> 00:23:49,079
if you could probably transition but we

700
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,658
know that wasn't us because we were

701
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:53,639
growing in houses and we were producing

702
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:55,500
our Edibles and hash and stuff in the

703
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,299
back of the plant Cafe Kitchen in the

704
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,038
commissary amazing

705
00:23:57,298 --> 00:24:00,900
um which is actually where I where SF

706
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:02,339
office of cannabis first tour was we're

707
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,919
like yeah go to the front ask the

708
00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:06,240
cashier or walk you into the back to the

709
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:08,100
commissary where we're making hash

710
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,538
hilarious it was totally Breaking Bad it

711
00:24:08,099 --> 00:24:11,519
was pretty funny

712
00:24:09,538 --> 00:24:13,619
um yeah so then we had to transition and

713
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:16,079
I transitioned manufacturing first was

714
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:17,639
the first manufacturer to open in the

715
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:19,918
city pulled three out of the first 10

716
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,960
permits hold the first building permit

717
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,580
in San Francisco nice

718
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,079
um and not with like a big crew of

719
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:27,779
lawyers and [ __ ] dude just my you know

720
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:29,460
my buddy part of my company is one of

721
00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:31,279
the better attorneys in the space our

722
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:33,720
Growers are really smart scientific guys

723
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:35,519
you know we looked at building codes we

724
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,319
figured it out hired an architect and

725
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:39,538
you know figured it out

726
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:41,339
um and now Sunset connect is the number

727
00:24:39,538 --> 00:24:43,440
one selling single gram pre-roll in the

728
00:24:41,339 --> 00:24:45,058
state we beat jeters out of that spot

729
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,120
which I'm really proud of for like a

730
00:24:45,058 --> 00:24:49,619
little SF dude and uh and we kind of

731
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:51,959
have to restructure now because you know

732
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:54,359
herbo went broke and they're really good

733
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,038
partner of ours and we now have to find

734
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:57,779
a new distributor but that's how this

735
00:24:56,038 --> 00:24:59,339
game goes you gotta be flexible gotta be

736
00:24:57,779 --> 00:25:00,960
nimble

737
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:04,158
yeah it's all about being able to Pivot

738
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,538
yeah and having it every day seven times

739
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,919
I mean if there's one thing I learned

740
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:09,658
from my partner it's always have a plan

741
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,620
B yeah what's our plan B like if this

742
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:12,539
doesn't work what's you know we're

743
00:25:10,619 --> 00:25:14,279
thinking ahead yeah I always have to

744
00:25:12,538 --> 00:25:16,259
kind of be and then a contingency if

745
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:17,940
that doesn't come through and that can't

746
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:19,558
just be another plan C that's you know

747
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:22,140
unrealistic that's when you go okay if

748
00:25:19,558 --> 00:25:24,839
that happens we contract we expand again

749
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:26,038
or we kill a few skus so I did that that

750
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:28,918
was actually one of the things that made

751
00:25:26,038 --> 00:25:31,200
us most successful was setting aside

752
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:32,880
what I know my small microcosm wanted

753
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,740
and saying okay what is it what's the

754
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,659
data here and the data was the single

755
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:38,220
Graham joint so you know we started with

756
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:40,559
one skew

757
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:42,240
used to sell like 10 000 a month and now

758
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:43,558
we're at seven of the same kind and saw

759
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,079
like a hundred thousand of them a month

760
00:25:43,558 --> 00:25:47,879
right so but we cut out flowers for them

761
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:50,038
being for the time being topicals

762
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:52,559
Edibles we cut out a lot of rationalize

763
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:54,058
our skews nice so doubling down on what

764
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:56,700
you're good at yeah getting rid of the

765
00:25:54,058 --> 00:25:58,798
stuff that is questionable Focus right

766
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:00,720
focused yeah it's all about Focus yeah

767
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:02,579
that's it so what do we got here

768
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,278
but that's one of the flavors so we have

769
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:06,839
two sativas two indicas and two hybrids

770
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:09,240
at any given point this is your morning

771
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:11,519
commute so it's based on the muni ticket

772
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,500
right that sort of our whole thing so

773
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:16,019
this is your morning commute and this is

774
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:19,798
a sunset popsicle which

775
00:26:16,019 --> 00:26:23,099
um is it is actually blow popped

776
00:26:19,798 --> 00:26:25,079
um blow pop sugar trim and sunset sugar

777
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:26,879
and this is a trim joint that goes out

778
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:29,038
the door at a dispensary for five bucks

779
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,559
because we were like we felt like dude

780
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:33,599
that's amazing you they offer nothing to

781
00:26:31,558 --> 00:26:35,099
somebody on a budget that still needs to

782
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:36,719
smoke a lot and like it still tastes

783
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:38,399
good probably I'm assuming I don't dry

784
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,079
hit it and it tastes and they're fresh I

785
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,600
mean you know it is a sugar trim joint

786
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:44,220
like we don't we don't make any we you

787
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:46,798
know we don't hide that fact but test

788
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:49,558
that 25 it's fresh I don't think you'll

789
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:51,900
ever get one that's older than like two

790
00:26:49,558 --> 00:26:53,099
or three weeks in the store uh that's

791
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,419
part of the game too that's one of the

792
00:26:53,099 --> 00:26:56,339
most important parts that I think a lot

793
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:58,080
of people are dropping the ball on is

794
00:26:56,339 --> 00:26:59,819
realizing that this is a product that

795
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:01,678
needs to be fresh yeah I don't want the

796
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:03,178
whole dry shell I don't want three month

797
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,620
old weed like necessarily if it's been

798
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:06,659
sitting on the shelf maybe if you

799
00:27:04,619 --> 00:27:08,459
harvested it and you stored it correctly

800
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:09,960
and then you put it out and I get the

801
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,159
week after yeah you know it's like

802
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,440
there's good there's ways you can do

803
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:16,080
stuff now for sure but I think a lot of

804
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,759
people are dropping the ball on how they

805
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:19,558
not only how they try and cure it but

806
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:22,379
how long it sits on the Shelf processing

807
00:27:19,558 --> 00:27:24,480
yeah I mean it's post-processing we're

808
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:27,000
really particular like

809
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,159
um from batch sizing you have a lot of

810
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,019
you have a lot of influence on your

811
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:33,000
product if you do it in small batches

812
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:35,700
you can make 10 small batches but we

813
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,579
grind in like 100 gram batches most big

814
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:40,620
pre-roll makers grinding five pounds and

815
00:27:38,579 --> 00:27:42,418
it's dust so I got a good solution for

816
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:44,038
all this this is the best solution

817
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:45,419
actually it's again I'm taking it from

818
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:47,640
Lagunitas because that's what they did

819
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:48,778
uh when they started shipping beer

820
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,759
across the country they had it

821
00:27:48,778 --> 00:27:51,960
refrigerated in refrigerated trucks

822
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:54,179
going they were the first ones that did

823
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:56,100
that all the big beer companies right

824
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:58,200
yeah and they got anchors not Anchor

825
00:27:56,099 --> 00:28:00,599
Steam they got Heineken from over in

826
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,159
Amsterdam to start shipping their beer

827
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:03,778
in the water to the United States so

828
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,880
it's not skunky like it used to be oh

829
00:28:03,778 --> 00:28:07,740
really

830
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,380
yeah yeah a million dollars for half a

831
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:11,759
half a billion and then a full billion

832
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:13,320
and uh but what we could do with the

833
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:16,379
flour is we could all have it stored at

834
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:17,939
60 degrees transfer it at 60 degrees and

835
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:19,440
then the dispensary has it at 60 degrees

836
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:22,679
so when you get it you're getting the

837
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:25,080
humidity well yeah for sure 60 Minutes

838
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:26,278
60 degrees coming in so you're never

839
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:27,359
getting it out of that environment

840
00:28:26,278 --> 00:28:28,980
you're going to get a better product for

841
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:30,658
a lot longer people are going to be a

842
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:33,000
lot more satisfied yeah that's kind of

843
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:34,860
what I see the consumer thinks that like

844
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,659
if there's no consistency right because

845
00:28:34,859 --> 00:28:39,719
one just and I see it in the numbers one

846
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:42,240
dispensary moves you know 130 of these a

847
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,860
day and another one does 70.

848
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,740
um so you can you can adjust that by

849
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:49,439
case sizes so we have 125 and a 250 case

850
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:51,419
fast movers get the big case medium

851
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,220
movers get the you know the medium the

852
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:55,440
small case because they move through it

853
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:56,819
fresh but right you go to dispensaries

854
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,038
and they have four or five month old

855
00:28:56,819 --> 00:29:01,019
Jeff flower jars I mean I don't want

856
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:02,879
that I don't want that either or a year

857
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:04,379
old I've seen year old products well not

858
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,299
a year is the cutoff you have to return

859
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:08,520
it to the vendor that's pushing it 11

860
00:29:06,298 --> 00:29:11,278
months 10 months nine months I mean with

861
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:13,679
with hash sure I like age cash I

862
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:16,019
personally age Ash per year yeah and

863
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:19,440
then I bust it open but um yeah I agree

864
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:21,298
I think with flower pre-rolls edible

865
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,519
shouldn't be around for a year probably

866
00:29:21,298 --> 00:29:25,200
probably not yeah you know I think well

867
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:27,538
yeah definitely Edibles have those shelf

868
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,759
lives for them based on food yeah food

869
00:29:27,538 --> 00:29:31,259
but they but they also degrade though I

870
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:32,398
mean I like my bread fresh too I'm not

871
00:29:31,259 --> 00:29:34,200
going to eat steel bread or anything

872
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:36,979
like that but yeah that [ __ ] gave me

873
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,980
such cottonmouth

874
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:45,479
same thing it's like yeah I do have to

875
00:29:43,859 --> 00:29:47,459
do a refire I think it could cure a

876
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,319
little longer still uh-huh this one but

877
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:52,019
in terms of effect high

878
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:53,639
great really Pleasant got me proper

879
00:29:52,019 --> 00:29:55,700
ripped and I didn't even finish it yet

880
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,700

881
00:29:55,798 --> 00:30:00,240
you can taste it on the relay yeah nice

882
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,679
that's nice it's a great song yeah well

883
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,380
a lot of these are you know soil grown

884
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,240
living soil grown these entries and it's

885
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:08,039
you know I like the skittley though okay

886
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,339
the ones that are that what's that added

887
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:12,778
layer of flavor that makes it special

888
00:30:10,339 --> 00:30:15,058
it's like a skittles is such a good

889
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:17,700
flavor enhancer it's kind of like what

890
00:30:15,058 --> 00:30:20,398
what forbidden fruit was but dude it

891
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:22,200
just forbidden food just [ __ ]

892
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:24,479
everything up for some reason oh dude

893
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:27,240
purple punch the thing is with purple

894
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,399
punches purple punch looks amazing on

895
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,538
the plant it's like I think most of the

896
00:30:29,398 --> 00:30:32,339
funeral is a wedding cake are like this

897
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:34,319
too they look amazing on the planet they

898
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:36,418
yield really well they look like super

899
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:38,220
Instagram beautiful and then you go to

900
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:39,778
smoke them and it's like wait a second

901
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:42,778
such a letter wait a second where's

902
00:30:39,778 --> 00:30:45,000
where's the Terps and you know I mean

903
00:30:42,778 --> 00:30:46,919
there's so Oreos is like that apple

904
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,419
fritter in my opinion the thing with

905
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:50,100
apple fritter is I like the effect of

906
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:52,200
apple fritter but I don't like the fact

907
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:53,398
that it smells like an apple fritter and

908
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:56,100
then you go to smoke it and you don't

909
00:30:53,398 --> 00:30:58,500
taste anything of it yeah and I mean

910
00:30:56,099 --> 00:31:00,418
I've said it before but all these things

911
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,798
that aren't that great like Oreos and

912
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:03,960
purple punch I think they're all one

913
00:31:01,798 --> 00:31:05,599
good cross yeah like the example of the

914
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:08,100
red pop you know which is actually

915
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:10,740
purple punched or whatever like whatever

916
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:12,418
he used but purple Punchy his strawberry

917
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:15,240
must have purple punch in there some on

918
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:17,520
some line going from there to the red

919
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,440
pop it's like it just takes work and

920
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,720
effort but all three ones that you named

921
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,880
are impossible to sell they're all three

922
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,558
of them nobody wants nobody wants Andre

923
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,240
like and that's like and then even

924
00:31:25,558 --> 00:31:29,038
buyers that are looking for completely

925
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:31,140
different things they'll tell you they

926
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:33,000
don't want Oreos that's for sure yeah no

927
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:35,480
matter who they are we have uh it's not

928
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,159
Oreos it's zorios

929
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:40,620
the rename games well the rename game I

930
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,778
got escalated with now the shape bags I

931
00:31:40,619 --> 00:31:45,178
feel like the rename game is now the

932
00:31:42,778 --> 00:31:48,079
shaved bag and rename game the bigger

933
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:50,278
and the more die cut your shaped bag

934
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:51,960
I just can't get into that that's kind

935
00:31:50,278 --> 00:31:54,359
of also why we cater I always say we

936
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:56,100
cater to like the heavy smoker that has

937
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:57,898
to watch their pocket and just wants a d

938
00:31:56,099 --> 00:31:59,519
decent smokes though yeah that's like

939
00:31:57,898 --> 00:32:01,558
the people that I make stuff for because

940
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,658
I was always kind of selling to Blue

941
00:32:01,558 --> 00:32:05,879
Collar dudes in the city so that's just

iteration and of the new one and I

958
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:43,860
always say this is a global experiment

959
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:45,960
and California is the only place in This

960
00:32:43,859 --> 00:32:48,658
Global experiment that actually matters

961
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:51,058
in terms of scale yeah and we you know

962
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:53,820
