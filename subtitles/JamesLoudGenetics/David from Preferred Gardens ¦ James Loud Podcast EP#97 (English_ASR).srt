actually it was amazing uh cuz I think

16
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,760
you they were even Smalls and I think it

17
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,040
was the

18
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,439
$108 but uh you blew everybody's mind

19
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,799
everybody that tried it was you know

20
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:13,478
even the people that were in the room

21
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:16,280
that smoked it afterwards were like wow

22
00:01:13,478 --> 00:01:17,920

23
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,719
like you guys do a great job you have

24
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,000
mix light you uh you take pride in your

25
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:25,478
work and uh yeah I can't say enough good

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,719
things about your brand for sure

27
00:01:25,478 --> 00:01:29,599
appreciate it no that's dope I I have

28
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:31,319
never seen that so I'd love to see it

29
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:32,679
but yeah yeah I'm sure it was like a mix

30
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:35,839
light bag or something you guys bought

31
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:38,360
from a store from cookies okay nice it

32
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,640
was it was really good burned good all

33
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:41,640
those things that you don't think about

34
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,280
we both next time but that's good I love

35
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,040
that because wreck needs to be put on a

36
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,000
spot a lot more there's a lot of issues

37
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,560
of course with uh stores and not pushing

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,560
things and pushing their their house

39
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,879
brands or whatnot and package dates and

40
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,399
you know things that have sited on the

41
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:58,438
shelf for a long time where people

42
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,079
discount were all flower kind of

43
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:02,758
degrades right but uh that's dope I love

44
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:05,959
it yeah I think that's the biggest

45
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,560
problem with wreck today is that the

46
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,878
consumer isn't getting the flower fast

47
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,759
stuff there's a surplus of product and a

48
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:14,359
lot of times it's not stored correctly

49
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:15,598
and then they buy it one time and they

50
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,560
don't like the brand they're like oh man

51
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:19,280
this is garbage but if they looked on

52
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,120
the date it's like six or eight months

53
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,280
old or or even older than that in

54
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,080
certain cases or the you know especially

55
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,759
with joints and pre-rolls it's like you

56
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,879
can't have an old joint or pre-roll it

57
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:31,479
has to get consumed fairly quickly yeah

58
00:02:29,878 --> 00:02:33,318
there's a shelf life and people don't

59
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:36,479
understand that it's like what we do now

60
00:02:33,318 --> 00:02:38,280
is we try to we try to you know do our

61
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,199
best to pull things off the shelf and

62
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,919
buy them back if they've sat for so long

63
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:43,280
or find the specific partners that are

64
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:44,719
actually pushing and selling through the

65
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,080
weed and they know the time where it has

66
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:50,959
to get discounted to move but right

67
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,599
California wreck is like a crazy crazy

68
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,199
situation right now it's it's really

69
00:02:52,598 --> 00:02:57,000
hard to track what's going on yeah it's

70
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,959
a beast and it's really hard to tackle

71
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,080
and I feel like so many things were over

72
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:02,519
looked in the beginning people just

73
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,640
wanted to get their license and wanted

74
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:06,120
to get product out there and there's all

75
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:07,759
these things that go along with that

76
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,959
where if you want to maintain high

77
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:12,399
quality which is what is going to get

78
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:14,400
people to come back and buy your flow

79
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,879
you know I think it's it's really it's

80
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,959
really Technical and there's a lot of

81
00:03:15,878 --> 00:03:21,399
trial and error that goes along yeah

82
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:23,439
along with that yeah I think uh I mean

83
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,560
I've learned I've scaled I have you know

84
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:27,039
decent size grow so that's the trickier

85
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,318
part we got to sell all the weed right

86
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:32,039
and we want to sell to more stores but

87
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:33,598
finding right partners that actually

88
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:35,479
understand the brand and push it in a

89
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:37,878
certain way it works well so it stays

90
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:39,919
fresh right they're not over ordering

91
00:03:37,878 --> 00:03:41,798
we're not over pushing you got to kind

92
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:44,438
of control you know the narrative with

93
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:47,239
the team and my team's been on it heavy

94
00:03:44,438 --> 00:03:49,639
lately especially well and then how long

95
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:52,719
do you have ways in house that you you

96
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:54,479
store and and uh protect your weed

97
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:56,079
before it goes out there how long does

98
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,798
it typically sit before it goes out to

99
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:00,920
the consumer so it's it's kind of varies

100
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,959
of course you know it's it's all about

101
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:05,438
how fast the store moves it but we get

102
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,878
it to distribution and out out on the

103
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:09,479
Shelf as fast as possible taing in in

104
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:11,719
about seven days right now it's like a

105
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:13,919
record breaker wow you know we make sure

106
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:16,040
we have the testing lined up as soon as

107
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:18,079
it drops it gets picked up from the farm

108
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:21,439
drops to distribution third party gets

109
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,918
tested packaged shipped to you know the

110
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:24,918
distributor that's going to push it to

111
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:26,918
the stores and it's already kind of sold

112
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:29,478
wow that's the fastest to get it to at

113
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:31,120
least to Dro yeah but uh as soon as it

114
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:35,439
gets to the shelves you never know a lot

115
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:38,319
of these retailers now they have like uh

116
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:40,360
dros that are you know like a big chain

117
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,918
will have a specific drro that

118
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,680
distributes the product to each of the

119
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:45,719
stores which I really hate to be honest

120
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,360
because you can't control what's

121
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,400
happening with that product and when it

122
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,919
gets to each of the stores you don't

123
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:52,519
even really know you don't have a date

124
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:55,120
like exact date when it's going to land

125
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:58,120
on shelf right so we can push or see

126
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,399
what's going on and It's Tricky they're

127
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,918
all you know everyone's kind of of doing

128
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:04,198
their own thing there's the mom and pop

129
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:06,159
shops there's the Big Chain shops right

130
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,560
so there's so many variables yeah so

131
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,080
many variables and then what are your

132
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,680
thoughts on on curing because a lot of

133
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:15,000
people they're like oh some stuff tastes

134
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,959
good after two months I hear that

135
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,560
sometimes I like it fresh but I think

136
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:23,359
it's cultivar specific as well it is I

137
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:26,079
love fresh weed yeah is the thing so My

138
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,199
Philosophy is I want to get it out to

139
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:30,439
distribution and testing a little

140
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:32,600
fresher than normal like right now with

141
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:34,600
mix light we use Grove bags I really

142
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,720
believe in the Grove bag you know it

143
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,759
keeps it keeps it it keeps it in a

144
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,919
better spot so you can you can put it in

145
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,720
there a little bit fresher and by the

146
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:45,439
time it makes to the to the Shelf you

147
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,960
pray that it's exactly where you want it

148
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:48,639
yeah turp blocks are the best I love

149
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:50,599
Grove we're doing some collaborations

150
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,519
we've done collaborations with them I

151
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,240
think it's a great product and I was a

152
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:59,240
jar guy I mean we talk about glass jars

153
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,759
it's like I I use jars my whole life and

154
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,639
you would have to twist my arm really

155
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:05,639
hard for me to even try the turp blck

156
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,199
but but I tried it and the the product

157
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:08,759
speaks for itself you know we put stuff

158
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,079
on the Shelf we do AB testing with

159
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:12,038
everything that was another one we did

160
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:15,318
AB testing with yeah we tested the

161
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:18,279
turkey versus the glass jar versus the

162
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:19,520
big Grove bag like the pound yeah yeah

163
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:21,559
and I they come in so many different

164
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:23,120
sizes they have tote liners I mean you

165
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,120
know and I have friends that are putting

166
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,918
Bita packs in with the turp blcks now

167
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,038
and I've never liked the bitas I feel

168
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:32,159
like they pull TPS but you know it's

169
00:06:30,038 --> 00:06:34,279
just personal preference everybody has

170
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,080
their own little way right so we

171
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:38,959
normally trim fresh we do put it in a

172
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:40,439
turkey first then we move it over to a

173
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:41,918
Grove bag when we think it's right I

174
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:44,800
feel like when you gets in a Grove bag

175
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:46,560
it's locked in right it's exact it keeps

176
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,079
it in stasis for the most part right

177
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,839
it's exactly where you have it so if you

178
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:52,918
get to the perfect cure and you get it

179
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:54,959
in the Grove bag you're solid for two

180
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:56,959
months but it's still going to go I mean

181
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:58,878
if you keep it colder it's better it'll

182
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:00,758
last a heck of a lot longer but if you

183
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,720
don't then it's like yeah that stuff can

184
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:04,520
go yeah but how do you control when

185
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,919
you're in hundreds of stores how do you

186
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:09,000
control which Dro van it goes in who's

187
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:11,598
using a HB in their Dro who has a

188
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,800
freezer van right which store is storing

189
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:15,800
it properly it's rare to be honest

190
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,759
summer yeah I mean people talk about it

191
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:21,478
as if it's not rare but it's rare it's

192
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:24,240
[ __ ] rare sadly rare yeah it needs to

193
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:26,279
be you know exactly to get it exactly

194
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,199
where you want it is tough yeah it's

195
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:31,878
really interesting the model um you know

196
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,199
C California is its own unique Beast as

197
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:36,919
well it's like going from medical where

198
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:39,038
it was completely different to to wreck

199
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:40,478
and then the brands that came I mean a

200
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:43,279
lot of the brands that we saw were big

201
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:45,199
with cultivation before you know it's

202
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:47,359
like those Brands aren't around anymore

203
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,840
you've been around quite a while yeah

204
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,759
for sure because I think I chose so I

205
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:54,478
had the options everyone in the

206
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:56,598
beginning had their options everyone you

207
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:58,318
know cannabis is sexy especially then

208
00:07:56,598 --> 00:08:00,439
all the investors are up your ass

209
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,919
they're sitting at your gate at the farm

210
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:03,839
if you have any kind of cultivation

211
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:06,120
license they can get a hold of you right

212
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,239
yeah then that's how it used to be now

213
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,680
no one's invested in cannabis really

214
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,680
right you know not in not in California

215
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,720
it's very rare too it's super rare so

216
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,598
like then I

217
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,440
decided I watched you know a lot of the

218
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:21,000
bigger guys and I had conversations

219
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:22,598
they're a lot of my friends right thank

220
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,158
God I had like a lot of this inside

221
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:27,878
information right that when they got the

222
00:08:25,158 --> 00:08:30,759
$25 million loan when they partnered

223
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:32,440
with the the people that were great in

224
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:35,560
the beginning and and the devil in the

225
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,959
end they they it always went bad you

226
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:40,239
know all the stock deals all this crazy

227
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:42,278
thing it always went bad so I've had

228
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,480
like probably the biggest opportunities

229
00:08:42,278 --> 00:08:47,080
in my lap in the beginning and I've

230
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,720
turned them all down just because I knew

231
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,560
it was too good to be true yeah I mean I

232
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,680
think that's the best it's like I have

233
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:56,159
one partner and that's it you know and

234
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:57,559
we if we fail it's on us for sure at the

235
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:59,078
end of the day but yeah I had so many

236
00:08:57,559 --> 00:09:00,159
friends same thing probably mutual

237
00:08:59,078 --> 00:09:02,039
friends

238
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,240
that have gotten burned over the years

239
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:06,399
with some of these deals from whether

240
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,919
it's Canadian companies or big investors

241
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,639
and then getting diluted out of their

242
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:12,719
shares exactly you know it's it's really

243
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:14,639
rough you know and I think we're just in

244
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,120
such a volatile industry too it's just

245
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:19,399
so volatile on on every level um you

246
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,799
know and people are like well what's

247
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:23,200
next what's next is candy G to go away I

248
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:25,199
don't think cand is going away I don't

249
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,920
think that's going away anytime soon but

250
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,959
I do think gas and sour and things like

251
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:32,039
that are coming back I agree I mean I

252
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:35,319
think they're coming back in small

253
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:37,919
spurts candy I've I've basically refused

254
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:40,399
to grow lcgs and and runs for the

255
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:42,679
longest yeah now that a bunch of people

256
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,879
backed off I put a handfuls of them into

257
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:47,479
the garden you know but

258
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:50,120
um I don't love them I grow what I like

259
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:52,800
to grow I grow a lot of green weed you

260
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,560
know it's it always works for us it just

261
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:56,359
if it's high quality doesn't matter yeah

262
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,479
we grow Z for sure that's what we're

263
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,560
that's what we want to smoke yeah I mean

264
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:04,240
I like z a lot well I think OG Kush it's

265
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:06,439
like you know that's people can't sell

266
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,600
it they say it's just you got to put in

267
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,040
the effort it's got to be the right

268
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,560
batch you know it's not easy to grow you

269
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:14,240
got to be patient and I feel like it's

270
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:15,799
not for everybody it's not for everybody

271
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,399
to grow or to smoke I mean I feel like

272
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:18,799
the high isn't for everybody some people

273
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:21,559
can handle it yeah I'm not going to grow

274
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:23,599
10,000 pounds of of Z or OG cush but I

275
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:25,000
grow a good amount yeah and I mean I

276
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,920
would grow that stuff just for myself to

277
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
smoke too because that's what I like you

278
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:33,240
know I love good OG like that piny

279
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,240
lemony gassy earthy that's what I like

280
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,639
yeah and I sell all my own weed for the

281
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,519
most part so like if I truly enjoy it

282
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:41,720
it's pretty easy for me to sell it you

283
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,839
know so if like it's a batch of OG or Z

284
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,800
or something and I'm very proud of it

285
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,440
I'll put a high number on it and sell it

286
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:50,838
easier than a candy that I don't like

287
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,399
and I'm like yeah you know if you want

288
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:55,079
it you can buy it yeah but when you do

289
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:56,919
mix light too so you're on a different

290
00:10:55,078 --> 00:10:59,559
level completely and your mix light is

291
00:10:56,919 --> 00:11:00,919
competing with indoor somewhat yeah well

292
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:02,838
I think it competes with it especially

293
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:04,759
with flavor yeah mixl light I think is

294
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:07,200
the future it always has been that's

295
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:10,720
that I'm I'm known for mixl light mixl

296
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:13,320
light is the hardest to grow too also I

297
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,759
feel you know it's like uh controlling

298
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,200
that kind of environment is a big

299
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:18,838
challenge now at scale I have a positive

300
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,800
pressure Greenhouse that's even more of

301
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:23,760
a challenge I bet you know looks super

302
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:25,719
cool but God that thing's a [ __ ] every

303
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:26,958
day well in those kind of green houses

304
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,399
people don't understand they can be more

305
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:31,958
expensive than indoor grow yeah and

306
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:33,679
don't they yield less they no one no

307
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:36,159
one's hitting the same yields they hit

308
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,799
in an indoor facility in a greenhouse

309
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:40,319
like that it's just it is what it is you

310
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:42,919
can't control the environment perfect so

311
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,480
you know it's cheaper to grow yes right

312
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:47,919
more efficient yes it's more natural yes

313
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,200
it's better weed yes

314
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:53,000
yeah yeah and then uh what's your take

315
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,879
on Coco soil rock wool ston wall

316
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,480
whatever you want to call I'm a Coco guy

317
00:11:54,879 --> 00:12:00,200
I mean I've grown in everything I mean

318
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:03,278
deep water culture every single thing

319
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:05,480
rockwool I still do Trials of things all

320
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:07,519
the time you know I trial different Coco

321
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,079
too I trial Pete Moss was like my

322
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:13,519
favorite for the longest yeah but at

323
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:16,278
scale in my opinion cocoa is is the best

324
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,399
like a one gallon cocoa B Coco bag is

325
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:21,039
you still get almost the same control as

326
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,919
a rock wo cube right but you have a

327
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:26,879
little bit more forgiveness there yeah

328
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:29,039
run you run a good lean crew you can run

329
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,519
coco no problem and not have an issue

330
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:32,719
yeah I mean I feel like Coco is the nice

331
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:34,879
mix same thing you you mix light cocoa

332
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,440
you're right in the middle with the with

333
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,879
the soil and the rock wool and you're

334
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,320
you're getting the Best of Both Worlds

335
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:42,958
and you know I have no problem we use

336
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,560
Rockwell for certain applications here

337
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,679
you as far as Nursery applications I

338
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:48,000
think it works course yeah and same here

339
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:49,599
but and then soil I really love the

340
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,120
flavor of soil you know when it comes

341
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,159
down to flavor but as far as if you want

342
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,679
a product that yields really well and

343
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:57,159
you know I think the effect of soil

344
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,479
might be a little bit better but you can

345
00:12:57,159 --> 00:13:01,039
get amazing tasting cocoa you can get

346
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,360
amazing effect with

347
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:06,319
Coco check the box there's just so many

348
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,800
variables there you know and every

349
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:12,920
facility is different in Florida we use

350
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:15,799
rockwool yeah right because the head of

351
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:17,599
cultivation is is a rockwool guy and he

352
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:19,599
can steer the [ __ ] properly and the weed

353
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,159
is phenomenal yeah right the best

354
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,800
Rockwell weed that I've ever had for

355
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:25,759
sure is out there in Florida and we did

356
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:27,879
Coco at first and it you know it's not

357
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:29,879
his thing he's so used to steering with

358
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:32,519
rockwool I'm not gonna be like hey you

359
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:34,399
have to do Cocoa in my rooms yeah and it

360
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:37,078
the wheed is super fire and it gets you

361
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:40,198
super high and it has mad flavor and

362
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:41,638
it's undeniable so we use rockwool there

363
00:13:40,198 --> 00:13:44,439
and certain facilities I've used

364
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:46,440
rockwool and had you know better results

365
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,160
it's just the environment was different

366
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,560
and you know there's so many different

367
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:53,159
factors it's hard to really pinpoint why

368
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:56,599
right soil too you know a lot of people

369
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:58,078
argue soil is the greatest you know and

370
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,680
I've grown in a lot of soil and had

371
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:05,278
amazing batches but for me like overall

372
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:08,120
Coco has been the best like overall

373
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:09,838
overall yeah for sure yeah and you know

374
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,919
I got away from Coco because the first

375
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,000
time I used Coco it came in these bricks

376
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:14,559
and you know we got these bricks and I

377
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,519
had to break them up in a kitty kitty

378
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:18,399
pool with the shovel oh yeah and I was

379
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:20,919
like I'm never doing this again I hate

380
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:24,000
this stuff and now like 20 years later I

381
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:28,278
ended up going all Coco I was using Char

382
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,519
cor yeah um and I've tried Cana Char cor

383
00:14:28,278 --> 00:14:32,679
I'm doing trials with K right now but

384
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:34,799
you know yeah we're testing out some uh

385
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:37,719
some cocoa with pearlite too you know

386
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:39,519
like a 7030 mix yeah I I like the 7030

387
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,480
mixes I think those are good I feel like

388
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,039
the the dryb backs are good on them very

389
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,680
good yeah so yeah and then even we we're

390
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:48,719
doing some trials with moms using the

391
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:50,198
Big 10inch Blocks so you know I'm trying

392
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,600
to compare that to Rockwell to really

393
00:14:50,198 --> 00:14:54,679
see what the difference is I mean I feel

394
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,800
like with Rockall you have total control

395
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:59,519
you get perfect dry backbacks uh it's

396
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:02,000
very consistent uh but I feel like

397
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,639
there's more of a buffer with Coco so

398
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,559
we'll see we'll see where that goes yeah

399
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:07,879
with Rock Wood I mean you can really

400
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:11,119
steer every inch of it oh yeah and I

401
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:13,198
love that factor but there's always in

402
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,198
in like a large scale facility for

403
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:18,159
instance my Greenhouse is 50,000 square

404
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:20,958
feet so and there's a large Bay like 18

405
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:24,039
20,000 Square ft Bays with Perpetual

406
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:26,159
Harvest inside so something goes wrong

407
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:28,958
you get some sediment in the line or

408
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:31,000
something we're letting lean you know

409
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:33,159
you can't just take out all the drippers

410
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,519
mhm you know figure out what's going on

411
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:36,958
and you got to have a little bit of

412
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:39,039
buffer also we did trials back toback

413
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:42,479
indoor I did tons of them with rockwool

414
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:45,159
slabs Rock wo cubes right cocoa one

415
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:48,519
gallon Coco two gallon different brands

416
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:51,679
of cocoa you know twice washed chippy

417
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:53,120
cocoa ground up cocoa and what I got the

418
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:55,318
best flavor from is what I'm really

419
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,720
looking for as flavor of course or

420
00:15:55,318 --> 00:16:01,439
weed's going to get you high yeah um was

421
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,800
Cocoa yeah nice yeah so you're working

422
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,959
in Florida you're working in all kinds

423
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:09,240
of other states as well yeah yeah how's

424
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:11,638
that going it's going great I mean not

425
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,919
all of it is great but it's like when

426
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:15,959
you find the right people to work with

427
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:17,479
that's that's what really matters it's

428
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:19,638
it's amazing I mean we're really

429
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:22,240
successful so yeah if that's what we're

430
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:24,318
shooting for it's that's working right

431
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,839
um and we found out you know certain

432
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:28,519
Partners not to work with it's just a

433
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:31,240
lot of like learning happening right now

434
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:32,959
I feel like like it's so early still in

435
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,720
the game that we don't know what's going

436
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:38,559
to happen so doing licensing deals

437
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,560
Consulting Partnerships in other states

438
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:43,039
right we got to try it all right for

439
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:44,479
sure yeah so with Florida what are some

440
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:46,360
of the challenges you guys faced over

441
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,240
there I feel like they're still medical

442
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,519
medical yeah I mean that's the biggest

443
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,600
challenge they were supposed to you know

444
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:55,919
was about to pass wreck everyone thought

445
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,159
was had to be like a 60% Vote or

446
00:16:55,919 --> 00:17:00,719
something and it didn't happen right um

447
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:02,278
that would have been huge for us but I

448
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,400
kind of like where we're at right now

449
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:05,759
it's working really well right but it is

450
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,280
medical and you have to get a medical

451
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:11,119
card and a medical card cost $0 and

452
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:12,879
something dollars everyone's on a budget

453
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,678
it's harder to get a card in Florida

454
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,400
it's not like California how it used to

455
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:19,959
be so there's a lot of challenges where

456
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,919
people want to get our product but can't

457
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:23,798
um but also there's still a good amount

458
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,559
of people that do yeah it seems like

459
00:17:23,798 --> 00:17:27,759
there's some really big Brands and some

460
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:29,918
really good brands that are in Florida

461
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:31,440
you know some California brand and you

462
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,679
know it's it's and some guys that are

463
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,919
transplants that have moved there and

464
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:36,360
they're doing really good sunburn

465
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,679
cannabis I talk about them a lot yeah uh

466
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:40,678
peab he's over there people for sure

467
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:42,519
hell yeah so yeah and I mean I think

468
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:43,759
it's exciting they're all about the gas

469
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:45,200
they're all about the green weed they're

470
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:46,879
all about the green weed I love that I

471
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,798
love I know those guys they support us

472
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,840
too which is you know this Mega

473
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:53,319
competition it's way more competitive in

474
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:54,918
other states especially the east coast

475
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:56,558
is what I've noticed like California

476
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:58,880
we're all collaborative right like you

477
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:00,000
have your own grow I got to grow we're

478
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,080
not trying to kill each other at all

479
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,440
we're all trying to help each other

480
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:05,879
boost up right it just depends all day

481
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,519
yeah and I'll like you can give me some

482
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:11,080
knowledge I'll share some knowledge with

483
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:12,960
you no problem gentics yeah a lot

484
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:15,759
different right it feels like companies

485
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,558
are way more Cutthroat and there's a lot

486
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:19,599
more money being thrown around and and

487
00:18:17,558 --> 00:18:21,599
it's kind of a monopoly in places like

488
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:24,399
Florida so it's kind of understandable I

489
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:27,439
guess it's more business you know but

490
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,159
Florida has like a serious culture

491
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,240
there's a lot of like good smok out

492
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:34,320
there Growers and people know their weed

493
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,159
yeah honestly it's our best Market

494
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:38,279
better than California well they used to

495
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:40,559
get their weed from Colombia and Mexico

496
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:42,359
and now it's being produced there yeah

497
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:43,720
yeah yeah pretty amazing yeah I'm

498
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:44,959
partnered with the flowery out there

499
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,279
though so I don't know if you know much

500
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,480
about them but they're they've just been

501
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:52,079
nothing but amazing partners and like

502
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:54,200
really great people to work with and

503
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:56,279
that's been I opening to me to want to

504
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,880
do more and more projects other places

505
00:18:56,279 --> 00:19:01,519
to meet people and you know collaborate

506
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,320
like that yeah collaboration's key these

507
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:06,079
days it's like it's so hard to make it

508
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,678
by yourself but then collaborating with

509
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:09,558
other people you could both Brands can

510
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,000
help lift each other up I mean there's

511
00:19:09,558 --> 00:19:13,480
and there's so many ways to collaborate

512
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,880
there's on the genetics level like we do

513
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,640
I feel like working with with

514
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,880
cultivation Partners uh you know we're

515
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:22,480
we're working with flow Gardens in hemp

516
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:24,320
in uh Tennessee nice we're about to do

517
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,599
some big projects with them Eric was on

518
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:30,038
the show a little while ago green houses

519
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:32,759
uh he's indoor okay he's indoor doing t

520
00:19:30,038 --> 00:19:34,319
not a great place for green houses yeah

521
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:36,599
yeah yeah yeah but but they do really

522
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:38,480
good quality stuff I feel like that you

523
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:41,519
know it's like working with other brands

524
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,279
that are like-minded is always great um

525
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:45,839
and then when the focus is on quality I

526
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:48,759
think that's the big thing that's that's

527
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:52,038
the big thing and everyone that does

528
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:54,798
that which is kind of a smaller Circle

529
00:19:52,038 --> 00:19:56,079
you know because the big msos they have

530
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:57,558
the option to do that they have the

531
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:59,678
money to like hire the people

532
00:19:57,558 --> 00:20:02,119
Consultants or bring in like good

533
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,400
Growers that care but a lot of them have

534
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:06,079
like a different mindset and a different

535
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,679
game plan and there's no problem with

536
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:09,798
that because it's all about just getting

537
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,759
money whatever they need to do to get

538
00:20:09,798 --> 00:20:14,599
money it kind of makes sense it's it's

539
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:17,319
expensive to grow like fire weed it's

540
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:19,439
very challenging right so do they want

541
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:21,158
the headache of that right now when all

542
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,679
their weeds selling anyways it's and

543
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:25,000
it's easier and it's cheaper for them to

544
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:27,480
sell right it's just a business model

545
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,720
you know so I I can play I play with

546
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,000
like I cons I'm a consultant too you

547
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,880
know because I've been growing for so

548
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,400
long and I can like help facilities turn

549
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,840
things around if they want to get to

550
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:42,640
Quality right so I can sit in the room

551
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:44,720
with these suits and I know like a lot

552
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,559
of them are cool people too sure you

553
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,519
know to be honest but their mindset is

554
00:20:47,558 --> 00:20:51,918
how do we get the most money out of this

555
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:53,759
because they're trying to build a

556
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,400
massive company right now and maybe in

557
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:57,359
the future they'll convert their

558
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,038
facilities to a higher quality but right

559
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:02,359
now on the sprad rad sheet it

560
00:21:00,038 --> 00:21:05,558
actually better for them to just sell

561
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:07,798
weed right mid quality is important I

562
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:10,319
mean my focus is always on quality but

563
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:12,158
I'm also genetics right so like genetics

564
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:13,798
you have to have the best quality I so

565
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,278
competitive I mean you even do your own

566
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:18,558
pheno hunting yeah for sure and some

567
00:21:16,278 --> 00:21:21,000
breeding I mean s1s f1s I've been doing

568
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:22,278
that for years too pheno hunting is my

569
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
thing though I've been feno hunting

570
00:21:22,278 --> 00:21:26,839
since I first started growing yeah I

571
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,200
started with seeds you know what I mean

572
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:30,879
and all the all the homies the bigger

573
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,240
breeders and stuff too would always send

574
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,840
me I was the tester guy right you know

575
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:37,159
and it's like I just love seeing new

576
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:39,519
[ __ ] always yeah every one of my

577
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:42,159
facilities has an outrageous amount of

578
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:44,200
feto hunts going on at all times I just

579
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,120
know how important it is it is it's so

580
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,679
important moving forward and to find new

581
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:50,678
things that kind of resonate with people

582
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:51,960
and just because I like something

583
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:54,640
doesn't mean everybody else is going to

584
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,960
like it but I think I have a pretty good

585
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,360
hand on the pulse of what everybody

586
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,440
wants to and I think that there's a lot

587
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:01,639
of alignment there I mean it's like with

588
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,720
yourself it's like after you've done it

589
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:06,120
for long enough you understand quality

590
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:08,360
and I can appreciate quality but there's

591
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:10,759
so many different things and it's very

592
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:13,599
subjective very and all of a sudden you

593
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:15,440
know wedding Cake's no longer popular

594
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:18,240
yeah even though it's even though it's

595
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,919
fire especially right ice cream the one

596
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,159
thing I just don't understand there's

597
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,320
ice cream cake gets a lot of hate it

598
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,559
yields too much so everybody grows it

599
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:27,359
and then there's an abundance of ice

600
00:22:25,558 --> 00:22:29,278
cream cake and ice cream cake is amazing

601
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:31,119
especially the rosin from ice cream cake

602
00:22:29,278 --> 00:22:32,720
it's a winner you know in my opinion

603
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:34,199
it's also a good breeder I think it has

604
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,960
a lot of breeding I made millions of

605
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,558
dollars off of ice cream cake so and on

606
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,480
it yeah people trash it online and it's

607
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:42,839
so funny it'll come back it's all you

608
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,440
know eventually it'll come back once

609
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:47,199
like the MSO started growing it that's

610
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,919
what happens and then there was a ton of

611
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,080
mid ice cream cake yeah I mean throw

612
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,080
punch away but keep the ice cream cake

613
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:55,599
for sure yeah kill kill that one kill

614
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:57,319
the fake turps and it's like there's the

615
00:22:55,599 --> 00:23:00,240
Oreos and the purple punches that have

616
00:22:57,319 --> 00:23:03,359
made their rounds too and like m i you

617
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,278
know I think they're one one good cross

618
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:06,879
from away from being good I think like

619
00:23:05,278 --> 00:23:08,558
you cross it with the right thing there

620
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,960
good potential yeah I agree I think we

621
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:12,119
shouldn't get rid of them I think they

622
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,319
have they need some power give them

623
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:17,759
power they need TS put some C in the

624
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:19,480
moros yeah so some GMO some chem some of

625
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:21,879
that yeah some of that dies I agree for

626
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:26,038
sure and people like it and the and what

627
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:27,760
PE like all right this is how like we

628
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:29,759
look at things right now we're a really

629
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:31,200
small team we have like a lot of like

630
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:34,038
close meetings but we're looking at

631
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,798
things as in the wreck market and all

632
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:37,879
these other states and everywhere else

633
00:23:35,798 --> 00:23:39,759
right we have this heady Circle yeah

634
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:43,600
that we all we can think of is This

635
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:46,319
heady Circle right this 1% not even 1%

636
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:49,480
of the market yeah then there's this 99%

637
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:51,439
that loves weed but they don't know weed

638
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,038
like we know weed right right they're

639
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,200
going to buy the Oreos they're going to

640
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:56,759
buy the and be happy with it and be

641
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,360
happy with it and they're going to get

642
00:23:56,759 --> 00:24:02,599
high from it even you know but like

643
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:05,359
we're so [ __ ] heady and stuck in this

644
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:08,278
1% that we can't break out of and be

645
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:10,319
successful with this 99% yeah go to a

646
00:24:08,278 --> 00:24:12,599
dispensary and do an event we do them

647
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:14,960
all day all the all the time so we we

648
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:16,719
have data for days I've had dis I've had

649
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,759
delivery services we know what people

650
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,240
are buying right right it's not what we

651
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:24,240
think like us right here we know too

652
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:26,440
much yeah we have to find people new

653
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,519
people in weed to test them out yeah

654
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:31,120
test them out figure out what they want

655
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:34,278
look at the companies that are Mega

656
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:37,759
successful that actually grow good weed

657
00:24:34,278 --> 00:24:40,079
it's just like pretty it's smells good

658
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:43,879
yeah you know what I mean but like the

659
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:46,079
Mad heady like Z no [ __ ] chance yeah

660
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,520
it's all Street weed it's yeah it's the

661
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:49,599
Trap weed or whatever it's the Trap weed

662
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,839
it's the 1% yeah they'll pay the most

663
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:54,079
for it but it's not even 1% it's not

664
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:56,398
even 1% so we all need to be successful

665
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:59,558
somehow and figure out how to merge this

666
00:24:56,398 --> 00:25:02,759
99% with the 1% yeah and we're pushing

667
00:24:59,558 --> 00:25:05,319
it as much as we can I'm in this circle

668
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:07,798
where we can kind of dictate what's good

669
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:10,879
and what's not in the he side yeah right

670
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:13,480
we can say we can bring up a strain a

671
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,520
cross or whatever it is and a couple of

672
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:19,038
guys that you know I'm with can say it's

673
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:22,119
amazing and it's amazing right but only

674
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:24,480
in that heady Circle not in not in what

675
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:26,079
really matters in the in the stores so

676
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,360
who's successful in the stores I look up

677
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:32,079
to that too yeah it's really a challenge

678
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:33,719
blue dream blue dream crushes it we just

679
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:35,158
dropped blue dream and it [ __ ] sold

680
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,558
out in like two seconds I'll have to

681
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:38,278
show you some of my blue dream crosses

682
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:39,960
that I made that are very blue dream but

683
00:25:38,278 --> 00:25:41,880
also something new I feel like yeah we

684
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,960
have dream candy and we have different

685
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,039
fenos and we're kind of renaming the

686
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,399
different fenos because we have one

687
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:48,879
that's really candy but it's very you

688
00:25:47,398 --> 00:25:51,038
smell it and you're like it's straight

689
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,600
Nostalgia blue dreams fire it was the

690
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:55,640
same thing msl's got a hold of it it

691
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:58,359
pumps out four lbs of light with your

692
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:00,600
eyes closed outdoor there was Millions

693
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:03,119
and millions of pounds you get sick of

694
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:05,240
everything but when it was still craft

695
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:07,558
in small where only a handful of people

696
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:10,319
had it it was top shelf that was so loud

697
00:26:07,558 --> 00:26:12,119
it's got so much flavor sticky it was

698
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:14,000
sticky the buds were perfect you didn't

699
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:16,719
have Smalls everything was we grew Blue

700
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,359
Dream for like a long time yeah had to

701
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,240
call it Platinum Blue Dream because

702
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:23,599
everyone had blue dream totally then it

703
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:25,640
lasted another year and then it died

704
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:27,319
yeah it completely died yeah Sour's

705
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,000
making a comeback though I see a lot of

706
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:30,720
people growing sour again I'm excited

707
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,359
about that I love sour it's something

708
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,558
that I've I've Loved for a long long

709
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:38,319
time yeah Sour's great yeah it might not

710
00:26:35,558 --> 00:26:40,519
have the best structure but uh the the

711
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:42,200
back in the day some of the ugliest weed

712
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:43,960
was also the most expensive weed cat

713
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,399
piss was the ugliest it was like when we

714
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:48,558
got it it was shreds in a bag and it was

715
00:26:45,398 --> 00:26:50,398
$60 an e all the way up yeah for sure so

716
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:51,519
before Instagram before people had to

717
00:26:50,398 --> 00:26:55,359
see what it looked like New York

718
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:58,319
dictates a lot honestly and that sour

719
00:26:55,359 --> 00:27:00,879
was like I started from soil you you

720
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:04,119
know in outdoor in the Hills so it was

721
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:06,200
Sour like when all my sour was sold you

722
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:08,038
better find the neighbor sour you know

723
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,558
what I mean because New York would just

724
00:27:08,038 --> 00:27:12,960
eat everything alive somehow whoever was

725
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:14,519
getting it in Sacramento or whatever I

726
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,360
guarantee was getting to New York

727
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:18,359
because no one really cared for it in in

728
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:20,599
Northern California that at that point

729
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:22,558
yeah and it's still I mean I'm sure they

730
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:25,038
still want it back they have that taste

731
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:27,359
for it they do so I I was just came from

732
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:29,839
New York actually and and I just pulled

733
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:31,240
a bunch of data stores flowery and

734
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:32,480
partnered with them they have they're

735
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,038
going to be like the biggest chain in

736
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,159
New York they have like five stores

737
00:27:34,038 --> 00:27:37,519
right now they're going to have eight in

738
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:40,240
like the next two months and then 10 or

739
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:43,679
11 real soon they're they're just good

740
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,919
yeah um but what's the top selling skew

741
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,798
of flower is sour I don't know if it's

742
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:51,559
real Sour I doubt [ __ ] it's real Sour

743
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:54,240
but it's sour name yeah I just started

744
00:27:51,558 --> 00:27:55,519
seeing real Sour come back it's like uh

745
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,640
you know we had one of the guys on the

746
00:27:55,519 --> 00:28:00,839
podcast Dave from bud budalo and then my

747
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,519
friend Josh he's growing real Sour again

748
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:04,759
and it's like in California and it's the

749
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:07,000
real real Drew green dog had a real Sour

750
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:09,960
for sure yeah and then uh we we were

751
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,919
growing a a sour bx1 that definitely had

752
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:15,319
like the sour smell and structure but it

753
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:17,679
wasn't it it's hard to say it's been so

754
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:19,639
many years so like we're always like

755
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,880
that's not it that's not it's not the

756
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:23,960
same I wish I had some here to show you

757
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,240
because when you see the real Sour again

758
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,278
you squeeze it you're like oh that's

759
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,440
it's

760
00:28:26,278 --> 00:28:30,519
unmistakable what real Sour is once you

761
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,759
see it again if you experienced it for

762
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:35,079
enough time in your life yeah just like

763
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:36,879
super Cil Haze and stuff like that I got

764
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:38,759
some of that here actually I love super

765
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,799
silver me too yeah Crush I love some of

766
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:42,640
those yeah me too I Crush I love that I

767
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:44,158
love the TPS on that I love the strength

768
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,799
of it and maybe it's not the first thing

769
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,440
I go to every time but I love the flavor

770
00:28:45,798 --> 00:28:49,639
yeah it gives you some anxiety I mean

771
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,840
now it just depends on what you like but

772
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,720
it's better than candy yeah some of

773
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:56,240
those good hazes you got to switch it up

774
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:58,519
I feel like they have amazing candy out

775
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:01,359
there but like it's just it's it's just

776
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:04,599
one thing we it's just one color in the

777
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:08,519
whole uh I think people like candy

778
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:10,439
because goes back to New York too is uh

779
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:13,480
it cuts through a blunt for some weird

780
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:15,519
reason even even if it's like not great

781
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:17,480
yeah and it it doesn't even have a great

782
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:19,278
smell or nothing yeah you taste it

783
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:21,360
through a blunt better than you do

784
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:23,880
through a joint well that's why a weird

785
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:25,759
strain tped weed people it's cuz it's

786
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:28,159
those blunt smokers yeah with the grabba

787
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:29,839
and they're mixing tobacco with the with

788
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,519
balance and yeah that TP weed that

789
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:33,519
shit's garbage though yeah I mean I

790
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:36,200
think czy the concept it's like oh well

791
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:37,960
they they TP uh carts and it's like I

792
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,399
wouldn't smoke those either it's just

793
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:42,880
not my thing but it's like the top mover

794
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:44,759
and people are making you know $5,000 a

795
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,360
pound for that stuff and it's like it's

796
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:48,278
cool whatever like no I mean like the

797
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:49,678
carts oh yeah yeah I don't know what's

798
00:29:48,278 --> 00:29:52,319
going on I don't stay I don't even

799
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,919
listen to the TP sprayed [ __ ] cuz that's

800
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:55,639
I want native CH most of it's probably

801
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:56,960
poison you know who knows what the hell

802
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,440
they're doing with most of it some of

803
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,360
it's done right I know there's

804
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,679
facilities that use like some crazy

805
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:04,119
machine to do it but you're still

806
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,440
smoking some something weird that smells

807
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:08,239
like bubble gum I'm straight I'm all

808
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,798
about the Rosen carts I I I didn't like

809
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,599
carts for a while I mean I go back and

810
00:30:09,798 --> 00:30:13,599
forth with do I like carts do I not like

811
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:15,278
carts but the Rosen half gram carts

812
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:17,240
that's I think that's the magic number

813
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:19,398
right there is half gram yeah and good

814
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:22,319
Rosen carts are amazing and I feel like

815
00:30:19,398 --> 00:30:23,918
it's a more natural product uh the cryo

816
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:25,798
trimmer I don't know if you've seen that

817
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:28,360
but they have the resonator does a cryo

818
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:30,759
trimmer where they pump liquid CO2 in

819
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:32,359
and I hate trim machines I absolutely

820
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:34,158
hate trim machines and then I saw this

821
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:36,079
the other day and I'm I've heard about

822
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,919
it for a long time and I don't believe

823
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:41,359
anything till I see it and going and

824
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:43,080
seeing the demo it changed my mind uh

825
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:45,038
for a trim machine because I'm I'm just

826
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:46,398
so anti you still got to finish it by

827
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:48,599
hand but it does a really good job and

828
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:50,599
then you can actually press rosin from

829
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:52,480
the Keef you separate they have they

830
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:54,079
have bags to go on so you can separate

831
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,120
your different layers so you have your

832
00:30:54,079 --> 00:31:00,240
200 Micron your 150 and your 50 and you

833
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:03,119
can capture the 50 to 150 then press it

834
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:05,519
and it's a pretty good Rosy yeah um you

835
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:06,759
know and I'm not endorsed by them or

836
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,319
anything I just think the products is

837
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:10,240
really cool and especially if you're

838
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:12,158
doing some sort of hand rolls or

839
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,759
pre-rolls yeah yeah I mean there's

840
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:17,639
there's a place for machines too yeah I

841
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:19,079
mean there there is Big scale large

842
00:31:17,638 --> 00:31:20,719
green houses that you're not going to be

843
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:22,038
able to get the quality you need out of

844
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,720
if you're doing pre-rolls if you're

845
00:31:22,038 --> 00:31:27,638
doing like cheap half ounces and you you

846
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,360
can't make a margin off a hand trim I

847
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:31,359
mean it's the biggest expense in every

848
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:33,678
cultivation facility is the trim for

849
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:35,278
sure you can do 400 lbs a day and I

850
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,679
think the trim it cost it ends up

851
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:39,319
costing you less than $20 a pound yeah

852
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,679
crazy it's crazy that we've gone that

853
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:42,319
far yeah i' played with the Mobius a

854
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:45,960
million times and a bunch of different

855
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:48,480
facilities I it's like the best of that

856
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:50,399
from what I've seen of that situation

857
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,000
but I [ __ ] hate trim machines for

858
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:53,278
sure I mean they're they [ __ ] it up

859
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,038
every time no matter what when this

860
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:58,319
doesn't cut it it actually has a net

861
00:31:55,038 --> 00:32:00,558
that looks like like fish uh like

862
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:02,240
fishnet that women wear and it's

863
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:03,599
stretched over this thing and it gently

864
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,240
tumbles the stuff and it knocks the

865
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:08,079
leaves off and we looked in the

866
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:10,638
microscope before and after and then I

867
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:12,240
smoked the weed I mean we're sending lab

868
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:14,519
results in now to make sure that like

869
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,839
we're not losing anything off it but I

870
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:19,759
think my friends are super stoked on it

871
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:21,319
and I think potential for it great yeah

872
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:24,079
I'm glad you said that because I I'm

873
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:26,119
licensed in uh Pennsylvania and they use

874
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:28,278
am Mobius because they it's just so hard

875
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:31,798
to get employees out there MH and they

876
00:32:28,278 --> 00:32:33,919
use a Mobius right and testing results

877
00:32:31,798 --> 00:32:35,638
it's so weird in every state right

878
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,360
testing is all [ __ ] for the most

879
00:32:35,638 --> 00:32:39,719
part no one's really like landed the

880
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:41,879
proper testing yet to this point there's

881
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:44,159
no consistency but there is consistency

882
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:46,278
in each state for whatever that

883
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:49,720
consistency is if you know what I mean

884
00:32:46,278 --> 00:32:51,359
right so if everything's hitting sub 20%

885
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,519
for the most part coming out of this

886
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:56,558
trim machine so I had them do some hand

887
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:58,558
trim pass in the hand trim stuff yeah

888
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:00,960
scope it of course there's a lot of

889
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:02,558
heads knocked off from the trim machines

890
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,240
yeah and there's damage and there's

891
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:07,200
there's also like chunks of leaf stuck

892
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:09,038
in the bud from the from the trim

893
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,840
machine right and they're doing super

894
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:14,240
light pass a little hand work on the

895
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:16,798
outside and you know the most expensive

896
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,000
trimmer or whatever the Mobius yeah and

897
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:22,879
it's test results are much better when

898
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,440
you hand Trim in Pennsylvania just FY it

899
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,200
was just something that we did just to

900
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:29,159
see if it you know totally and it's kind

901
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,440
we kind of hit trimmed it too just to

902
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:32,960
try to not touch it as much as possible

903
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,440
right and that was we got better results

904
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,038
from that yeah it's interesting all

905
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:39,000
these things coming online I mean new

906
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:40,759
technology comes out every year I

907
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,960
haven't seen a lot of innovation in the

908
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:44,240
last little bit I mean other than

909
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:46,319
lighting yeah under canopies has been

910
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,919
probably the biggest Innovation and

911
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:50,879
cultivation that you know I have friends

912
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:53,960
in green houses that over this winter

913
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,919
are just using under canopy with the low

914
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,480
low ppfd from the Sun and they're

915
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,360
getting really good results yeah hell

916
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:02,839
yeah for sure I under canopies in my

917
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:04,638
Greenhouse now yeah um I'm a huge

918
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:06,918
believer in underc canopy lights as much

919
00:34:04,638 --> 00:34:08,559
as I [ __ ] hate looking at him you

920
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:11,280
know what I mean totally I love those

921
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:14,159
faven you know it's like uh yeah Tim

922
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,519
Bobby bags yeah yeah he's great those

923
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,960
are the homies yeah and I mean the game

924
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:20,918
changer right there I mean the under

925
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:22,320
canopy for yield especially and I think

926
00:34:20,918 --> 00:34:23,638
with LED lights you're getting more

927
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:27,039
purple now on the bottom than you're on

928
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:29,399
the tops mhm yeah it's not even not just

929
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:31,039
the bottoms that you benefit from that's

930
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:32,679
the cool thing about under canopy and

931
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:34,838
the thing that people don't even really

932
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:37,599
understand about it is the yield comes

933
00:34:34,838 --> 00:34:40,000
from the top yeah it's the plant is

934
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:41,480
absorbing light and it just even if you

935
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,398
stripped off everything on the bottom

936
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:45,480
you're going to gain from under canopy

937
00:34:43,398 --> 00:34:47,039
lights yeah and I think more lights

938
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,358
different Spectrum I like the red less

939
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:50,960
labor less labor I like the less labor

940
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:52,639
Factor so you're only pulling fan leaves

941
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,838
and you're not having to completely

942
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:57,000
clean out the undercarriage yeah I think

943
00:34:54,838 --> 00:34:58,838
that that'll save you some money and

944
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
over the period of a year five years

945
00:34:58,838 --> 00:35:03,759
that can be significant yeah we did a

946
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,119
lot of research you know we' we've had

947
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,640
them for a long time at this point I

948
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:10,640
don't know couple years you know when

949
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:13,679
craft farmer first kind of dropped them

950
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:15,639
faving like right at the same time we

951
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:18,838
did them all bunch of side by sides and

952
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:20,879
stuff honestly it's more labor for us MH

953
00:35:18,838 --> 00:35:22,679
because I wasn't like a proponent of

954
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,440
like heavy de leafing and you know

955
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:28,358
stripping anyway anyway yeah I was not

956
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,760
to an extreme I found the even medium of

957
00:35:28,358 --> 00:35:32,838
having less plant count right you know

958
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:35,599
gaining more getting higher yields from

959
00:35:32,838 --> 00:35:37,400
less plant count still having my solar

960
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:39,000
panels on the leaves if you look at my

961
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,880
plants they're always pretty full for

962
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,239
the most part I don't believe in like

963
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,838
stripping the dog [ __ ] out of them

964
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:45,559
because I did it for so many years and

965
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:47,719
when I did side by sides with less

966
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:50,078
plants and leaving them alone a little

967
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:52,480
bit more I got better results wow in

968
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:55,960
quality in yields all the way across the

969
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:58,000
board like non-top plants mhm but uh

970
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:00,960
it's more labor for us to do the under

971
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,920
canopies but it's so minute yeah that

972
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,400
and you get such a gain from it that it

973
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:08,079
doesn't matter wow yeah and more

974
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,880
nutrients more water use more

975
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:13,200
dehumidification there is things you got

976
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:15,599
to consider for sure but it's yields are

977
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:17,879
way better the quality is the same if

978
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:21,960
not better yeah same if not better I

979
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:25,079
would agree so per 4x4 how many plants

980
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:27,079
you put typically nine right now at most

981
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:29,760
yeah yeah yeah we're doing nine too I

982
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:33,480
mean I think that nine is a a sweet spot

983
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:35,079
yeah a lot of guys do 12 15 20 one PL

984
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:37,280
per square my buddy that was doing

985
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:39,079
Skittles was doing 25 to get three

986
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,720
pounds of light yeah and you know and

987
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:41,880
that's cool for what he more issues come

988
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:43,639
with that for sure now he's doing under

989
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,880
canopy and I think he uses nine and he's

990
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:48,239
getting we do like six in Florida six

991
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:50,000
plants per in Florida and every nug is

992
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:51,399
perfect yeah my buddy you know what I

993
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,920
mean when you do that every butt is

994
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:55,720
perfect you might you might lose like a

995
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:59,680
little bit of yield but every piece of

996
00:36:55,719 --> 00:37:00,838
it is like perfect pble totally it all

997
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:02,399
depends on what you're what you're

998
00:37:00,838 --> 00:37:04,519
trying to do if you're if you're pushing

999
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,160
bags like turkeys yeah then you might

1000
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:07,960
want to put a little bit more plants but

1001
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:09,639
not too many where it causes it depends

1002
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:12,039
on what your calculations are on

1003
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:16,000
dehumidification HVAC all that how's

1004
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:17,719
your room setup but um package Goods

1005
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,318
less plants is way better because you

1006
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:22,519
can package like every bit of it right

1007
00:37:20,318 --> 00:37:24,679
you know that's that's huge yeah I think

1008
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:25,960
the biggest part of cultivation where

1009
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:27,919
people screw up is their

1010
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:30,400
dehumidification they don't get enough

1011
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,280
for sure so I see that time and time and

1012
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,920
time again always and you add a du and

1013
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:37,720
you try and you're out of

1014
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:39,760
power still not enough and then yeah

1015
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:40,759
that's normally the problem yeah I mean

1016
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,200
it used to be the guys with the

1017
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:44,160
reservoirs in their rooms and wondering

1018
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:45,679
why they couldn't dehumidify their stuff

1019
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:47,799
properly it's like you got to pull that

1020
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:49,799
out bu rot and everything yeah yeah that

1021
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:52,760
was pretty standard like 10 years ago it

1022
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:54,599
was for sure it's evolved a lot I mean

1023
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:56,760
shout out jungle boys to be honest

1024
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:58,280
everyone kind of took what they were saw

1025
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:01,000
what they were doing took that and try

1026
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:03,200
to better it now it isn't evolving much

1027
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,920
from there if you know what I mean just

1028
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:07,598
like you said like what's what's the new

1029
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:10,240
innovation in this space is not a ton

1030
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:11,880
everyone's so [ __ ] busy right though

1031
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:15,279
like every

1032
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:16,720
second every second counts so how do you

1033
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,560
we've thought about it do we want to put

1034
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:21,559
energy into these things well like we

1035
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:23,159
got to put energy into the brand we got

1036
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:25,400
to put energy into the grow when you

1037
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:27,239
stop putting energy into the grow yeah

1038
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,880
you're totally [ __ ] so totally you

1039
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:30,000
know is it worth like putting energy in

1040
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,838
these other things it's a lot to

1041
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,838
consider yeah I mean I like the Light

1042
00:38:31,838 --> 00:38:36,719
Lift I think that for dialing P ppfd you

1043
00:38:34,838 --> 00:38:38,440
know we used to use yo-yos and so it's

1044
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:40,078
nice to be able to have it on iPad where

1045
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:42,280
we can bring it up and down yeah it's

1046
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:45,240
cool I mean it's another trick and toy

1047
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:47,680
it can do I mean if you if you do the

1048
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:49,279
proper research it's worth it for sure a

1049
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:50,559
lot of people just have light lifters to

1050
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,760
have them because it was kind of cool to

1051
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:54,639
put them in in the beginning DPS was

1052
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:58,079
putting them in a lot of these big huge

1053
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:59,759
massive grows and they mango has his own

1054
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,880
version of The Light Lift yeah I'm sure

1055
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,000
he's doing his research like he's all

1056
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,400
about that so like if someone did if

1057
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,800
someone's will if you got someone to put

1058
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:10,480
in the work and spreadsheet it out and

1059
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:12,318
see if you can get you know an extra

1060
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,240
five grams of square foot and it's worth

1061
00:39:12,318 --> 00:39:16,800
it all day then you can move them around

1062
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:17,838
and it's worth like the the headache of

1063
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,200
you're going to have to fix them here

1064
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:21,960
and there it's just another piece that

1065
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:25,358
can break too exactly exactly so I don't

1066
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:27,480
I don't build them with them just FY but

1067
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:29,119
maybe I would if you if you prove to me

1068
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,838
that it was worth it you'll see the data

1069
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:34,039
here soon enough I mean and then also

1070
00:39:30,838 --> 00:39:35,799
with the faven and versus the faven and

1071
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:37,679
also combined with the faven so we'll

1072
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,000
have both we're going to do seed

1073
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:40,358
production on that as well so I'll be

1074
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,239
able to get some numbers on what kind of

1075
00:39:40,358 --> 00:39:43,920
seed production that we're doing and I'm

1076
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:46,078
excited about getting my numbers up

1077
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,800
really high I mean we're at 50,000 seeds

1078
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:49,760
per light for 4x4 now we're talking see

1079
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,560
now we're talking about something

1080
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,920
different that no one really thinks

1081
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:56,119
about much other than big a but in

1082
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,039
cannabis who's actually like oh this is

1083
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:59,720
how many seeds I'm getting per square

1084
00:39:58,039 --> 00:40:01,719
foot I've never I've don't think I've

1085
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:03,118
ever heard that yeah with autoflowers

1086
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:04,719
it's like we do Autoflower seed

1087
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,960
production too but it's like we do photo

1088
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:08,439
period and that's it's very cultivar

1089
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,880
dependent but with autoflowers I'm

1090
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,519
getting really high numbers across the

1091
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,680
board and it's like how high can I push

1092
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:14,800
that gets me really excited because you

1093
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:16,399
know it's like with the indoor

1094
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,720
environment you can really control

1095
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,318
everything yeah you do it in a

1096
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:21,838
greenhouse you can you can almost

1097
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:23,480
control everything yeah you can't

1098
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:25,639
outdoor you can't control any of it you

1099
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,318
can get pollen from somewhere you you do

1100
00:40:25,639 --> 00:40:28,719
an

1101
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:29,838
acre in the middle of a regular season

1102
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:31,279
more than likely you're going to have

1103
00:40:29,838 --> 00:40:33,679
some sort of cross-contamination

1104
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,319
somewhere MH yeah so depends on the

1105
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:36,639
county depends on the region depends on

1106
00:40:35,318 --> 00:40:38,679
a million different things if you want

1107
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:40,598
to grow it for cheaper you would

1108
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:42,879
probably put it in like a mix light or a

1109
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:44,519
greenhouse facility right yeah it but it

1110
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,039
depends on the volume you need if you

1111
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:47,559
can push through that amount then you

1112
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:49,759
need to get as much yield as you

1113
00:40:47,559 --> 00:40:51,679
possibly can per square foot right

1114
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,200
exactly with seeds and they're going to

1115
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:55,118
be quality seeds you're going to get

1116
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:57,318
really good quality seeds and the the

1117
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,880
favin and I believe this is my first

1118
00:40:57,318 --> 00:41:00,639
time running favin with seed production

1119
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,838
but I believe we are going to get even

1120
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:05,000
seeds from top to bottom typically the

1121
00:41:02,838 --> 00:41:07,679
stuff on the bottom they're not as nice

1122
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,119
as top yeah you get lighter seeds and

1123
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:10,719
then we got to separate them and all

1124
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,920
that stuff so if I can get even seeds

1125
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:15,039
across the board I mean I think that

1126
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:18,200
could be a big game changer smart I love

1127
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:19,519
that that's uh that's cool I like new

1128
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:21,559
[ __ ] that's the thing with me in

1129
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:23,280
cultivation and all that is that's why I

1130
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:24,960
feno hunt so much because I wouldn't

1131
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,960
grow weed if I couldn't feno hunt to be

1132
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,318
honest if I can't see a new strains like

1133
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:33,079
on regular basis yeah and I just have to

1134
00:41:29,318 --> 00:41:36,239
grow like [ __ ] acre of candy mhm it's

1135
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:39,318
not for me I'll go conso do something

1136
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:41,959
different yeah no it's so hard like why

1137
00:41:39,318 --> 00:41:44,639
not you know you could if working

1138
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:47,079
working this hard you could you're G

1139
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:48,838
make money doing anything right yeah

1140
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:50,359
yeah I I feel you especially if you're a

1141
00:41:48,838 --> 00:41:51,759
hard worker you can go to almost any

1142
00:41:50,358 --> 00:41:53,199
industry and figure out how to make it

1143
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,319
if you can make it in this industry with

1144
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:56,598
as hard as this to work oh yeah for sure

1145
00:41:55,318 --> 00:41:57,960
but and there's something special about

1146
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:59,640
seeing new stuff stuff and that's not

1147
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:01,639
the stressful part either finding new

1148
00:41:59,639 --> 00:42:03,838
stuff it's like I find weird stuff I get

1149
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:05,159
I get excited about the strangest things

1150
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:07,159
you know we had one that smelled kind of

1151
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:09,039
like vomit and and it's like so

1152
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:10,279
disgusting but at the same time you want

1153
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:12,838
all your friends to smell it because

1154
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:14,760
it's so out of the box the thug pug all

1155
00:42:12,838 --> 00:42:16,719
the thug pug work before he'd always

1156
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:18,800
have like some runchy like weird

1157
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:22,000
smelling stuff that was either like like

1158
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:24,039
rotten chocolate or totally that's cool

1159
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,480
different turps would be awesome

1160
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:28,119
everything's kind of like what's new now

1161
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,960
you know there not a lot of new stuff

1162
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:32,039
but there there still come you know

1163
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:33,358
we're still seeing new stuff I think

1164
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:35,759
we're going back to the drawing board

1165
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:37,880
with some land race varieties and and

1166
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,240
basically germinating him here and then

1167
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:42,519
taking them out to everybody else and

1168
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:43,799
seeing what we can do with them but uh a

1169
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:45,318
lot of stuff is like we get so

1170
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,200
bottlenecked especially in the United

1171
00:42:45,318 --> 00:42:48,599
States like candy candy candy everyone's

1172
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:49,519
got to have it has to be candy and it

1173
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:52,880
has to have

1174
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:54,440
color I mean that's great for the people

1175
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,559
that like that but there's so many other

1176
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:59,880
things that you can share I love like

1177
00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:02,319
Florida yeah they [ __ ] know good weed

1178
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:04,280
and they they like green weed more than

1179
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:07,759
they like candy and purple weed to be

1180
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:07,760
honest that's where the turs are too

1181
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,800
like [ __ ] yeah they like stuff they just

1182
00:43:10,039 --> 00:43:14,039
like turps that's the main thing I feel

1183
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:16,039
like they want it to taste crazy yeah

1184
00:43:14,039 --> 00:43:17,960
and it doesn't matter like like citrus

1185
00:43:16,039 --> 00:43:21,400
is like probably most popping thing in

1186
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:23,720
Florida wow so and C was like dead it's

1187
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:26,400
the least yeah Jack Herrera is the least

1188
00:43:23,719 --> 00:43:28,000
like strain in California I would say h

1189
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,519
yeah and it's also something I really

1190
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,880
like if it's done well yeah um but a lot

1191
00:43:30,519 --> 00:43:35,119
of these guys that are newer they never

1192
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,400
got to experience the good Jack because

1193
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:39,400
you know in the 90s and the early 2000s

1194
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:41,800
there was amazing Jack herrer there was

1195
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:43,358
amazing Jack crosses Jack Flash that was

1196
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:46,000
some of the best [ __ ] I ever seen in my

1197
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:48,000
life yeah small badge people cared for

1198
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,639
it real Farmers putting in the work and

1199
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,039
actually like focusing on their plants

1200
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:54,719
now when you know the msos are growing

1201
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:56,358
massive amounts of Jack it's going to be

1202
00:43:54,719 --> 00:43:59,519
hella mid Jack and all they're going to

1203
00:43:56,358 --> 00:44:02,119
be able to get at store for cheap is

1204
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:04,318
Jack that sucks right but it smells good

1205
00:44:02,119 --> 00:44:08,680
regardless I mean it still smells good

1206
00:44:04,318 --> 00:44:10,679
yeah wind XE smelling Jack yeah H yeah I

1207
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:12,838
like I don't like the high that much but

1208
00:44:10,679 --> 00:44:15,000
no I don't I don't either from Jack but

1209
00:44:12,838 --> 00:44:16,639
there was um I can't even think of the

1210
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,480
brand that's down in La I think they're

1211
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:21,118
still there but they have their own Jack

1212
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:23,639
Herrera and it's it's not it's funky

1213
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:27,640
Jack it's like nose burning but like

1214
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:29,759
really high on that trinoline limine mhm

1215
00:44:27,639 --> 00:44:31,519
and like like a haze but it's definitely

1216
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,119
that cleaner like where it burns your

1217
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:34,519
nostrils every time you smell it it goes

1218
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,680
to burn your nostrils and then the high

1219
00:44:34,519 --> 00:44:38,039
from it was really strong Jack typically

1220
00:44:36,679 --> 00:44:40,639
didn't have a strong high like

1221
00:44:38,039 --> 00:44:44,639
especially the stuff I see now yeah but

1222
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:46,358
Jack Flash it was like this funky lemony

1223
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:47,799
amazing stuff and and it looked it had

1224
00:44:46,358 --> 00:44:50,119
the bag appeal and it was so sticky you

1225
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:51,920
could take a you could thumb a bud onto

1226
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:53,800
the wall you know yeah that was so that

1227
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,800
was the good times California kind of

1228
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:58,280
[ __ ] that up with the smoke ability

1229
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:00,400
and the burn and the you can't have like

1230
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:02,800
cracked out stick weed that you can

1231
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,599
stick on the wall is not going to ignite

1232
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,960
the way that you want it to ignite at

1233
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:08,079
this point some of that stuff won't even

1234
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:09,480
go through the grinder you know it

1235
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:12,359
sticks to your grind that's how the

1236
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:14,639
Florida weed is right now so like uh

1237
00:45:12,358 --> 00:45:18,598
Brian out there he's just [ __ ] super

1238
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:20,639
heady grower yeah and this guy Trent

1239
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:22,519
he's he's like the Cure guy so like when

1240
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:25,400
there's a cure guy who's focused on

1241
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:27,838
[ __ ] dry cure like this guy is it

1242
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:30,358
changes the game yeah right and the

1243
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:31,960
[ __ ] weed out there you we stick it

1244
00:45:30,358 --> 00:45:34,558
to the wall all the time like whenever I

1245
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:36,119
get my samples I'll be in the hot Hotel

1246
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:37,480
I'll stick it to the wall I'll leave

1247
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:39,559
I'll come back it'll still be stuck to

1248
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:42,599
the wall yeah it's crazy that's when you

1249
00:45:39,559 --> 00:45:43,920
know it's good that the thumb test yeah

1250
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:46,160
but that's that comes with a lot of

1251
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:49,039
babying right and it's 100,000 foot

1252
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:52,039
facility how do you like burp bags 12

1253
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:54,159
times a day and make sure like check the

1254
00:45:52,039 --> 00:45:56,440
exact humidities and make sure and

1255
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:59,879
you're in a challenging spot too and

1256
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:01,720
like near Miami like the yeah outside is

1257
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,400
ruthless well that's the beauty of the

1258
00:46:01,719 --> 00:46:05,318
tur loock I mean they basically eat up

1259
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,880
CO2 they they absorb CO2 through the

1260
00:46:05,318 --> 00:46:09,279
liner so now you don't need to burp them

1261
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:12,358
anymore I mean that's but you still you

1262
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:14,960
bring that outside in in Florida oh done

1263
00:46:12,358 --> 00:46:16,759
and it's done even the tur block stands

1264
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,480
no chance you know what I mean the the

1265
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:20,920
best thing there is stands no chance but

1266
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:23,039
a jar way worse it gets crushed like

1267
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:25,000
that like that yeah yeah so you brought

1268
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:27,318
some interesting flour today yeah I

1269
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,880
brought some flavors for us to sniff

1270
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:31,279
through I don't know if you want to look

1271
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:33,039
at some things now here's the the mix

1272
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,800
light Z that's in a big competition

1273
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:35,079
right now I don't know if you're

1274
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,800
following along let's talk about that

1275
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:38,960
proper doinks competition I think that's

1276
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,640
popping off really quickly proper doinks

1277
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:43,159
those guys are all about their indoors

1278
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:46,039
right like highend indoors and they they

1279
00:46:43,159 --> 00:46:48,558
have never supposedly had any like mix

1280
00:46:46,039 --> 00:46:50,599
light or outdoor or any sungrown stuff

1281
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:52,319
that's been any good at all that that

1282
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:55,800
burns you know they like things that

1283
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:57,079
burn clean they specific thing that

1284
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,039
they're looking for they're they're

1285
00:46:57,079 --> 00:47:01,519
really [ __ ] good with with like what

1286
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:04,639
they're you know what they do and what

1287
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:06,838
what defines quality to them at first I

1288
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:08,440
was like I'm an old school kind of

1289
00:47:06,838 --> 00:47:09,480
farmer guy at first I was like [ __ ]

1290
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:11,400
these guys they don't know what they're

1291
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:13,240
talking about now I'm like these guys

1292
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:16,160
know what they're talking about honestly

1293
00:47:13,239 --> 00:47:18,759
and they're they they stir the pot a lot

1294
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:21,279
which is kind of like important to do in

1295
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:23,319
their space yeah and they're also very

1296
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:25,880
strict about what they like right and

1297
00:47:23,318 --> 00:47:28,159
it's and they're not like we're homies

1298
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:30,200
and they're going to be like this is not

1299
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:32,598
it trash everyone like they'll bring on

1300
00:47:30,199 --> 00:47:34,039
all their friends and it's all batch to

1301
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:35,480
batch so you're going to get clowned

1302
00:47:34,039 --> 00:47:37,519
here and there and you got to be willing

1303
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:39,119
to take it and it's kind of hard for

1304
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:41,960
people to grow weed well you guys are

1305
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:43,440
having fun with it too it looks like um

1306
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:47,159
you know and then you got the thing it's

1307
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:50,800
with be easy right yeah so uh someone on

1308
00:47:47,159 --> 00:47:52,598
X said have you ever tried Dave's mix

1309
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,599
light they've smoked a bunch of my indor

1310
00:47:52,599 --> 00:47:57,119
you know and certain things they love

1311
00:47:54,599 --> 00:48:00,079
other things maybe not so much cuz it's

1312
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:01,440
probably like a a stickier more you know

1313
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:03,599
what something that I like a little bit

1314
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,119
more is maybe not what they like yeah

1315
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:06,400
but I was like yeah I got some I just

1316
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,400
got back from New York I was like I got

1317
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,639
some mix light for you guys right now

1318
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,079
and he's like you want to go up against

1319
00:48:09,639 --> 00:48:14,759
some indoor Adam said that and I was

1320
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:16,559
like yeah of your choice pick the brand

1321
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:18,440
yeah and then he's like what strains you

1322
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:20,119
got and I was and I heard they had this

1323
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:22,760
Z competition I was like oh actually I

1324
00:48:20,119 --> 00:48:25,920
got some Z mix light Z and they're like

1325
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:29,240
oh well Bey put $110,000 on his mix

1326
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:32,400
light or his indoor Z yeah up against

1327
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:34,318
anybody I was like done let's go we want

1328
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,920
to prove that mixl light is just as good

1329
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:39,159
if not better than you know weed is weed

1330
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:42,000
is weed fire weed is fire weed I've had

1331
00:48:39,159 --> 00:48:44,199
outdoor that's mad flavor smokes amazing

1332
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,760
totally I've growing it mixl light I

1333
00:48:44,199 --> 00:48:49,000
stand on pretty heavy I feel like it's

1334
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:51,599
it's the most challenging weed there is

1335
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,960
where people think that it's like depths

1336
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:55,000
you know but it's I think it's the best

1337
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:57,280
of both worlds indoor plus is what we're

1338
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,159
kind of talking about because it we have

1339
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:03,079
HPS lights right we have environmental

1340
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:04,759
controls we're we have benches drippers

1341
00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:07,318
we have everything that indoor facility

1342
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:10,440
has that I grow indoor too everything

1343
00:49:07,318 --> 00:49:11,960
that my indoor facility has but I also

1344
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:13,679
got the option of the Sun so I got

1345
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:16,199
another spectrum that you can't you

1346
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:18,358
can't mimic yeah right so and sun does

1347
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:20,000
something special so let's go you know

1348
00:49:18,358 --> 00:49:22,838
what I mean [ __ ]

1349
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:25,679
that I I stand on a lot of mix light

1350
00:49:22,838 --> 00:49:28,239
honestly some batches I would choose

1351
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:29,759
over indoor any day yeah I'm a huge fan

1352
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:32,639
and I feel like it's the best of both

1353
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:34,680
worlds in it's also the most economical

1354
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:36,598
and best as far as like if you want to

1355
00:49:34,679 --> 00:49:38,480
indoor product it's better for the Earth

1356
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:39,798
we wasting yeah there's a lot of pluses

1357
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:42,440
there but we don't even need to talk

1358
00:49:39,798 --> 00:49:45,639
about that in a competition like this no

1359
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:47,519
not at all for sure but now everyone's

1360
00:49:45,639 --> 00:49:49,920
you know oh you're putting mixl light in

1361
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:52,000
I could beat that all day 10,000 10,000

1362
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,200
10,000 they just messed me it's at

1363
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,639
60,000 I love it

1364
00:49:54,199 --> 00:50:01,000
yeah that's amazing Dave actually won

1365
00:49:57,639 --> 00:50:03,199
$60,000 in the proper dinks contest now

1366
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,960
back to this episode with Z I feel like

1367
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:06,039
Z is one of those ones where the turps

1368
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:09,358
really you know it's like we were

1369
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:11,838
talking about Coco versus soil Z

1370
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:13,880
especially the soil brings out something

1371
00:50:11,838 --> 00:50:15,798
special you know feel like Z you can you

1372
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:17,240
can get these different expressions and

1373
00:50:15,798 --> 00:50:20,119
it's very noticeable some of the

1374
00:50:17,239 --> 00:50:23,118
genetics out there you don't see as much

1375
00:50:20,119 --> 00:50:24,760
uh with the the different uh substrates

1376
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:26,920
and the different uh lights and stuff

1377
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:30,079
like that Z is very noticeable with each

1378
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:32,960
one yeah I was wondering because Z was

1379
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:35,680
probably breed outside yeah in soil

1380
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,798
right under the sun mhm right and I was

1381
00:50:35,679 --> 00:50:40,159
thinking about that when you just said

1382
00:50:36,798 --> 00:50:43,639
the seed thing and I've always thought

1383
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:46,159
that there's specific like things that

1384
00:50:43,639 --> 00:50:48,480
need to happen with breeding too like if

1385
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:50,279
you're breeding under LEDs and you're

1386
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:52,599
pheno hunting under LEDs and you're

1387
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:55,599
choosing things under these because when

1388
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:57,559
I feno hunt in my Greenhouse at now I

1389
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:59,359
can kind of find tune and figure out

1390
00:50:57,559 --> 00:51:01,559
what I think will do well indoor but it

1391
00:50:59,358 --> 00:51:04,358
always isn't the truth right and when I

1392
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:07,119
feno hunt indoor it's so controlled that

1393
00:51:04,358 --> 00:51:09,960
everything's [ __ ] good yeah right and

1394
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:12,599
it doesn't have too much variable and

1395
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:14,039
less like hermaphrodites happen a lot of

1396
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:15,798
lot of things happen when you have like

1397
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:17,798
that controlled of an environment I love

1398
00:51:15,798 --> 00:51:20,679
feno hunting in a greenhouse yeah

1399
00:51:17,798 --> 00:51:22,960
because of tomorrow it's freezing balls

1400
00:51:20,679 --> 00:51:24,639
next day it's raining there's no sun

1401
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:27,838
it's cloudy you're stress testing at the

1402
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:30,199
same time all day yeah so

1403
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:31,639
I wonder with breeding though because

1404
00:51:30,199 --> 00:51:34,078
you know I've always bred in like a

1405
00:51:31,639 --> 00:51:36,558
[ __ ] shed or outside or in a

1406
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:38,720
greenhous like a shitty Greenhouse right

1407
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:40,640
right but I wonder with breeding if

1408
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:41,879
there's going to be some adaptations

1409
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:45,279
right there's going to be some things

1410
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:47,798
that it's a baby it's it's used to this

1411
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:49,798
right and it's not always going to work

1412
00:51:47,798 --> 00:51:52,599
in that way and when you feno hunt it

1413
00:51:49,798 --> 00:51:55,079
this way I know for a fact for sure

1414
00:51:52,599 --> 00:51:56,640
hunting for sure yeah and I think you

1415
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:58,720
know it's like if we're doing stuff so

1416
00:51:56,639 --> 00:52:00,199
don't even use that seed start I get rid

1417
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:02,318
of the seed start and I take a clone and

1418
00:52:00,199 --> 00:52:03,679
weo hunt starting with the Clone right

1419
00:52:02,318 --> 00:52:05,480
so I don't even I don't want to know

1420
00:52:03,679 --> 00:52:06,719
what that seed start expression looks

1421
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:08,798
like if I can't have it it's not even

1422
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:10,159
the same strain uhuh you you clone it

1423
00:52:08,798 --> 00:52:11,440
and we're we're looking for stuff to

1424
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:13,358
license we're looking stuff that we're

1425
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:15,960
going to take clones off of I want to

1426
00:52:13,358 --> 00:52:17,920
know what that looks like but now if I'm

1427
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:19,639
gonna sell the seeds for outdoor

1428
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:21,119
production like flower production I want

1429
00:52:19,639 --> 00:52:23,078
it grown Outdoors where we're feno

1430
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,880
hunting Outdoors where we can go this

1431
00:52:23,079 --> 00:52:27,079
one's this good for this reason or this

1432
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:29,079
one because it's totally different ideal

1433
00:52:27,079 --> 00:52:31,839
of course yeah that's ideal so you're so

1434
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:34,280
when you pheno hunt you pop your seed

1435
00:52:31,838 --> 00:52:36,719
germinate your seed you germinate it in

1436
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:38,960
a substrate or you do it in a towel or

1437
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:40,679
put it in water what's your process I'm

1438
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,480
curious because you got a lot of seeds I

1439
00:52:40,679 --> 00:52:43,719
want to know oh yeah I mean I think it's

1440
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,719
different depending on what we're doing

1441
00:52:43,719 --> 00:52:47,239
but typically with pheno hunting um if

1442
00:52:45,719 --> 00:52:48,838
they're from somebody else I'm going to

1443
00:52:47,239 --> 00:52:51,719
take hydrogen peroxide and I'm going to

1444
00:52:48,838 --> 00:52:54,119
do a six to1 ratio with water to

1445
00:52:51,719 --> 00:52:55,318
hydrogen peroxide and then I'm going to

1446
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:57,760
take that and I'm going to soak it in

1447
00:52:55,318 --> 00:53:00,000
there typically overnight

1448
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:01,880
peroxide it sterilizes the seed so I

1449
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,039
think that it can kill a lot of bad

1450
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:05,160
stuff yeah yeah but we basically take

1451
00:53:04,039 --> 00:53:06,798
that and it gives it a little bit of

1452
00:53:05,159 --> 00:53:08,920
Head Start you're working now with a

1453
00:53:06,798 --> 00:53:13,280
clean environment y right and so we'll

1454
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:15,480
go into uh rapid Rooter root Riot so you

1455
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,920
like it in a clone plug right away I do

1456
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:19,079
like it in the plugs I feel like it

1457
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:21,280
works the best when you go into a plug

1458
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:22,920
you can control it better and then once

1459
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,200
we have a roote shooting at the bottom

1460
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:27,559
then it goes right into wherever we're

1461
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:29,719
going got it yeah so and it's pretty and

1462
00:53:27,559 --> 00:53:33,760
then you take one clone from you build

1463
00:53:29,719 --> 00:53:35,358
the mom up for what 20 days or 30 days

1464
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:37,359
maybe even exactly depending on the

1465
00:53:35,358 --> 00:53:38,759
cultivar some go faster some are super

1466
00:53:37,358 --> 00:53:40,639
vigorous and we could take them in two

1467
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:42,880
weeks you know but typically it's you

1468
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:45,279
take the top though and then you take

1469
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:47,680
that top you plug that top you root that

1470
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,920
top then you feno hunt with that top and

1471
00:53:47,679 --> 00:53:50,719
a lot of times we'll go till we can get

1472
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:52,838
two clones we won't just take the top

1473
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:54,639
yeah so you might go we might go a month

1474
00:53:52,838 --> 00:53:57,838
we might go five weeks depending I like

1475
00:53:54,639 --> 00:54:00,440
to get to three yeah found that in green

1476
00:53:57,838 --> 00:54:03,039
houses was stabilizing for some weird

1477
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:06,240
reason maybe you can explain why MH

1478
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:07,838
first cut well seed you're going to have

1479
00:54:06,239 --> 00:54:09,519
way more hermaphrodites than normal it's

1480
00:54:07,838 --> 00:54:12,078
going to be a different plant it's it's

1481
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:13,519
a beast the weed is different it smokes

1482
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:14,839
different smells different everything's

1483
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:16,639
different about it it's pointless to

1484
00:54:14,838 --> 00:54:18,880
feno hunt with the seed in my opinion

1485
00:54:16,639 --> 00:54:23,639
yeah the the first

1486
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:26,200
cut I find that I get a little bit more

1487
00:54:23,639 --> 00:54:29,639
not stable things happening also from

1488
00:54:26,199 --> 00:54:31,118
that top right right second cut might be

1489
00:54:29,639 --> 00:54:32,920
the same as the third cut but I just

1490
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:35,640
have a process of liking to have the

1491
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:38,200
third cut be the feno hunt yeah well and

1492
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:39,519
we do cut from the third for we fenal

1493
00:54:38,199 --> 00:54:41,399
hunt that one as well but usually from

1494
00:54:39,519 --> 00:54:42,920
the second we start there for the well

1495
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:45,240
so from the first cut we can start there

1496
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:47,119
and then from the second and third uh

1497
00:54:45,239 --> 00:54:49,159
but you will get sexual maturity so the

1498
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:52,760
plant is going to change over time yes

1499
00:54:49,159 --> 00:54:55,199
and you will get more uh Expressions

1500
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:57,799
hermaphrodites stuff like that uh pheno

1501
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:59,558
you know gets more stable kind of over

1502
00:54:57,798 --> 00:55:01,920
time or it doesn't if it's going to be

1503
00:54:59,559 --> 00:55:03,440
that what it is you'll find out and it's

1504
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,440
going to it's going to be that solid

1505
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,440
expression then you get for a longer

1506
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:08,480
amount of time what you're going to get

1507
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:09,960
Forever After that's how I feel is what

1508
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:12,519
it normally is is what you're going to

1509
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:14,400
get forever off of that third third

1510
00:55:12,519 --> 00:55:16,679
sometimes third generation yeah the

1511
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:19,119
third and fourth clonal generation is

1512
00:55:16,679 --> 00:55:21,919
where you it stabilizes I've randomly

1513
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:23,358
had things like Herm for since they

1514
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,200
probably had they were in the spring

1515
00:55:23,358 --> 00:55:27,318
they probably had a nice environment and

1516
00:55:25,199 --> 00:55:29,118
then winter came came around and they

1517
00:55:27,318 --> 00:55:31,679
hered out of nowhere you know something

1518
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:33,880
that was still kind of early range but

1519
00:55:31,679 --> 00:55:35,798
normally like if it's stable it's stable

1520
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:38,798
for the most part right yeah the one

1521
00:55:35,798 --> 00:55:41,318
exception for pheno hunting from seed

1522
00:55:38,798 --> 00:55:43,119
would be if you are selling seeds to be

1523
00:55:41,318 --> 00:55:45,838
grown out in a field so if I'm going to

1524
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:48,440
sell 100,000 seeds to somebody I'm going

1525
00:55:45,838 --> 00:55:50,279
to want to know what a hundred of those

1526
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:52,519
seeds or a thousand of those seeds do

1527
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:54,519
when we put them outside uh and so we

1528
00:55:52,519 --> 00:55:56,400
will put them outside and grow them out

1529
00:55:54,519 --> 00:55:58,119
test them that way I feel like if you

1530
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,880
are going to sell your seeds in bulk for

1531
00:55:58,119 --> 00:56:03,000
someone in Morocco someone in Germany or

1532
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,400
wherever wherever it is and you're going

1533
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,119
to sell them and they're doing outdoor

1534
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:08,280
field production you really want to know

1535
00:56:06,119 --> 00:56:10,280
what that does outdoor in the field yeah

1536
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:11,920
so that's the not many people have those

1537
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:13,920
options and I think you're kind of ahead

1538
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:17,240
of the game so it's like that's probably

1539
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:18,838
like you're talking some some scientific

1540
00:56:17,239 --> 00:56:21,798
algebra right now to some people that

1541
00:56:18,838 --> 00:56:23,119
are doing but that's the right way to

1542
00:56:21,798 --> 00:56:25,119
you that's what they do in a too you

1543
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:26,559
know I mean I think uh but but for what

1544
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:28,200
we're doing where we want to license

1545
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:29,798
aeno or we want to sell clones of

1546
00:56:28,199 --> 00:56:32,399
something it's obviously that's the best

1547
00:56:29,798 --> 00:56:34,079
way to do it yeah yeah yeah for sure

1548
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,680
yeah but it's hard to have that option I

1549
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:37,720
feel like I'm one of the only people

1550
00:56:35,679 --> 00:56:39,358
that has an indoor an outdoor and a mix

1551
00:56:37,719 --> 00:56:40,879
light right well and so we work with

1552
00:56:39,358 --> 00:56:43,279
cultivation Partners all over right so

1553
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:45,400
we work with people in multiple States I

1554
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:46,559
have guys that are just itching to test

1555
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,358
something new because we always have

1556
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:50,280
weird stuff or fun stuff or different

1557
00:56:48,358 --> 00:56:52,038
stff people beg to do that it's awesome

1558
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:53,760
you put it put it in the closet too it's

1559
00:56:52,039 --> 00:56:55,359
like cool to give it to those people and

1560
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:57,480
they find stuff and we have a ton of

1561
00:56:55,358 --> 00:56:59,318
people to love hpe it up yeah but yeah

1562
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:00,838
that third and fourth clonal generation

1563
00:56:59,318 --> 00:57:02,279
is really where it's at and so we'll

1564
00:57:00,838 --> 00:57:04,199
grow it out and I like growing things

1565
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:05,920
out at least three times before we run

1566
00:57:04,199 --> 00:57:08,118
with anything because we've seen stuff

1567
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:10,400
that it's amazing and then the next time

1568
00:57:08,119 --> 00:57:12,400
it's [ __ ] and then it's amazing again

1569
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:14,480
and we've also seen the opposite where

1570
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,599
it's not that great but it's it's still

1571
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:18,079
it might not be the best of the best but

1572
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:19,720
we grow it the second time and now it's

1573
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:21,480
the best yeah and then we grow it again

1574
00:57:19,719 --> 00:57:23,480
and oh wow it's the best again even just

1575
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:26,199
on its own it kind of just like picks

1576
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:28,159
that to get to production it takes three

1577
00:57:26,199 --> 00:57:31,038
kind of rounds anyway so like we always

1578
00:57:28,159 --> 00:57:32,719
do the test the second test is like you

1579
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:35,160
might start with three plants then you

1580
00:57:32,719 --> 00:57:37,399
get up to 10 plants then you before you

1581
00:57:35,159 --> 00:57:39,159
get to 100 plus plants exactly you don't

1582
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:41,519
want to go too big too quickly with

1583
00:57:39,159 --> 00:57:43,440
stuff and and the other thing is is what

1584
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:46,559
I like sometimes isn't what everybody

1585
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:47,679
likes um I get excited about some weird

1586
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:49,240
stuff and you don't want to put that

1587
00:57:47,679 --> 00:57:51,279
into production you got to see what kind

1588
00:57:49,239 --> 00:57:52,479
of response you get from people too yeah

1589
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,079
because you know I'm jumping up and down

1590
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:57,639
about this new thing because we've never

1591

had this before and it's like this crazy

1592
00:57:57,639 --> 00:58:02,279
floral thing that I think is going to be

1593
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:04,000
great but then you give it out to guys

1594

1600
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:16,798

1603
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:24,240
maybe if it is it I want one bag yeah

1604
00:58:21,559 --> 00:58:25,760

1605
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:27,558
about what he likes and he knows what he

1606
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:29,400
likes very black and white like I like

1607
00:58:27,559 --> 00:58:30,798
this I don't like that that's the circle

1608
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:33,680
I'm talking about those type of guys

1609
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:35,480
dictate what is good and what isn't for

1610
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:37,759
sure you know and it's you have to have

1611
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:39,400
them around or you're just blessed to

1612
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:41,280
have them around like thank God they're

1613
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:43,280
around you know what I mean give them as

1614
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:45,319
much free weed as you possibly can

1615
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:47,079
exactly yeah my guy from hush same thing

1616
00:58:45,318 --> 00:58:50,079
he has like this he's the pickiest

1617
00:58:47,079 --> 00:58:51,960
person I know and you know he works with

1618
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:55,359
Beezy and those guys too it's all part

1619
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:57,079
of the same circle of of connoisseurs

1620
00:58:55,358 --> 00:58:59,440
yeah you know and these guys are so

1621
00:58:57,079 --> 00:59:00,880
picky you know on the way it burns and

1622
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,280
the way and it's like yeah the stuff

1623
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,599
looks good and all these things but when

1624
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:05,359
you roll it in a joint it just doesn't

1625
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:08,960
burn quite right yeah and it's like to

1626
00:59:05,358 --> 00:59:10,719
me it's some super gr a triple AA a plus

1627
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:12,240
I love it but it's like for the streets

1628
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:13,759
maybe it's not what the streets want

1629
00:59:12,239 --> 00:59:15,798
yeah everybody's different that's the

1630
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:17,640
thing is everybody's different and like

1631
00:59:15,798 --> 00:59:20,079
they all have different pallets and when

1632
00:59:17,639 --> 00:59:22,400
you get to that 1% that most extreme

1633
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:24,079
palette sometimes they they [ __ ] it up

1634
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,119
for everybody you know I mean like some

1635
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:27,920
[ __ ] is actually really good and it's

1636
00:59:26,119 --> 00:59:30,559
amazing for the market and it's has like

1637
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:32,200
the most medicinal Factor yeah and we

1638
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:35,119
think about that a lot too cuz we're in

1639
00:59:32,199 --> 00:59:36,558
the medical Market again started in the

1640
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:39,160
medical Market in California in the

1641
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:41,680
medical Market in in Florida now in the

1642
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:43,920
medical Market in Pennsylvania like it's

1643
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:46,719
the same Market as before and people

1644
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:48,559
like treat the weed like it's more like

1645
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:50,519
medicine which I like you know there's

1646
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:52,559
reasons for certain strains that are

1647
00:59:50,519 --> 00:59:54,559
extra powerful and they take away pain

1648
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:56,720
and we start talking about the effect

1649
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:58,200
more I mean I think even in it's still

1650
00:59:56,719 --> 00:59:59,919
medicine but we're calling it wreck or

1651
00:59:58,199 --> 01:00:03,239
whatever like whether you like it or not

1652
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:05,039
it's testing medicine right so 100% so

1653
01:00:03,239 --> 01:00:06,639
and I I love that about it but I feel

1654
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:08,640
like the conversation needs to come back

1655
01:00:06,639 --> 01:00:10,159
to like how does it make you feel you

1656
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:11,199
know it's like how how does it taste

1657
01:00:10,159 --> 01:00:12,279
yeah that's great but how does it make

1658
01:00:11,199 --> 01:00:13,558
you feel at the end of the day is it

1659
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:15,200
something you want to keep smoking all

1660
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:16,400
day long and you want to wake up

1661
01:00:15,199 --> 01:00:18,199
tomorrow and keep smoking that because

1662
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:20,318
then you're on to something for sure

1663
01:00:18,199 --> 01:00:22,239
yeah that's what Z has done that for a

1664
01:00:20,318 --> 01:00:24,358
lot of people I feel like Z still does

1665
01:00:22,239 --> 01:00:26,199
that for especially like business people

1666
01:00:24,358 --> 01:00:29,318
they're it's like something that I don't

1667
01:00:26,199 --> 01:00:30,519
know it's like a upper echelon love Z

1668
01:00:29,318 --> 01:00:32,239
and it isn't I think that they would

1669
01:00:30,519 --> 01:00:35,318
like it anyway it's just it's the

1670
01:00:32,239 --> 01:00:37,679
feeling of Z it isn't NE yeah it tastes

1671
01:00:35,318 --> 01:00:39,679
great but the feeling you get from it

1672
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:41,960
yeah is the best and you like you still

1673
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:44,118
be very creative and it doesn't like

1674
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:45,519
knock you out either which is a plus

1675
01:00:44,119 --> 01:00:48,000
when you're trying to run like hundreds

1676
01:00:45,519 --> 01:00:50,960
of employees and doing other things you

1677
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:54,358
can't just smoke hella OG you know my

1678
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:56,440
lawyer used to my lawyer my lawyer yeah

1679
01:00:54,358 --> 01:00:59,159
those guys are whack jobs yeah guy used

1680
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:00,358
to smoke only OG yeah and that's all he

1681
01:00:59,159 --> 01:01:01,519
would smoke and he would smoke it all

1682
01:01:00,358 --> 01:01:02,639
day a lot of people are different

1683
01:01:01,519 --> 01:01:04,480
there's some people that are like the

1684
01:01:02,639 --> 01:01:06,318
most successful ever and their brain is

1685
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:10,119
like two wired and they need something

1686
01:01:06,318 --> 01:01:12,358
to crack them down yeah just weed is

1687
01:01:10,119 --> 01:01:14,119
weird and it works with everybody

1688
01:01:12,358 --> 01:01:15,239
different that's the thing it's so funny

1689
01:01:14,119 --> 01:01:17,920
because yeah the effect can be

1690
01:01:15,239 --> 01:01:19,838
subjective to the individual mhm always

1691
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:22,159
it is every time yeah let me smell that

1692
01:01:19,838 --> 01:01:24,798
Z you have right there this is that's

1693
01:01:22,159 --> 01:01:27,118
the soil grown Z huh this is the dirty Z

1694
01:01:24,798 --> 01:01:28,679
I think that'll win you harvested really

1695
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:31,200
let's put this in right now we need it

1696
01:01:28,679 --> 01:01:31,199
let let's make it

1697
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:37,720
70 oh yeah how big of a sample do I need

1698
01:01:35,318 --> 01:01:38,880
because I really think e an eighth

1699
01:01:37,719 --> 01:01:40,439
that's it yeah you call them right now

1700
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:43,280
you got

1701
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:46,039
10K because I need I need another I need

1702
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:47,440
another 10K I bet you do I don't know if

1703
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:49,720
you want to I we can smoke this right

1704
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:51,920
now yeah for sure no this is this is

1705
01:01:49,719 --> 01:01:54,358
smells amazing yeah and this is the old

1706
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:56,159
batch is okay I was wondering yeah when

1707
01:01:54,358 --> 01:01:58,400
was it Harvest is yeah so this is from

1708
01:01:56,159 --> 01:01:59,920
November right so it's a couple months

1709
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,680
it's still good Skittles is one of those

1710
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:05,278
ones but the funny thing with Skittles

1711
01:02:01,679 --> 01:02:06,879
is when it's done and it's dried it is

1712
01:02:05,278 --> 01:02:09,000
the best right away it's one of those

1713
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:10,599
ones there's like I like some people

1714
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,278
like oh two weeks you need two weeks on

1715
01:02:10,599 --> 01:02:13,920
it maybe for the smoke or whatever you

1716
01:02:12,278 --> 01:02:16,079
want to say but I think that it's the

1717
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:18,278
loudest you open a bag of Skittles

1718
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:20,960
that's like just freshly trimmed and

1719
01:02:18,278 --> 01:02:22,639
dried perfectly it pops like nothing

1720
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:24,480
else yeah yeah you know it hits you with

1721
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:27,598
that candy yeah for sure especially a

1722
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:30,039
pound like a pound bag a turkey bag yeah

1723
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:31,960
TPL loock bag and it just punches you in

1724
01:02:30,039 --> 01:02:33,240
the face and I love that about flow and

1725
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:34,880
you don't get that with a lot of the

1726
01:02:33,239 --> 01:02:36,759
stuff now where where it hits you in the

1727
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:38,358
face like where like literally it sticks

1728
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:40,680
to your face that's that's the main

1729
01:02:38,358 --> 01:02:41,880
thing we hunt for is is that but yeah

1730
01:02:40,679 --> 01:02:44,038
you're right and there's a lot of

1731
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:47,039
strains that people like want really bad

1732
01:02:44,039 --> 01:02:49,119
that doesn't do that which kind of sucks

1733
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:53,160
you know I don't know if you know Mark

Christian Christian I love Christian too

1748
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:23,519
he's a good mutual friend of both of

1749
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:26,278
ours you know he's amazing I've known

1750
01:03:23,519 --> 01:03:29,679
him for quite a while and just a solid

1751
01:03:26,278 --> 01:03:32,039
dude oh yeah um but yeah my buddy used

1752
01:03:29,679 --> 01:03:34,038
to he had kickass Farms was his brand

1753
01:03:32,039 --> 01:03:35,640
but he used to do stock splitting where

1754
01:03:34,039 --> 01:03:37,359
You' grow the plant up and You' split

1755
01:03:35,639 --> 01:03:39,759
the stock with a buck knife we've done

1756
01:03:37,358 --> 01:03:41,759
that yeah you can only do that in like

1757
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:43,119
some weird kind of super cropping yeah

1758
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,640
dude it basically you don't need to top

1759
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:46,599
your basically it does the it

1760
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:48,719
distributes the hormones evenly across

1761
01:03:46,599 --> 01:03:50,278
the plant and you get all these extra BR

1762
01:03:48,719 --> 01:03:52,879
science though that's what I'm still I

1763
01:03:50,278 --> 01:03:54,559
still don't know I think it's a real

1764
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:56,278
thing I mean I saw his plants were huge

1765
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:58,119
too he'd have these big 10 Pounders with

1766
01:03:56,278 --> 01:03:59,838
all the small buds rather than one big

1767
01:03:58,119 --> 01:04:02,278
and they were like big trees yeah that

1768
01:03:59,838 --> 01:04:05,639
was the best for outdoor he used to also

1769
01:04:02,278 --> 01:04:07,519
water his plants from the top in the in

1770
01:04:05,639 --> 01:04:09,440
the a no in the morning he'd water them

1771
01:04:07,519 --> 01:04:10,480
from the top in the bottom in the

1772
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:12,838
afternoon he'd water them from the

1773
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:14,358
bottom to cool the canopy got it and he

1774
01:04:12,838 --> 01:04:16,400
was doing that all the way into flower

1775
01:04:14,358 --> 01:04:18,480
and I I'm like shaking my head like what

1776
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:22,358
is this guy doing he's got he's

1777
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:24,639
reversing the magnetism of the water and

1778
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:27,119
you know it it was pretty wild and he

1779
01:04:24,639 --> 01:04:28,519
grew some of the best flow I've SE

1780
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:30,680
Grass Valley and ESP special because

1781
01:04:28,519 --> 01:04:33,000
Grass Valley is so dry if you tried to

1782
01:04:30,679 --> 01:04:35,879
do that in Humble or in Mendo on the

1783
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:38,400
coast you would be toast you would have

1784
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:41,318
the worst rot yeah for sure with all

1785
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:42,798
your breeding and stuff you're pretty

1786
01:04:41,318 --> 01:04:47,079
heavy on

1787
01:04:42,798 --> 01:04:50,559
like Vigor and you know mold resistance

1788
01:04:47,079 --> 01:04:54,039
and all those things even a major factor

1789
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:56,798
yet for for sure I think commercial

1790
01:04:54,039 --> 01:04:58,680
viability is extremely important

1791
01:04:56,798 --> 01:05:00,278
uh although it's not the only thing

1792
01:04:58,679 --> 01:05:02,199
first I go over the other things then

1793
01:05:00,278 --> 01:05:03,440
it's like okay well I have a lot of

1794
01:05:02,199 --> 01:05:05,399
people that are like I need something

1795
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:07,440
that's commercial it has to yield for

1796
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:09,119
one thing these guys and I have some of

1797
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,880
my best stuff doesn't yield right some

1798
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:13,559
my favorite things don't yield yeah this

1799
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:15,480
[ __ ] dude this this thing although my

1800
01:05:13,559 --> 01:05:18,319
friend gets over three light with

1801
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:20,559
Skittles Savage so but he also does set

1802
01:05:18,318 --> 01:05:23,719
up dude the secret is seven we the [ __ ]

1803
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:25,160
out of seven we he does a preeg in a veg

1804
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:27,480
we're about to crack the code we're on

1805
01:05:25,159 --> 01:05:30,118
to something I think yeah we're working

1806
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:31,559
on cleaning it somehow I don't know

1807
01:05:30,119 --> 01:05:34,559
we're just playing around with whatever

1808
01:05:31,559 --> 01:05:36,278
Weird Science we can do yep but uh I

1809
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:39,039
know some people that have that are

1810
01:05:36,278 --> 01:05:41,679
doing pretty well with it but I don't

1811
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:44,119
know if it changes like anything in the

1812
01:05:41,679 --> 01:05:46,480
quality that's my worry but we're we're

1813
01:05:44,119 --> 01:05:48,200
going to over veg it now yeah over

1814
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:50,599
vegging topping it and then keeping it

1815
01:05:48,199 --> 01:05:53,038
even I think keeping the canopy nice and

1816
01:05:50,599 --> 01:05:54,599
even yeah yeah we'll see I don't know

1817
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:55,960
patience and I think every environment

1818
01:05:54,599 --> 01:05:58,880
is a little bit different where is this

1819
01:05:55,960 --> 01:06:02,440
Z grown this is some special stuff

1820
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:04,880
growing in the city SF can big sh yeah

1821
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:06,599
for sure yeah I know they kill it so

1822
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:08,318
we've been working

1823
01:06:06,599 --> 01:06:12,838
on

1824
01:06:08,318 --> 01:06:15,038
collaborations and uh I love organic

1825
01:06:12,838 --> 01:06:16,679
tips that's my my choice I don't like

1826
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:19,480
the glass tips personally glass tips are

1827
01:06:16,679 --> 01:06:21,598
okay but I I prefer the the bamboo yeah

1828
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:25,000
I mean these guys are the homies we we

1829
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:26,680
uh we do these joints in uh Florida too

1830
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:29,440
but yeah paper wise what do you prefer

1831
01:06:26,679 --> 01:06:32,440
paper wise elements are my favorite I

1832
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:34,318
have some OCB XLS right now I mean

1833
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:37,039
they're they're cleaner I think they

1834
01:06:34,318 --> 01:06:39,558
look like like when you roll them they

1835
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:41,319
look nice and super tidy elements don't

1836
01:06:39,559 --> 01:06:42,720
stick that well it's one problem that I

1837
01:06:41,318 --> 01:06:45,880
have with them but I feel like they burn

1838
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:48,598
the best in elements I do too I like the

1839
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:50,480
you know if you you know we Tri we Tri

1840
01:06:48,599 --> 01:06:53,519
all the different papers yeah and I feel

1841
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:56,159
like elements burned the best they do um

1842
01:06:53,519 --> 01:06:58,400
I didn't have OCB in the trial really uh

1843
01:06:56,159 --> 01:07:01,118
that was a year and a half ago these are

1844
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:02,920
probably the the expert double XXL this

1845
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:04,880
is probably the one that goes up to them

1846
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:06,480
the best yeah I know proper doinks and

1847
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:10,358
them just did like some weird tests with

1848
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:12,159
it and had some problems with them but U

1849
01:07:10,358 --> 01:07:14,400
I don't know they're they're good most

1850
01:07:12,159 --> 01:07:16,399
of the rollers use those or elements

1851
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:17,400
yeah you know we got Mike and Main I

1852
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:20,639

the squad they're a professional rollers

1854
01:07:20,639 --> 01:07:25,798
they crush it but they mainly use those

1855
01:07:22,798 --> 01:07:27,960
ocbs yeah we work with hustle Hawaii

1856

yeah we stand on I'm born and raised so

1864
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:54,119
nice Sacramento is uh is home but it's

1865
01:07:49,639 --> 01:07:57,879
pretty cool that it's become like super

1866
01:07:54,119 --> 01:08:01,720
[ __ ] famous for fire weed and dope

1867
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:03,200
rollers and you know a lot of culture I

1868
01:08:01,719 --> 01:08:04,959
mean people got a lot of [ __ ] from the

1869
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:07,038
police back back in the day like they

1870
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:09,278
were no joke in Sacramento they were way

1871
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:13,359
harder on people than everywhere else I

1872
01:08:09,278 --> 01:08:16,279
agree for sure they're electric not like

1873
01:08:13,358 --> 01:08:18,278
not like the East Coast those in

1874
01:08:16,279 --> 01:08:19,839
California it was pretty [ __ ] up uh

1875
01:08:18,279 --> 01:08:22,040
for sure SoCal you could right around

1876
01:08:19,838 --> 01:08:24,238
1,000 PBS would get pulled over and get

1877
01:08:22,039 --> 01:08:26,519
a ticket yeah when they were [ __ ]

1878
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:28,678
taking people to prison NorCal was super

1879
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:30,759
weird it made no sense over there

1880
01:08:28,679 --> 01:08:33,399
whoever the power company is they were

1881
01:08:30,759 --> 01:08:36,158
basically working with law enforcement

1882
01:08:33,399 --> 01:08:38,559
people I know yeah tell me about rated

1883
01:08:36,158 --> 01:08:41,079
but for that same reason yeah and it's

1884
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:42,759
like I mean we obviously PG Oakland it's

1885
01:08:41,079 --> 01:08:44,198
like they don't they don't give a [ __ ]

1886
01:08:42,759 --> 01:08:46,158
they don't give a [ __ ] want your money

1887
01:08:44,198 --> 01:08:49,358
hell yeah pay the bill as long as you

1888
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:51,838
don't let it lapse like once or twice

1889
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:55,640
then then you're hot then you're hot

1890
01:08:51,838 --> 01:08:58,439
yeah but yeah NorCal is different

1891
01:08:55,640 --> 01:09:00,719
I'm glad you noticed that because uh I

1892
01:08:58,439 --> 01:09:03,439
felt like you can get away with whatever

1893
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:04,960
in SoCal and La for a while oh dude the

1894
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:07,358
warehouses people that's where the real

1895
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:09,880
Warehouse CRA right yeah thousands of

1896
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:11,679
Lights yeah literally thousand lighters

1897
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:14,039
you know people were way before anywhere

1898
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:15,759
else in the world jungle boys jungle

1899
01:09:14,039 --> 01:09:17,039
boys and they were doing it you know

1900
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:19,319
scale

1901
01:09:17,039 --> 01:09:22,359
quality really kind of pushing pushing

1902
01:09:19,319 --> 01:09:25,039
it Forward setting the ground for it

1903
01:09:22,359 --> 01:09:26,520
yeah showing it you they had a million

1904
01:09:25,039 --> 01:09:28,000

1912
01:09:48,119 --> 01:09:52,719
I'm like last last second yeah it's all

1913
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:55,880
GMP

1914
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:58,840
certification so I feel like from what I

1915
01:09:55,880 --> 01:10:00,800
understand yeah is everything if you

1916
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:03,760
want to get producted like

1917
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:06,320
Germany and you know the EU for the most

1918
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:08,880
part it has to go through Portugal yeah

1919
01:10:06,319 --> 01:10:10,319
so I'm trying to figure out uh P who

1920
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:13,279
needs help in Portugal because that's

1921
01:10:10,319 --> 01:10:17,279
where I'd like to you know make my way

1922
01:10:13,279 --> 01:10:18,639
out there from uh from Portugal so I'm

1923
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:21,359
going there in the in the morning

1924
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:25,159
actually nice yeah it's a good time to

1925
01:10:21,359 --> 01:10:26,639
go I think Portugal's hot right now I

1926
01:10:25,158 --> 01:10:28,519
think I think a lot of people paved the

1927
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:30,920
way so that Portugal could happen I

1928
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:32,760
think Greenhouse was in Portugal I think

1929
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:34,039
they're still in Portugal but yeah you

1930
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:35,840
probably have your finger on it more

1931
01:10:34,039 --> 01:10:37,760
than me because I feel like with the

1932
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:39,920
seeds and you were doing stuff with a

1933
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:42,520
lot of those guys that are out there in

1934
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:44,960
Europe and oh yeah so like we have a

1935
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:46,520
name in Europe and people have somehow

1936
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:49,039
found a way to get our products in

1937
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:51,560

1939
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:54,280

01:11:35,039 --> 01:11:38,800
yeah it's you got to go to Barcelona you

1959
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:41,280
gotta Amsterdam Barcelona those are the

1960
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:43,400
places to go for sure if if you go

1961
01:11:41,279 --> 01:11:46,439
before after at least one of them yeah I

1962
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:48,799
hear it's a must yeah Amsterdam's still

1963
01:11:46,439 --> 01:11:50,519
experience oh yeah it's all getting shut

1964
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:52,760
down in Amsterdam for the most part or

1965
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:54,320
no I wouldn't say it's getting shut down

1966
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:55,920
I'd say it's not what it used to be same

1967
01:11:54,319 --> 01:11:57,559
thing with Barcelona Barcelona used to

1968
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:59,279
be just popping like crazy you could go

1969
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:02,400
to a restaurant and roll a joint up and

1970
01:11:59,279 --> 01:12:03,759
nobody would blink twice yeah now you

1971
01:12:02,399 --> 01:12:05,839
can't really do that you can't be

1972
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:07,079
smelling like weed everywhere you know

1973
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:09,560
they'll they'll mess with you a little

1974
01:12:07,079 --> 01:12:12,840
bit more really uh compared to 10 years

1975
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:14,480
ago but they do have social clubs there

1976
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:16,079
they do you know both places you know

1977
01:12:14,479 --> 01:12:17,678
they have coffee shops in Amsterdam they

1978
01:12:16,079 --> 01:12:20,238
have amazing coffee shops there they

1979
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:22,239
have amazing Social Clubs in Barcelona

1980
01:12:20,238 --> 01:12:23,879
oh yeah uh and people are really

1981
01:12:22,238 --> 01:12:25,439
passionate about cannabis they have good

1982
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:27,880
you can find good flour in both places

1983
01:12:25,439 --> 01:12:29,359
if you know where to go so and there's

1984
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:32,199
all kinds of great

1985
01:12:29,359 --> 01:12:33,599

months old we're smoking the old stuff

1988
01:12:35,439 --> 01:12:40,039
so you can get an idea on what it would

1989
01:12:37,439 --> 01:12:43,678
taste like if it was super fresh indoor

1990

2031
01:14:22,158 --> 01:14:26,599
much money you make yeah not everyone

2032
01:14:24,679 --> 01:14:28,840
has a batch at the right time is what it

2033
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:30,760
really comes down to in competition

2034
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:32,719
exactly is who has the batch at the

2035
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:35,400
right time who's the best that day that

2036
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:37,719
day exactly and it could be like who

2037
01:14:35,399 --> 01:14:39,439
everyone thinks is like the smallest or

2038
01:14:37,719 --> 01:14:42,158
shittiest grower I mean that would be

2039
01:14:39,439 --> 01:14:43,439
cool so Alfred Master Yoda told me this

2040
01:14:42,158 --> 01:14:46,519
a long time

2041
01:14:43,439 --> 01:14:48,279
ago uh when I won my first Cannabis Cup

2042
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:50,520
yeah he said and I was in Amsterdam in

2043
01:14:48,279 --> 01:14:52,840
2012 and he said it's it's not always

2044
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:54,000
the best it's the best that day that day

2045
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:56,960
you know and

2046
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:58,479
so some of these guys that win it's like

2047
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:00,439
at least with the fair competitions you

2048
01:14:58,479 --> 01:15:01,638
know what I mean like the real ones

2049
01:15:00,439 --> 01:15:04,599
which I think are getting better and

2050
01:15:01,639 --> 01:15:07,639
better I agree I mean I like the reason

2051
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:10,320
I did it with them is because I I like

2052
01:15:07,639 --> 01:15:13,199
how they judge things too I know that

2053
01:15:10,319 --> 01:15:14,519
they H they have a pretty distinct

2054
01:15:13,198 --> 01:15:17,000
palette and it's

2055
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:19,400
extreme what they think about quality

2056
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:21,760
and I've seen them dog like their own

2057
01:15:19,399 --> 01:15:24,638
person who grows their weed I've seen

2058
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:25,960
them dog their own weed online so like I

2059
01:15:24,639 --> 01:15:27,560
trust

2060
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:29,319
what they do they do it in your face you

2061
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:31,400
know what I mean for sure you're

2062
01:15:29,319 --> 01:15:33,158
addicted to the soil Z though sound oh

2063
01:15:31,399 --> 01:15:34,759
this stuff is super special you'll be

2064
01:15:33,158 --> 01:15:38,439
addicted to it too the second you taste

2065
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:41,520
it you you smoke a lot of OG and Cam and

2066
01:15:38,439 --> 01:15:44,638
I smoke a lot of everything but I like I

2067
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:46,199
like Skittles I like OG I'm smoking on

2068
01:15:44,639 --> 01:15:49,199
some crippy right now that's like a old

2069
01:15:46,198 --> 01:15:52,079
school OG cut yeah yeah it's gassy

2070
01:15:49,198 --> 01:15:53,960
what's your favorite though cat piss but

2071
01:15:52,079 --> 01:15:55,279
there is no cat piss anymore but yeah if

2072
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:57,639
if I had to pick my favorite thing in

2073
01:15:55,279 --> 01:15:59,800
the whole world that'd be ciss when the

2074
01:15:57,639 --> 01:16:01,960
last time you had it a long time ago and

2075
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:03,800
I've had so many imposters over the

2076
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:06,399
years and it's like the ciss I remember

2077
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:09,520
was a I would say it was super silver

2078
01:16:06,399 --> 01:16:10,799
haze was was in ciss that I had you know

2079
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:12,719
but it had the worst structure and it

2080
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:16,679
was ammonia and skunk and it wasn't

2081
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:18,039
gassy like OG it was like straight skunk

2082
01:16:16,679 --> 01:16:20,239
tenth of a gram would smell the whole

2083
01:16:18,039 --> 01:16:23,439
room up and it's unmistakable you know

2084
01:16:20,238 --> 01:16:25,479
cat piss was fire then a lot of strains

2085
01:16:23,439 --> 01:16:27,799
were fire for I feel like the TPS were

2086
01:16:25,479 --> 01:16:30,279
better then not better but right more

2087
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:33,520
distinct from grow to grow yep because

2088
01:16:30,279 --> 01:16:35,279
everyone wasn't using [ __ ] Athena or

2089
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:37,719
whatever the whatever the hottest the

2090
01:16:35,279 --> 01:16:40,519
cheapest salt brand there is I feel like

2091
01:16:37,719 --> 01:16:42,319
that's a big play on it and you can only

2092
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:45,679
get so many different substrates I mean

2093
01:16:42,319 --> 01:16:48,279
it's cool to see some soil but I you

2094
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:50,199
know at scale that's a little tough to

2095
01:16:48,279 --> 01:16:52,000
be able to steer and and you're going to

2096
01:16:50,198 --> 01:16:56,198
be super batch to batch with soil that's

2097
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:59,279
the one thing I would say yep

2098
01:16:56,198 --> 01:17:00,960
okay I got this down about a half inch I

2099
01:16:59,279 --> 01:17:02,479
think it's the best part yeah I want the

2100
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:06,198
neck

2101
01:17:02,479 --> 01:17:08,919
bone we got some decent Ash we got some

2102
01:17:06,198 --> 01:17:11,559
really good drip feel like this thing is

2103
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:12,760
dripping like crazy for flour yeah and

2104
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:15,239
for Skittles a lot of guys their

2105
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:17,840
Skittles don't drip yeah

2106
01:17:15,238 --> 01:17:19,359
yeah well that's you I think I feel like

2107
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:23,960
you can get an oil ring on anything or

2108
01:17:19,359 --> 01:17:23,960
I'll take this yeah

2109
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:31,440
yeah it tastes great T pretty good right

2110
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:33,880
for sure hell yeah yeah and it's burning

2111
01:17:31,439 --> 01:17:35,519
kind of dark like in between you know

2112
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:38,239
but it tastes really good I like the

2113
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:41,719
fact that it's burning not not bone

2114
01:17:38,238 --> 01:17:41,718
white and tastes good

2115
01:17:42,198 --> 01:17:45,638
yeah if I would have rolled that a

2116
01:17:44,198 --> 01:17:49,238
little tighter it might burn a little

2117
01:17:45,639 --> 01:17:52,119
wider but yeah and the thing is is this

2118
01:17:49,238 --> 01:17:55,479
is going to air after the proper dinks

2119
01:17:52,119 --> 01:17:58,279
yeah yeah so definitely like it it's

2120
01:17:55,479 --> 01:17:58,279
good

2121
01:17:58,359 --> 01:18:03,319
nice but yeah the ash isn't perfect I

2122
01:18:01,039 --> 01:18:05,719
definitely get critiqued on the ash on

2123
01:18:03,319 --> 01:18:10,840
this one guarantee yeah I'm not 100% on

2124
01:18:05,719 --> 01:18:10,840
that always I mean I oh [ __ ] I just

2125
01:18:11,719 --> 01:18:16,319
lost but OG's from back in the day we

2126
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:17,760
didn't care about the ash as much I

2127
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:19,279
didn't want black ash I don't think that

2128
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:22,400
would be like weirded out maybe but it

2129
01:18:19,279 --> 01:18:23,960
was like ash wasn't a qualifier with the

2130
01:18:22,399 --> 01:18:26,039
stuff we used to smoke and I've been

2131
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:27,719
smoking since the 90s we've been rolling

2132
01:18:26,039 --> 01:18:30,319
big joints since the 90s you have to

2133
01:18:27,719 --> 01:18:30,319
hold that on the

2134
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:36,840
paper nice looking Ash nice smoth

2135
01:18:34,079 --> 01:18:38,600
burning clean yeah you got a nice drip

2136
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:39,960
yeah it's got the it's got the ring for

2137
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:42,600
sure I mean you can get the ring out of

2138
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:45,439
everything I like smoking inside that's

2139
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:47,960
a big factor yep smoke that

2140
01:18:45,439 --> 01:18:51,158
outside it's going to be more peppery

2141
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:53,439
and less uh resiny I

2142
01:18:51,158 --> 01:18:56,119
mean see why you're entering this this

2143
01:18:53,439 --> 01:19:00,359
is great yeah

2144
01:18:56,119 --> 01:19:03,960
it's hard to go Z side to side and just

2145
01:19:00,359 --> 01:19:05,519
pick you can tell me I'll I'll let you

2146
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:07,119
do the talking on this one but I think

2147
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:10,040
they're the flavor

2148
01:19:07,119 --> 01:19:12,238
profile yours definitely looks better

2149
01:19:10,039 --> 01:19:15,600
and it's it's turpy but it's

2150
01:19:12,238 --> 01:19:19,198
hard going to compare Z to

2151
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:22,000
Z good smooth it tastes

2152
01:19:19,198 --> 01:19:24,119
great and it's burning dark that's the

2153
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:26,800
funny part yeah it's got a lot of turps

2154
01:19:24,119 --> 01:19:30,158
though it does

2155
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:33,039
yeah similar for sure I mean it's about

2156
01:19:30,158 --> 01:19:35,000
the grind and the tightness and all the

2157
01:19:33,039 --> 01:19:37,399
things too is the trickier part

2158
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,880
interesting concept though yeah but yeah

2159
01:19:37,399 --> 01:19:41,559
we need proper in them on the on the

2160
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:44,000
show to actually to have them tell you

2161
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:45,840
when and why you know yeah they be like

2162
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:50,520
yeah you didn't Ru it quite tight enough

2163
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:52,279
and TPS wise they're both tppy

2164
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:55,440
yeah yes

2165
01:19:52,279 --> 01:19:57,800
sir hard strain to beat the funny thing

2166
01:19:55,439 --> 01:20:00,879
is with the dirt Skittles it's so

2167
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:04,480
[ __ ] strong and Skittles is you so he

2168
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:06,359
pulls around between effect effect yeah

2169
01:20:04,479 --> 01:20:08,479
and turps obviously but with effect

2170
01:20:06,359 --> 01:20:10,079
Skittles is not normally strong yeah

2171
01:20:08,479 --> 01:20:11,479
yeah right I think probably when we

2172
01:20:10,079 --> 01:20:13,359
smoke these two it's even going to get

2173
01:20:11,479 --> 01:20:15,359
us more high for whatever reason but I

2174
01:20:13,359 --> 01:20:17,238
get super high I get super high from

2175
01:20:15,359 --> 01:20:19,158
mixed light more than I do from my own

2176
01:20:17,238 --> 01:20:21,279
indoor of the same strain I get a lot

2177
01:20:19,158 --> 01:20:23,599
higher from mix light yeah I don't know

2178
01:20:21,279 --> 01:20:25,198
why but I do get higher from it yeah and

2179
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:27,360
this dirt is the first time I've got

2180
01:20:25,198 --> 01:20:29,279
Skittles in my entire life that was both

2181
01:20:27,359 --> 01:20:30,639
strong and turpy where it was like candy

2182
01:20:29,279 --> 01:20:32,880
because usually if I want it strong I

2183
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:35,800
could go day 63 yeah yeah but if I want

2184
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:38,480
a turpy I want to go if I Want Candy Day

2185
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:41,039
51 day 52 day 53 do you know when that

2186
01:20:38,479 --> 01:20:43,039
was harvested it was on day 53 yeah

2187
01:20:41,039 --> 01:20:44,079
that's kind of right around the range I

2188
01:20:43,039 --> 01:20:48,319
think

2189
01:20:44,079 --> 01:20:50,960
yeah LED HPS

2190
01:20:48,319 --> 01:20:53,079
Led Led and you know the thing is is

2191
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:54,719
like I think a lot of the ogs growing

2192
01:20:53,079 --> 01:20:56,319
under LED aren't very good I've seen

2193
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:57,920
some lately and I'm just like not that

2194
01:20:56,319 --> 01:21:00,639
excited I've seen a handful of stuff

2195
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:03,079
that's like CMH HPS yeah it's awesome

2196
01:21:00,639 --> 01:21:07,079
but the LED ogs just don't cut it for

2197
01:21:03,079 --> 01:21:10,158
sure I uh I think it's too intense so

2198
01:21:07,079 --> 01:21:12,559
like with OG I have some OG here it's

2199
01:21:10,158 --> 01:21:15,759
like you almost got to put it on the you

2200
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:17,760
got to put it on the edge of a grow yeah

2201
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:19,239
or in the back corner or you know what I

2202
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:21,360
mean you can't if you put that [ __ ] in

2203
01:21:19,238 --> 01:21:23,839
the center right it's going to blow out

2204
01:21:21,359 --> 01:21:26,279
it's going to lose turps it's it's OG

2205
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:27,480
mhm it's icky it's going to ask for

2206
01:21:26,279 --> 01:21:29,079
things that you can't give it in the

2207
01:21:27,479 --> 01:21:31,638
middle of the room right if you look at

2208
01:21:29,079 --> 01:21:34,000
OG wrong it's not going to be the the

2209
01:21:31,639 --> 01:21:38,039
best OG batch that you had yeah I got I

2210
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:39,840
got this cut from Christian oh nice yeah

2211
01:21:38,039 --> 01:21:41,079
Christian knows really good weed he does

2212
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:44,360
for sure he went through the feno hunt

2213
01:21:41,079 --> 01:21:48,238
with me too here that we just recently

2214
01:21:44,359 --> 01:21:48,238
did oh yeah that's really

2215
01:21:51,039 --> 01:21:57,679
nice it's OG it's definitely OG that's

2216
01:21:55,158 --> 01:21:59,638
un I don't even see OG like

2217
01:21:57,679 --> 01:22:01,359
this that's why I wanted to give it to

2218
01:21:59,639 --> 01:22:03,920
you I was like you're you're going to

2219
01:22:01,359 --> 01:22:06,238
respect that yeah because there's a lot

2220
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:09,520
of OG crosses and there's a lot I don't

2221
01:22:06,238 --> 01:22:12,279
know just not many people are growing

2222
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:14,040
like original OG like this dude this

2223
01:22:12,279 --> 01:22:16,759
definitely checks the boxes on the White

2224
01:22:14,039 --> 01:22:19,760
Ash you got nice clean burning good

2225
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:22,520
burning really good got a good drip

2226
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:25,000
burning even burning even it's got It's

2227
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:27,199
got the resin yeah right definitely it

2228
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:29,158
definitely I mean we're halfway down and

2229
01:22:27,198 --> 01:22:30,559
it still tastes great that's when you

2230
01:22:29,158 --> 01:22:32,359
know it's like the further down it gets

2231
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:35,080
if it still keeps tasting good collect

2232
01:22:32,359 --> 01:22:37,439
the check seriously you g to put this

2233
01:22:35,079 --> 01:22:41,238
one in though I mean you you definitely

2234
01:22:37,439 --> 01:22:43,319
get critiqued on Just burn but they they

2235
01:22:41,238 --> 01:22:46,158
roll I think with flavor it stands a

2236
01:22:43,319 --> 01:22:48,399
chance against anything dude like that

2237
01:22:46,158 --> 01:22:50,238
flavor if I wouldn't get knocked for the

2238
01:22:48,399 --> 01:22:51,960
I would enter it except for I I think it

2239
01:22:50,238 --> 01:22:53,879
would win on flavor but it feels it

2240
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:56,399
feels strong too you know what I mean

2241
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:58,440
like it has some good expansion for Z it

2242
01:22:56,399 --> 01:23:01,279
does it's uh it's good I like those guys

2243
01:22:58,439 --> 01:23:02,960
too so I know it's I know it's coming

2244
01:23:01,279 --> 01:23:04,759
out of a clean facility that's an

2245
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:07,119
important piece you know what I

2246
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:08,159
mean yeah it's hard smoking stuff from

2247
01:23:07,119 --> 01:23:09,519
other people when you don't know what

2248
01:23:08,158 --> 01:23:11,238
the [ __ ] they did with it or who they

2249
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:13,440
got it from I prefer not doing it I'd

2250
01:23:11,238 --> 01:23:14,439
rather it's like we're we mainly smoke

2251
01:23:13,439 --> 01:23:17,198
our own

2252
01:23:14,439 --> 01:23:18,559
weed we we're qcing so much that it's

2253
01:23:17,198 --> 01:23:20,678
like really hard to get a hold of

2254
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:22,600
everybody else's weed yeah which but we

2255
01:23:20,679 --> 01:23:24,880
do it we got to be sure that we're

2256
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:26,520
standing up to

2257
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:28,119
people that are doing well and making

2258
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:29,840
noise that's you know that's the main

2259
01:23:28,119 --> 01:23:31,599
reason I feel like California everybody

2260
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:34,639
likes sharing their stuff too like we're

2261
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:36,639
super inclusive uh and I mean there is

2262
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:38,359
exclusivity but also between in the

2263
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:40,760
circle it's like yeah dude you want like

2264
01:23:38,359 --> 01:23:42,238
let's smoke you're in that's the thing

2265
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:43,880
that's what you have to do it's like a

2266
01:23:42,238 --> 01:23:45,879
it's like a mandatory

2267
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:47,719
thing for sure and everybody likes

2268
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:49,840
showing the weed sharing the

2269
01:23:47,719 --> 01:23:52,359
batches I mean you can really tell a

2270
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:53,600
person by their weed too like who walks

2271
01:23:52,359 --> 01:23:55,599
around with weed what kind of weed do

2272
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:57,320
they walk around with I think yeah at

2273
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:59,079
least the forward- facing people that

2274
01:23:57,319 --> 01:24:01,439
smoke it's like they have good weed on

2275
01:23:59,079 --> 01:24:03,198
them it's it's usually an obvious one

2276
01:24:01,439 --> 01:24:05,599
for sure these are

2277
01:24:03,198 --> 01:24:07,399
uh this was something from a hunt that's

2278
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:08,840
like a skittles cross where it was like

2279
01:24:07,399 --> 01:24:11,839
a mystery

2280
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:11,840
strain

2281
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:20,960

2288
01:24:33,039 --> 01:24:38,479
with it too that was one that was like a

2289
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:42,159
little bit lighter on the perm I felt

2290
01:24:38,479 --> 01:24:44,118
like but it's fire strong too I got

2291
01:24:42,158 --> 01:24:47,238

boy first class if anything's candy

2295
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:57,360
that's about as candy as you're going to

2296
01:24:54,079 --> 01:24:59,920
get for me it's not that candy yeah yeah

2297
01:24:57,359 --> 01:25:01,719
first class genetics did a permanent

2298
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:04,440
marker headband that we feno hunted yeah

2299
01:25:01,719 --> 01:25:07,800
headbands like that's that's my go-to I

2300
01:25:04,439 --> 01:25:09,439
can get a hold of that cut yeah 707 yeah

2301
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:11,679
because we had the OG cut in the bay and

2302
01:25:09,439 --> 01:25:15,118
then I learned the 707 is like sour and

2303
01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:17,319
OG whereas like the the Josh D was also

2304
01:25:15,118 --> 01:25:19,198
renamed headband and so there was an OG

2305
01:25:17,319 --> 01:25:22,079
cut of headband

2306
01:25:19,198 --> 01:25:24,879
yeah G's got some fire dude he got real

2307
01:25:22,079 --> 01:25:26,118
fire for sure he's with us in Florida

2308
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:28,920
dude that's

2309
01:25:26,118 --> 01:25:31,000
amazing um dude this is special this is

2310
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:33,000
like bubblegum this smells like straight

2311
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:35,840
up bubble gum but it's if you get in

2312
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:38,600
there it's gassy it is it's a little bit

2313
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:40,279
gassy but dude this is like more bubble

2314
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:42,079
gum than the fake bubble gum stuff that

2315
01:25:40,279 --> 01:25:43,359
was going around I mean there's a strain

2316
01:25:42,079 --> 01:25:45,960
bubble gum and this is way more bubble

2317
01:25:43,359 --> 01:25:47,639
gum than that and it's super powerful

2318
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:48,439
that's like the most medicinal strain we

2319
01:25:47,639 --> 01:25:50,960
have

2320
01:25:48,439 --> 01:25:52,759

thing when cookies was popping we had

2389
01:28:29,158 --> 01:28:35,559
