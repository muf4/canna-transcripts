41
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,040
because um all my friends or well I

42
00:01:26,438 --> 00:01:30,719
moved from Columbia to uh thefield Beach

43
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,200
or pompo Beach

44
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:36,000
Florida and uh I became a surfer and all

45
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,200
my friends were Surfers and most of them

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,759
were rich and they all smoked weed and I

47
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,719
was anti-weed and then um they were just

48
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:43,399
they were even rich and they were still

49
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:45,560
sell weed I'm like [ __ ] man I need to do

50
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:47,759
that because I was busting my ass being

51
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,399
a bus boy salad boy you know prep cook

52
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,920
cook construction and eventually I just

53
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,718
said you know know I want to sell some

54
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,240
weed you know I need to buy a car or

55
00:01:53,718 --> 00:01:57,679
something because I beat up car and yeah

56
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,239
um you know from there I got into

57
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,920
construction and then they wanted me to

58
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,640
um they want me to build stuff for them

59
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,159
so then I would I would build it and

60
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,759
then I would get all the rights to to

61
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:10,840
whatever came out of that place that I

62
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:14,119
would build and that's how kind I got my

63
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:17,840

68
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,680
whole Miami thing was straight straight

00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:37,840
started nice we had some we had some uh

73
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,239
I mean it's just luck of the drop but we

74
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,800
had some Surfers that were that were

75
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:44,200
pretty connected and they they you know

76
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:47,120

that weed to this day is still some of

86
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,959
the baddest weed yeah that that I

87
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:09,799
remember uh there's some interesting

88
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:12,239
things that came out of Florida for like

89
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:13,519
example OG Kush did you see OG Kush back

90
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,360
in the day was that something that went

91
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,759
around as like the crippy or you know

92
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,799
what crippy is crippy to anybody that

93
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:22,039
remers seedless you know uh you know

94
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:23,959
that that crypto was the original thing

95
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:25,959
that we remember as as you know as

96
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:28,840
chronic seedless stuff that that was

97
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:30,319
pretty damn good and then um people

98
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,840
started growing more and more and more

99
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:35,479
weed in in Florida um the Cubans the

100
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,920
Cubans they're beasts they were growing

101
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:40,679
all all kinds of weed down in in in in

102
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:43,000
Homestead in Miami lots of sativas lots

103
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,159
of sativas yes lots of hazes you know

104
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,239
lots of stuff and anything that was

105
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:49,318
seedless became synonymous were creepy

106
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:51,080
yeah and um you know little accents the

107
00:03:49,318 --> 00:03:53,158
creepy the creepy the creepy you got

108
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,239
that creepy yeah so everything was

109
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:57,078
seedless it was it was crippy to anybody

110
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:58,759
so crippy could be whatever it was at

111
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:00,519
that time that you first started smoking

112
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:03,479
that was seedless that's the Exotics of

113
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:05,840
its day yes sir yes sir then the the

114
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:07,438
Cuban black Haze and there was I really

115
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,319
like the Cuban black Haze I got some in

116
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:11,919
the other room uh and some piff really

117
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:13,518
good stuff pretty much almost the same

118
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:16,639
thing is you got that you know like that

119
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:19,160
cat piss kind of leathery you know burnt

120
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,799
rubber kind of like smell you know it's

121
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,000
definitely different you know yeah well

122
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:25,399
it's it's got Pine and limine and so

123
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,759
it's like got any it's got a lot of it's

124
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:30,038
robust it's got a lot of different

125
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:33,680
flavors super super musky stinky yes

126
00:04:30,038 --> 00:04:35,240
like dank I guess you could say yeah MH

127
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,478
yeah I like the effect of them too but

128
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,918
they're long flowering plants yes

129
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:40,839
they're definitely not a commercial

130
00:04:38,918 --> 00:04:43,038
viable plant uh anything that takes

131
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:44,879
longer than than 10 weeks is really hard

132
00:04:43,038 --> 00:04:48,279
to justify because no nobody's going to

133
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:50,159
pay for for for for what it cost to grow

134
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:52,038
right so uh they kind of they're faded

135
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,800
out on the commercial commercial side

136
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:57,879
there are some people that have um you

137
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,199
know bred the piff and and other hazes

138
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:01,800
into uh into nine week strains you know

139
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:04,280
I don't know how they did it back cross

140
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,478
to something and there are some 9 10s

141
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:09,638
yeah exactly the haze that I grow is the

142
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:11,639
the the mango Haze and that's an 63 65

143
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:13,400
day strain haste yeah and that's kind of

144
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:15,519
where we grew and and it threw down too

145
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:18,000
I mean back in the day it was so yours

146
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:20,680
finishes the one you showed me yesterday

147
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,680
yes finishes in 63 days 63 65 days that

148
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,759
thing's done it's a late bloomer starts

149
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,160
slow yeah and then it just puts its

150
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:29,639
weight on and uh in in the last you know

151
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,520
couple of weeks it definitely you know

152
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:34,478
throw some weight yeah yeah 63 there

153
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:35,918
it's got an interesting structure it's

154
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,038
funny because we were just talking on

155
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:40,159
the last podcast I did about structure

156
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:43,599
and you know appealing structure people

157
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,199
like those nested tight buds whereas

158
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,639
like that stuff is very open bud with uh

159
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:51,038
BRS that stack on top of each other and

160
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,038
yes very foxy you know some of us looser

161
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:56,038
than others uh the D mango haste happens

162
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:59,120
to be like T tight fox tails super

163
00:05:56,038 --> 00:06:01,560
bright uh orange hairs and like I call

164
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,720
it wet TPS uh it retains its weight you

165
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,918
know when it dries out um when you have

166
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,280
dry you know wet flower with no leaf on

167
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:10,799
it and it dries it usually dries

168
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:12,239
anywhere between 19 to 22% average uh

169
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,680
the mango is one of those that kind of

170
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,879
retains his weight because it's it's

171
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,478
like heavy oils yeah so it's like in the

172
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:21,839
20 22% resist rate yeah greasy doesn't

173
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:24,519
wash for [ __ ] yeah it's a loser in in

174
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:26,959
the in the wash but still in the it's a

175
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:29,639
loser but uh for BHO it's a winner it

176
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:31,038
definitely throws down on that for sure

177
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,240
yeah and I'm sure smoking joints of it I

178
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:33,879
can just imagine from smelling it

179
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,280
yesterday how it tastes yes it's

180
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:37,279
definitely got a I mean there's some

181
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:38,679
people I like it I like the taste chicks

182
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:40,038
love the taste too there's some people

183
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,598
that uh love the taste some people

184
00:06:40,038 --> 00:06:43,360
actually you know don't like the taste

185
00:06:41,598 --> 00:06:44,680
they I think it's strong I could just

186
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,680
tell by the smell of it that it's

187
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,680
probably pretty strong it's full flavor

188
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,319
but it's probably also strong in effect

189
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,000
super pungent and uh you know what

190
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,720
actually T tests pretty low for THC like

191
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,800
in in the mid 25s nice I've had it

192
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,440
anywhere from 23 to 26 roughly yeah but

193
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,360
uh it definitely gets you high and we

194
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:04,959
all know that just because you know

195
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,000
something's lower or in the High Teens

196
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,359
or low 20s doesn't mean that it's not

197
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
good as you know it's it's got a

198
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,680
different effect totally people just

199
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,759
starting to figure that out that like I

200
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,360
don't think they'll ever figure it out

201
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:18,199
James yeah if that's not the truth you

202
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,800
know what anybody that's that's that's

203
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:21,520
in the Cannabis game may know it but you

204
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,759
know most people they just go straight

205
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:24,719
to their store and they just look at

206
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:26,038
that percentage des and that's just it's

207
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,120
like tunnel vision like a horse with

208
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:29,079
blinders and that's all they're going to

209
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,959
buy if it's I I think that's going to

210
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:32,800
change though I see it changing in

211
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:35,000
Colorado I see it changing in Washington

212
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,960
more that people are relying on Brands

213
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,680
rather than just THC and so if you have

214
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:41,959
a good brand and you have something they

215
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,319
they trusted enough to try it and it's

216
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:45,158
just going to take time and it's going

217
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:46,439
to take better products with low THC on

218
00:07:45,158 --> 00:07:48,800
the market where people are like holy

219
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:50,560
[ __ ] it's only 22% me to me it's about

220
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,840
Flavor you know flavors like I I don't

221
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,639
see anybody that's going to a liquor

222
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:55,478
store and goes like what let me see on

223
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:59,360

dilute it properly they put some fruit

255
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:01,120
in it what're talking about we're going

256
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,480
back to tast yeah and craft exactly

257
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,759
tasting yeah some guys that you know

258
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,839
Infuse it with you know apples or

259
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:07,720
oranges citrus or something whatever is

260
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,079
to making it their own exactly but

261
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,278
that's what we need to do with genetics

262
00:09:09,078 --> 00:09:13,000
too I feel like we're um we're in this

263
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:14,600
really interesting place where

264
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,720
everything is like purple candy gas

265
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,560
gelato and that's going to change

266
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,320
everything changes that's what it is if

267
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,599
it a if it ain't candy gas just but how

268
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,040
do you make it your own you know what I

269
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,680
mean that's going to like the my your

270
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:28,399
your mango strand your mango Haze right

271
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:31,078
yep I'm getting ready to those things

272
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,799
are gonna over time will develop into

273
00:09:31,078 --> 00:09:34,559
popular things I mean I I can just

274
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:36,719
assume that will like everything else

275
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:39,719
but like we need those things because we

276
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,639
need the diversity because taste is so

277
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,600
subjective um you know it's it's

278
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:45,319
interesting yeah like everybody says you

279
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,079
know um you know I hate fruit or I hate

280
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:50,000
gas or you know I hate earthy whatever

281
00:09:47,078 --> 00:09:51,759
it is I tell people is uh Basin Robins

282
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,399
got 31 Flavors for a reason you know

283
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:55,120
what's what's the best vanilla or

284
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:57,200
chocolate you know strawberry or you

285
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,200

286
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,800
different palletes Vanilla some people

287
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,320
just love that FL on vanilla you can eat

288
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:04,519
an edible if you don't want like I got

289
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,240
to say I like haand vanilla where it's

290
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:07,720
got It's not infused with with air like

291
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,519
all those briers and all the stuff but

292
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,800
oh yeah I'm a vanilla guy Roman Risin

293
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,120
though actually actually better so

294
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:16,719
there's some fruit yeah I love gelato I

295
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,839
love Italian big on the Italian style

296
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,360
where they don't have the air the

297
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,880
overrun no exactly yeah when it's

298
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,600
fluffed out it kind of you know D it

299
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:24,000
ruins it it Ru but it's also different

300
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,720
where it's like it's healthier I think

301
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,759
gelato is healthier than ice cream it's

302
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,200
probably real milk cre yeah or real milk

303
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:31,919
or whatever ever it is yeah but yeah and

304
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,440
you eat it fresh so where's ice cream

305
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:35,519
you pull it out of the freezer I think

306
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,920
gelato if you make it that day it's

307
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,600
freaking amazing you know this texture

308
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:41,199
right special texture and especially

309
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,800
when they start mixing like pistachos or

310
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,639
this caramel or stuff like that there

311
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:48,159
was a place in Oregon that was

312
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:50,159
insane that made the most insane ice

313
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:51,719
cream or gelato and I forget what it was

314
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:54,519
U fins and feathers or something

315
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,040
something some weird name but they made

316
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:58,240
the weirdest ice cream and one day they

317
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:59,759
were making out of duck fat or something

318
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,839
like that it was just

319
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:04,039
the best the best ice cream I ever

320
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:07,440
tasted duck Fett ice cream sounds crazy

321
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:10,078
yeah super creamy yeah I bet it's a

322
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,079
heart stoer yeah exactly yeah I made

323
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:15,000
gelato when I was uh in my 20s my early

324
00:11:13,078 --> 00:11:17,599
20s I worked at a gelato shop for like

325
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,078
six months gelato Milano in Berkeley

326
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,800
Avenue and I really wanted to learn how

327
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:23,719
to make gelato because I was so D and

328
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:25,199
it's just amazing the process and I I

329
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,680
have so much appreciation for you can't

330
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,680
get away from gelato can you no gelato

331
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:31,679
then gelato now they're forcing the

332
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:33,759
gelato on me and I do like some of the

333
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:35,078
gelato you know like the 33 is super

334
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,559
diverse I feel like there's a lot of

335
00:11:35,078 --> 00:11:39,319
amazing stuff but like everything's

336
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:41,000
gelato these days back seat gelato came

337
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,278
out of something some kind of bag and

338
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,200
everything's just from there and then

339
00:11:42,278 --> 00:11:46,039
another back seat came out it was just

340
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,560
you know yeah back seed after back seed

341
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,838
but and and that's okay I think all

342
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:51,278
these Evolutions that we're going

343
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,079
through these different stages they're

344
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:56,480
all okay they're all part of the process

345
00:11:53,078 --> 00:11:58,120
of wherever we're going yep can you call

346
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,720
can you call what the next what the next

347
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,000
fad thing's going to be it's so hard to

348
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,320
call it what do you

349
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,278
think I think gas is coming back

350
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,000
honestly I think gas gas and lime green

351
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:08,519
we're I've been talking about lime green

352
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,278
a little bit with people and I think

353
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,519
lime green has the potential but gas

354
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:14,399
like old school ogs and also old school

355
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:16,600
favorites that we were nostalgic about

356
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,879
those are going to come back the a lot

357
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,839
of people are saying like the hazes are

358
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:21,519
coming back you know I think I I read

359
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,440
somewhere might have been an Instagram

360
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,078
post from Mr Nice Seedbank that he says

361
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,639
that in the last year he sold more mango

362
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:31,359
hay seeds than than than like since he

363
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:34,799
ever started selling them so well also

364
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:38,399
so what we have is we have the increase

365
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:40,359
in popularity and so more people are

366
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,198
trying cannabis we have like a larger

367
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,240
pool of people there's more people

368
00:12:42,198 --> 00:12:46,359
breeding there's more people agreed

369
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,680
buying seeds to a degree although it's

370
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,278
been a little slow this year with seed

371
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:51,599
sales retail but I think that has to do

372
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:54,240
with the economy I would probably say so

373
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,759
too I would probably say so too and uh

374
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,680
seeds aren't cheap you know and then I

375
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:59,039
can I can see where that that would

376
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:00,519
probably hurt you know that the the seed

377
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:02,879
breeders a little bit because people are

378
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:04,519
not buying them yeah mhm I can see that

379
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,000
totally well there's so many there's

380
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:07,519
just so many breeders everybody's a

381
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,399
breeder every Everybody Wants to be a

382
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,320
breeder there is there is and anybody

383
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:13,320
can make seeds seeds aren't hard to make

384
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,959
I think breeders nowadays I mean they're

385
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,160
not like they used to back back back in

386
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,719
the day when I remember breeders I mean

387
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:20,360
they didn't have seeds all the time and

388
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:22,399
they would work the line to it wasn't

389
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,039
like what do you call it f1s or s1's you

390
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,120
know when you when you you you cross

391
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:28,198
them you sell everything but now now

392
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,879
they cross it and they sell everything

393
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:32,838
it's like a pot it's more like a lottery

394
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:34,759
ticket yeah stuff was held a lot tighter

395
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,959
and you didn't want to necessar sell

396
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:38,360
stuff when you were breeding or you

397
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:40,119
didn't necessarily it wasn't it wasn't

398
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,480
the same and like your the sour diesel

399
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,679
cut we didn't want the sour diesel cut

400
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,440
to get out we didn't want to share the

401
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:46,319
sour diesel cut want any good cut to get

402
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,600
out no you didn't want cuts to get out

403
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,839
especially in Florida let me tell you I

404
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:54,680
PID 60 Grand yeah for the mango cut back

405
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:57,079
in 2001 crazy 60 grand for for for nine

406
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:59,958
little clones and a recipe on how to

407
00:13:57,078 --> 00:14:02,399
grow it and uh but you know paid itself

408
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:04,000
back then I mean you grew weed and you

409
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,198
sell a pound of weed anywhere from 4,000

410
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,519
to 4,800 whether it was one or 10 it

411
00:14:06,198 --> 00:14:10,278
didn't matter so uh you made your money

412
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:12,399
back on on one run and then from there

413
00:14:10,278 --> 00:14:16,159
on you know you it was all all profit

414
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:18,198
and the thing back then is um you didn't

415
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:20,439
really have you know it was federally

416
00:14:18,198 --> 00:14:22,559

418
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:26,719
yeah so you didn't want to mess with

419
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:27,958
with seeds in Florida because you know

420
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,199
it was a potluck you know we're going to

421
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,599

427
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,278

your money back and made some yeah it's

430
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:50,439
pretty wild times were so different in

431
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:52,439
so many ways and you know I just I can

432
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:55,240
appreciate the past it was wild it was a

433
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,720
wild west 100% and uh yeah I mean you

434
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,440
were you were doing you you were

435
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,079
building out multiple grows and you were

436
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:04,240
growing gr and doing all kinds of stuff

437
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:06,359
so since 1996 yeah since 199 96 95 I

438
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,639
started building one thing we we grew up

439
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,720
first grop in 96 amazing and uh it was

440

the the mom room and clone room and then

443
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:19,120
from there it was all history then we

444
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,480

00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:42,839
working 24 hours like you know you had

456
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,759

in doing in a house you got to go to a

463
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:56,799
warehouse and we were scared of

464
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,278
warehouses in Florida it just didn't

465
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:59,879
happen Florida is a little different

466
00:15:58,278 --> 00:16:02,639
because

467
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:04,679
uh you got to jump the power you can't I

468
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,680
mean here in California you guys yeah

469
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:08,439
you guys are spoiled you Sacramento they

470
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:10,719

they'll point the finger at you yeah

473
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:16,600
well so in Oakland how they determin the

474
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:18,399
green zone was by the power so they went

475
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,639
and looked at PG the highest used power

476
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,120
areas where everyone was already growing

477
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,360
that's where they put the green zone for

478
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,480
cannabis in Oakland interesting so very

479
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,560
supportive of the movement yeah nowadays

480
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,560
just like uh nowadays with these LEDs

481
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:32,479
that we have now and uh you can slam

482
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:33,879
them on the canopy you can turn that

483
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,039
that power way down and slam on the

484
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:37,120
canopy you still have the same ppfd

485
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:39,000
that's a winner because you don't have

486
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,318
to tap anymore so yeah that's a pretty

487
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,919
good way to go about it now you got into

488
00:16:40,318 --> 00:16:45,679
the lighting game kind of early or I

489
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:48,559
guess not so long ago but you got in

490
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:51,278
with a good product and yes and it was

491
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:52,758
kind of by accident in a way uh I got

492
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:54,919
I've told this story several times I got

493
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:57,318
raid in 2017 6 months before

494
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:59,240
legalization in California yeah I was

495
00:16:57,318 --> 00:17:01,559
planning on going out west I mean uh

496
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,919
well East from here West from Florida to

497
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:05,639
Colorado I was invested into a into a

498
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:08,240
grow over there that was kind of failing

499
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,038
I was buying some Partners out and I

500
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,439
thought I was going to you know make it

501
00:17:10,038 --> 00:17:15,798
there and then I got raided in in 2017

502
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,919
in in orille California and that threw a

503
00:17:15,798 --> 00:17:19,720
wrench of my spoke and I had to reinvent

504
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,600
myself I had to figure out how to how to

505
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,919
survive and you know feed the family so

506
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,399
I started doing more Consulting because

507
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:27,679
I had started doing it and I met this

508
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,038
this Asian dude in in Oregon at at a

509
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,840
trap that I was re building and uh he

510
00:17:30,038 --> 00:17:34,000
liked me he seen something in me and um

511
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:35,959
we started you know selling these

512
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,599
controllers and I started giving them

513
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,880
feedback as a grower you know because

514
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:40,959
they had a great product as it was

515
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,400
anyway but he just needed to be refined

516
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,200
this is the original troll Master

517
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,200
correct before it was troll Master no it

518
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,480
was troll it was troll Master already uh

519
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,558
it was troll Master already it wasn't in

520
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:52,759
any stores yeah um back then it wasn't

521
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:54,960
haon it was a Sunlight Supply yeah

522
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:57,400
turned them down hydrarm turned them

523
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,679
down and uh any other store turn them

524
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,519
down so the owner went up up and down

525
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:03,440
the coast from door to door with

526
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:05,079
pamphlets he moved from Hong Kong to LA

527
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,200
and went up and down the coast just

528
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:08,399
pamphlet after pamphlet you know and now

529
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,960
he had some sales and the guy that I was

530
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,159
doing a trap for you know picked up the

531
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,558
pamphlet and told me we were going to

532
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:15,720
use his controllers I was kind of

533
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:17,319
against it but it wasn't it wasn't my

534
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,360
dog and pony show so I had to do were

535
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:21,240
you hand watering at the time no no no

536
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:22,959
no he actually hired me he was hand

537
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,000
watering he was handw he was handing

538
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,919
watering posit with this big you know

539
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,038
Coco on a on a on a on a pallet with

540
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,840
caster

541
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:31,960
on this makeshift stuff you know and he

542
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:35,639
wanted to get

543
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:38,000
automated since my first grow in 1996

544
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,480
James I was automated Intermatic baby

545
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,759
Intermatic with you know automatic

546
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,159
drippers there's no [ __ ] I was going to

547
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:44,919
hold I think it's important to learn how

548
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:46,120
to hand water in the beginning like you

549
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:48,799
got to get away from it there's no way

550
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:50,399
to do it I was a contractor I was a

551
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:54,000
contractor

552
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,280
we [ __ ] see here counting at 10 you know

553
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,359
multiple times a day it's just not going

554
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:59,279
to happen so we automated everything me

555
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:02,119
from back then I you know I you know

556
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:03,599
somebody showed me a grow and I said I

557
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:04,959
can do that I can do it better in my

558
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:07,038
mind obviously I didn't see I didn't

559
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,840
voice that right but uh you know you

560
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:11,519
walk into this girls and but you know in

561
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:12,959
their defense they're not contractors

562
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:15,240
they they're not they're not

563
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,400
construction savvy so they do the best

564
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,798
that they can what they got but as soon

565
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,000
as I walk into this place okay I'll

566
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:21,839
change that I'll change that I'm just

567
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
looking around in my mind going I'm not

568
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:25,079
going to do this don't do that that can

569
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,079
be the B better yeah and eventually you

570
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:29,038
you have an automated system you know it

571
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:31,158
was in armatic but it's it still work

572
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:32,759
turn on and off turn on and off yeah and

573
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:34,200
that's why I was so against trow Master

574
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:36,440
because I had this little controller

575
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,240
that was smaller than Intermatic time

576
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:41,120
clock and it did everything I'm like you

577
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,759
[ __ ] kidding me I'm I'm not the most

578
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:45,759
um you know um technology Savvy guy and

579
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:48,440
I'm like I was scared of it did you use

580
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:50,798
50 gallon drums to build your stock tank

581
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,159
back in the day you just have a we uh we

582
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:55,720
used um it wasn't there weren't drums

583
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:58,320
because I I recirculated feed back then

584
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:00,640
so so to do it the easiest way so things

585
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:04,119
wouldn't break is um we had a pump in

586
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:08,038
these low shallow like you know 16inch

587
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:11,000
60 gallon um res Wars that sat sat

588
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:13,240
underneath a long table and we top top

589
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,480
drip feed to a gutter and then the

590
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,679
gutter back gravity back into into the

591
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,880
reservoir and we were circulated yeah so

592
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,360
you really only have to um you know uh

593
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,799
rely on one pump and one timer you know

594
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:26,158
to uh to to activate that it was

595
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:27,879
actually you know it was it was

596
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,679
technologically you know at that for

597
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,559
that time you know high tech for that

598
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,440
time but it was it was simple to the

599
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:35,240
point that you know it wasn't going to

600
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,400
break I mean intermatic timer on off

601
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,880
like a sprinkler outside on off on off

602
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,360
pretty simple yeah those ball valves

603
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,320
were pretty simple and I remember my

604
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:46,558
buddy at his

605
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:48,079
grow uh we we showed up but he had the

606
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:50,759
the float valve to fill up the 50

607
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:52,759
gallons big problem and the the the

608
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:54,359
float valve didn't work and the whole

609
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:55,960
room is flooded oh yes it's not when

610
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:56,839
it's going to flood you know not if it's

611
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:00,798
going to flood but when it's going to

612
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:02,720
flood it's uh we also had when we built

613
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:05,480
grow rooms in Florida when you know the

614
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,839
guy that taught me we used to build sub

615
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:11,319
FL so uh we we did a sub Flor we pitched

616
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:14,158
it and then we used back then we used to

617
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:16,240
use um shower pan liners when they put

618
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,440
underneath a shower in a in in a second

619
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,278
story home you know and then they put

620
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,278
concrete and then they put the tile on

621
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:24,798
it so we used to glue the shower pan

622
00:21:22,278 --> 00:21:27,679
liners that would uh go on the on the on

623
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:29,440
the on the pitch floor up the wall and

624
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,880
then we was some hearty Hardy Board that

625
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,360
was painted you know the first one

626
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,799
wasn't painted and they got mold e and

627
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:35,079
said okay we got to paint them we

628
00:21:33,798 --> 00:21:37,000
painted you know the outside of them and

629
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:39,639
then the inside of them were moldy so we

630
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
painted all the way around when you know

631
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,240
the the shower pain liner went up the

632
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,400
wall hardy hardy plank on the side and

633
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:47,200
then we foam the whole rooms and then we

634
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,559
the first ones was just the the closo

635
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,720
foam aluminum and then we started

636
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:51,759
painting them and stuff like that so we

637
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:54,640
got better it was a progression yeah we

638
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:57,000
graduated with uh using TPO which is a a

639
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,600
roofing roofing membrane that needs 500

640
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,159
Degrees to to to seal it together wow

641
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:02,639
and then from there we went to just

642
00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:04,120
through Straight you know you know the

643
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,799
the rolling benches and stuff like that

644
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:10,158
but so back to that is uh if something

645
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:11,359
ever bursted it wouldn't flood the house

646
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,480
because there was a drain at the corner

647
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:15,038
that would send it to the outside of the

648
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,558
of the Garden or whatever right of the

649
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:18,599
house do you guys use wood rolling

650
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:19,960
benches back in the day or did you even

651
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:21,158
from the beginning no no from the

652
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,759
beginning like I said from the beginning

653
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:24,919
we had a s floor and we started with um

654
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:25,960
I think it were like one one gallon pots

655
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:30,278
that were

656
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:33,480
um call do the hydrogen hydrogen and

657
00:22:30,278 --> 00:22:35,400
then a 3-inch Cube inside the the that

658
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:38,000
that the one gallon pot with hydrogen

659
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:40,400
and with top feed and feed to waste feed

660
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,720
to waste so we go on the on on the

661
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:46,400
shower pan liner work its way down to

662
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,679
the the drain and and go outside yeah

663
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,840
then when uh when when I met the guy uh

664
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:53,000
the qan guy that um that I bought the

665
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:54,240
mango from he show me these benches that

666
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
they they had a little bit of benches

667
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,120
he's the one that showed me the benches

668
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,640
with the gutter and uh they had 2x4s on

669
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:03,479
cinder blocks yeah with a gutter and

670
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,440
then they had soft hose that would go

671
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,919
like this in between leech trays you

672
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,120
know Dutch Le trays you know pitched at

673
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,320
an angle uh and they had the little

674
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:14,239
little L's that you put into the Le tray

675
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:16,399
so yeah so I'm looking at this thing I'm

676
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,759
trying to absorb as much as possible

677
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,880
because I don't you don't get to take

678
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:21,839
pictures you only get to be there once

679
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:24,039
you know or they tell you whatever it is

680
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:25,959
and then um I said well I'm not going to

681
00:23:24,038 --> 00:23:27,960
use bricks I'm going to use legs and

682
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,880
then uh I'm not going to use this hose

683
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,720
that's going to go like this cuz you

684
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,360
lose pressure put a pipe down the back

685
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:36,038
of it and then offshoots and then uh

686
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:38,119
spaghetti spaghetti drippers so while

687
00:23:36,038 --> 00:23:39,278
you're evaluating this this girl as as

688
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:41,199
you're as they're telling you about it

689
00:23:39,278 --> 00:23:43,000
or you're or you're looking at it and

690
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,440
then uh before you know when they look

691
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,599
at your stuff it's like [ __ ] I should

692
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:49,480

693
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:51,359

00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:01,158
free labor from those guys that were

755
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:03,200
staying at the farm and they helped me

756
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:05,720
oh sh de construct de construct the

757
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,798
3,000 ft building and put it back to

758
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,519
normal because I had to sell that

759
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:10,038
property oh wow I had to sell that

760
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:12,839
property so I did constructed everything

761
00:26:10,038 --> 00:26:16,240
I sold everything that was that was not

762
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:18,639
strapped down M and then I kept a 16 uh

763
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,679
16 lighter as a as a as a comeback hit

764
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,000
cuz like I said I thought I was going to

765
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,120
jail so right I kept a 16 lighter that I

766
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,440
put in a in a in a warehouse for like

767
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:28,558
three years or four years waiting for

768
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:31,000
back then it was a good time to do it 16

769
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:32,798
lighter yes yeah that was the comeback

770
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,319
hit you I can come back with 16 lights

771
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:36,918
and and build a future from there

772
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:39,720
totally now maybe

773
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:41,159
not don't know it be tough itd be tough

774
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,399
I can probably just you know probably

775
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:43,919
just pay the bills you know I don't know

776
00:26:42,398 --> 00:26:45,359
about a comeback but you can probably

777
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,840
survive you could probably survive if

778
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:48,558
you goow good in enough flour if you do

779
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:49,918

780
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:51,519
new technology you can get three pounds

781
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,600
of light of good flour I mean we were

782
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:57,759

00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:10,038
been talking about that for a long time

788
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,759

792
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:21,158
even care if it's 10% yield you know I

793
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:22,599
think it pay for itself it's going to

794
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:25,159
make the quality better I've been doing

795
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:27,359
since the place that I got rated at I've

796

them up top and I wasn't I don't think

802
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,320
that I think the LEDs were almost there

803
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:45,158
they really weren't quite what they are

804
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:46,720

these things are cool what am I going to

807
00:27:48,038 --> 00:27:52,759
do with them and then um they had the

808
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,720
cops or three cobs I forget the wattage

809
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:55,798
and it just says you know what I'm going

810
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,919
to put him on the side of the [ __ ]

811
00:27:55,798 --> 00:28:01,558
walls nice so I lined up all these rooms

812
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:04,038
with with lights like every so often and

813

00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:19,319
punch and and and I grew it but anyway

854
00:29:17,558 --> 00:29:21,000
back to the LEDs the LEDs I mean I

855
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:22,519
remember I but a purple punch almost as

856
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,558
big as this coming out of the rock like

857
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:26,919
this and it's like are you kidding me

858
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:28,519
but then I called Pacific FL concerts

859
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:30,000
and I order more I paid for these next

860
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:33,079
time and then I just lined up the whole

861
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,398
two sides wow and then I dropped

862
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:37,599
HPS bulbs in the center of the aisles

863
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:39,239
and I caged them because people you know

864
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:40,278
guys or or girls were were burning

865
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,278
themselves in the shoulders because they

866
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:43,919
were touching were hot oh I bet and then

867
00:29:42,278 --> 00:29:46,919
the heels just went through the roof it

868
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:50,919
was just crazy uh because I had I had

869
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:54,080
upgraded from um standard HPS to these

870
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:56,278
and then I added this side lighting um

871
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:57,839
that was on the outside walls yeah and

872
00:29:56,278 --> 00:30:00,519
then the drop walls on the S and it was

873
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:01,918
just it was just massive massive

874
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:04,038
everything's getting an even amount of

875
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,600
ppfd it was just tons of light I don't

876
00:30:04,038 --> 00:30:07,119
know what the [ __ ] ppfd back was back

877
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:08,798
then you mean but it was just tons of

878
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:12,199
light and it just and I just knew that

879
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:14,119
it worked and then uh later on after I

880
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:17,840
think it was

881
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:19,558
2018 or Beginnings to 2019 2019 I think

882
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:22,278
it was after I came back from Oregon

883
00:30:19,558 --> 00:30:24,278
yeah I built there amazing two-car

884
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:25,079
garage for the guys these guys in Santa

885
00:30:24,278 --> 00:30:27,919
Rosa

886
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:29,918
California and uh I called the guy um

887
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,200

888
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:34,960

00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,760
I can erase up and down in the aisles

894
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,759
because right the other place was just

895
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:48,440
long and it was just two rows so I could

896
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:50,879
put them on the outside but this one was

897
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:53,640
several rows and you got to work in the

898
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,080

you out you know so we we'll do some

901
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,080
strips so I kind of did some drawings

902
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,000
and I still have those drawings that

903
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:05,519

906
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:09,638
hash guy and that was his nickname you

907
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,240
know wook you know King wook so we

908
00:31:09,638 --> 00:31:13,678
called him King wook um so anyway u i I

909
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,440
designed these panels and then I went to

910
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,399
a fabricator in town he got this piece

911
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,000
of aluminum metal you know I gave him

912
00:31:17,398 --> 00:31:21,798
the dimensions he made and then uh you

913
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,839
know I glued these these the I think

914
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:28,558
were 100 100 watt sticks with Samsung

915
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:30,678
LEDs um and I put them on there with

916
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:33,240
this with this tape that would allow the

917
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:34,639
heat to to go into the metal and I built

918
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,278
these things and he sent me the whole

919
00:31:34,638 --> 00:31:37,798
kit to be able to hook them up and then

920
00:31:36,278 --> 00:31:40,398
we had sidelights that would go up and

921
00:31:37,798 --> 00:31:42,398
down wow and that place Crush too for a

922
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:44,038
two-car garage [ __ ] I parked the range

923
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:45,479
on the outside of the other the house so

924
00:31:44,038 --> 00:31:48,679
the light just goes up and down nice and

925
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:51,319
slow no no no you you put it in in place

926
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:53,960
you know in in the in the walls it was

927
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:56,038
only one-sided it was fixed to the wall

928
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:58,240
but in the aisles yeah you would drop it

929
00:31:56,038 --> 00:32:00,359
you you know you you leave it there but

930
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,079
then if you had to go service dial then

931
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:04,199
you got a pulley You' pull them out of

932
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:06,240
the way you spray the you spread the

933
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,720
rolling benches and then you go service

934
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,480
you go defoliate water you know whatever

935
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,038
you whatever you want to do you know

936

yeah um pick and then when you're done

937
00:32:12,038 --> 00:32:15,720
with the aisle you uh you drop the

938
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:17,080
lights and then close the benches and

939
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,839
then go to the next one and do the same

940
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:21,879
thing yeah and uh that that garage is

941
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:23,678
actually operating to this day really

942
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:28,360
and when I built it back in 20 see we're

943
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:29,639
2023 now 2018 people uh

well they didn't call well they called

945
00:32:29,638 --> 00:32:32,278
him through my Instagram what an idiot I

946
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:33,359
can't believe he's spending that money

947
00:32:32,278 --> 00:32:35,159
he's going to get busted it's going to

948
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:37,479

949
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:39,519
was still a rat at that time yeah you

950
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,278
know you hear it all and then guess what

951
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,880
silly [ __ ] 2023 and they're still

952
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:46,480
operating

953
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:48,159
yeah I feel you I feel you they're

954
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,360
number

955
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:53,519
funny yeah man but yeah that's great and

956
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:55,240
so with the lights what makes your light

957
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:56,480
so special because I feel like you have

958
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:59,200
a special light that's different than

959
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,639
other people's light lights um at first

960
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,360
our lights were special because they had

961
00:33:00,638 --> 00:33:04,678
the right spectrum and they had the the

962
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:06,959
the best diodes in the market yeah uh

963
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:08,880
and the controllability is second to

964
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,880
none um the cats out of the bag

965
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,440
everybody knows you know what what what

966
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,080
good diodes are what bad diodes are

967
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:16,639
everybody knows that lm301 BS were the

968
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:19,158
were were the best di at that time

969
00:33:16,638 --> 00:33:21,319
they're not anymore they are uh there's

970
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:23,240
an H there's evos but they're so

971
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:25,759
expensive nowadays that it's just not

972
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:28,599
commercially viable to go to those to

973
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:30,638
those um di because the difference is

974
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:33,359
not that much you know maybe for a small

975
00:33:30,638 --> 00:33:36,119
manufacturer lights it is but not for

976
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:39,158
for a bigger company uh the osram Reds

977
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:42,319
is what we use but uh controllability is

978
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:43,399
King and uh people started to catch on

979
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:45,480
that you know you want to be able to

980
00:33:43,398 --> 00:33:48,439
control the the the deep red and or

981
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:52,278
control the far red uh so they started

982
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:55,038
adding that but um to this day there's

983
00:33:52,278 --> 00:33:57,440
not a combination of controller and

984
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:59,720
light that work as good as the

985
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,960
trollmaster Hydrox Pro with the th gr

986
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:04,519
LED lights yeah um now our lights have

987
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:07,278
four spectrums and they're all can be

988
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:10,280
individually adjusted to your liking and

989
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:12,280
strain dependent uh as you saw yesterday

990
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:15,040
when I brought you through uh when when

991
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:18,240
you stopped by uh our plays I show you

992
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:20,960
the the test that we're doing um a lot

993
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:22,838
of times people read Google or read

994
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,599
books or whatever it is and they get

995
00:34:22,838 --> 00:34:26,759
information and then you go to the next

996
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:28,440
story it contradicts what you just read

997
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,000
right uh and that was the issue with me

998
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:32,358
for this last four years that I took a

999
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,639
Hiatus from from growing um I was

1000
00:34:32,358 --> 00:34:37,398
selling LEDs and I knew there were

1001
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:39,320
really good good LEDs you know um but I

1002
00:34:37,398 --> 00:34:41,358
didn't really play with them myself

1003
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,960
because I didn't have a personal grow so

1004
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:45,039
I'm just starting to actually put all

1005
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,960
this stuff into into into uh I'm

1006
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:48,918
implementing all these tests myself

1007
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,398
because I'm I'm a kind of person I I

1008
00:34:48,918 --> 00:34:53,358
want to do it right I want to prove it

1009
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:54,480
to myself and um all these things that

1010
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:55,878
I've been you know they've been telling

1011
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,599
me that you know the the far red you

1012
00:34:55,878 --> 00:35:00,039
know was stretch was short short and

1013
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:02,680
will uh will take off time so I'll find

1014
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:04,719
and dandy but I need to do it so I can

1015
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:06,679
see it for myself believe it and then I

1016
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:08,719
can teach people about it and tell them

1017
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:11,118
how to do it so the first test that

1018
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:13,519
we're we doing yesterday is we we you

1019
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:14,640
seen it pretty dark on I wanted I want

1020
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:16,639
you to stay there when the lights went

1021
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:18,319
off so you could say wow okay yeah yeah

1022
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:19,799
there's far red here and it's not really

1023
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,640
light polluting any anything in the

1024
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,920
center no um so it was important for me

1025
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:26,118
to show you that so you know five

1026
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,800
minutes of of far red after dark and

1027
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:30,160
then the opposite side at 30 minutes

1028
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:33,519
after after Darkness you know that that

1029
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:35,719
the red stay on mhm and um it seems like

1030
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:37,199
it it shaved two weeks of a nine weeks

1031
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:39,519
train well it looks like something's

1032
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:41,799
going on there for sure for sure for

1033
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:42,719
sure so uh what we started doing I you

1034
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,880
know we're going to do this the right

1035
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:47,118
way what we're going to do is we're

1036
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:50,200
going to cut tops of somewhat the same

1037
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:52,720
size same height away from the light in

1038
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:54,279
in the five minute after dark the the

1039
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:55,799
control subject and then the 30 minutes

1040
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:58,640
after dark and then we're going to label

1041
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:00,960
them okay this one was it you know uh 50

1042
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:02,559
days and three days later do it again

1043
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,039
and then another three days later do it

1044
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:06,000
again and then we're going to send all

1045
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:08,239
that stuff to testing we also look at

1046
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,679
them through the loop and the loops are

1047
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:11,719
are showing that that that it's pretty

1048
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:13,440
much done but uh at the end of the day

1049
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:15,639
you know um the test is going to tell

1050
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,559
you the the the truth I think it's it's

1051
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:19,039
a

1052
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:20,480
cbga that's going to tell you if if if

1053
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:22,079
that plant if you left meat on the bone

1054
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,639
per se or not you know when it's fully

1055
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:26,960
mature so at the end of the day roughly

1056
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:29,799
um we have to take that room to 63

1057
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:33,000
because the majority of the room was set

1058
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:35,240
for that so even if if if these two rows

1059
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,880
get twoo dark as that get two Amber or

1060
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:40,679
whatever what's going to have to happen

1061
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:43,760
um and the environmentals in that room

1062
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:45,199
were set to finish in nine weeks yeah uh

1063
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,760
so then we'll send those for testing the

1064
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:50,078
next round we're going to do it to where

1065
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:51,720
we expand our our test subjects to five

1066
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:53,599
racks from one side five racks in

1067
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:55,598
another there's 13 racks in that room

1068
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:56,960
and then three racks are going to be in

1069
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:59,240
the that are going to be the control

1070
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,400
control and then we're going to run that

1071
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:03,439
room to finish the environmentals we're

1072
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,079
going to run it to finish in seven weeks

1073
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,720
so it should actually what you seen

1074
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:08,599
yesterday it actually should be farther

1075
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:10,279
along because now we're we're we're

1076
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:12,880
making the room colder faster we're

1077
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:15,359
going to we're going to drop the EC uh

1078
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:18,000
you know um earlier yeah and then we're

1079
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:20,679
going to uh you know lower the ppfd and

1080
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,318
the light you know earlier so actually

1081
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:23,960
what we saw yesterday should be actually

1082
00:37:22,318 --> 00:37:26,639
probably even farther along and even

1083
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:28,599
more Amber than than what we we sawest

1084
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:32,639
yesterday because the environmentals

1085
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:34,359
followed the the the timeline right yeah

1086
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:37,118
it's really impressive and it's really

1087
00:37:34,358 --> 00:37:38,480
it's it's very obvious it's not yeah

1088
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,039
that's the thing is it's very obvious

1089
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,240
it's you can't argue the fact and the

1090
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:43,639
funny thing is like when you you know

1091
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:44,919
like uh the the other day uh you know

1092
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:46,799
the director cultivation was in there

1093
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:49,880
and then you know the the the ppfd is

1094
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,880
down on the on on the on the LEDs and

1095
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,960
you can't really dim an LED by the way

1096
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:58,318
you can't dim an LED the way that you

1097
00:37:53,960 --> 00:38:00,519
Dim an LED is by um

1098
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:02,838
it's flashes LED flashes okay so when

1099
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:06,358
it's on 100% it's just on and when you

1100
00:38:02,838 --> 00:38:08,119
start doing let's say 90 90% it flashes

1101
00:38:06,358 --> 00:38:11,119
off for super quick time and it comes

1102
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:13,720
back on the lower the dim the off cycle

1103
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:15,200
is is longer yeah then the on cycle so

1104
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:16,838
that's how you Dim an LED believe it or

1105
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:19,199
not so it's not really dimming it is

1106
00:38:16,838 --> 00:38:21,358
you're talking to it a morse code per se

1107
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:23,960
so then when you're videoing you see all

1108
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:25,920
these little lines yeah in in in the

1109
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,559
phone but then so I told the director

1110
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,318
ofation turn these up to 100 cuz I want

1111
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:31,159
to do a video because the lines were

1112
00:38:29,318 --> 00:38:33,039
messing up with the video the color and

1113
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:34,838
know you're doing this video and then

1114
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:35,920
their representation on the phone is not

1115
00:38:34,838 --> 00:38:37,239
the same as your eyesight when you're

1116
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,838
seeing this these things are [ __ ]

1117
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:40,759
done they're purple and then you look

1118
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:42,559
over here these are these are white you

1119
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:44,160
know still got white hairs and stuff

1120
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:46,000
like that it's more of a visual thing

1121
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:48,118
when you're there and you know it tells

1122
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,039
you wow these things really working

1123
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:51,880
right so um so it's going to be

1124
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:53,880
interesting to uh to do it the next time

1125
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,480
you know and uh and and really be able

1126
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,079
to have the science behind it and give

1127
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:00,440
people the feedback

1128
00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:02,000
uh and on on this totally well you've

1129
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,400
been doing a bunch of data collection

1130
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,440
sounds like from talking to you guys you

1131
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,480
guys collecting data on phenotypes and

1132
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,159
you're also doing some pheno hunting yes

1133
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,679
we're doing some pheno hunting uh you

1134
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:12,199
know something that I'm not used to

1135
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:14,318
doing this is something new for me uh

1136
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:16,199
you're the expert on this on this on

1137
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:18,119
this field for sure very challenging

1138
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:19,960
this is the first like I said I've never

1139
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:21,800
I think I in my life I probably count

1140
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:24,159
one hand how many how many seeds I

1141
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,839
popped until this last run I went from

1142
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:29,879
like five seeds in my life to like you

1143
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:31,519
know 520 seats wow so it was it was

1144
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,960
definitely it's an adventure it's

1145
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:34,920
definitely cool and then seeing these

1146
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,480
these these different fenos like oh my

1147
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,720
God this one's tall and it's busting out

1148
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,400
this one over here looks like a bonsai

1149
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:41,719
tree yeah uh it's like H holy crap well

1150
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,960
then you're doing the initial growing

1151
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:45,959
from seed the first run so your next run

1152
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,480
is going to be completely different so

1153
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,159
some of the stuff that looks a certain

1154
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:51,280
way when you grow up from the first

1155
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:52,559
clonal generation it could be a

1156
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,400
completely different expression you

1157
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:56,799
could lose chps you could gain chps you

1158
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,800
could you just get different things as

1159
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,440
the plant matures and uh well sometimes

1160
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,318
they get better which is I ask a lot of

1161
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,119
questions to to to to breeders like I

1162
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:07,679
said this is not my field so yeah um by

1163
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:09,000
no means am I nowhere near a [ __ ]

1164
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:11,239
expert or anything like that so I ask

1165
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,599
questions and what everybody says just

1166
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:15,159
best just clone everything in there yeah

1167
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:16,920
you know put it to the side you know

1168
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:18,559
flip those see which ones are your males

1169
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,639
then go back to your clone room and kill

1170
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:20,719
those or if you want to keep them

1171
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:22,920
whatever you know but you know get rid

1172
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:24,399
of them and then once you're left you

1173
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,800
know what everything is that you think

1174
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,639
is females then plant those that way

1175
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,839
they all run at the same time right you

1176
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:31,719
know it's like you know you have you

1177
00:40:29,838 --> 00:40:33,358
know 400 plants this one's small there

1178
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:34,759
take less less water this one St is

1179
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:36,000
going to take a lot less water when

1180
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,760
you're an automated system it doesn't

1181
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,239
work that way yeah so it's best if they

1182
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,480
all grow at the same speed and then uh

1183
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:43,799
obvious going have to keep an eye just

1184
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:45,800
in case something throws a banana um but

1185
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:48,640
um they say that it gives you a better

1186
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:50,560
representation of what that that plant

1187
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:53,159
or that feno is going to be once you're

1188
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:55,000
start cloning it so I don't know you

1189
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:56,078
tell me me I like getting rid of that

1190
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,318
first generation because I don't want to

1191
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,839
see something that I can't have okay so

1192
00:40:58,318 --> 00:41:02,199
I like getting rid of the SE me

1193
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:03,920
personally that's just I think that

1194
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:06,118
growing from seed is great outdoors and

1195
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,440
I think there's obviously growing from

1196
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:08,960
seed is great you'll get bigger plants

1197
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,400
you get a tap rot but if you're looking

1198
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,519
for what's the long-term expression

1199
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,318
because you're going to keep this alive

1200
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:15,440
in a clone form getting rid of that

1201
00:41:13,318 --> 00:41:17,119
first generation is okay perfect you

1202
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,119
gota and it saves you time so you don't

1203
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,680
have to grow that out to see it again

1204
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,318
now you get the first generation the

1205
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:23,559
second generation CU you really got to

1206
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:25,599
grow them out and you'll fall in love

1207
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:26,920
with some and then the next Generation

1208
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:28,400
you might fall in love with some others

1209
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,639
and then third generation it's like the

1210
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,680
ones that are still amazing those are

1211
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:34,078
usually the ones you go for sick Okay

1212
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:35,078
cool so I guess I'm I'm I'm in the right

1213
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:36,119
direction somebody you're going the

1214
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:38,640
right direction somebody Point me the

1215
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:40,920
right way it's yeah and it's all fun

1216
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:43,159
it's all like this it's a very like very

1217
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,400
fun the exploration side of it like

1218
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:45,519
where you're exploring different plants

1219
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,440
and you have a chance of winning the

1220
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:48,719
lottery cuz technically it's a big

1221
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,599
lottery we're all playing the lottery

1222
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:51,559
trying to hit that one here the lottery

1223
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:54,559
for

1224
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:55,799
sure as expensive as a lottery too yeah

1225
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:57,838
yeah but back to the L you have an

1226
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,920
expensive facility you have the the most

1227
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:01,880
expensive the most built out facility

1228
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,639
I've ever been it's like yeah it's the

1229
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:06,000
Lamborghini of facilities but there's a

1230
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:09,000
reason for that you know I know that I

1231
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,800
went over and Beyond yeah uh in in in

1232
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,239
building this thing but the reason why

1233
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,119
this facility is so nice is because we

1234
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:16,479
use it for tours when I was selling

1235
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,280
controllers and selling lights oh yeah

1236
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,480
it's the best the best sales pitch you

1237
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,359
don't have to tell anybody you just show

1238
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,400
them come on by yeah come on by you're

1239
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:23,799
looking to build something you want to

1240
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,680
see how it's done you know come on come

1241
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:27,519
on check it out the funny thing is that

1242
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:29,358
um like you were saying about the LEDs

1243
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:32,318
you know um you know I started and I got

1244
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:34,318
sidetracked um the controllability on on

1245
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:36,039
these LEDs is like no other and then

1246
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:37,920
while I was building that facility a lot

1247
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:40,759
of a lot of ideas that the owner of

1248
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,880
trollmaster had and combined with my

1249
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:45,160
ideas we developed a lot of products

1250
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,200
while we were building that that space

1251
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:49,318
right Co did throw a wrench on our on on

1252
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:50,679
our spoke and slowed us down but uh

1253
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:52,318
there was a lot of products that were

1254
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:53,558
developed while the facility was being

1255
00:42:52,318 --> 00:42:55,199
built like you know the lifters or

1256
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:57,119
something that he had in his in his mind

1257
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:59,318
for a long time we actually built

1258
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:02,920
prototypes and I tested them tested them

1259
00:42:59,318 --> 00:43:05,279
and then gave them feedback and um even

1260
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:07,119
like the the there was a room that I

1261
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,440
actually changed lights without even

1262
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:09,920
growing in there because there was a new

1263
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:11,280
model that came out and I wanted it and

1264
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,880
I wanted to show it because you know

1265
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,000
that the facility is there is to sell

1266
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,838
product and me sell products for for for

1267
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,639
troll Master showing the troll Master's

1268
00:43:16,838 --> 00:43:20,239
potential so I Ed the troll Master too

1269
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:22,558
in some of my I've used it in the past

1270
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:24,199
and it's beautiful in the sense that you

1271
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:25,680
can control the lights too you can dim

1272
00:43:24,199 --> 00:43:27,838
your lights with the trollmaster on your

1273
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:29,399
phone correct I want to dim the lights

1274
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:31,358
and down to 1% you can dim our lights

1275
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,800
down to 1% and 1% increments which a lot

1276
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:35,199
of lights you can only dim down to 40%

1277
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:37,160
well I never thought of the troll Master

1278
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:39,358

Master knowledge on all the controllers

1356
00:46:10,838 --> 00:46:14,960
and there's a couple reasons for that

1357
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:17,000
they're young they're very Tech savy

1358
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:19,000
super tech savy information [ __ ]

1359
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,480
buttons like dude slow the [ __ ] down

1360
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,960
dude you know well let me figure it out

1361
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,960
and I'll tell you after I'm like no talk

1362
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:25,599
to me through it he's just like you know

1363
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:27,240
pushing fingers it was aggravating and

1364
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:29,440
then he laugh he thinks it's funny but

1365
00:46:27,239 --> 00:46:31,639
but whatever and then and then the other

1366
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,679
thing is also I I feel like I tell

1367
00:46:31,639 --> 00:46:33,759
people all the time I walk around the

1368
00:46:32,679 --> 00:46:35,358
building go I don't even grow eat

1369
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:38,119
anymore I grow a business I grow emails

1370
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:39,679
that's what I do I'm you know I do make

1371
00:46:38,119 --> 00:46:41,640
sure that I get out of my office and I

1372
00:46:39,679 --> 00:46:43,838
walk the rooms all the time I'm I'm at

1373
00:46:41,639 --> 00:46:45,159
the facility every day I get involved

1374
00:46:43,838 --> 00:46:47,799
but at the end of the day you know I run

1375
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:50,118
a business I you know if there's if if

1376
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:52,400
there's an issue that they can't take

1377
00:46:50,119 --> 00:46:54,440
care of her dress then then I go and and

1378
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,599
try to figure out but they for the most

1379
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:57,599
part take care of that stuff and then

1380
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:00,079
that kid came into his own with uh with

1381

it was the purple LEDs and the it was

1591
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:04,639
the worst butt ever the blurp yeah the

1592
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:07,199
blurp from that to where it is now as

1593
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:08,440
being the the main focus for most

1594
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:10,558
companies they're like okay we're doing

1595
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:12,798
LEDs they're cost effective all this

1596
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:15,960
where do you see the industry going in

1597
00:54:12,798 --> 00:54:18,280
you know five years 10 years the I think

1598
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:21,838
I we went over to that

1599
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:24,798
um to that uh I call it a seminar where

1600
00:54:21,838 --> 00:54:26,400
where Bobby bags was talking about the

1601
00:54:24,798 --> 00:54:28,440
yeah connect event exactly that surger

1602
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,000
throw um and I went there just you know

1603
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:32,400
just check it out hear out what they

1604
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,880
have to say um one thing that we've been

1605
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:36,000
trying to work on for the last four

1606
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:37,358
years is is some kind of side lighting

1607
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,280
interner canopy lighting they call it

1608
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:41,440
inter canopy lighting yeah is something

1609
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:43,160
that's very hot uh I went to MJB last

1610
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:44,480
year and seen a bunch of it there the

1611
00:54:43,159 --> 00:54:46,759
side lighting or the inner canopy

1612
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:48,719
lighting back then it was side lighting

1613
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:51,319
was something that would work on yeah

1614
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:54,719
nowadays is uh is inner canopy lighting

1615
00:54:51,318 --> 00:54:56,358
um so it's not uh it's not um under

1616
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:59,239
canip Li on canopy lightning sits at the

1617
00:54:56,358 --> 00:55:01,239
bottom of your tray yeah um pretty much

1618
00:54:59,239 --> 00:55:04,118
level with the top of your medium and

1619
00:55:01,239 --> 00:55:06,000
and the light shine shines up M so uh

1620
00:55:04,119 --> 00:55:08,358
the way that the light goes up into the

1621
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,760
bottom of the canopy and then the top of

1622
00:55:08,358 --> 00:55:12,440
the leaves well the light shines up to

1623
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:14,160
the bottom of the canopy it reflects and

1624
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:17,119
then it hits the top of your leaf and

1625
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:18,519
that's called aaal U because it's

1626
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:20,440
reflecting it's hitting the bottom of

1627
00:55:18,519 --> 00:55:21,559
your by bottom of leaves but the plants

1628
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,960
are absorbing the light that's

1629
00:55:21,559 --> 00:55:26,599
reflecting from the bottom of the leaves

1630
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:30,318
in the canopy yeah um we wanted to go a

1631
00:55:26,599 --> 00:55:31,680
step better above and beyond so we we

1632
00:55:30,318 --> 00:55:35,480
put our

1633
00:55:31,679 --> 00:55:37,838
lights up in the canopy m a diode has

1634
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:41,280
180 degree I mean sorry 120 degree

1635
00:55:37,838 --> 00:55:43,639
spread yeah um and we went both sides so

1636
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,440
then that's called um Ada axio because

1637
00:55:43,639 --> 00:55:47,118
the light shining on top of the leaf so

1638
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:49,679
it's more direct it's more

1639
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:50,960
efficient um we've had a couple of

1640
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:52,199
prototypes and I thought the last

1641
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:54,720
prototype was the one that we were going

1642
00:55:52,199 --> 00:55:56,318
to go with which I showed you and uh at

1643
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:59,239
the last last second you know sometimes

1644
00:55:56,318 --> 00:56:01,759
I I leak Intel and

1645
00:55:59,239 --> 00:56:03,399
purpose to uh to see what the peanut

1646
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:05,160
gallery has to say you know you got

1647
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:06,559
something to say there's always op

1648
00:56:05,159 --> 00:56:08,480
there's always P you know and then and

1649
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:09,920
you you evaluate that information that

1650
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:11,400
comes in you know everybody's always got

1651
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:13,318
a has got an idea how they're going to

1652
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:15,880
do it better and stuff like that but at

1653
00:56:13,318 --> 00:56:18,279
the end of the day it's it's Intel that

1654
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:20,000
you take you evaluate and then you you

1655
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:23,280
you work from there so uh this was going

1656
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,159
to be the last prototype and I ended up

1657
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:27,039
kicking like a little girl and saying no

1658
00:56:25,159 --> 00:56:28,279
we need to change it and you know by the

1659
00:56:27,039 --> 00:56:29,880
time this thing this thing's been

1660
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:31,680
through projects you know there's a mold

1661
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:33,280
there's this there there there's

1662
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:35,480
thousands and thousands of dollars in

1663
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,680
time and hours right that's been put

1664
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:38,639
into this

1665
00:56:36,679 --> 00:56:41,279
project so they don't really want to

1666
00:56:38,639 --> 00:56:42,879
scrap it but um you know finally at the

1667
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,798
end of the day you know I take

1668
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:46,119
temperatures you know and you know with

1669
00:56:44,798 --> 00:56:47,838
you know Leaf temperatures are touching

1670
00:56:46,119 --> 00:56:49,960
these sinks and then you know some some

1671
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:50,960
Leaf might be having a little burnt I

1672
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:52,199
said we're going to you know I take

1673
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,240
pictures and I send they go we're going

1674
00:56:52,199 --> 00:56:56,118
to get picked for that we're going to

1675
00:56:53,239 --> 00:56:59,118
get Nick picked for that so um so then

1676
00:56:56,119 --> 00:57:01,720
we uh we decided to call the ICL 300s

1677
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:04,119
because it has a 300 degre spread of

1678
00:57:01,719 --> 00:57:05,480
light nice not just 180 but you know

1679
00:57:04,119 --> 00:57:07,119
they're going to go actually down and

1680
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:10,639
then all the way around right and you

1681
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:11,680
can stack our our lights so kind of

1682
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:13,038
touching based on what you think the

1683
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:15,798
future is because that's what the

1684
00:57:13,039 --> 00:57:17,640
original question was is I think Bobby

1685
00:57:15,798 --> 00:57:22,038
bags was correct that in in a couple of

1686
00:57:17,639 --> 00:57:24,358
years yeah people will have some kind of

1687
00:57:22,039 --> 00:57:25,359
inner or under canopy inter canopy

1688
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:28,920
lighting

1689
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:33,000
because to build another space cost a

1690
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:36,240
lot of money yeah um and you know the

1691
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:37,920
buildout the rent the time that you know

1692
00:57:36,239 --> 00:57:40,038
say if you have this space how can we

1693
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:42,280
squeeze more juice out of this fruit

1694
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:44,280
yeah you know what inner canopy lighting

1695
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:46,160
that is the [ __ ] Next Level so Justin

1696
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:49,880
our our mutual friend Justin apical

1697
00:57:46,159 --> 00:57:51,199
biotech uh he when I first met him he

1698
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:52,400
was talking about this stuff and he was

1699
00:57:51,199 --> 00:57:54,199
like you need to attach it to the

1700
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:56,119
trellis like it'll go up with the

1701
00:57:54,199 --> 00:57:57,358
trellis you know the lighting that goes

1702
00:57:56,119 --> 00:57:59,119
and I thought he was a little crazy

1703
00:57:57,358 --> 00:58:00,920
right I've heard every freaking

1704
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:03,240
suggestion oh totally no this is but

1705
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:05,159
this was 2018 and I was like this guy's

1706
00:58:03,239 --> 00:58:06,719
crazy a little bit you know cuz he has

1707
00:58:05,159 --> 00:58:07,719
crazy ideas yes he does he's very

1708
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:09,598
knowledgeable yeah he's super

1709
00:58:07,719 --> 00:58:11,439
knowledgeable he thinks outside the box

1710
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:13,920
he has some ideas where I'm like oh no

1711
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:14,880
and then now now like it's pretty you

1712
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,599
know I think it's going to be a

1713
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:19,400
standardized thing is eventually we'll

1714
00:58:16,599 --> 00:58:21,720
have 100% And especially for green

1715
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:23,280
houses I see the benefit even more than

1716
00:58:21,719 --> 00:58:25,598
for indoor indoor it's great you'll get

1717
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:27,359
more yield and stuff but if you can

1718
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:28,640
harden up those buds that are in the

1719
00:58:27,358 --> 00:58:30,000
greenhouse where you have supplemental

1720
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:31,639
lighting now you've got an indoor

1721
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,159
product right it looks like an indoor

1722
00:58:31,639 --> 00:58:35,558
product it'll help it'll help it'll help

1723
00:58:34,159 --> 00:58:38,960
increase it'll help to increase the

1724
00:58:35,559 --> 00:58:40,920
quality of like you know I I love

1725
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:43,760
sungrown too so I think it's like the

1726
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:45,920
perfect mix if we can do mix light a a

1727
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:48,079
little bit of mix light Little Mix

1728
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:50,240
Little Mix light yeah for for sure and I

1729
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:51,760
I just think that's like I said Bobby I

1730
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:53,838
think hit it hit it on the nose in in

1731
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:56,440
the future people are going to evaluate

1732
00:58:53,838 --> 00:58:59,078
wow I can get another 20 you know he's

1733
00:58:56,440 --> 00:59:01,400
he's right on numbers you know 15 to 25%

1734
00:58:59,079 --> 00:59:02,760
yeah increase uh and he was right on a

1735
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:05,599
lot of things that he said you know now

1736
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:06,960
you you know you have a a a buds that

1737
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:08,960
are that are purple you have a buds that

1738
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:12,199
are not you know they say purple or

1739
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:13,639
whatever color that's that's you know

1740
00:59:12,199 --> 00:59:15,159
color of the day or you know color of

1741
00:59:13,639 --> 00:59:16,358
the Year whatever and then you have your

1742
00:59:15,159 --> 00:59:17,759
bees and stuff like that and then when

1743
00:59:16,358 --> 00:59:19,838
you have under canopy lighting or inner

1744
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,640
canopy lighting everything becomes

1745
00:59:19,838 --> 00:59:23,719
unified uniform you know you got bigger

1746
00:59:21,639 --> 00:59:25,960
Buds and then the problem is going to be

1747
00:59:23,719 --> 00:59:27,598
is what it not a problem but everybody's

1748
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:29,519
going to is going to brag we have the

1749
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:30,318
best pre-rolls because it's all bud you

1750
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:32,798
know they don't know they're not going

1751
00:59:30,318 --> 00:59:33,960
to use the the micros yeah for pre-rolls

1752
00:59:32,798 --> 00:59:36,159
everybody right now everyone's using

1753
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:37,838
Smalls although some people like the

1754
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:39,679
guys over SF Canada their Smalls are

1755
00:59:37,838 --> 00:59:42,358
just as good as the big nugs you know I

1756
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:43,919
mean they burn clean all that [ __ ] y so

1757
00:59:42,358 --> 00:59:45,639
but but yeah it won't be like you won't

1758
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:47,559
get Smalls Smalls is going to be a thing

1759
00:59:45,639 --> 00:59:49,838
of the past I he was talking about 5%

1760
00:59:47,559 --> 00:59:51,519
and I get it like when when it's all

1761
00:59:49,838 --> 00:59:52,920
graded you know if you did it right and

1762
00:59:51,519 --> 00:59:54,199
you had the right genetics because

1763
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:56,798
that's very dependent on the genetics

1764
00:59:54,199 --> 00:59:59,798
too yep yep the good thing about our

1765
00:59:56,798 --> 01:00:01,400
inner canopy lights is that um single

1766
00:59:59,798 --> 01:00:02,960
tier you you run a little bit taller

1767
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:05,119
plant than you do in your double tier

1768
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:07,079
yeah uh our our inner canopy lights

1769
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:08,039
you'll be able to stack you know one on

1770
01:00:07,079 --> 01:00:09,640
top of each other so you're going to

1771
01:00:08,039 --> 01:00:11,119
have and they're going to shine up right

1772
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:13,199
so you're really going to have light

1773
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:15,240
from the tray yeah and you don't need a

1774
01:00:13,199 --> 01:00:18,798
ton of light so we're not talking about

1775
01:00:15,239 --> 01:00:20,598
wat 12 watt 60 60 watts per side it's

1776
01:00:18,798 --> 01:00:22,079
really it's really not not not that much

1777
01:00:20,599 --> 01:00:25,318
yeah but think about it if you have a

1778
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:28,160
five foot tall plant um you have light

1779
01:00:25,318 --> 01:00:30,599
from the top coming down yeah and

1780
01:00:28,159 --> 01:00:32,199
then and then you have a light bar

1781
01:00:30,599 --> 01:00:33,798
inside the canopy that's shining and

1782
01:00:32,199 --> 01:00:36,078
then you have another one up here you

1783
01:00:33,798 --> 01:00:38,358
have light from the bottom to the top so

1784
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:40,559
there is no maximum efficiency maximum

1785
01:00:38,358 --> 01:00:44,719
efficiency it also is going to require

1786
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:46,480
more uh more parts per million higher EC

1787
01:00:44,719 --> 01:00:47,679
potentially correct Y and he had a bunch

1788
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,719
of good information in there too

1789
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:50,358
additional you're going to have to feed

1790
01:00:48,719 --> 01:00:51,679
it more have to feed it more a little

1791
01:00:50,358 --> 01:00:53,078
bit more feed you know for sure

1792
01:00:51,679 --> 01:00:55,000
transpiration more transpiration a

1793
01:00:53,079 --> 01:00:56,160
little more humidity but that's because

1794
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,480
you can handle that you know you can add

1795
01:00:56,159 --> 01:01:00,358
a dehumidifier you can add you know a

1796
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:02,000
these serious dehumidifiers now that to

1797
01:01:00,358 --> 01:01:03,598
handle that kind of stuff yes and then

1798
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,400
obviously uh there's there's there's

1799
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:07,039
reheat also if people want wanted to go

1800
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:08,798
that way they can do use the reheat in

1801
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:10,280
in a in an AC unit if they wanted to do

1802
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:12,880
that too yeah so there's definitely

1803
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:13,920
options but I think I think the easiest

1804
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:16,599
way to

1805
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:18,318
increase your money in a current space

1806
01:01:16,599 --> 01:01:19,599
is going to be the inner canopy lighting

1807
01:01:18,318 --> 01:01:21,480
hands down instead of building another

1808
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:22,640
SP besides having good genetics besides

1809
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:25,199
having good genetics you know good

1810
01:01:22,639 --> 01:01:27,000
genetics goes we all know good gentics

1811
01:01:25,199 --> 01:01:28,558
everybody's genetics but but but having

1812
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:31,559
good gentics got to have good genetics

1813
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:33,160
it's everything 100% 100% you got to

1814
01:01:31,559 --> 01:01:34,798
have good it all starts from that seed

1815
01:01:33,159 --> 01:01:36,199
at some point in life but it starts from

1816
01:01:34,798 --> 01:01:37,599
having good genetics I mean if if you

1817
01:01:36,199 --> 01:01:40,199
don't have good

1818
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:42,599
genetics it's hard to get I you can't

1819
01:01:40,199 --> 01:01:43,838
get good weed out of shitty genetics it

1820
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:45,760
just doesn't you either got to have good

1821
01:01:43,838 --> 01:01:49,038
genetics start good seeds or you got to

1822
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:51,200
have friends that give you good genetics

1823
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:52,520
yeah there's somewhere along line

1824
01:01:51,199 --> 01:01:53,838
sometimes you cheat and you say hey man

1825
01:01:52,519 --> 01:01:55,239
what do you got and they go I got this

1826
01:01:53,838 --> 01:01:57,798
for you don't give it to anybody okay no

1827
01:01:55,239 --> 01:01:59,118
F yeah yeah you know totally and that

1828
01:01:57,798 --> 01:02:00,759
works and that works for yeah genetics

1829
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:02,400
is everything you know at the end of the

1830
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:03,559
day I feel like genetics is what it

1831
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,079
boils down too like we're in the

1832
01:02:03,559 --> 01:02:06,798
genetics race right now everybody's

1833
01:02:05,079 --> 01:02:08,400
trying to get their own new thing

1834
01:02:06,798 --> 01:02:09,759
there's so many noway just kind of crazy

1835
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,960
you know everybody like I said even if

1836
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,160
you're not a breeder you're you're an

1837
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:14,039
in-house guy and then you know you have

1838
01:02:12,159 --> 01:02:15,440
a little of pollen you have a reversal

1839
01:02:14,039 --> 01:02:17,400
plan and you go start touching I mean

1840
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:19,240
you might not be getting a jar of seeds

1841
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:21,519
like this but you know you get you get

1842
01:02:19,239 --> 01:02:22,919
you know you get you know 10 20 30 40 50

1843
01:02:21,519 --> 01:02:24,960
seeds out of a branch you know if you

1844
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:26,318
want to put pollen on a branch

1845
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,679
and then you're you're an in-house guy

1846
01:02:26,318 --> 01:02:29,400
you can get genetics there's just so

1847
01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:31,078
much of it well I was talking to one of

1848
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:33,119
my friends I was talking to Mojave

1849
01:02:31,079 --> 01:02:34,960
Richmond we were talking about cultivars

1850
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:38,000
and how many cultivars there are in the

1851
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:40,159
United States right now in in wck and

1852
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:43,119
there's somewhere between 35 and

1853
01:02:40,159 --> 01:02:44,440
5,000 different C different named

1854
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:47,440
cultivars it could be a lot of the same

1855
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:49,318
[ __ ] but and then worldwide 20,000

1856
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:52,880
different cultivars that's way more than

1857
01:02:49,318 --> 01:02:55,278
any other plant species that's been uh

1858
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:57,358
domesticated available for you know

1859
01:02:55,278 --> 01:02:59,318
commercial and and Retail you know what

1860
01:02:57,358 --> 01:03:00,519
I I don't I don't know if there correct

1861
01:02:59,318 --> 01:03:02,440
me if I'm wrong but I don't think that

1862
01:03:00,519 --> 01:03:06,519
there is there I don't know if any of

1863
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:09,480
you guys have sat down and made a a

1864
01:03:06,519 --> 01:03:12,519
forum page whatever internet page that

1865
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:13,838
shows every single name of strain

1866
01:03:12,519 --> 01:03:15,358
because I mean there's so many strains

1867
01:03:13,838 --> 01:03:17,199
nowaday that it's hard to come up with a

1868
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:19,119
name and I suck coming up with name it's

1869
01:03:17,199 --> 01:03:20,879
tough It's I suck coming up with names

1870
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:25,079
the director of cultivation that work

1871
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:26,519
for yeah chat gbt hey call it this but

1872
01:03:25,079 --> 01:03:27,760
uh the director cation that that works

1873
01:03:26,519 --> 01:03:29,679
for me he's great at coming up with

1874
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,839
names like [ __ ] just just spat that

1875
01:03:29,679 --> 01:03:32,519
out I've been thinking for three days

1876
01:03:30,838 --> 01:03:37,318
what to call something he just just spit

1877
01:03:32,519 --> 01:03:38,960
it out but um what happens seedfinder EU

1878
01:03:37,318 --> 01:03:40,599
is the place where you go for all the

1879
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:41,920
genetics it's the closest thing we

1880
01:03:40,599 --> 01:03:44,359
really have now that I think is an

1881
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:46,119
organized list of lineage interesting so

1882
01:03:44,358 --> 01:03:48,639
I got a question for you let's say you

1883
01:03:46,119 --> 01:03:50,920
cross two strains and you come up with a

1884
01:03:48,639 --> 01:03:54,000
name for something right and then XYZ

1885
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:55,960
person over there crosses same strings

1886
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,719
or two different strains uhhuh well

1887
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:59,480
let's go one one problem at a time they

1888
01:03:57,719 --> 01:04:01,558
say crosses the same strains and then

1889
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:04,760
causes the same thing by accident or

1890
01:04:01,559 --> 01:04:07,400
whatever it is so what takes president

1891
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:10,720
what takes president I mean this is this

1892
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:12,838
is the question of the of the year uh

1893
01:04:10,719 --> 01:04:14,239
you know because it happens all the time

1894
01:04:12,838 --> 01:04:15,759
people have the same come up with the

1895
01:04:14,239 --> 01:04:18,358
same name you know because there's so

1896
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:20,278
many names Black Betty for instance like

1897
01:04:18,358 --> 01:04:21,838
I named something Black Betty this other

1898
01:04:20,278 --> 01:04:23,599
[ __ ] guy named something Black Betty

1899
01:04:21,838 --> 01:04:25,519
too and it was probably someone else

1900
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:27,039
that named it before that it's like you

1901
01:04:25,519 --> 01:04:29,440
can kind of take credit for anything

1902
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:31,839
until you get it trademarked you ain't

1903
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:34,240
got [ __ ] yeah until you have a trademark

1904
01:04:31,838 --> 01:04:36,278
on you can't trademark strain either

1905
01:04:34,239 --> 01:04:38,399
anyway you the name the name kind of

1906
01:04:36,278 --> 01:04:40,559
like I get yeah but you can trademark

1907
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:42,559
the name in California you on a state

1908
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:44,039
level you can trademark stuff okay right

1909
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:45,400
but but there still I mean and that's

1910
01:04:44,039 --> 01:04:48,760
like if we're looking at it from a legal

1911
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:50,400
standpoint if we're talking about uh if

1912
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:51,480
we're talking about clout and all these

1913
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,599
other things that's a whole different

1914
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:57,079
thing because I can the perfect example

1915
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:59,200
is rain rbow runs uh can Organics came

1916
01:04:57,079 --> 01:05:00,960
out with rainbow runs I was working with

1917
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:03,000
Tim and Kyle and there's rainbow runs it

1918
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:05,240
was originally rainbow runs and then

1919
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,719
literally Mike from exotic comes out

1920
01:05:05,239 --> 01:05:08,959
with rainbow runs and sells it

1921
01:05:06,719 --> 01:05:11,239
commercially he's obviously way bigger

1922
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,838
big dude so he get he gets everybody's

1923
01:05:11,239 --> 01:05:16,519
like rainbow runs and they think of his

1924
01:05:12,838 --> 01:05:18,880
so Tim and Kyle renamed rainbow runs

1925
01:05:16,519 --> 01:05:21,679
rain shadow runs which is the Skittles

1926
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:24,200
times gelato 41 and it's [ __ ] amazing

1927
01:05:21,679 --> 01:05:26,118
and it's different completely different

1928
01:05:24,199 --> 01:05:29,519
but like this happens all the time and

1929
01:05:26,119 --> 01:05:31,318
so it's like um I think it's just one of

1930
01:05:29,519 --> 01:05:33,079
those things like we're going to have

1931
01:05:31,318 --> 01:05:35,119
you know it's going to be rainbow runs

1932
01:05:33,079 --> 01:05:36,440
by exotic as opposed to Rainbow runs by

1933
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:38,680
that in the future and that this kind of

1934
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:40,240
stuff happens unless we have trademarks

1935
01:05:38,679 --> 01:05:41,598
that's the only way to really like if

1936
01:05:40,239 --> 01:05:44,199
you have it trademarked and it's your

1937
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:45,798
[ __ ] then you know you've paid the the

1938
01:05:44,199 --> 01:05:46,879
money and you can enforce it too if

1939
01:05:45,798 --> 01:05:48,880
other people try to do it on the

1940
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:50,798
commercial now if we're talking outside

1941
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:52,920
a wreck that's a different story correct

1942
01:05:50,798 --> 01:05:54,599
yeah I gotta yeah and and it's tough to

1943
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:56,318
to to enforce things nowadays on

1944
01:05:54,599 --> 01:05:59,278
something that's kind

1945
01:05:56,318 --> 01:06:01,159
of regulated but not regulated you know

1946
01:05:59,278 --> 01:06:02,760
there's no banking stuff like that so if

1947
01:06:01,159 --> 01:06:04,038
if these guys that are trap and they

1948
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:05,760
they they breed and they call something

1949
01:06:04,039 --> 01:06:07,599
you know how a lot of this stuff becomes

1950
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:08,720
big on the black yeah on the black

1951
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:10,920
market how you supposed to find those

1952
01:06:08,719 --> 01:06:12,318
people send them cease assist right hey

1953
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:14,079
you can't call that that that's you know

1954
01:06:12,318 --> 01:06:16,358
that's this Trin that I that I created

1955
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:18,318
and I've been working years and I paid

1956
01:06:16,358 --> 01:06:20,038
all this money to get go getting

1957
01:06:18,318 --> 01:06:21,798
trademarks and putting them implementing

1958
01:06:20,039 --> 01:06:23,520
them in every state it's not cheap no

1959
01:06:21,798 --> 01:06:26,038
it's not cheap B no enforcement's the

1960
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:27,880
the most part of getting a tradar if you

1961
01:06:26,039 --> 01:06:29,559
have to enforce something had some guys

1962

01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:44,238
Lux or ET yeah they're all different so

2063
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:47,119
what does that tell you he's partners

2064
01:09:44,238 --> 01:09:49,559
with a law firm and they uh it's cheap

2065
01:09:47,119 --> 01:09:51,960
to them to drag you into their state

2066
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:53,319
yeah not cheap for you it's not cheap

2067
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:55,239
for me lawyers always win it's not

2068
01:09:53,319 --> 01:09:56,880
correct 100% And it's not cheap for me

2069
01:09:55,238 --> 01:09:58,799
but we we we did it a smart way we

2070
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:01,319
fought jurisdiction they had a chance to

2071
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:03,320
appeal and they um they decided not to

2072
01:10:01,319 --> 01:10:05,238
and then they realized that coming to

2073
01:10:03,319 --> 01:10:08,960
California the what they were suing me

2074
01:10:05,238 --> 01:10:10,959
for was a lot tougher to enforce enforce

2075
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:12,480
in California a lot tougher to enforce

2076
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:13,880
that they knew it and their attorney

2077
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:16,158
probably told them it's just best if you

2078
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:17,000
probably don't yeah and it's it going to

2079
01:10:16,158 --> 01:10:18,519
cost the money because now they're going

2080
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,319
to have to hire an attorney in

2081
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:23,199
California that's that's you know CU not

2082
01:10:20,319 --> 01:10:24,960
an in-house attorney right um so they

2083
01:10:23,198 --> 01:10:27,039
they they just decided to go away but

2084
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:28,239
I'm sure they I don't know at some point

2085
01:10:27,039 --> 01:10:30,119
I'm sure he's find he's going to try to

2086
01:10:28,238 --> 01:10:35,119
find something else who

2087
01:10:30,119 --> 01:10:37,079
knows I know whatever wild times yeah

2088
01:10:35,119 --> 01:10:38,519
just reminds me like California or uh

2089
01:10:37,079 --> 01:10:39,439
reminds me of Florida Sue State you know

2090
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:42,280
seem like everybody wants to sue

2091
01:10:39,439 --> 01:10:44,238
everybody yeah we would it's it's the

2092
01:10:42,279 --> 01:10:46,359
day and age unfortunately when I grew up

2093
01:10:44,238 --> 01:10:47,519
we didn't sue people you know no no you

2094
01:10:46,359 --> 01:10:49,319

2142
01:12:29,158 --> 01:12:35,039
a whole another scale it's a new place

2143
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:37,080
with all kinds of new technology uh new

2144
01:12:35,039 --> 01:12:38,719

2145
01:12:37,079 --> 01:12:40,679

2153
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:58,079
about you know I cycled feed back in the

2154
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:59,800
day um and then you um I actually paid a

2155
01:12:58,079 --> 01:13:01,800
couple people to come and consult for me

2156
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:03,159
MH and tell me about crop steering a

2157
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:05,279
couple different people because you know

2158
01:13:03,158 --> 01:13:07,198
you you want to get a couple different

2159
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:09,119
you know aspects of their views you know

2160
01:13:07,198 --> 01:13:11,479
yeah and then you kind of you know start

2161
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:13,519
playing with this stuff and then I tell

2162
01:13:11,479 --> 01:13:15,439
you every [ __ ] room is different

2163
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:17,600
because some rooms are just super

2164
01:13:15,439 --> 01:13:18,960
charged they're super efficient yeah the

2165
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:21,280
way that the air flows the way that the

2166
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:23,800
AC is working too much AC less AC a lot

2167
01:13:21,279 --> 01:13:25,399
of wind whatever it is so you get all

2168
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:26,920
this information from from people that

2169
01:13:25,399 --> 01:13:29,039
been doing it but everything is going to

2170
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:31,000
work out slightly different yeah in your

2171
01:13:29,039 --> 01:13:32,800
space and you got to learn that you know

2172
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:34,279
there's there's you can't buy experience

2173
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:35,960
from [ __ ] anybody and that's why I

2174
01:13:34,279 --> 01:13:37,359
tell my kid all the time so you got to

2175
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:39,000
figure stuff out you got to put the time

2176
01:13:37,359 --> 01:13:40,880
in do the work you got to put the time

2177
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,279
in um and so yeah so I'm glad that you

2178
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:44,359
came you got you got to come back

2179
01:13:42,279 --> 01:13:46,519
yesterday and we got um it was a great

2180
01:13:44,359 --> 01:13:48,719
tour I I redeemed myself a little bit

2181
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:50,199
and for sure you James come here come

2182
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:52,239
here James come into this room what do

2183
01:13:50,198 --> 01:13:54,839
you think remember last time so

2184
01:13:52,238 --> 01:13:56,919
different so different and very even

2185
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:58,880
canopies now I'd say your canopies are

2186
01:13:56,920 --> 01:14:00,158
super even especially compared to before

2187
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:01,600
it's like but these are all learning

2188
01:14:00,158 --> 01:14:02,839
curbs and everybody goes through them if

2189
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:04,880
you have it grow and you want to get

2190
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:06,639
better it just it it happens over time

2191
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:07,920
yeah and then the differ size canopies

2192
01:14:06,639 --> 01:14:10,840
also like when we started this thing we

2193
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:12,158
started with 63 strings and and against

2194
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:13,400
that's pretty wild that's pretty

2195
01:14:12,158 --> 01:14:14,599
aggressive well you had to throw

2196
01:14:13,399 --> 01:14:16,279
everything in there and then the

2197
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:18,719
director cultivation is going oh my God

2198
01:14:16,279 --> 01:14:20,039
I can't believe I can't believe but I go

2199
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:21,279
we got to figure out what they like what

2200
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:23,000
they don't like and let's just figure

2201
01:14:21,279 --> 01:14:24,519
out now so [ __ ] we can put stuff to

2202
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,840
the side well it's great doing a handful

2203
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:28,639
at a time but you get a 63 it's like so

2204
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:32,440
hard there was one room that had 17

2205
01:14:28,639 --> 01:14:34,719
cultivars you know 2 221 2200 plants and

2206
01:14:32,439 --> 01:14:37,359
we had 17 cultiv ours the good thing is

2207
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:38,520
that we kind of uh figured out we kind

2208
01:14:37,359 --> 01:14:40,839
of knew the ones that were going to hit

2209
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:43,960
and we we we bulked those in the room so

2210
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:46,199
so the room did okay but overall the the

2211
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:48,319
yields and the ratios from atbs to to

2212
01:14:46,198 --> 01:14:51,599
Smalls and micros was was a little

2213
01:14:48,319 --> 01:14:53,279
whacked right and uh since then we we we

2214
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:54,960
we we've turned the corner by far and

2215
01:14:53,279 --> 01:14:55,960
and we see the light at the end of the

2216
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,719
tunnel it's definitely going to get

2217
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:59,079
better from this point on can't wait to

2218
01:14:57,719 --> 01:15:00,639
