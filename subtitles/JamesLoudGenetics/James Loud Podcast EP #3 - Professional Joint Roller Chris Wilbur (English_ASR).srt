you'd be on the show of course yeah yeah

25
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,698
we've been working together now for a

26
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,039
couple months uh he hit me up through

27
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:04,439
Instagram and uh yeah I've been working

28
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,060
with his material now for what now five

29
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:08,399
six weeks what do you think of his fire

30
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,379
he's got some good material there I I

31
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,200
like the jungle cake I'm sort of partial

32
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:15,899
to that strain it's super strong so that

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,700
jungle cake is super super yeah I like

34
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,280
the poison gushers because it's Unique

35
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,799
oh definitely uh you know the the Goji

36
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,200
the pine salt yeah the pine sauce fire

37
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,759
and it's like it's got the gas

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,400
characteristics if you don't mind green

39
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,500
weed yeah amazing that is the thing

40
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,240
these days right the green wheat it

41
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,578
scares people for some reason it's like

42
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:36,839
not not all people yeah people that know

43
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:38,819
what's up I mean people that have

44
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,280
smoking a long time still love green

45
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:44,039
flower but I think a lot of the market

46
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,280
demands purple candy gas yeah they want

47
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:50,280
Lemon Cherry gelato runs yeah uh you

48
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,140
know even the Skittles now has color of

49
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,579
course yeah yeah well everyone's just

50
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,959
crossing it to make it look prettier

51
00:01:53,578 --> 00:01:57,059
because it's always been like that

52
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,859
strain that has zero bag appeal but

53
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,719
everyone that smokes it sort of knows

54
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:02,879
what to look for yeah but I mean

55
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,039
honestly I'm just happy that I'm in a

56
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,658
place where I can choose what I want to

57
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,159
smoke like like we were talking about

58
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:10,200
earlier I came from the east coast and

59
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:13,139
we didn't really have options of what

60
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:16,139
flavor of weed we wanted it was like do

61
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:18,059
you want OG or do you want whatever [ __ ]

62
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:20,279
this dude just made up like and it's all

63
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,659
mids like none of it's good weed when

64
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,640
you come out and actually see what's

65
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:25,500
available on the west coast and

66
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:27,059
specifically the Bay Area so how long

67
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,098
have you been smoking for I've been

68
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,659
smoking since what is it like right

69
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:33,299
after I graduated high school basically

70
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:35,759
and so it's kind of like a weird thing

71
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,319
for me I I basically grew up in a more

72
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:39,959
sort of traditional conservative

73
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:41,339
household and no one in my family had

74
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,860
really smoked weed so it was always

75
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,180
looked down upon and I remember in high

76
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,599
school like when I found out my friends

77
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,280
were making the the Sobe bottle bongs I

78
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:51,659
was super like distraught because I was

79
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,098
like they're throwing their lives away

80
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:54,840
like these are my friends who I've

81
00:02:53,098 --> 00:02:56,399
looked up to but like now they're

82
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,739
smoking weed like and I didn't really

83
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,719
know how to deal with it and so after a

84
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:03,060
while I realized oh it's not that big of

85
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:05,340
a deal like they're just sort of happy

86
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,080
and hungry around me I don't really care

87
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,479
so I was always just sort of that kid

88
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,760
who was around the friends who smoked

89
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:14,518
but never really partook and then

90
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,139
finally like the senior summer one of my

91
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:18,000
friends we were we were a little bit

92
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:19,378
drunk and he was like hey like I'll put

93
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,658
a star next to your name of the people

94
00:03:19,378 --> 00:03:23,818
who I've smoked with and I was like well

95
00:03:21,658 --> 00:03:26,340
[ __ ] it like let's do it and so I went

96
00:03:23,818 --> 00:03:28,560
up I we smoked a little bowl and then of

97
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:31,080
course as things do with weed like

98
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,180
literally 30 seconds after I hit his

99
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,580
bowl my friend's brother who was inside

100
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,140
was like oh Wilbur's smoking like you're

101
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,879
hitting my big bong so I went

102
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:41,279
immediately upstairs and hit his like

103
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:43,139
two and a half foot bong nice and so I

104
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,239
was just completely floored but at the

105
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:47,098
same time I was like this isn't all what

106
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,680
I expected like I expected to be

107
00:03:47,098 --> 00:03:51,899
completely out of my mind like I was

108
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,879
feeling fantastic totally and I was like

109
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,860
this is what I want like I don't like

110
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:57,840
the feeling I get with alcohol as much

111
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,540
but this is what I've been looking for

112
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,000
and pretty much since then I was like I

113
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:05,658
gotta kind of like control myself with

114
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,280
this because I can feel how much I enjoy

115
00:04:05,658 --> 00:04:10,859
cannabis and I know probably shouldn't

116
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,080
be smoking at this age so like I kind of

117
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:15,480
weaned myself into it where I was like I

118
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,280
won't smoke for like a couple weeks so

119
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:19,079
it only spoke like once every few weeks

120
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,659
and then of course like I went to

121
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,759
college all my friends in college smoked

122
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,080
because I was playing D3 lacrosse wow

123
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,240
and I don't know if you know what this

124
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:29,698
but like the lacrosse Community I would

125
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,560
say probably 90 to 9 95 percent of

126
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:33,540
lacrosse players smoke weed it's just

127
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,000
like basketball players exactly and so

128
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,680
we we all just like in football players

129
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,300
and baseball players and that's what

130
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,740
that's what we're finding out now is

131
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,600
that everyone's doing this stuff I was

132
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:46,139
listening to a podcast the other week in

133
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,879
an ex-nfl uh D lineman was micro dosing

134
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:50,280
mushrooms during games oh I believe it

135
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:52,800
and I'm like now now looking back at him

136
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:55,019
like it makes sense yeah I mean Nate

137
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,220
Diaz and Nick Diaz these guys they would

138
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:58,680
you know those guys have been smoking

139
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,240
weed publicly yeah and now it comes out

140
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,740
that everybody's kind of been doing it

141
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,660
all along yeah yeah for the most part

142
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,519
it's a trip and and there there really

143
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:08,100
is that sort of

144
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:10,740
I don't know not performance enhancing

145
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:13,080
maybe but it really helps you focus the

146
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,720
mind more like sure whether it's whether

147
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:18,779
it's weed or like micro dosing mushrooms

148
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:21,660
it's a similar experience where you're

149
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:23,879
sort of hyper focused on one specific

150
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:26,220
task and you can really get into that

151
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:29,038
groove of sort of grinding whatever that

152
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:31,440
specific thing is right and I mean for

153
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:33,000
me that was like I would wake up we had

154
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,978
an early morning lacrosse practices and

155
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,259
I would smoke before practice just to

156
00:05:34,978 --> 00:05:38,879
sort of wake up and get my body going

157
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:40,379
totally I used to smoke and go to the

158
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:43,560
gym it's the same thing [ __ ] Jiu

159
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:45,300
Jitsu yeah exactly for me it takes my

160
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:48,060
mind out of it so I don't have to think

161
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:50,280
about it I just do it I think that is

162
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,439
the beauty of it uh you know if you're

163
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:54,179
gonna go get on a treadmill you'll start

164
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:55,860
doing cardio the best way is to actually

165
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,959
smoke a little bit and keep your mind

166
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,460
completely out of it yeah you know it's

167
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:01,739
a personal preference and maybe it's not

168
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:03,478
for everybody but man it definitely has

169
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,220
helped me along the way oh absolutely

170
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:08,459
and I would say it's definitely not for

171
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:10,620
everyone like I have best friends of

172
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:12,839
mine who like I'll will be out on the

173
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,759
golf course and I'll be two and a half

174
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:16,439
joints in and I'll say hey do you want

175
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,000
to hit and it'll be like nah dude if I

176
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:20,219
take one hit I'll be done for the day

177
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,740
yeah and like I mean maybe some people

178
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:25,319
paranoia and I think it's because of

179
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:27,840
the genetics I mean I I think that maybe

180
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:30,600
if they smoke the right type of [ __ ]

181
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,399
flower yeah or edible or whatever it is

182
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,439
you know so I think Edibles is what

183
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:37,560
ruined it for a lot of people 100 my

184
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:39,478
sister herself she was I'd always talked

185
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,560
to her about it like how I smoke and all

186
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:42,599
this stuff and she's like oh yeah I

187
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,220
tried weed with my friends one time I

188
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,600
was like oh tell me about it she's like

189
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,880
yeah we decided we're gonna make our own

190
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,979
Edibles and I said well there you [ __ ]

191
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:52,019
up right away

192
00:06:48,978 --> 00:06:53,519
Edibles will do that I was like you had

193
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:56,459
a terrible night because you just

194
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:59,099
literally dosed yourself with an unknown

195
00:06:56,459 --> 00:07:01,019
amount of weed and for your first time

196
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:03,720
ever experiencing it like that sounds

197
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:07,258
terrible for someone who's done it for

198
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,759
what is it now 15 years yeah I mean if

199
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:12,000
you take too much coffee you're gonna

200
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:14,100
have a bad experience 100 so it's so

201
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,319
funny because I think a lot of people do

202
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:19,560
relate that edible experience and

203
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:22,680
Edibles on uh you know the strong side

204
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,780
can be stronger than mushrooms or LSD or

205
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,180
other drug other psychedelic drugs it

206
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:29,098
can be just as potent or or more oh

207
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,740
absolutely and isn't it because of like

208
00:07:29,098 --> 00:07:33,659
the way it digests in your body and it's

209
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,579
so so it's not really weed that you're

210
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,620
getting anymore it's not the same THC

211
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:40,159
high that you're getting it metabolizes

212
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:42,959
into a different drug so it is more

213
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,180
psychedelic than a traditional oh yeah

214
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:46,978
you can get limitations all kinds of oh

215
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,978
yeah I've been stuck in my bed for hours

216
00:07:46,978 --> 00:07:51,839
off Edibles yeah me too I curled up and

217
00:07:49,978 --> 00:07:53,639
you know yeah one time I was making

218
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:56,098
Edibles for tray cool from Green Day

219
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,418
yeah yeah yeah and uh I was tasting them

220
00:07:56,098 --> 00:07:58,860
because he's like oh yeah we need him

221
00:07:57,418 --> 00:08:01,439
really really strong and I'm going

222
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,180
overseas and I was making Fruity Pebble

223
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,918
Treats oh because I kept tasting them

224
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,579
and I didn't realize how strong they

225
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:09,839
were and I ended up curling up in my bed

226
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:13,079
and then I have people trimming in my

227
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:14,758
house and my wife was like uh she was at

228
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:16,800
work and I had to call her and I'm like

229
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:19,139
I think I need to go to the hospital she

230
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,520
[ __ ] and hung up the phone on me and I

231
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:21,960
was like oh my God I want to call her

232
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:24,719
back and she's like you need to man up

233
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:27,060
you know you just ate some weed yeah so

234
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,500
go figure yeah well I actually have a

235
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,120
similar experience my friend and I were

236
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:33,000
making like you know what firecrackers

237
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,278
are so it's basically the jankiest form

238
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,679
of edible you can possibly make you take

239
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:39,240
what we would do is we'd make s'mores

240
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,278
firecrackers so you'd take a graham

241
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,320
cracker you'd put a little piece of

242
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:45,838
chocolate down you'd put a little peanut

243
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,200
butter for fat for the weed to bind to

244
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:52,440
and then you put a marshmallow on top

245
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:54,420
and so we were making these Edibles and

246
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,920
you have no idea what the dose is on

247
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:57,778
them and people were like you never did

248
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:59,159
no no people were liking them so we were

249
00:08:57,778 --> 00:09:02,399
like oh let's make a batch or two of

250
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:04,019
brownies and cookies yeah and so we're

251
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,700
whipping up cookies like you normally

252
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:08,759
would eating some eating some of the

253
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,620
batter and then my friend's like oh I've

254
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:12,179
got to go like grab more materials

255
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,980
because we don't have enough to make all

256
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:17,159
these cookies that we've got batter for

257
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:19,980
or we got we've got uh butter for and so

258
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:21,958
he goes to the grocery store and by the

259
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,659
time he gets back like 40 minutes later

260
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm curled up using a Betty Crocker box

261
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:29,579
as a pillow just to sleep on his kitchen

262
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,019
floor and he wakes me up and we busted

263
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,019
out another like 200 something cookies

264
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,160
okay so part of the show and part of the

265
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:40,200
fun of my show is that we get to taste

266
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:42,719
some flour and so we have a blind

267
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,879
tasting we have three samples uh one of

268
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,519
them is a less than five dollar a gram

269
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:49,139
joint one of them is a less than ten

270
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,440
dollar gram joint and one of them is

271
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:53,939
more than fifteen dollars a gram and you

272
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,180
actually help me roll these today so we

273
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:59,519
have some beautiful beautiful cones uh

274
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:02,879
you do everything so you do cones you do

275
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,860
big fat uh you know fingers yeah yeah

276
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:07,559
the normal ones that most people know me

277
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,300
for are like uh two grams typically and

278
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:10,799
they have like the nozzle tips but these

279
00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:12,838
are actually what I kind of prefer to

280
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:15,299
smoke if I'm just smoking like by myself

281
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:17,040
or if I'm just rolling up quickly like

282
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:18,778
either on the golf course or just at

283
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:20,939
home so you like to play golf yeah I

284
00:10:18,778 --> 00:10:23,159
play golf a lot I'm not huge I'm not

285
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:26,700
really picky on the course I'm not that

286
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:28,319
good but I I mean it's my main form of

287
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:31,640
exercise these days getting out and

288
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,640
walking the golf course

289
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,120
nice yeah I like golf I just don't have

290
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:38,278
enough time for it yeah it is so busy

291
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,320
it's time consuming it'll eat regardless

292
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:42,240
it eats up a half a day

293
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,680
if you're lucky it needs of a half a day

294
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,240
if you're lucky I mean that's the

295
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:47,458
minimum and then you're exhausted

296
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,500
afterwards especially like I go out

297
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:52,319
there and I walk so it's like a six

298
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:54,120
seven mile walk on Long courses like so

299
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,640
a lot of the time you're exhausted

300
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,799
afterwards as far as when when you hit

301
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,419
one of your joints you don't take big

302
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:02,278
monster Hits I don't take big monster I

303
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:03,899
see sometimes people like you know I was

304
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:05,159
at a party the other day and people were

305
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:06,059
hitting it and all of a sudden it starts

306
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:07,860
running and they're complaining about

307
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:10,078
the joint I'm like dude you can't

308
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:12,959
[ __ ] hit it like that yeah expect it

309
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:15,120
not to run you know a lot of the issues

310
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:16,679
with with running typically come down to

311
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,360
what exactly what you're saying is

312
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:20,578
people are used to that sort of puff

313
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,440
puff pass mentality right that we all

314
00:11:20,578 --> 00:11:23,819
grew up with where it's like everyone in

315
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,680
the group wants to get high so like

316
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:28,800
let's get this [ __ ] over with puff puff

317
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:32,099
and pass it along whereas

318
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:34,500
we have access to an amount of such

319
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,860
quality material at this point to smoke

320
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:40,559
that it's less now about that let's get

321
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,839
high and more about the experience it's

322
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:46,199
like a Cohiba cigar it's more like that

323
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:48,480
where you're you're in this for 20

324
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,459
minutes that is the mentality I like to

325
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,959
have is the kohibo cigar I like cigars

326
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:53,939
too I don't smoke a lot of cigars but

327
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:56,338
it's that mentality well and you'll see

328
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:58,680
like when I smoke it's not

329
00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:01,560
I typically don't take like direct to

330
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:03,958
Long hits I typically will inhale into

331
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:05,219
my mouth to let that smoke cool down a

332
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,479
little bit more to get more of that

333
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,639
flavor

334
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,079
yep where you see a lot of people when

335
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,539
the joints start rolling is because

336
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:14,939
they're sucking directly into their

337
00:12:12,539 --> 00:12:17,159
lungs and it causes that cherry to get

338
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,899
way too hot totally what do you think of

339
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:21,360
the way this is burning in the way the

340
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:23,519
ash looks what's your opinion Ash I mean

341
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,278
I think it really ashes

342
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,740
such like a batch dependent sort of

343
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:31,019
thing in my opinion like I've had I've

344
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:32,940
had good weed that smokes like this

345
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:36,120
where it's maybe not as white as it

346
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:38,760
probably could be but it's not offensive

347
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,639
the smoke isn't I'm not upset with how

348
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:44,100
it's smoking yeah but

349
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:46,259
the thing is it's typically a mark of

350
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:50,100
someone doing those couple extra things

351
00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:52,439
right yeah that when you get that white

352
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:55,079
ash it typically does come from better

353
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,820
weed from the drying process yeah the

354
00:12:55,078 --> 00:12:59,399
drying The Cure has a lot to do with it

355
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:01,500
for one thing well but at the end of the

356
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:03,480
day like there's good material that

357
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:06,240
smokes a little bit darker it might not

358
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:08,399
be somewhere in genetics too genetics

359
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,720
definitely play a role in it I think

360
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,639
it's something that we honestly still

361
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,278
are the jury's still out like we're

362
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:16,680
people still don't really know what

363
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:19,139
exactly causes it because there's so

364
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:20,578
many factors that go into growing the

365
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:22,919
plant sure

366
00:13:20,578 --> 00:13:25,019
I mean maybe you can correct me if I'm

367
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:26,879
wrong but like from my limited knowledge

368
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:28,919
like there's so many different factors

369
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:31,439
that go in from the growing to the

370
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:33,659
drying process that it could be any one

371
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,160
of those along the way that yeah it's

372
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:37,139
not just a lot of times people want to

373
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:39,419
say it's how you flush it and yeah just

374
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:42,060
how you flush it it's how it's dried and

375
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:44,338
cured and the actual I mean I think we

376
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:46,739
we understand it a lot more but it's

377
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:49,079
definitely not just one thing that makes

378
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:50,700
sense and that makes sense

379
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,799
so yeah and what about oil rings what's

380
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,120
your opinion on an oil ring I mean if if

381
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:55,979
you're not

382
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,679
smoking the joint

383
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:00,360
just to look for the oil ring yeah then

384
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:02,338
I don't think there's really much to it

385
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,440
it obviously it shows that there might

386
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:06,839
be a little bit more THC content in

387
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,700
there but at the end of the day

388
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:11,279
unless you're holding that joint upside

389
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:13,800
down to consolidate that resin on the

390
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:15,600
paper yeah it really it doesn't show

391
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:17,278
that much in my opinion and definitely

392
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,159
how it's rolled too I think yeah

393
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:22,320
definitely the the rolling style yeah

394
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,879
absolutely getting a good paper can also

395
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,459
contribute it to contribute to it

396
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:29,278
because I I feel like papers that are a

397
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:32,338
little bit on the the Slicker side yeah

398
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:33,720
like like an element's paper they show

399
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:34,980
the ring a little bit more maybe it's

400
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,139
also because it's a little bit lighter

401
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,820
of a paper so what's your choice as far

402
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:40,620
as papers what's what's if you were to

403
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,720
pick one piece yeah what do you use

404
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:44,820
paper well I personally I typically

405
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,860
smoke the raw organic chems typically

406
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:49,139
yeah just because that's sort of the

407
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:51,000
flavor profile that I'm used to if that

408
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:53,278
makes sense yeah because every paper has

409
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,539
a little bit of a taste well hemp hemp

410
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:56,639
seems to have a little bit more of a

411
00:14:54,539 --> 00:14:58,019
taste and a little bit more of a burn I

412
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,399
get a little from hemp yeah yeah

413
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:01,379
personally I do like hemp but I like

414
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:03,299
race paper yeah yeah and that's that's

415
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:05,399
what a lot of people that's what a lot

416
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:07,379
of people say is that they prefer like

417
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:09,059
elements I just prefer that because

418
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:10,500
that's what I've gotten used to yeah and

419
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:11,939
so it's kind of like when you're tasting

420
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,278
something you have to taste it on top of

421
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,899
like whatever your palette is raw's got

422
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:18,600
a lot of controversy right now I know

423
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:19,620
it's kind of crazy the weird thing about

424
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,339
it is

425
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:25,620
he's played it so well that you don't

426
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:27,899
really know how much of what came out of

427
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,759
the lawsuit is true sure because with

428
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:31,919
every lawsuit there's going to be a

429
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,720
kernel of Truth where yeah it might not

430
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:35,219
have been made in alcoy Spain it might

431
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,440
have been made in the town next to it

432
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:40,079
which seems to be the direction that

433
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:43,380
Josh from raw is sort of going with it I

434
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:46,620
I don't really care where the paper came

435
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:48,539
from obviously it seems kind of silly to

436
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:50,698
me to lie about something like that

437
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:53,698
totally in any extent like who cares if

438
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:55,319
it came from alcoy or came from the town

439
00:15:53,698 --> 00:15:58,139
next to it like right I don't really

440
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:00,839
care I think it's unfortunate that it's

441
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:02,579
sort of blown up to the point but the

442
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:05,639
way that he's handled I think is great

443
00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:07,859
the exposing sort of where where it's

444
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:10,139
coming from providing people an

445
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,278
opportunity to come and see it well the

446
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:13,740
truth is we live in a world of

447
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:17,000
snowflakes that's it is definitely so

448
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:21,600
we've got a less than five dollar gram

449
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:24,419
less than ten or more than 15.

450
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,120
that's got to be less than ten less than

451
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:28,620
10. yeah that's my guess okay more than

452
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,940
five less than 10. we'll let you know at

453
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,139
the end you've got to get into number

454
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,180
two

455
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:35,519
and actually I'm going to throw you the

456
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:38,399
lighter and we want to see how you light

457
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:41,220
it see if I can figure this is

458
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:45,000
cigar lighter that's that's pretty cool

459
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:46,800
but it's all about that Cohiba mentality

460
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,620
yeah I typically I mean similar to what

461
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:51,299
you were doing I it's honestly exactly

462
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:54,720
how you would light a cigar just Char

463
00:16:51,299 --> 00:16:57,000
the tip it's absolutely and then once

464
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:01,040
you see that cherry coming give it a

465
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,039
couple blows and then inhale yeah

466
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,160
and also I don't know if you notice on

467
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:10,140
on that first joint it did start running

468
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,240
a little bit at the beginning yeah but

469
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:15,059
then it it balances when you take your

470
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:18,919
time with it yeah it balances all that

471
00:17:15,058 --> 00:17:18,918
is it dead it might be dead

472
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:25,220
got my little collection

473
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,940
yeah you can't fly with torch lighters

474
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,319
by the way

475
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,880
you can fly can you fly with normal

476
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:34,500
lighters you can fly with normal

477
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,960
lighters but you cannot fly with these

478
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:39,960
torchlighters uh any sort of torch

479
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,100
lighter they will take it or you can you

480
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,298
know give it to somebody else or

481
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:43,859
whatever like but yeah but you cannot

482
00:17:42,298 --> 00:17:46,079
fly it you can put in your check bag but

483
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:49,019
I think you got to take out all the gas

484
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:50,038
really so you're so you're supposed to

485
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:51,720
yeah

486
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:53,038
I have a lighter that looks like a torch

487
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,839
lighter but it's not and they always

488
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:57,058
[ __ ] with me they like take it off my

489
00:17:54,839 --> 00:18:00,980
bag like it's not a torch lighter

490
00:17:57,058 --> 00:18:00,980
they're like okay you have it so

491
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,400
what are the other travel tips that you

492
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:07,259
have for us because that's that's a

493
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,240
useful one I didn't know that

494
00:18:07,259 --> 00:18:11,279
yeah same thing butane like if you smoke

495
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,140
Dabs you don't want to fly with that oh

496
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:15,058
no no you obviously can't even check

497
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:17,720
that you have to basically take out all

498
00:18:15,058 --> 00:18:20,339
the gas and fly with an empty

499
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:22,620
explosions and stuff like that of I like

500
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:25,319
those rosin carts a lot that I've just

501
00:18:22,619 --> 00:18:27,538
recently sort of getting popular carts

502
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:29,399
are awesome my only concern though is

503
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:31,980
you have no idea what they're cutting it

504
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,538
with yeah and that's my only concern is

505
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:36,298
like you get some that tastes like

506
00:18:33,538 --> 00:18:38,879
better than others you're like well it's

507
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:41,220
not just pure rosin so what's like the

508
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,380
cut uh you know you gotta talk to

509
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,120
nicotine he's got his his way where he's

510
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,620
doing I mean he's got Pure Rod he's one

511
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,879
of those guys yeah I mean the guys that

512
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:50,099
are doing rosin carts that aren't

513
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,320
cutting it with anything yeah yeah that

514
00:18:50,099 --> 00:18:54,058
are thinning it has to do with heat well

515
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:56,099
I'm just not an expert yeah subject at

516
00:18:54,058 --> 00:18:57,298
all because I believe in doubling down

517
00:18:56,099 --> 00:18:58,740
when I'm good at I'm not trying to do

518
00:18:57,298 --> 00:19:01,019
everything yeah of course we're kind of

519
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:02,279
talking about it a little earlier why I

520
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:04,619
never got into mushrooms or anything

521
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:06,660
like that yeah it's just I believe that

522
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:09,119
whatever you're good at if you double

523
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:10,380
down on that that you get rid of all the

524
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:11,879
other distractions you're going to be

525
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,200
successful absolutely you know it's like

526
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,520
you're successful with joint roll your

527
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,160
your joints are awesome online you do

528
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:19,558
tutorials you have a subscription now on

529
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,240
Instagram as well I don't know I I was I

530
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:24,058
was toying around because they had some

531
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,798
sort of like uh a messaging platform and

532
00:19:24,058 --> 00:19:27,720
I think all it really is is what

533
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:29,639
Instagram used to be where if someone

534
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,940
follows you they're gonna see your posts

535
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:34,200
which seems crazy right like if someone

536
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:37,140
follows you they want to see what you

537
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,700
have to say but I'm I'm not I don't

538
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,740
think I'm going down that that line

539
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,538
anymore so with the first one what were

540
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:45,179
the flavors that you tasted I got a

541
00:19:42,538 --> 00:19:48,179
little bread yeah I I didn't get a ton

542
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:50,280
of it wasn't over no yeah it wasn't a

543
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:53,759
ton of flavor like maybe earthy but like

544
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:56,639
nothing nothing gassy maybe yeah but not

545
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:58,740
like OG you know it didn't stand out and

546
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,259
that's why I I sort of hedged my bet

547
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:03,660
with the the middle guess on that one

548
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:06,740
this one I'm getting a little bit more I

549
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,740
get more on that as well

550
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:13,079
you know without seeing the bud it's

551
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,880
like it's a different experience right

552
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:16,379
without looking at the bud and analyzing

553
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,960
the bud smelling it and trying to get

554
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:21,840
those uh and I genuinely don't remember

555
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,480
which is which now oh yeah yeah so it's

556
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:26,519
it's like I'm really trying to like

557
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,900
piece together this one I would I would

558
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:31,339
say is a little bit smoother than the

559
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,340
first one yeah I agree

560
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:34,918
I think it's smoother and I think

561
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,179
there's definitely more Terps I get a

562
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:37,799
little bit of fruit in there a little

563
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:40,380
Berry I get a little yeah definitely

564
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:42,779
some berries some some gas for sure on

565
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:44,220
the back of it but it's not super gassy

566
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:45,779
and it's not super fruity it's just kind

567
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,279
of balanced and I mean for what it's

568
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:50,160
worth there's a little bit more resin on

569
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:52,619
the paper for sure like I mean

570
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,058
but I also the aftertaste it lingers a

571
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:55,558
lot longer than the first one kind of

572
00:20:54,058 --> 00:20:57,000
like you'd hit it you get a little bit

573
00:20:55,558 --> 00:20:59,160
of flavor that's it but it was gone

574
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,798
whereas this like after I take a hit

575
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:03,419
it's still on my palate for like 30

576
00:21:01,798 --> 00:21:04,918
seconds well when you before right

577
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:06,240
before you handed it back to me I still

578
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:09,360
had a little bit of the flavor on my

579
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,099
palette I mean I might have [ __ ] up I

580
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:12,479
think that one might be I don't know now

581
00:21:11,099 --> 00:21:13,859
I think that one might be the middle one

582
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,480
you think this one might be the middle

583
00:21:13,859 --> 00:21:17,219
one yeah and I think the first one might

584
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,038
be the low one that's okay you can

585
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:21,298
change it as we go all the way to the

586
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:24,119
end all right

587
00:21:21,298 --> 00:21:25,980
that's what I'm thinking right now yeah

588
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:27,538
dude the effect of this one is

589
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,980
noticeably stronger than the first oh

590
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:30,480
absolutely it's not just because I

591
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,919
didn't even take as many hits of the

592
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,200
second one as I did of the first one

593
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,419
took more of the first one for sure yeah

594
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,100
yeah and I think we took like two or

595
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:40,500
three hits and I definitely feel the

596
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:42,538
effect like yeah uplifting and it's not

597
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,460
like tight around the eyes it's more

598
00:21:42,538 --> 00:21:46,859
just it's almost more of like what

599
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:49,798
people would call a sativa High yes 100

600
00:21:46,859 --> 00:21:51,839
100 and I don't smoke a lot of sativas

601
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:53,460
so that is no I mean but yeah it's

602
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:56,579
definitely if anything it's like a

603
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:58,679
sativa leaning hybrid it's not on that

604
00:21:56,579 --> 00:22:01,319
far end of sativa it still has gas in it

605
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:04,320
it still has uh almost like a

606
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:06,119
caffeinated Buzz right but I love

607
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:09,000
caffeine with weed is always a good

608
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:13,379
combo uh one of my favorite uh combos is

609
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:17,099
uh Cuban coffee yeah with with a nice

610
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:19,020
like cigar nice uh or a nice uh blunt I

611
00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:20,759
don't know if you've heard of gonzarello

612
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:22,619
uh he might be someone to look into

613
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:24,619
having on the podcast future actually

614
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:28,259
but he rolls

615
00:22:24,619 --> 00:22:32,399
heirloom Cuban tobacco cigars

616
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:34,319
uh with with cannabis in them wow and he

617
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,240
invited me over his place a few years

618
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:38,759
ago when we were first sort of doing

619
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:42,240
business together he he was selling me a

620
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:44,158
few few of his Blunts and so I go over

621
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,859
there and he fights me into his home

622
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:50,400
very welcoming so we we smoked together

623
00:22:46,859 --> 00:22:52,979
and then he brings out similar to this a

624
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,840
small cup of of coffee and I assumed it

625
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,038
might be like an espresso or something

626
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:57,779
like that

627
00:22:56,038 --> 00:23:00,658
and he's like this is a Cuban coffee

628
00:22:57,779 --> 00:23:03,379
yeah and what it is is it's basically an

629
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:07,380
espresso but it's whipped in with sugar

630
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:10,860
huh and so it's like a sweet but like

631
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:13,140
almost silky smooth espresso yeah and it

632
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:15,178
was it was so delicious I had like two

633
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,799
or three of them and my heart was just

634
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:20,038
racing the whole time but it was just

635
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:24,058
like that that experience of like the

636
00:23:20,038 --> 00:23:26,158
the cigar along with the the tobacco and

637
00:23:24,058 --> 00:23:27,418
like the do you like Vietnamese coffee I

638
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,340
don't know if I've ever had Vietnamese

639
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:30,360
coffee oh dude you got to get the I

640
00:23:29,339 --> 00:23:31,859
don't know after this we'll go get some

641
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:34,019
Vietnamese coffee because Vietnamese

642
00:23:31,859 --> 00:23:36,240
coffee is one of my favorites they do

643
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:38,819
it's sweet because they use condensed

644
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,500
milk oh right and so they do a slow drip

645
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:42,658
and the drip actually goes in and it's

646
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,480
like super strong oh wow the heart races

647
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:46,919
yeah you can't sleep at night

648
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,400
so we're gonna get into the third flavor

649
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:49,400
here yeah

650
00:23:50,339 --> 00:23:55,558
so so far so good today I mean I really

651
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:57,599
think the California Market has improved

652
00:23:55,558 --> 00:23:59,940
over the last

653
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:01,619
year since the beginning of covid until

654
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,058
now absolutely there's definitely

655
00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:05,099
improvements in quality I think product

656
00:24:03,058 --> 00:24:06,899
is moving faster too so it's not sitting

657
00:24:05,099 --> 00:24:08,639
on the shelves quite as long which is a

658
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,840
bad thing but I feel like a lot of the

659
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,100
shitty cultivators that thought they

660
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:13,319
were going to come in and grow these

661
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:14,579
mid-quality yeah things and not even mid

662
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:17,220
we're talking about the low quality

663
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:19,199
stuff those dudes are gone yeah so and I

664
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:21,960
mean well I think also a lot of it comes

665
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,298
down to like people have now found their

666
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,400
path into the legal Market

667
00:24:24,298 --> 00:24:27,960
yeah and I mean there's there's some

668
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,538
Boutique Brands there's a lot of Booth

669
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:33,179
still 100 but I would say there are some

670
00:24:30,538 --> 00:24:37,079
really good Boutique Brands uh the the

671
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:38,640
struggle I find is finding finding the

672
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:40,798
quality brands

673
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,740
in dispensaries like I typically am not

674
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:46,139
a dispensary Shopper but the last time I

675
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:48,000
was in a dispensary

676
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:50,580
the bud tender didn't even know what he

677
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,980
was talking about yeah I bought one one

678
00:24:50,579 --> 00:24:55,558
like an ounce of one flavor and then a

679
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:58,259
week later came back and it was the same

680
00:24:55,558 --> 00:25:01,079
same packaging but a different color wow

681
00:24:58,259 --> 00:25:03,119
and he had told me oh yeah it's it's the

682
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:05,158
same bat or the same strain but a

683
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:07,439
different batch of it and I go back home

684
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:09,900
and I look at the two labels and it's

685
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,659
completely different crosses of two

686
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:14,940
completely different strains wow and I

687
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:17,400
was like most people don't know what the

688
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:19,200
hell is the difference sure but to

689
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,720
someone who does that's such like an

690
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,240
off-putting experience compared to

691
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:27,120
knowing the person who grows it knowing

692
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,278
all of what went into it well that's the

693
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:30,839
difference between the the wreck world

694
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:32,759
and the black market back in the days

695
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:33,959
you were a lot closer to the cultivator

696
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:35,700
for the most part if you're in

697
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,159
California especially yeah maybe not so

698
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:40,259
in other states whatever but like in

699
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,480
California we were like blessed to I

700
00:25:40,259 --> 00:25:44,519
mean growing up in the bay we always had

701
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,919
somebody who had weed for the most part

702
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:48,778
but we had Brown weed back in the day we

703
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:51,659
you know I mean like with [ __ ] seeds

704
00:25:48,778 --> 00:25:53,460
in it before yep yeah I mean the old

705
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:55,020
Mexican weed and those seeds are [ __ ]

706
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,400
I wish I had more of those still because

707
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:58,440
there's some interesting stuff that came

708
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,200
out of those and you know but

709
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,120
uh you were closer to the if you get got

710
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,940
homegrown weed the green stuff the stuff

711
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:09,119
coming out of [ __ ] uh the

712
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:11,340
uh areas up in Humboldt and friggin

713
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:13,319
Mendo and Sonoma you know they've been

714
00:26:11,339 --> 00:26:15,418
freaking producing bomb ass weed forever

715
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:17,278
and there was home Growers that did a

716
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:18,480
good job too but like you were closer

717
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:20,038
and so

718
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,200
I don't know well it's just different

719
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:24,058
experience well so I grew up on the East

720
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,340
Coast where like I was saying like you

721
00:26:24,058 --> 00:26:28,678
didn't always know what strain you were

722
00:26:26,339 --> 00:26:30,538
buying like you can't always even trust

723
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:32,220
what other people say the strains are

724
00:26:30,538 --> 00:26:34,859
yeah and then

725
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:36,179
I was very much like a person like I

726
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:37,798
want to know like the flavors I'm

727
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:41,640
smoking I want a couple different ones

728
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:43,440
so I can like try different strains and

729
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,940
growing up in like a small town in

730
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,220
Massachusetts there's not a lot of

731
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:50,220
access to that but I was able to sort of

732
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:53,339
I know I was always making friends with

733
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:55,620
other people who had access to good weed

734
00:26:53,339 --> 00:26:59,220
or were just cool people to hang out

735
00:26:55,619 --> 00:27:01,319
with and happen to also smoke and one of

736
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:05,400
those people happened to be like the

737
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:07,558
sort of town Weed supplier for the kids

738
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:11,220
who didn't mind dealing with kind of the

739
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:13,200
weird guy and he would have

740
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:16,319
like sort of you have set up here he

741
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:19,140
would have 10 different strains and like

742
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:21,000
you'd be able to sort of smell sample

743
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:22,620
some of them totally and he would be

744
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,400
able to tell you hey here's some purple

745
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:28,439
Romulan here's like so and what year was

746
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,740
this like around the 2000s no well so

747
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:35,340
this was probably like

748
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:37,980
2011 2012. okay and so he he had a guy

749
00:27:35,339 --> 00:27:40,019
out in Washington who he was willing to

750
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:42,659
play a little bit more but he could hand

751
00:27:40,019 --> 00:27:44,759
select hey I want these 12 strains yeah

752
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:46,440
and I want the good [ __ ] I don't want

753
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:48,720
the [ __ ] you're peddling to most guys on

754
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,940
the East Coast right and so he had that

755
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,380
quality flower and then when I went to

756
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:55,340
school in Maryland it was the same sort

757
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,340
of thing where I was like

758
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:59,640
I want to know what I'm smoking I want

759
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:01,440
to know where it comes from and so I

760
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,720
made those relationships and then when I

761
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:07,380
came out to the West Coast it was always

762
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:10,558
well who grew this yeah and then I would

763
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:12,299
meet the person who grew it or I meet up

764
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:13,918
the supply chain and eventually meet the

765
00:28:12,298 --> 00:28:16,200
person who grew it and not to make any

766
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,299
money off of them but simply for the

767
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:21,179
sake of the relationship I'm interested

768
00:28:18,298 --> 00:28:22,740
like you I don't have the expertise so

769
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:25,080
I'm interested in what you're doing like

770
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:27,240
I want to know how you do that like I

771
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:29,699
want to witness this and then I can

772
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,740
maybe help you in something else or just

773
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,778
watch it right and I think I was able to

774
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:36,359
sort of build those relationships

775
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:38,220
because I wasn't worried about making

776
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:40,979
any money off of

777
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:42,659
the relationship at all yeah I think

778
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:44,460
when you're driven by Passion you're

779
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:46,380
going to be more successful yeah you

780
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:48,840
know it's like there's so many different

781
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:51,179
ways to make money but like passion

782
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:52,859
driven people are usually the happiest

783
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:54,778
yeah you know if you're just motivated

784
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:56,158
by money I I don't know that it's

785
00:28:54,778 --> 00:28:59,460
definitely not the industry to be in

786
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:01,260
anymore it's just Money Motivated but

787
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:03,600
really interesting so let's talk about

788
00:29:01,259 --> 00:29:05,879
your giant rolling yeah uh your

789
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:08,278
Instagram is professional joint roller

790
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:10,679
yes sir and do you have tips for people

791
00:29:08,278 --> 00:29:12,839
on rolling joints I think we did some uh

792
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:14,820
joint join uh videos that we'll probably

793
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:16,619
cut in yeah yeah you spare people with

794
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:19,439
people but yeah give us some tips yeah

795
00:29:16,619 --> 00:29:21,778
so I mean a lot of the time people are

796
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:25,220
dealing with either papers that are too

797
00:29:21,778 --> 00:29:28,440
small or not enough weed is what I find

798
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:30,538
and a lot of really what joint rolling

799
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:34,200
is is getting the material into the

800
00:29:30,538 --> 00:29:36,839
shape that into a workable shape and so

801
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:40,140
when I'm rolling specifically like cones

802
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:43,439
like this I'm not necessarily like

803
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:46,080
working the material that much I'm more

804
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:50,038
shaping the paper into the shape that I

805
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:53,220
want it to be and the material then yeah

806
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:56,398
goes goes with right and then from there

807
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:58,440
it's knowing what what it feels like to

808
00:29:56,398 --> 00:30:00,959
have like a clump in the joint so that

809
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:04,320
you can work those out stickier dry weed

810
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,120
all right it's got to be it's got to be

811
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:08,038
if I have to choose it's got to be

812
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:09,898
sticky it's easier to roll a sticky

813
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:13,319
definitely easier to roll and also dry

814
00:30:09,898 --> 00:30:16,379
weed it tends to to run more because

815
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:17,939
you'll get clumps on one side I mean I

816
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,559
have a guy that grows the most amazing

817
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:22,679
weed and it always comes out super

818
00:30:19,558 --> 00:30:25,379
[ __ ] dry yeah I mean Super dry yeah

819
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:27,419
but it rolls fine and it burns fine it

820
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:29,760
actually breaks down super [ __ ] fine

821
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:32,520
and so then it burns real slow oh okay

822
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:34,319
that makes sense but you know I like

823
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:35,519
sticky weed too I mean I want yeah I

824
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:37,678
want it so it doesn't matter how dry it

825
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:39,839
is the the resin is the sticky part yeah

826
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:42,298
yeah I I definitely prefer a little bit

827
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:44,339
on the fresher side yeah because then I

828
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:46,500
mean typically if I'm rolling like a

829
00:30:44,339 --> 00:30:48,778
pound of joints they're not being smoked

830
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:51,298
that next day as well so if you roll

831
00:30:48,778 --> 00:30:52,919
them when they're slightly fresher then

832
00:30:51,298 --> 00:30:55,079
they a lot they're allowed to cure up in

833
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:56,820
the paper a little bit and then you get

834
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:58,798
the joint when you'd want to smoke it

835
00:30:56,819 --> 00:31:01,200
yeah you don't get it when it's too

836
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:04,019
fresh or too dry

837
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:07,259
totally yeah you just for my Amsterdam

838
00:31:04,019 --> 00:31:10,500
we used to uh I I stayed in Amsterdam on

839
00:31:07,259 --> 00:31:14,879
and off for a lot a lot of uh you know

840
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:16,500
the 2010 through 2012 13 and 14. okay

841
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,960
yeah and I'd stay for extended amounts

842
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:22,019
of time with my buddy and he basically I

843
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,120
learned how to roll joints good for like

844
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:28,379
with the crutch yeah do a reverse role

845
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:29,579
in Amsterdam and my buddy Abba he taught

846
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:31,559
me how to do it I was staying with him

847
00:31:29,579 --> 00:31:33,599
and he like looked at my joint and he

848
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:35,278
was like sad for me yeah he was actually

849
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:36,719
sad for me he's like you need to learn

850
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:38,519
how to roll real good joints I don't

851
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,019
know what that is well a lot of a lot of

852
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:41,759
people are too heavy-handed with it

853
00:31:40,019 --> 00:31:44,038
where they try to like

854
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:46,319
crunch the paper into the form they

855
00:31:44,038 --> 00:31:50,940
think a joint should be yeah where it's

856
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:53,038
really like the less that you manipulate

857
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:55,860
the paper the better like so you're

858
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:58,619
almost using the paper to form the weed

859
00:31:55,859 --> 00:32:01,979
you're not necessarily like forming the

860
00:31:58,619 --> 00:32:04,379
paper itself it's almost like so the old

861
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:05,940
uh joint rolling you remember the joint

862
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,620
rollers from back yeah yeah yeah two

863
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,880
bars of course the whole concept is

864
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:10,558
doing the same thing with your hands

865
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,140
yeah and shaping it and then using that

866
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:16,259
top I I use the top paper to push over

867
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:19,679
yeah you know you're basically my when I

868
00:32:16,259 --> 00:32:21,839
roll my left thumb stays on the crutch

869
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,980
yeah and so it doesn't move from there

870
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:24,240
because that's basically the most

871
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,919
important part is getting that crutch

872
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,538
tight yeah and then from there you're

873
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,240
just basically what you said you're

874
00:32:27,538 --> 00:32:32,278
you're forming the weed but with the

875
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,038
paper as you're basically like your

876
00:32:32,278 --> 00:32:37,798
finger yeah and then as you go you're

877
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:39,599
getting that fold from here I'll get out

878
00:32:37,798 --> 00:32:41,359
of or actually you have a paper over

879
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:44,158
there yeah

880
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:46,139
so you're getting that fold

881
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,640
and that's the part that most people

882
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:49,740
struggle on

883
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:51,960
is getting the fold over

884
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:55,259
you're getting that fold

885
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:57,778
simply by going over that material

886
00:32:55,259 --> 00:33:00,599
and then running your thumb there enough

887
00:32:57,778 --> 00:33:02,759
to where the material is down and you

888
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:05,158
can get that glue strip over top of that

889
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:07,200
paper totally and that's what I think a

890
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:09,299
lot of people over complicate the the

891
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,319
whole thing and that's why I've sort of

892
00:33:09,298 --> 00:33:16,500
simplified my joint rolling process

893
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:19,500
whereas I don't roll these on mass yeah

894
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:22,200
I roll them I roll my joints a slightly

895
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:25,380
different way more like a cigar that can

896
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:27,960
be sort of rolled out totally how many

897
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:31,860
joints can you roll in a day

898
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:35,460
if I'm putting in a 10 11 hour day I can

899
00:33:31,859 --> 00:33:38,038
typically roll about 150 to like 160

900
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:40,798
joints nice so

901
00:33:38,038 --> 00:33:43,200
then I guess let's dive into what you

902
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:44,940
think number three is is that that one

903
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,240
got me high I feel I mean they've all

904
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:49,080
got I want to think have the best flavor

905
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:52,319
I would agree that it had the best

906
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:54,178
flavor the best finish it had [ __ ]

907
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:55,558
Terps and it's halfway down we keep

908
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:57,120
smoking that one because it tastes so

909
00:33:55,558 --> 00:34:00,000
[ __ ] yeah

910
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:02,518
um what kind of chirps

911
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,179
getting a little bit more

912
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:08,099
more of like an lcg terp yeah but it's

913
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:11,099
definitely like a good

914
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:14,099
candy chirp I would say like yeah candy

915
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:16,859
floral yeah candy floral gas

916
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:18,720
you know I feel like it got it has that

917
00:34:16,858 --> 00:34:21,179
it's not it's not linear it's definitely

918
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:24,059
layers of flavors it's good yeah that

919
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:26,099
definitely Cherry yeah [ __ ] strong

920
00:34:24,059 --> 00:34:28,019
Cherry note in there yeah I think I know

921
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:30,419
which one that would that one is yeah I

922
00:34:28,019 --> 00:34:32,460
would assume that one's the the what is

923
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:35,158
it Cherry poppers

924
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:37,440
I don't know we are gonna go through

925
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:39,358
these that one I would I would assume is

926
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,480
the most expensive one the most

927
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:46,559
expensive so I would go I would go

928
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:49,559
three two one so expensive middle low

929
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:52,398
that's what I'm going okay now

930
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:56,519
this one

931
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:58,019
is Oak Fruitland still amazing this this

932
00:34:56,519 --> 00:35:00,119
one's kind of special though so this Oak

933
00:34:58,019 --> 00:35:01,858
Fruitland was I went to cookies Hayward

934
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:04,140
big shout out to cookies Hayward but I

935
00:35:01,858 --> 00:35:07,319
went there today and picked that up it

936
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:09,659
was a thirty dollar uh thirty dollar

937
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:12,180
quarter ounce oh wow and normally it's

938
00:35:09,659 --> 00:35:14,279
like 60. yeah so that was their 30

939
00:35:12,179 --> 00:35:16,199
special the price for the price [ __ ]

940
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,240
yeah you you can't beat it but that's

941
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:21,299
the less than ten dollar again so this

942
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:23,459
was Oak fruit land and Sherbert times

943
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:25,500
piscotti yeah fortune cookies I remember

944
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:28,139
fortune cookies back in the day was just

945
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:30,900
a phenotype of

946
00:35:28,139 --> 00:35:33,000
Girl Scout cookies like the Forum cut or

947
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:34,920
maybe it was one of the other random

948
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,440
cuts that it was but fortune cookies was

949
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:39,780
just cookies so then the next one

950
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,900
boom I really want to smell this one but

951
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:46,980
this one right here was the lesson five

952
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:50,639
really so which it was good lesson five

953
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:52,980
the sativa one big Dave's Bud uh gummies

954
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:55,259
which was jet fuel gelato times peach

955
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:57,838
rings yeah yeah and uh that makes sense

956
00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:00,599
that peach rings that's from dying breed

957
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:01,699
[ __ ] Terps it's got good Terps I love

958
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:05,338
that one

959
00:36:01,699 --> 00:36:07,618
marionberry times uh that's definitely a

960
00:36:05,338 --> 00:36:09,059
sativa hybrid then yeah for sure I just

961
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:11,039
got the jet fuel gelato which is

962
00:36:09,059 --> 00:36:13,139
definitely on the other side so but as

963
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:17,039
far as it was uh

964
00:36:13,139 --> 00:36:19,379
hmm marionberry time something

965
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:22,259
but uh yeah so man I'm [ __ ] high off

966
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:25,680
that yeah so we we go in the the order

967
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:27,359
here and number three yeah you guessed

968
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:31,259
it yep it was definitely the more
