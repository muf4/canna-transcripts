like the Ryan Seacrest of cannabis holy

9
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,839
[ __ ] that's too much responsibility I

10
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:28,920
can't I can't take that right now

11
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:30,719
we can we can take it down a couple

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,700
notches but like literally I feel like

13
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,979
you are well versed in so many different

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,500
things uh we've known each other for

15
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:39,539
quite a long time long time and I don't

16
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,579
even know how many years yeah a lot of

17
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:45,359
experience we've we've seen different

18
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:48,239
places together Columbia uh We've yeah

19
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:52,859
been to events together lots of uh lots

20
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:54,179
of shows lots of Expos cannabis science

21
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:56,460
um good stuff and we have a lot of

22
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:59,340
mutual friends Ed Rosenthal absolutely

23
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,079
Gotta Love Ed and Jane Love Ed so yeah

24
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,640
so tell us a little bit history I guess

25
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,320
we'll touch on History a little bit and

26
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,519
we'll dive into some fun stuff but your

27
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,639
history how you got started with

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,618
cannabis Where it All Began

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,299
um so I got started in cannabis actually

30
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:16,319
right down the street from where we are

31
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:18,900
now off of uh Fruitvale in Oakland got

32
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:19,978
my first grow house there about 20 years

33
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,580
ago

34
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:25,739
and set it up with eight lights and a

35
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:27,900
tray of train wreck and grew a pound and

36
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:29,280
a half per light my first run which was

37
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,900
really good at the time I know that's

38
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,519
embarrassing to say now no that's

39
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,320
amazing I mean about a half you were

40
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:36,840
doing it right and that's pretty rare I

41
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:38,938
mean I think women sometimes for

42
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,100
whatever reason have this association

43
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:42,779
with this plant and they get better

44
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:44,519
results sometimes right out the gate I

45
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,159
mean I think it's kind of like a chef

46
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:49,560
right like our attention to detail and

47
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,420
the ability to multitask a bunch of

48
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,820
different things at the same time yeah

49
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,618
and kind of keep that mental list of all

50
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:58,319
of them sure

51
00:01:55,618 --> 00:02:01,078
um really helps and definitely seen some

52
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:03,539
amazing female cultivators come out

53
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:05,399
recently where it didn't used to be that

54
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,600
way I don't think I met another female

55
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,419
grower

56
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:12,719
for probably 10 years the whole time I

57
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:15,000
was doing it yeah a new one it was a

58
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:18,479
man's world and then there was the the

59
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,939
rare women like yourself you know my

60
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:23,780
aunt she was growing for for medicine in

61
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:27,300
back in the 90s probably even in the 80s

62
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:29,580
uh but yeah it was definitely mostly men

63
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:32,700
yeah yeah so and you're one of those

64
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,739
boundary pushers who kind of had to had

65
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:37,318
to be the first in a lot of regards as

66
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:38,878
far as Consulting and stuff like that

67
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:41,219
you were the only female consultant that

68
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:44,340
I knew of back in the day well I'm an

69
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:45,439
owner's rep not a consultant so sure I'd

70
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,360
like to explain the difference

71
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:50,280
absolutely consultants in the Cannabis

72
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,620
industry typically get a bad name and I

73
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,000
find that one of the reasons for that is

74
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,099
because

75
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,419
they double dip they'll take money from

76
00:02:56,098 --> 00:02:58,799
their clients and then they'll take

77
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:00,659
money from everything that's

78
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,459
incentivized all the way up that they

79
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:05,159
recommend to the grow

80
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:06,840
so the way we set up our practice was to

81
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:09,060
be an owner's rep which is traditional

82
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,158
in construction world to kind of back

83
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,080
the client get them the best possible

84
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:15,299
price and not take any incentives

85
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,400
sideways but yes it's Consulting of

86
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,200
sorts because you are guiding the

87
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,239
process and I think it was just

88
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,679
everybody used consultant back in the

89
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:25,500
day and now it's really evolved into

90
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,659
something much bigger yeah so I didn't

91
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,818
even know what a consultant was when I

92
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:31,979
started Consulting there wasn't any

93
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:35,039
there was no position called consultant

94
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:37,919
and yeah or mutual friend Ed Rosenthal

95
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,299
kind of pulled me up to Canada and they

96
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,158
were working on

97
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:44,219
what was the largest grow in the world

98
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:48,598
at the time 300 000 square foot facility

99
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:52,439
in Nova Scotia and it was the first time

100
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:54,238
I've ever met Ed and you know I met him

101
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:55,979
once here in Oakland before and then we

102
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,739
ended up going to Canada and working on

103
00:03:55,979 --> 00:04:00,539
that facility together and that kind of

104
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:04,680
snowballed into

105
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:06,900
what became cultivo which I started for

106
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,000
ten thousand dollars that I basically

107
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,900
maxed out on credit cards and then

108
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,759
became

109
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,739
what it was was built to be which was

110
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:17,039
one of the largest design build firms in

111
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:19,918
the space certainly yeah and yeah pretty

112
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,560
awesome and that just as far as a

113
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,839
reference on time that was almost 10

114
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,478
years ago or maybe probably about that

115
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:31,258
maybe a little longer I consulted for a

116
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:32,939
couple years other under another company

117
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:35,639
um and became their

118
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:37,860
uh director of construction under their

119
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:40,199
brand and then started my own about

120
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,280
three years later yeah yeah and you've

121
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,340
worked with some of the biggest brands

122
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,779
out there jungle boys uh you know mango

123
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:46,859
you're pretty tight with mango I don't

124
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:49,619
know how much you've done with them but

125
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,460
you're saying yeah we

126
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,680
um

127
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:54,239
I I can't take credit for anything that

128
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,680
that he's done but we definitely have

129
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,780
our friend group that we bounce ideas

130
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,000
off of each other and what's working and

131
00:04:57,779 --> 00:05:01,439
what isn't working and yeah I mean

132
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,740

00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:41,519
four-way manifolds that you can stack

149

163
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:10,500
working facility anyway right totally

164
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:12,180
that was in that environment like yeah

165
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,379
instead of showing you how to do it in

166
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,819
their environment they could actually do

167
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:16,800
it in your environment and kind of set

168
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:18,360
you up exactly yeah which is really cool

169
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,280
it's all the pressures make sure it's

170
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,520
working appropriately amazing people

171
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:25,978
yeah great service yeah let's talk about

172
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:29,339
Micah I love talking about Micah you

173
00:06:25,978 --> 00:06:31,620
know he's my God yeah Mike he's a very

174
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:33,119
dear mutual friend of both of ours

175
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,939
um they're yeah really close I mean he's

176
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,819
like family to both of us yeah uh you

177
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:40,620
know I started breeding with Micah and

178
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:42,360
you started growing with Micah to a

179
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,819
degree and we're that's that's how we

180
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,699
know each other the same Circle

181
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:50,460
so did Micah were you growing before you

182
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:52,500
met Micah or yeah I was growing with a

183
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:54,060
couple other friends and then several

184
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,699
other friends through yeah and then we I

185
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,439
met through Micah and my I we had a

186
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:00,180
mutual friend he didn't really want to

187
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:03,418
introduce me to Micah and then we

188
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:05,220
randomly met at a restaurant and then

189
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:08,818
had became we've been friends ever since

190
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:13,500
so that was 20 plus years ago I met him

191
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:17,720
originally in 97. okay I think 98 Maybe

192
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:19,918
I've known Micah since fourth grade

193
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,259
and he was

194
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:24,659
um my older brother's friend and friends

195
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:26,460
with Ryan Gatica and some of these other

196
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:29,039
guys that are all kind of close in our

197
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:30,538
Circle and um

198
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:33,060
you know he was growing plants when he

199
00:07:30,538 --> 00:07:35,699
was like 16 like out in the hills of

200
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:38,399
Santa Barbara or whatever it was and so

201
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:42,000
he always had this you know wonderful

202
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:44,399
relationship with the plant and then I

203
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,220
moved to San Francisco Bay Area when I

204
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,598
was like 18.

205
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:51,780
and Micah was kind of one of the only

206
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:53,579
people I knew here yeah and uh saw his

207
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:55,379
setup for the first time which was

208
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:58,258
basically him and his couple of

209
00:07:55,379 --> 00:08:00,899
Roommates had octagons set up in there

210
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:04,098
basement you know with the tube lights

211
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:06,418
and the yeah so it was probably

212
00:08:04,098 --> 00:08:08,519
1998 or something like that when because

213
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:10,620
he lived in Oakland in the Oakland Hills

214
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:11,579
and we had octagons I met him because he

215
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,639
came over and helped him build an

216
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:16,680
octagon and we both like partying back

217
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,660
then and yeah and good weed and he

218
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:22,379
always had like the sour and the chem

219
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:26,340
and yeah yeah OG we had OG we had the

220
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:27,900
dog the original dog yeah yeah d-awg I

221
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:30,500
talked about on my last podcast too did

222
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:32,819
you yeah so yeah yeah that's a classic

223
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,019
do you still have that yeah it's still

224
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,000
around yeah all right we're gonna have

225
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:37,079
to talk after the show oh yeah well now

226
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,580
everything's got to go through tissue

227
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,959
culture you know it's like we're putting

228
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,940
everything through tissue culture to

229
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:43,619
clean it most of the stuff if it doesn't

230
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,720
have hot plate and veroid it has other

231
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,860
you know systemic bacteria and other

232
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,019
pathogens

233
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,940
so we try to keep every start clean stay

234
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:52,799
clean that's Justin's motto I love it

235
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,200
it's just so I know you're you're a

236
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:57,719
purist and you like a lot of the same

237
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,459
old school gassy stuff that I do oh yeah

238
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,740
so are you is that a part of your

239
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:04,018
process of bringing back these kind of

240
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,959
older genetics through tissue culture

241
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:09,360
and yeah integrating them I I think that

242
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:11,458
gas will always come back I think that

243
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,620
these things for connoisseurs they like

244
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:15,239
this you know the and the thing is some

245
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,820
of them may change like we have you know

246
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:21,240
the chemd was the original like super

247
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:23,820
foul gas and then GMO is just like a

248
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,980
brighter chemd but it's they're both

249
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,360
amazing it's just different and I think

250
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,580
these things will change and people will

251
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,860
breed gas but I think

252
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,720
right now at this moment in time people

253
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,759
want color it's just such a weird thing

254
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,560
that like they put a high demand and

255
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:39,299
high price on color that you've got to

256
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:41,278
have color in your stuff and there's

257
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:44,639
gassy stuff with color I mean even like

258
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:47,159
Jokers the strange Jokers that has a

259
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:49,319
strong gas and it's purple yeah but I

260
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:50,819
will always breed with gas and go back

261
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,260
towards those things because those are

262
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,240
the things that I enjoy the most right

263
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:56,939
and they're nostalgic because they

264
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,200
remind me of childhood or yeah growing

265
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,940
up hanging out with Micah back in the

266
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,740
day or hanging out with certain friends

267
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,019
it reminds like anytime I smell sour

268
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:06,240
diesel it reminds me of Josh yeah you

269
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:08,100
know I mean absolutely Josh would have

270
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,320
these pounds of sour diesel and they

271
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,820
were outdoor and they were so sticky and

272
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,860
you'd open the bag and it would just hit

273
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,180
you in the face you know you don't you

274
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,580
don't really see that as often anymore

275
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:19,439
even yeah even with the best stuff it's

276
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,240
it's very rare to have stuff where you

277
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,540
open it and it's just like this bright

278
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:28,379
punch to the face with Terps Terps and

279
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:29,519
dials yeah yeah and I remember like back

280
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:31,379
in the day

281
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,299
you know you'd have a specific grower

282
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:35,338
and they maybe grew two or three things

283
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:37,620
like this is my two or three things

284
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:40,560
that's it you know

285
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,659
um purple Urkel and sour d and then they

286
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:44,399
had you know

287
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:45,778
a blue dream yeah not that there's

288
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,578
anything wrong with blue dream but

289
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:49,740
people really perfected the process

290
00:10:47,578 --> 00:10:51,539
because they didn't have 10 11 12

291
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,339
strains in one room that they were

292
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:54,958
trying to acclimate to the same lighting

293
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:56,100
and different ones every cycle it's like

294
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:58,139
you're growing the same thing over and

295
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,879
over I feel like the best Growers are

296
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:02,699
the ones that have really perfected that

297
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:03,659
specific cultivar yeah I mean in the

298
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,000
future there's going to be directions

299
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:07,919
that come with your cultivars yeah you

300
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,480
get it from uh you know either tissue

301
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:10,860
culture or whatever the facility that

302
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,620
you're getting that clone from to grow

303
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,180
it out or seed from and you can give

304
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,860
people directions like you're gonna need

305
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:18,719
more nitrogen you're gonna need more of

306
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,480
this and you know I think these Harvest

307
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,278
windows they're great like 70 days but

308
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,579
that's also specific to the environment

309
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:28,200
as well in the lighting too absolutely

310
00:11:26,578 --> 00:11:30,659
it would be nice when we can kind of

311
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,399
fine-tune those spectrums I know that

312
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:34,379
there are certain cultivars that just

313
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,139
suffer under LEDs and don't do well

314
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:39,539
right you know and then once you're able

315
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:41,338
to play with that Spectrum along with

316
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:43,199
the environment you can really fine tune

317
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:45,180
it so I think that's I mean that's the

318
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,820
future yeah it's all fine-tuning and I

319
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:49,799
think it's I keep on talking about data

320
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,240
points a lot with people and even on the

321
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:52,799
show but collecting the more data points

322
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,839
we have the more we can improve stuff

323
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:56,338
including our palettes right including

324
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,800
the way we do lighting including

325
00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:01,500
nutrition it's like data points are just

326
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:03,240
so huge I'm big on data points yeah you

327
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,700
know that but um you're big on taking

328
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:08,778
notes you've uh I'm a good note taker

329
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,778
you're a good note taker

330
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:13,379
um but yeah data points specifically

331
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:15,958
like now we've got you know we're doing

332
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:18,179
outdoor this year so it's outdoor's a

333
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:19,739
little more difficult yeah you can take

334
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:21,000
all the best notes in the world and the

335
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,980
next year could be completely different

336
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,139
yeah God's just like nope we're gonna

337
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:28,019
start in early rain we're gonna have a

338
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:29,639
you know hurricane in uh August

339
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:31,679
hurricane in August and then we're gonna

340
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:33,539
have humidity of 85 for the next two

341
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:35,278
weeks which was amazing because we're on

342
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:37,860
our last bit of stretch before

343
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:39,899
everything flips and so they've loved

344
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:42,000
this weather so far so

345
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:43,559
I can't wait yeah I just drove down from

346
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,259
Oregon and we had like torrential

347
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:47,638
downpour coming into California I mean I

348
00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:50,100
think that's good it's good for the air

349
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:52,019
quality for sure yeah

350
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,360
um any rain's good for California any

351
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:56,220
rain not necessarily for plants at the

352
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,200
end of the cycle like those early

353
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,820
October rains yeah especially if you

354
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,040
grow really big buds and you get the

355
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:04,139
yeah issues botrytis and other things

356
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:06,360
like that yeah we're

357
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:10,320
um doing more row crop style so more

358
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:12,539
plants closer together less volume or

359
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,278
mass I prefer that especially at scale I

360
00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:16,199
mean I I know there's guys men no dope

361
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:18,600
these guys growing these you know 20

362
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:21,060
pound plants that are 25 feet wide by 20

363
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,159
feet tall and really cool I mean it's

364
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:25,979
it's cool everyone's got their own style

365
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:29,458
and I'm not one to knock anyone's style

366
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:33,839
but I do feel that it's partially left

367
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:36,659
over from the 99 plant count limit days

368
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,279
where absolutely you know you had to

369
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:40,379
grow the biggest plan as possible you

370
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:41,578
get one Harvest a year and then they

371
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:43,439
have six plants and you're like I'm

372
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:46,138
gonna do the six biggest freaking places

373
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,420
plants I can but when you try to process

374
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:50,820
it and take down that mass again but try

375
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:53,519
this pathogens for sure

376
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,920
but then even processing it like 75 of

377
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,539
that plant is junk yeah you know and

378
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:59,879
you're still only pulling your top Buds

379
00:13:57,539 --> 00:14:02,278
and your your outliers and then you have

380
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:04,679
all this mass in the middle that's

381
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:07,399
basically worthless right what's your

382
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:07,399
take on Autoflower

383
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,659
um

384
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:15,540
[Music]

385
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:19,078
flower I I look forward to the future of

386
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:19,860
Autoflower I don't think it's there yet

387
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:21,838
um

388
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,100
but I think it's getting there and I

389
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,660
think for

390
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,800
you know it depends what you're doing

391
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:32,100
with it if you're making extract

392
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:34,379
products carts Edibles like definitely

393
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,839
absolutely a place in the market for it

394
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:38,519
I'm Gonna Run them next year and see see

395
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:40,139
how we like them I might give you a call

396
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:41,698
for some advice yeah I definitely have

397
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:43,139
some autoflowers for you yeah and I

398
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:45,539
think at scale when you're looking at

399
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:47,519
doing 100 acres or 200 Acres or 300

400
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:49,639
acres autoflowers definitely makes sense

401
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,500
because they're very predictable yeah

402
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:54,060
and I think in the right

403
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,679
it's in the right place in The Right Use

404
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:58,439
they're amazing they're absolutely

405
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:01,019
amazing and we're getting very distinct

406
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,060
profiles and we're getting stuff that's

407
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:05,820
so much more consistent where there's

408
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:07,559
less phenotypical variation and you know

409
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,000
but but again I think there's more work

410
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:10,919
that needs to be done I agree for sure

411
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,419
yeah and it's getting there because if

412
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:14,338
you look at where it is now compared to

413
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:16,979
10 years ago it's a whole different ball

414
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:18,480
game I want you asked me 10 years ago I

415
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,800
would have said no I'm never touching

416
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,659
autoflowers I don't want to breed that

417
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:23,219
stuff yeah I was in Spain looking at

418
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:25,620
plants that were This Tall that were

419
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:27,120
yielding like seven grams and why would

420
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,159
you grow a seven gram plant you know

421
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,919
unless that's all you can do yeah

422
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:35,399
but if you grow them 12 inches apart

423
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:38,039
totally all the way down and then double

424
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:39,360
stacking Rose vertical yeah you got an

425
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:41,769
outdoor sea of green

426
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,278
so let's talk about Chevy volts

427
00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:46,439
[Laughter]

428
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:47,639
I love my Chevy the best kept secret in

429
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,399
the industry was not secret anymore

430
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:52,919
because it doesn't exist right so

431
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:58,078
um yeah that was funny because

432
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:59,599
what year was that like 2014 13. so 2013

433
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:02,819
14.

434
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,839
Micah drives up with a Chevy Volt and

435
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,120
I'm like

436
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,860
what is this no was it was a leaf it was

437
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,659
originally it was a Nissan Leaf first

438
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:12,120
and then

439
00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:15,059
best kept secret in cannabis because

440
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,860
they were reducing your kilowatt hour if

441
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:19,138
you bought one of these electric cars

442
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:21,419
for a period of eight hours which is

443
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:23,039
what it took the car to charge right and

444
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:24,479
they reduced it from

445
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:27,120
I don't know what we were paying in

446
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,220
kilowatt hour back then but it it was

447
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,198
less than half and so if you went out

448
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:34,019
and got one of these cars

449
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:36,000
the car paid for itself basically you

450
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:37,399
got a free car and your power bill was

451
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,139
cut in half yeah

452
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:42,000
it felt like I was everyone it felt like

453
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:44,159
we were stealing power yeah but it was

454
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,078
legal legal loophole but literally all

455
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:48,419
our friends within the period of six

456
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:50,099
months went out and got Chevy volts

457
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:51,958
Nissan leaves all these electric cars

458
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,699
yeah for these rebates and like

459
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:56,099
literally everyone's driving these are

460
00:16:53,698 --> 00:16:58,740
guys who can afford yeah nice cars but

461
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,839
we all drove electric cars and yeah

462
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,339
better for the environment and you

463
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:04,318
didn't want a nice car when you were a

464
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:07,500
grower back then absolutely I feel like

465
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:10,318
that's a recent thing you know the flex

466
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:12,179
was different five ten years yeah like

467
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:14,220
you want to feel a Toyota truck you're

468
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:16,319
like so in the 90s we all had Honda

469
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,818
Civics and then there was the occasional

470
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:19,578
guy that got the Accord and it's like

471
00:17:17,818 --> 00:17:22,318
dude you got to be careful with people

472
00:17:19,578 --> 00:17:24,659
check your rear view mirrors seriously

473
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:25,859
road driving Civics for a reason we you

474
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:28,140
know we want to blend in and that was

475
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:30,719
the most popular car back in the 90s so

476
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:32,880
everybody got yeah some of these guys

477
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,339
are making crazy money blend yeah

478
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,299
they're they're driving money when you

479
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:39,000
know I mean we didn't really wear

480
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:41,700
watches back then either as much no

481
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,619
nothing fancy it wasn't a priority yeah

482
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:47,340
so and it was more about the weed back

483
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:49,079
then too I think to a degree yeah so

484
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:49,859
people that were in it were in it yeah I

485
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:51,298
mean

486
00:17:49,859 --> 00:17:54,839
remember when we used to cure in these

487
00:17:51,298 --> 00:17:56,700
jars we like burped the jars

488
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:58,439
that was the way to do it you know and

489
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,480
then you'd get like a box of these jars

490
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,519
just yeah dank is sweet you've ever

491
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,460
smoked in your life it was always good I

492
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:07,319
recently transitioned from jar for my

493
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,960
personal I went to the terplock bags

494
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:11,339
after doing side-by-side tests and I

495
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,960
really like terplock what they do is

496
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:15,359
they control the humidity and they off

497
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,400
gas the CO2 whereas like you don't get

498
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:19,619
that with the glass the only thing is is

499
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,320
like the the only disadvantage the

500
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:24,000
turblock is the it's a bag and if you

501
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:25,619
put in your backpack you can have squish

502
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,599
Buds and I like the shape of my buds

503
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:30,839
yeah but you can always put them in a

504
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:33,298
glass jar so okay so I have tons of jars

505
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:34,918
if you need to borrow some okay so you

506
00:18:33,298 --> 00:18:37,440
were using the jar method for your

507
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:40,500
personal up until like oh it's up until

508
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,480
uh less than a year ago but yeah I've

509
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,640
still used jars I like jars I like the

510
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,380
way that yeah and then putting the jars

511
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,179
keeping them in a cool environment it

512
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:50,100
keeps your buds from getting crushed

513
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:54,080
yeah for one thing and it looks cool

514
00:18:50,099 --> 00:18:54,079
because you can look at your product too

515
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:59,099
um but yeah now we got the infinity jars

516
00:18:56,579 --> 00:19:00,779
that are UV they're black they work

517
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:03,298
really good at keeping all the Terps in

518
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:04,859
yeah I like the infinity jars

519
00:19:03,298 --> 00:19:07,918
so yeah there's so many options now

520
00:19:04,859 --> 00:19:10,199
that's the beauty of the legal Market

521
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,299
uh is the options there's options for

522
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:17,100
everything and maybe it's it's sensory

523
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:19,200
overload to a degree yeah no I remember

524
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:21,779
feeling like I was set in my ways and

525
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,179
not learning anything for 10 years and

526
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:26,220
then when I started working in the legal

527
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:29,340
Market I learned something new every day

528
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:31,019
I learned 10 new things every day it's I

529
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:33,298
do too but I forget about five of them

530
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:37,019
if you retain the other five you're

531
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:37,019
doing really well seriously

532
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,380
um that's why you got to take notes

533
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,660
right that's why you're gonna have those

534
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:44,820
it's so important and now you can record

535
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:49,259
it and have it dictate to the notes it's

536
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:51,720
great AI is amazing yeah scary and

537
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:53,038
amazing and you know everything now oh

538
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,259
yeah you can record conversations

539
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:57,119
directly to notes

540
00:19:55,259 --> 00:19:58,798
so it's it's pretty great some of this

541
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:00,418
stuff is really amazing

542
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:03,058
I'm still old-fashioned though I'll

543
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:05,038
still pull out my notepad and transcribe

544
00:20:03,058 --> 00:20:07,798
it later like I feel like it helps yeah

545
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:09,900
my process to to think it out and have a

546
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:11,099
notepad even though I can type faster

547
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,440
than I write

548
00:20:11,099 --> 00:20:15,899
yeah I still take notes by hand too yeah

549
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,759
so you'll be able to scan them in with

550
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,320
AI and then it'll put them in Nice Notes

551
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:21,538
for all your friends yeah no I still

552
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:23,399
digitize them afterwards it's the best

553
00:20:21,538 --> 00:20:24,720
so tell us about what you're doing now

554
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,419
because you're doing all kinds of cool

555
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,700
stuff I mean you have a show yeah

556
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:32,220
um so I'm doing

557
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,720
um I actually so during covid I was

558
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,319
working

559
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:40,380
um in about three different states

560
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:42,119
and the airport shut down and for my job

561
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:44,520
with cultivo

562
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:48,119
I was the main owner's rep I was kind of

563
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:50,038
the go-to for most of the

564
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:52,319
um project management and structure of

565
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:54,058
how these buildings rolled out and I

566
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:56,159
would take on you know four to eight

567
00:20:54,058 --> 00:20:57,960
buildings at a time and I'd be juggling

568
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,940
a few hundred thousand square feet of

569
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:02,340
building at any given time in multiple

570
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:04,080
different states so it was on a plane

571
00:21:02,339 --> 00:21:05,099
pretty much every week for about eight

572
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:06,599
years

573
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:09,058
and

574
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:11,399
then when covet hit I couldn't get on

575
00:21:09,058 --> 00:21:13,379
the plane anymore and I had all of these

576
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,240
I usually would take all the projects

577
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:17,820
around the same time so all these

578
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,740
buildings wrapping at once and then a

579
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:22,619
waiting list of about 600 000 square

580
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:25,679
feet of building to pick up and I just

581
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:26,819
couldn't pick up the phone to take the

582
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,519
call I feel like a lot of people

583
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:31,980
reassess their lives during covet and

584
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:34,139
right I was one of those people so you

585
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:36,779
know I just I I couldn't building

586
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:38,220
facilities is such an intense process

587
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:40,678
because you're not just building a

588
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:42,600
facility you're in building an entire

589
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:44,159
business model at least the way that we

590
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:46,319
do it we have to know exactly how many

591
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,600
plants you have in the facility will

592
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:51,058
calculate your clones off of that we'll

593
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:53,639
understand how much you know Cuts you're

594
00:21:51,058 --> 00:21:55,619
comfortable taking off of a mom and then

595
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,960
everything is built from the inside out

596
00:21:55,619 --> 00:22:01,139
we're typically an architectural design

597
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:04,140
it's built from the outside in right

598
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:06,240
um and so you know you become a part of

599
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:08,340
the staff augmentation you become a part

600
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,259
of every part of the process you're the

601
00:22:08,339 --> 00:22:12,720
person that gets called at four in the

602
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:14,879
morning if any irrigation system goes

603
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,259
out in you know Florida or something

604
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,500
right

605
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:20,460
um so it was a lot but I I loved it and

606
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,919
I

607
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:25,380
um really enjoyed my my job my career

608
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:27,419
everything that I built and

609
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:29,700
but I just got kind of tired and burnt

610
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:31,860
out at the same time so

611
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,600
sitting at home for like two three

612
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:35,759
months going you know I really need to

613
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:37,558
take another job here take another

614
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:41,640
client on

615
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:43,440
um and uh you know one of uh a partner

616
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,820
that I worked with previously that was a

617
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,558
client kind of said you know what are

618
00:22:44,819 --> 00:22:48,418
you doing and I said I think I'm

619
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:52,139
starting a farm again like I want to

620
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:55,020
come full circle and go back to growing

621
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:56,580
and um you know that kind of evolved

622
00:22:55,019 --> 00:22:59,099
into looking all over California

623
00:22:56,579 --> 00:23:01,619
understanding the tax structure and all

624
00:22:59,099 --> 00:23:04,678
of the 400 plus jurisdictions and what

625
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:06,599
they were doing on the local tax level

626
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:09,419
um came across Lake County for the grow

627
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:13,319
the growing climate uh the tax structure

628
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:15,380
all of it picked up these properties and

629
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:17,579
we have a 67 000 square foot

630
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:21,059
manufacturing facility which is all

631
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:22,798
solventless and allocated to it's about

632
00:23:21,058 --> 00:23:25,319
seven different buildings that make up

633
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:26,879
that square footage so we've got a

634
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:29,819
drying structure that's just allocated

635
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,580
to drying we've got a manufacturing

636
00:23:29,819 --> 00:23:34,798
component that we can run solventless at

637
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:36,119
scale and big kind of Brewery equipment

638
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:38,639
nice

639
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:41,339
um we've got Automated Packaging bagging

640
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,440
pre-rolls I've automated everything in

641
00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:45,359
the facility with the the best possible

642
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:49,860
equipment that I could

643
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:51,538
and the idea behind that model is to

644
00:23:49,859 --> 00:23:53,879
um there's so many small farmers in my

645
00:23:51,538 --> 00:23:55,859
area and they're you know I talk to some

646
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,960
people and they're still trimming last

647
00:23:55,859 --> 00:24:01,918
year's product you know husband and wife

648
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:03,538
team just so I feel like if we buy all

649
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,159
of the big equipment that the

650
00:24:03,538 --> 00:24:07,319
corporations have

651
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:10,200
these small farmers have a chance to

652
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:12,480
compete at that level if we can bring

653
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,700
their cogs down that's awesome

654
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,740
yeah and Lake county is a special area I

655
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:19,200
was up in Lake County

656
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:22,319
I guess four or five years ago now doing

657
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,940
some seed production and uh yeah it's

658
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:25,558
it's a beautiful place and there's still

659
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,538
Boutique Farmers up there doing a great

660
00:24:25,558 --> 00:24:29,759
job and yeah the environment's pretty

661
00:24:27,538 --> 00:24:31,379
cool I think

662
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:33,480
there's not a lot of great restaurants

663
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,919
up there but there's some there are not

664
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,200
a lot of great restaurants but there's a

665
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:40,440
couple yeah so no I moved up to Lake

666
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,519
County uh packed my bags in La you've

667
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,320
been talking about this for a while

668
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:44,940
though in the whole Consulting thing

669
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:46,379
about like getting your own grow and

670
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:50,820
growing getting your hands in the dirt

671
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:54,299
again so the idea behind cultivo was

672
00:24:50,819 --> 00:24:56,639
always to get my own facility right

673
00:24:54,298 --> 00:24:58,400
um so I thought that cultivo would be a

674
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,000
catalyst to

675
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,880
entering

676
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,279
um you know the the legal realm with my

677
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,559
own facility right now

678
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:09,119
it happened almost overnight remember

679
00:25:07,558 --> 00:25:11,759
like back when we were putting our

680
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:14,519
garages together you know maybe you'd

681
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:16,558
spend 20 grand yeah then Colorado came

682
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:18,418
online with these bigger buildings and

683
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:19,740
these guys were spending

684
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:22,740
100

685
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:24,839
000 50 000 right and then all of a

686
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:28,079
sudden these buildings went from 100 to

687
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:32,099
200 000 to build out to 20 million yeah

688
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:33,058
and it was like okay that's a lot of

689
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:34,980
plans

690
00:25:33,058 --> 00:25:36,899
and so

691
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:39,778
um yeah that was always kind of the the

692
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:41,400
driver behind cultivo but

693
00:25:39,778 --> 00:25:43,079
you know and I really I really love

694
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:46,080
building I loved

695
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:48,359
being able to walk away from it give

696
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:51,418
someone else the keys right like okay

697
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:54,479
this is your baby now you know

698
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:56,880
and um and that was fun for a lot of

699
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,500
years but now it's fun going through the

700
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,740
whole process again

701
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:03,359
building the staff you know driving the

702
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,220
race car and doing it all for yourself

703
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:07,439
too and helping other people in the

704
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,400
process like the you know but yeah we're

705
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,778
definitely

706
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,400
um still growing

707
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:13,798
um but our our

708
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:16,440
throughput you know would be like two

709
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:18,179
weeks in that facility so when the

710
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,759
licensing process if there isn't easy

711
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:24,120
necessarily no no it's a little

712
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:25,558
challenging for sure it was for a little

713
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:29,219
bit they had a program called early

714
00:26:25,558 --> 00:26:32,158
activation where it was designed to help

715
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:33,778
um small farmers get to the other side

716
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,000
so they would give them a temporary

717
00:26:33,778 --> 00:26:36,960
license and then what happened with that

718
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,579
is

719
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,079
I think everyone kind of thought it was

720
00:26:38,579 --> 00:26:43,500
a building permit so they started

721
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:45,778
grading and doing major work and so the

722
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,859
county shut down that program right and

723
00:26:45,778 --> 00:26:49,619
then made everyone go through the

724
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:51,479
process which is about

725
00:26:49,619 --> 00:26:53,879
and this is you know someone who

726
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:57,240
expedites plans for a living it's taken

727
00:26:53,880 --> 00:27:00,659
us two and a half years per project to

728
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:03,720
get through much different than la

729
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:05,039
LA's got its own challenges La will take

730
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,120
you three years just to get your power

731
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:08,940
drop

732
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:12,000
um right but yeah they've all got their

733
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:13,740
different challenges so for sure yeah

734
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,720
nice and you guys are planted this year

735
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:17,220
we're planted yeah we're planted on two

736
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,400
acres

737
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:22,500
um roughly and that's kind of our

738
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,360
what I would call our r d farm so where

739
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:26,700
we'd probably run Autos run different

740
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:29,158
genetics cultivars see what we want to

741
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:31,080
put in rotation nice um and then we're

742
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:34,320
building kind of another Farm up the

743
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:38,220
street uh from that and um that'll be

744
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:40,319
going in probably next next year 2024.

745
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:42,000
that's awesome yeah well you want to try

746
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:44,158
one of these pre-rolls

747
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,019
I do but I'm gonna

748
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,840
I spoke

749
00:27:46,019 --> 00:27:51,960
so this is actually some Skittles okay

750
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:54,058
and uh

751
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,319
it's mild it has a ceiling it so it

752
00:27:54,058 --> 00:27:57,000
doesn't get you too high

753
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:58,740
my business partner he doesn't smoke

754
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,619
weed but I started so I've been working

755
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:05,298
on these pre-rolls getting the right tip

756
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:08,459
we have the bamboo Crush in here from

757
00:28:05,298 --> 00:28:10,200
organotips uh the right paper I've been

758
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:12,659
I like rice paper actually better than

759
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,580
these but uh I do like raw I like

760
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:16,919
supporting raw I love them or hate them

761
00:28:14,579 --> 00:28:19,019
I like their you like the paper I like

762
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:21,600
the product I do well I like the company

763
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:24,000
too yeah and uh but I do like the way

764
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:26,158
rice paper tastes I feel like it's not

765
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,778
as harsh as the papers

766
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,120
so we've been working on the right

767
00:28:27,778 --> 00:28:32,278
temperature to where like I was doing

768
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:34,979
real fatties that were bigger we've done

769
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:37,740
them smaller and these ones actually can

770
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:40,519
I see yep you can dry hit it are these

771
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,519
all um

772
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:46,080
like Knox boxes no these are all hand

773
00:28:44,579 --> 00:28:48,899
rolled and we're going to have them

774
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:51,240
numbered per you know one of x amount

775
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,440
and you know I think it's a fun product

776
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,778
and it's gonna be a while before we

777
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:58,380
launched anything like this but

778
00:28:54,778 --> 00:29:00,000
I uh I really enjoy the flavor and it

779
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:02,278
has if they're too wide they burn too

780
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,019
hot you don't get the Terps they're too

781
00:29:02,278 --> 00:29:05,640
narrow they don't get as many turfs

782
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:07,379
because you're just not able to draw in

783
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,900
as many but so I feel like it's the

784
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:12,900
perfect balance in like the 3.5 grams is

785
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:16,320
a nice round eighth you always come with

786
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:20,480
the big bad joints and then I

787
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:20,480
watch me get real quiet really quick

788
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:25,380
I like the way they smoke

789
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:26,398
feel like

790
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:28,559
um

791
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:30,898
the flavor is the best and if you have

792
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:32,339
good flour you can re-fire to any one

793
00:29:30,898 --> 00:29:34,859
point you can put it back in the tube

794
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:37,079
that it came in let it sit for a day or

795
00:29:34,859 --> 00:29:38,398
even two days if it's really good you

796
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:39,480
can fire back up and it still tastes

797
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:42,479
good

798
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:45,058
yeah you're probably like the best joint

799
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,099
roller I think in the industry is that

800
00:29:45,058 --> 00:29:48,538
is there a title for that I'd be like

801
00:29:47,099 --> 00:29:51,778
every time I run into you you have like

802
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:54,240
this perfectly rolled you know it's like

803
00:29:51,778 --> 00:29:55,980
sure I like to smoke too yeah and so I

804
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,919
really put a lot of attention to detail

805
00:29:55,980 --> 00:30:00,720
into what I'm smoking

806
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:02,100
and uh but yeah there's guys that do

807
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,819
better professional Joy roller and

808
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:04,678
Instagram

809
00:30:02,819 --> 00:30:07,200
he was on the podcast and he does really

810
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:09,899
good stuff and that's he can roll 125 of

811
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,120
them a day I can't do that wow

812
00:30:09,898 --> 00:30:14,219
that's a lot

813
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:16,319
yeah I'm I'm really bad at rolling

814
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:18,899
joints still even 20 years later it's

815
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:21,359
like a mental block for me right so I

816
00:30:18,898 --> 00:30:24,298
always buddy up to Someone Like You So

817
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:26,219
that I'm like hey you roll a joint

818
00:30:24,298 --> 00:30:28,079
as long as they smoke

819
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:29,880
I mean I can make it happen but it's not

820
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:33,178
pretty totally

821
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:35,220
looks like a bent toothpick like

822
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:39,080
they're all about five to six months

823
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:39,079
pregnant yeah that's okay

824
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:46,380
they say it's better to try and it

825
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:48,599
failed than never to have tried

826
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:51,179
that's

827
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:52,678
but yeah we uh we almost died in a

828
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:56,220
private jet

829
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:58,080
five years ago the PJ incident uh-huh oh

830
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:00,240
my God you're flying out of LA and it

831
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:02,759
wasn't LAX it was uh Burbank I believe

832
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:05,220
well it was the the private jet airport

833
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:09,058
in Van Nuys there next to Burbank

834
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:11,159
airport right but we had a

835
00:31:09,058 --> 00:31:14,700
wealthy client it wasn't our private jet

836
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:16,620
just uh no no no no we're not there yet

837
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,519
right

838
00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:22,398
um

839
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:25,440
so yeah we we were going somewhere uh

840
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:27,298
and that was crazy I still tell that

841
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,100
story when people tell me they're afraid

842
00:31:27,298 --> 00:31:31,019
of airplanes I'm like well what I

843
00:31:29,099 --> 00:31:33,898
remember about it was that we flipped to

844
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:34,819
1500 feet and then we fell out of the

845
00:31:33,898 --> 00:31:39,000
sky

846
00:31:34,819 --> 00:31:40,859
and I remember my phone I I was wearing

847
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,919
my seatbelt loose because I remember my

848
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:45,538
my butt completely off of the seat in my

849
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,399
cell phone hit the ceiling and then flew

850
00:31:45,538 --> 00:31:49,619
to the back of the plane and then my

851
00:31:47,398 --> 00:31:51,719
coffee cup

852
00:31:49,619 --> 00:31:53,398
so your coffee I think you your coffee

853
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:56,819
went all over you and then my coffee cup

854
00:31:53,398 --> 00:31:58,979
went up in the air it said a couple 360s

855
00:31:56,819 --> 00:32:01,079
and landed on my head and landed on your

856
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:03,360
head yes one in my lap I don't think I

857
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:05,099
had coffee in mine luckily no there was

858
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:06,658
because I had to go take a shower at the

859
00:32:05,099 --> 00:32:09,298
airport because I was covered in coffee

860
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:10,500
but we were just taking off from the

861
00:32:09,298 --> 00:32:14,038
airport

862
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:16,019
and I mean we just dropped like it was

863
00:32:14,038 --> 00:32:18,119
at that moment you're like we fell 500

864
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:21,179
feet out of the sky literally 500 feet

865
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:23,699
and we were only 1500 up yep so

866
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:26,278
it's not very far no it was like a

867
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:29,278
roller coaster yeah but but way crazier

868
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:31,200
but I guess what had happened in that

869
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:33,058
area in Burbank

870
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,380
like by the airport over there you have

871
00:32:33,058 --> 00:32:36,240
to Coast because there's all the houses

872
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:39,120
and so they actually

873
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:43,019
take up to a certain in the to a certain

874
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:46,379
elevation and then have to uh coast and

875
00:32:43,019 --> 00:32:48,839
when the pilot was going up to 1500 feet

876
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:51,480
she pushed the autopilot button and we

877
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:53,699
didn't go into autopilot actually like

878
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:55,558
knocked it out or something like that I

879
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:57,419
don't remember she tried to explain the

880
00:32:55,558 --> 00:33:01,079
story like three times and then the real

881
00:32:57,419 --> 00:33:02,820
story came out yeah as our our buddy was

882
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:06,298
kind of new planes and was prodding

883
00:33:02,819 --> 00:33:08,220
about what just happened

884
00:33:06,298 --> 00:33:10,379
um yeah I know that was that was really

885
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:12,360
it was that moment where you're like oh

886
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:14,880
this is what seat belts are for on

887
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:16,678
airplanes totally you don't realize like

888
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,179
no if you fall on this guy you're gonna

889
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:19,860
want to be in a seatbelt yeah you can

890
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:22,559
break your neck on the roof of the plane

891
00:33:19,859 --> 00:33:24,778
very easily I realized that so when I

892
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:27,240
get into an airplane now every time I

893
00:33:24,778 --> 00:33:30,659
sit down buckling the seat belt

894
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:32,278
tightening it like that's that's that's

895
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:34,200
definitely your best friend in this guy

896
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:36,419
yeah for sure

897
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:39,179
yeah I totally you know I was freaked

898
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:40,320
out about flying for maybe six months a

899
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:42,240
little bit after that but I kept having

900
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:43,980
I was working everywhere so I was having

901
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,380
to fly to Europe and I was having a

902
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:48,960
flight of Mexico and flying all over

903
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:50,940
and so I had to fly but like takeoffs

904
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,159
and landings I always like the shaking

905
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:54,960
you got some Trauma from it oh seriously

906
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:56,760
I had some serious trauma for like a

907
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,919
while yeah I don't get it anymore but

908
00:33:56,759 --> 00:34:01,319
like because I I literally had to fly

909
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:03,179
back and then two days later I had to

910
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:04,558
fly again and so I was flying but I

911
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:08,039
literally would like be holding on my

912
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:10,440
seat like oh [ __ ] like mentally I wasn't

913
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:13,559
ready for it but that was my second

914
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:16,320
plane incident by the way there was one

915
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:17,759
previous to that wow I was on a

916
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,679
Southwest flight now I won't Fly

917
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,960
Southwest anymore but I'm not afraid of

918
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,519
flying like I really do love being in an

919
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:27,000
airplane right I don't like Southwest

920
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:27,960
either yeah so it's going from LA to

921
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,539
Denver

922
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:33,240
and as with Tracy Ryan from Canada kids

923
00:34:30,539 --> 00:34:35,338
you know and and uh

924
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:37,079
she's always high intensity to travel

925
00:34:35,338 --> 00:34:39,659
with anyway because she's got her

926
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:42,719
daughter at home that like you know

927
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:45,960
um has cancer so uh you know we're on

928
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:50,338
this plane and I just smell burning

929
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:52,199
wires like electrical fire and

930
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:54,539
the whole plane light kind of fills up

931
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:57,899
with smoke and there's electrical wires

932
00:34:54,539 --> 00:35:00,059
burning and then we the pilot comes on

933
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:02,338
and he goes we're gonna have to make an

934
00:35:00,059 --> 00:35:04,320
emergency landing in Las Vegas

935
00:35:02,338 --> 00:35:06,358
I was like oh my God we're on our way to

936
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,640
Denver so luckily the Las Vegas Airport

937
00:35:06,358 --> 00:35:10,679
was right there I walked back to the

938
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:12,299
little stewardess cart and I grabbed

939
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:15,779
like a bunch of mini bottles of alcohol

940
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:18,119
like having to Tracy I'm like here oh

941
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:20,820
man we're gonna die today we're drinking

942
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:23,519
some whiskey first and so threw a couple

943
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:25,440
of those back you know landed

944
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:27,719
and it was all it was all good and fine

945
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,659
but I won't Fly Southwest to this day

946
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:33,719
yeah I was on a flight last year and it

947
00:35:30,659 --> 00:35:35,159
got hit by uh lightning and I was like I

948
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:39,000
literally saw the lightning coming in

949
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:40,199
and the whole Sky got yellow and uh so

950
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,320
maybe that's the problem we can't travel

951
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:45,059
together anymore

952
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,800
take separate flights yeah but when it

953
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:49,078
got hit by lightning I was like oh [ __ ]

954
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,000
because that's bad right and then the

955
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:52,619
guy like two seats over he was like no

956
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
no no these planes are designed to let

957
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:55,260
the electrical current pass through it

958
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,880
and so he's like it's no big deal

959
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,500
happens all the time and then he went on

960
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,880
to tell me about the supercell that he

961
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:02,579
went through when he was Landing in LAX

962
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:05,220
one time and he got hit like 40 or 50

963
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:06,539
times with lightning it's designed to go

964
00:36:05,219 --> 00:36:07,439
right through it the lighting is

965
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:10,440
designed to go right through the

966
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,659
airplane wow so pretty it makes sense

967
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:15,900
that

968
00:36:12,659 --> 00:36:17,639
technology yeah

969
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:19,139
yeah when are you filming you guys have

970
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:21,920
another season you're filming or how's

971
00:36:19,139 --> 00:36:21,920
that good stuff going

972
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:27,059
it's not it's not

973
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:29,579
no

974
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:32,159
um I'm so busy I'm working like 100

975
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:34,500
hours a week right now I'm building out

976
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:36,480
our whole facility and doing all the

977
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:39,780
construction management for it

978
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:42,480
and also kind of managing the farm and

979
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:45,180
so there was just no time with all the

980
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,338
development we have going on yeah yeah

981
00:36:45,179 --> 00:36:49,559
you guys you put a lot of production

982
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:51,599
work into it pretty it's a yeah it was a

983
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:54,599
great show thank you I appreciate that

984
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:56,220
but yeah no I'm just laser focused on

985
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:57,599
getting everything built out up and

986
00:36:56,219 --> 00:36:59,939
running

987
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:02,880
um you know surviving the California

988
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:05,700
market so to speak totally it's been a

989
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,800
roller coaster it's been a rough time

990
00:37:05,699 --> 00:37:09,719
for a lot of people and yeah a lot

991
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,099
rougher than we we've both had it

992
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:12,779
although you know it's still been tough

993
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:15,059
yeah there's still a lot of navigating

994
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:18,900
it's not just easy

995
00:37:15,059 --> 00:37:20,279
yeah I think I just I remember now that

996
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,858
um

997
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:24,720
you know we didn't always do really well

998
00:37:22,858 --> 00:37:27,179
at this and it was a struggle for a long

999
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:30,779
time just getting started getting going

1000
00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:33,179
making cultivation make sense being the

1001
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:35,280
you know the buyer the distributor the

1002
00:37:33,179 --> 00:37:37,980
sales person every part for your brand

1003
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:40,200
like when you're coming up

1004
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:43,858
that I don't know if I've just gotten

1005
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:45,960
tougher over the years but it hasn't you

1006
00:37:43,858 --> 00:37:47,940
know it could be a lot worse

1007
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:51,659
you were really tough back in the day

1008
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:54,119
thank you you've always been tough thank

1009
00:37:51,659 --> 00:37:56,699
you and you really have to be to be

1010
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:59,160
to get to the point where you're at it

1011
00:37:56,699 --> 00:38:00,539
takes a lot of toughness mental

1012
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:02,460
toughness

1013
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:05,219
attitude

1014
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:06,720
being able to say no yes those kind of

1015
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:08,399
things I mean I think those are all

1016
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:09,719
important and it's yeah good lessons to

1017
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,559
learn for everybody

1018
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:16,319
so yeah being able to say no

1019
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:19,139
um when things don't serve you even when

1020
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,000
they sound really good is is a big part

1021
00:38:19,139 --> 00:38:24,239
of my philosophy and just listening to

1022
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,219
your your gut instinct and kind of

1023
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:28,979
backing yourself on those plays when

1024
00:38:26,219 --> 00:38:31,199
they don't feel right you know totally

1025
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:33,539
so if you had any advice for your

1026
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:35,939
younger self that was maybe one to two

1027
00:38:33,539 --> 00:38:37,800
years into this what advice would you

1028
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:39,619
give yourself

1029
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:43,700
save the money

1030
00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:43,700
it doesn't last forever

1031
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:50,519
um no yeah I think when back when we

1032
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:52,858
were growing even small scale the the

1033
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:55,380
packs were worth exponentially more so

1034
00:38:52,858 --> 00:38:57,358
totally running a 12 lighter was like

1035
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:59,640
running a 50 lighter now or whatever the

1036
00:38:57,358 --> 00:39:02,039
equivalent is to to that maybe more

1037
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:04,858
maybe 100 literally bigger to make the

1038
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:07,619
same amount of money yeah no advice to

1039
00:39:04,858 --> 00:39:10,019
my younger self yeah I think

1040
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:12,300
better management of money I feel like

1041
00:39:10,019 --> 00:39:14,280
I've really learned that in my like

1042
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:17,880
later

1043
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:19,920
in my career me too I think you have to

1044
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:21,720
be and especially when we just had this

1045
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:25,440
recent crash you know everybody did

1046
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:27,598
these rapid expansions and oh my God you

1047
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,159
know that's why we have a lot of failure

1048
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,980
in the industry right now because people

1049
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:34,199
thought that this model this price point

1050
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:36,059
was going to last forever and that the

1051
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:38,699
market share was infinite and it's not

1052
00:39:36,059 --> 00:39:40,259
whereas so many people scaled yeah so

1053
00:39:38,699 --> 00:39:41,578
many people scaled they got money from

1054
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,720
the government not necessarily in

1055
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:44,760
cannabis with everything even

1056
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:46,078
restaurants I saw a lot of stuff that

1057
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,700
people thought it was going to last

1058
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:49,680
forever or that they weren't getting

1059
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:52,078
everybody money back that they got you

1060
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:54,960
know and and it's like you'd have the

1061
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:56,519
the best CFOs in the world making these

1062
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,139
calls and I don't blame them for it like

1063
00:39:56,519 --> 00:40:00,239
you're looking at the numbers they make

1064
00:39:58,139 --> 00:40:01,980
sense the expansion makes sense totally

1065
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:04,618
you'll at least make your money back

1066
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:06,719
like that's what everybody thought and

1067
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:08,640
then everybody thought the same thing at

1068
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:09,779
the same time and they all went big and

1069
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:11,940
then

1070
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:13,680
I saw some completed projects and then I

1071
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:15,960
I saw a bunch of half finished projects

1072
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:17,519
where people realized yeah because the

1073
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,380
project took so long that this isn't a

1074
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:21,838
good idea right

1075
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:24,059
so yeah all over you know and I think I

1076
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:25,920
get calls every week yeah like

1077
00:40:24,059 --> 00:40:28,078
Washington went through the second round

1078
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,338
of consolidation like I didn't realize

1079
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:31,140
there was going to be a second round I

1080
00:40:29,338 --> 00:40:32,940
don't think a lot of people did probably

1081
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:35,279
a third yeah and there probably will be

1082
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:36,960
a third and that's just the line yeah

1083
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,500
this is how it works

1084
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:44,699
no I think we saw that consolidation in

1085
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:47,099
Colorado Washington Oregon anywhere you

1086
00:40:44,699 --> 00:40:49,679
had you know the ability to get a

1087
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:50,700
license it wasn't a monopoly

1088
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:53,338
um

1089
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:55,919
had a saturation Point had to right

1090
00:40:53,338 --> 00:40:57,900
except California's over 40 million

1091
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,619
people or 39 million people whatever it

1092
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,539
is

1093
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:03,720
Colorado is about four million people

1094
00:41:00,539 --> 00:41:05,940
when their program started yeah so it's

1095
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:07,980
kind of like

1096
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:10,619
timing a small country instead of a

1097
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:12,659
state so

1098
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:14,220
it's it's a difficult Market to track

1099
00:41:12,659 --> 00:41:16,078
even if you've worked in multiple

1100
00:41:14,219 --> 00:41:18,118
markets I don't think anyone expected

1101
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,820
yeah what was going to happen

1102
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:22,019
no and I think

1103
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:23,760
it's interesting with these

1104
00:41:22,019 --> 00:41:25,079
International markets going on to see

1105
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,680
what's going to happen with places like

1106
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:31,019
Germany as they progress yeah and uh

1107
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:33,000
you know even Colombia

1108
00:41:31,019 --> 00:41:34,559
is still I mean they've been around a

1109
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,260
while but they're in their infancy to a

1110
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:38,279
degree of the whole

1111
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:40,740
legalization and how they're going to do

1112
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:42,660
an import export places like Portugal

1113
00:41:40,739 --> 00:41:45,539
that really are banking on places like

1114
00:41:42,659 --> 00:41:49,699
Germany for import but if Germany

1115
00:41:45,539 --> 00:41:52,980
doesn't allow Portugal's got the climate

1116
00:41:49,699 --> 00:41:55,439
I mean that's got I would be worried

1117
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:58,440
about I mean

1118
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:01,800
Mexico yeah for sure that would be like

1119
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:03,119
top of my list to be worried about

1120
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,960
um and you're talking about countries

1121
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:07,140
like

1122
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:09,240
it it's gonna go the way of anything in

1123
00:42:07,139 --> 00:42:10,799
ag right where it splits off and you

1124
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:12,959
have these large

1125
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,760
commodity producers that are just

1126
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,679
cranking this stuff out for pennies on

1127
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:20,160
the dollar and then hopefully we have

1128
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:22,559
our you know home breweries that are

1129
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:24,779
farm to table and have that whole ethos

1130
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:27,599
and Vibe behind it why people buy

1131
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:29,280
organic food and why people are are

1132
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:30,720
caring more about their health and what

1133
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,640
they put in their bodies these days

1134
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:34,679
right I think the same thing will happen

1135
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:37,319
with cannabis at least I'm heavily

1136
00:42:34,679 --> 00:42:38,399
banking on it yeah me too and I mean I

1137
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,260
think

1138
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,420
genetic diversity is going to come back

1139
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:44,160
into play things like that and then

1140
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:45,838
terroir we start talking about outdoor

1141
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:49,559
farms in Humboldt and Mendocino and

1142
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:51,838
Sonoma and Oregon where there is like

1143
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:53,219
the microbrewery model yeah they can do

1144
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:55,320
them vertically integrated I'd love to

1145
00:42:53,219 --> 00:42:57,419
see a lot of that going on where you can

1146
00:42:55,320 --> 00:43:00,480
go to the shop that they grow it on site

1147
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:01,800
I skunk VA from the last episode he was

1148
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,199
talking about he's vertically integrated

1149
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:06,000
and I love that and I think outdoor

1150
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:07,739
Farmers Indoor Farmers but having the

1151
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,500
small boutique model I love it I feel

1152
00:43:07,739 --> 00:43:12,179
like that's so much more attainable for

1153
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:13,980
the average person that loves weed that

1154
00:43:12,179 --> 00:43:17,460
wants to be in the industry or younger

1155
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:19,679
person coming in and you see that it's

1156
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:22,679
much more attainable than owning this

1157
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:24,299
huge mega million dollar company and so

1158
00:43:22,679 --> 00:43:25,500
we don't want to ever get rid of that

1159
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:28,079
Boutique model because that's where the

1160
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:29,818
quality lies is in the boutique and in

1161
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:31,680
the you know the passionate people it's

1162
00:43:29,818 --> 00:43:33,719
all Boutique product and there is

1163
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:35,818
product that's really good grown at

1164
00:43:33,719 --> 00:43:37,858
scale but there's always the boutique

1165
00:43:35,818 --> 00:43:39,599
stuff which I love boutique farmers and

1166
00:43:37,858 --> 00:43:41,219
the those are the most passionate people

1167
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:44,039
too yeah

1168
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:46,858
I I think it should be no different than

1169
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:49,019
you know tasting rooms for wine I would

1170
00:43:46,858 --> 00:43:50,818
love to see tasting rooms all over our

1171
00:43:49,019 --> 00:43:52,500
County at different Farms where people

1172
00:43:50,818 --> 00:43:55,139
can come up and visit and learn about

1173
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:57,059
the plant yeah and

1174
00:43:55,139 --> 00:43:58,379
um you know have an experience right

1175
00:43:57,059 --> 00:43:59,759
like at the end of the day it's all

1176
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:01,858
about experiences you know and what

1177
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,720
better way to have an experience than

1178
00:44:01,858 --> 00:44:06,059
smoke a good joint of someone's stuff or

1179
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:08,159
be able to experience

1180
00:44:06,059 --> 00:44:09,900
their facility and the stuff they go

1181
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:11,279
through harvesting and being able to see

1182
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:13,139
big plants I think there's just

1183
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,460
something to be said for big plants also

1184
00:44:13,139 --> 00:44:16,379
sure

1185
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:18,539
the beauty of what a big plan actually

1186
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:21,539
looks like like yeah like back when we

1187
00:44:18,539 --> 00:44:23,639
were uh up in Sonoma and they'd be you

1188
00:44:21,539 --> 00:44:26,519
know 12 feet tall by 10 feet wide and

1189
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:28,139
yeah massively yeah just there is

1190
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:31,318
something about it I'm I'm not gonna

1191
00:44:28,139 --> 00:44:33,719
yeah it depends how you scale

1192
00:44:31,318 --> 00:44:35,400
what things make sense at that point and

1193
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:38,759
you just have to do what what works for

1194
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:41,420
you I mean at cultiva we built every

1195
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:43,800
model of every type of grow hydroponic

1196
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:45,000
aquaponics like everything you pretty

1197
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,519
much we're able to test out pretty much

1198
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:51,500
all the differences over four years with

1199
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:51,500
and you worked in almost every state too

1200
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:58,140
up until recently it seemed like you had

1201
00:44:55,500 --> 00:45:00,300
yeah yeah we've had a footprint in most

1202
00:44:58,139 --> 00:45:01,980
of the legal states yep I'm sure there's

1203
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:03,720
a few we've missed

1204
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:04,800
yeah and you were doing licensing and

1205
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:07,019
you were doing all kinds of other stuff

1206
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:09,960
great stuff yeah we do the licensing I

1207
00:45:07,019 --> 00:45:11,759
mean by default and get in um working in

1208
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:13,318
some of the more restrictive states

1209
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,359
where licensing

1210
00:45:13,318 --> 00:45:16,920
you know sometimes it costs a million

1211
00:45:15,358 --> 00:45:18,420
dollars just to throw the paint at the

1212
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:21,059
wall let's see if it sticks so you have

1213
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:23,159
to have a full set of plans going in you

1214
00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:25,619
have to have your board and it's it's

1215
00:45:23,159 --> 00:45:27,358
crazy like I think New York applications

1216
00:45:25,619 --> 00:45:29,818
were like a thousand Pages or something

1217
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:31,619
like that so crazy then they put

1218
00:45:29,818 --> 00:45:33,599
um word count limits after that because

1219
00:45:31,619 --> 00:45:36,780
people were pulling up in U-Haul trucks

1220
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:38,579
just dropping their applications out and

1221
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:40,680
uh you'd have to have 10 copies like one

1222
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:43,619
for each reviewer and so it was just

1223
00:45:40,679 --> 00:45:47,279
like U-Hauls with stacked binders of of

1224
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:48,900
Sops and information it is wild yeah um

1225
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,359
that's actually my least favorite part

1226
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:53,160
of the process if I had to pick anything

1227
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:54,480
in cannabis that I don't like doing

1228
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:58,019
anymore would be the application

1229
00:45:54,480 --> 00:46:00,000
component yeah I bet it's doing the

1230
00:45:58,019 --> 00:46:01,199
Lord's work yeah having to deal with the

1231
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,219
people that you have to deal with too

1232
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:04,500
and

1233
00:46:02,219 --> 00:46:07,559
people that you you know as far as what

1234
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:09,539
I've seen and experienced a lot of

1235
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:11,400
actually from you back in the day having

1236
00:46:09,539 --> 00:46:13,199
to re-educate people

1237
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,700
about their own laws and they're they're

1238
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:15,960
the government entity that should

1239
00:46:14,699 --> 00:46:17,519
understand it and you're actually having

1240
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:20,280
to go through the educational process

1241
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:22,199
yeah can you build this what is it

1242
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:24,420
classified as what can we do in this

1243
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:26,578
facility right and then so you can't

1244
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:29,220
just flip rooms and take your commercial

1245
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:31,560
kitchen and then put it into your your

1246
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:34,019
grow space so yeah

1247
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:36,539
um yeah I like the plan part of it I

1248
00:46:34,019 --> 00:46:38,039
like the construction management part of

1249
00:46:36,539 --> 00:46:40,079
it I like actually physically building

1250
00:46:38,039 --> 00:46:42,358
the facility and watching the progress

1251
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:45,060
as it comes together right

1252
00:46:42,358 --> 00:46:47,940
um but yeah the the planning process is

1253
00:46:45,059 --> 00:46:50,219
always the the biggest hurdle I think at

1254
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:52,260
least for me so out of all the projects

1255
00:46:50,219 --> 00:46:55,439
you've done which one stands out the

1256
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:58,500
most favorite projects oh God there's so

1257
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:00,539
many for so many reasons

1258
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:02,760
um I feel like my newest project is

1259
00:47:00,539 --> 00:47:06,239
always my favorite yeah until I get the

1260
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:09,000
next one like I don't look back there's

1261
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:11,338
facilities that I'd say the majority of

1262
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,139
the facilities that I've designed and

1263
00:47:11,338 --> 00:47:15,299
manage the construction

1264
00:47:13,139 --> 00:47:17,818
I've not been back inside once they were

1265
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:19,500
operational oh wow yeah

1266
00:47:17,818 --> 00:47:22,199
you never get to see the actual

1267
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:24,239
sometimes they do but the majority of

1268
00:47:22,199 --> 00:47:25,739
the time I'm I'm working on the next

1269
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:29,098
thing and I'm moving on to the next

1270
00:47:25,739 --> 00:47:30,659
thing like I I'm I'm really passionate

1271
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:31,619
about only seeing what's right in front

1272
00:47:30,659 --> 00:47:34,858
of me

1273
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:37,680
and I don't like look back and reminisce

1274
00:47:34,858 --> 00:47:40,019
I'll pull things that evolve over the

1275
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:42,239
years about different

1276
00:47:40,019 --> 00:47:44,519
parts that I like of a structure how you

1277
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:46,318
walk into a gowning room how you

1278
00:47:44,519 --> 00:47:49,199
you know where you place certain things

1279
00:47:46,318 --> 00:47:50,460
it just becomes like second nature you

1280
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:52,019
know right

1281
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:54,000
no but so tell us a little bit about

1282
00:47:52,019 --> 00:47:55,858
Israel and you did some cool things over

1283
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:59,338
in Israel and I think that'd be great to

1284
00:47:55,858 --> 00:48:02,039
share yeah I um I travel I started

1285
00:47:59,338 --> 00:48:04,019
traveling to Israel with my friend Tracy

1286
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:05,579
Ryan that I almost died on the Southwest

1287
00:48:04,019 --> 00:48:08,519
flight with

1288
00:48:05,579 --> 00:48:11,160
um she her daughter Sophie has what's

1289
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:13,199
known as an optic pathway glioma tumor

1290
00:48:11,159 --> 00:48:16,078
which is a tumor that wraps itself

1291
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:19,019
around the optic nerve of the eye and

1292
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:21,780
they have a really high survival rate so

1293
00:48:19,019 --> 00:48:23,699
it's not like a high risk cancer in that

1294
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:27,240
respect but they also have a very high

1295
00:48:23,699 --> 00:48:29,639
recurrence rate it's an inoperable tumor

1296
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:32,818
so as it wraps itself around the optic

1297
00:48:29,639 --> 00:48:36,239
nerve the child slowly loses it their

1298
00:48:32,818 --> 00:48:38,279
vision and so Tracy was told

1299
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:39,719
um that you know by the time her

1300
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:42,540
daughter was two she was going to lose

1301
00:48:39,719 --> 00:48:45,078
her sight completely wow she started her

1302
00:48:42,539 --> 00:48:48,300
on cannabis at eight months old this was

1303
00:48:45,079 --> 00:48:50,400
pre-charlet's web it was before anyone

1304
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:53,880
was doing it there was no Sanjay Gupta

1305
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:56,099
she just got all these random signs to

1306
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:58,500
give her daughter cannabis and and her

1307
00:48:56,099 --> 00:49:01,619
story the way she tells it is much more

1308
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:03,420
elegant and incredible she gathered all

1309
00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:05,338
these medical connections and started

1310
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:06,900
doing research all over the world and we

1311
00:49:05,338 --> 00:49:10,078
found

1312
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:12,720
um or she found this Dr Debbie Miri who

1313
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:14,640
is a scientist out of the University of

1314
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:17,039
technion which is Israel's basically

1315
00:49:14,639 --> 00:49:18,779
equivalent to MIT

1316
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:21,599
um he was working within 100 million

1317
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:23,640
dollar Lab at his disposal and he was

1318
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:26,160
doing all this cannabis research that we

1319
00:49:23,639 --> 00:49:28,379
had not done here before so

1320
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:31,019
we actually from her daughter's prior

1321
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:33,539
brain surgery uh Tracy was able to get a

1322
00:49:31,019 --> 00:49:37,980
live sample and

1323
00:49:33,539 --> 00:49:39,599
um basically uh take it to Israel uh had

1324
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:40,318
to declare it and all that stuff and

1325
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:41,880
then

1326
00:49:40,318 --> 00:49:44,699
um we met with a doctor that was going

1327
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:47,280
to take the sample put it into rats then

1328
00:49:44,699 --> 00:49:48,838
they pump human blood into the rats with

1329
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,619
the same

1330
00:49:48,838 --> 00:49:52,139
um

1331
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:53,880
mutations or same specific type of tumor

1332
00:49:52,139 --> 00:49:56,578
and then test that tumor against

1333
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:59,519
different cannabinoid profiles that may

1334
00:49:56,579 --> 00:50:02,519
help fight the disease and cause cell

1335
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:05,280
death around this tumor essentially so

1336
00:50:02,519 --> 00:50:08,338
that was my first trip to Israel and and

1337
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:10,380
I met Dr daddy Mary and I I was just

1338
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:12,838
blown away by him still to this day I

1339
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:15,119
mean the man publishes you introduce me

1340
00:50:12,838 --> 00:50:17,039
to him paper after paper right so yeah

1341
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:19,260
the first time I met him I'm like I will

1342
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:21,119
quit my job and come and mop your floors

1343
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:22,980
for the rest of my life like I just want

1344
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:24,539
to learn from you

1345
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:26,579
um so that you know he's kind of my

1346
00:50:24,539 --> 00:50:28,800
connection over there to the country and

1347
00:50:26,579 --> 00:50:30,900
everything else and so kind of pop over

1348
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:33,180
there and see what medical science is

1349
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:35,099
doing and how that's pretty amazing

1350
00:50:33,179 --> 00:50:37,259
works the stuff they're doing over there

1351
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:39,000
as opposed to the process that we have

1352
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:42,119
to go through for drug Discovery here

1353
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:44,760
there's so much red tape involved that

1354
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:47,519
it makes it difficult almost impossible

1355
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:49,020
to do anything whereas over there most

1356
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:51,539
of the studies and stuff if you want to

1357
00:50:49,019 --> 00:50:53,818
do a double blindfolded study is a phone

1358
00:50:51,539 --> 00:50:55,259
call away and yeah the government's very

1359
00:50:53,818 --> 00:50:56,519
supportive of everything just the

1360
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:59,940
opposite

1361
00:50:56,519 --> 00:51:03,059
yeah here it's the polar opposite polar

1362
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:05,099
opposite and the uh hopefully slowly

1363
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:07,140
changing I know how I'm opening the door

1364
00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:08,760
for a lot of that research and and the

1365
00:51:07,139 --> 00:51:11,578
main reason behind it for people that

1366
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:14,520
don't know is that you cannot bring a

1367
00:51:11,579 --> 00:51:17,839
schedule one substance onto a university

1368
00:51:14,519 --> 00:51:20,699
property where all of the grand labs are

1369
00:51:17,838 --> 00:51:23,219
without putting their Federal funding as

1370
00:51:20,699 --> 00:51:25,679
a school at risk even if the doctor on

1371
00:51:23,219 --> 00:51:28,558
the other side holds a schedule one

1372
00:51:25,679 --> 00:51:31,618
research license so it's been this

1373
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:34,319
weird oxymoron that we cannot study

1374
00:51:31,619 --> 00:51:35,940
cannabis through our universities unless

1375
00:51:34,318 --> 00:51:39,239
it came out of the University of

1376
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:41,400
Mississippi which we you know kind of

1377
00:51:39,239 --> 00:51:44,219
all know what happened there was a

1378
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:46,680
federally funded grow that um was really

1379
00:51:44,219 --> 00:51:49,019
growing trash trash product and it's the

1380
00:51:46,679 --> 00:51:52,739
only place that scientists could legally

1381
00:51:49,019 --> 00:51:54,300
get cannabis from now I've heard since

1382
00:51:52,739 --> 00:51:56,939
then there's a few facilities that have

1383
00:51:54,300 --> 00:52:00,539
come online that have better product and

1384
00:51:56,940 --> 00:52:03,059
and actually care but you know the that

1385
00:52:00,539 --> 00:52:05,338
work is just starting right and we're in

1386
00:52:03,059 --> 00:52:08,160
a very nascent stage where

1387
00:52:05,338 --> 00:52:09,779
is real because it's a small country

1388
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:12,899
um not a lot of people you could do

1389
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:14,819
these micronized studies and at the time

1390
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:17,880
I know there's more now there was only

1391
00:52:14,818 --> 00:52:19,858
eight license grows in Israel so you

1392
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:21,838
could actually track back like I know

1393
00:52:19,858 --> 00:52:24,119
they did an Autism study

1394
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:25,920
and they had these uh kids who were

1395
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:27,358
violently autistic like to the point

1396
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,280
where they would attack their parents

1397
00:52:27,358 --> 00:52:32,098
and things like that

1398
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,720
um and Dr daddy Mary put them on you

1399
00:52:32,099 --> 00:52:36,740
know schedule regimen

1400
00:52:33,719 --> 00:52:39,239
same strain same dosage same everything

1401
00:52:36,739 --> 00:52:42,000
consistency grown out of the same

1402
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:45,598
Greenhouse chemovar specific yeah and

1403
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:47,639
then he got thank you and then he got um

1404
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:49,380
a phone call one day that one of these

1405
00:52:47,639 --> 00:52:51,779
kids out of a year and a half of studies

1406
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:52,920
had you know attacked uh one of one of

1407
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:54,599
his parents

1408
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:56,460
and then you got another call the same

1409
00:52:54,599 --> 00:52:59,519
thing so he immediately went over there

1410
00:52:56,460 --> 00:53:01,800
and looked at what the dosage was and

1411
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:04,318
then takes it back test the product goes

1412
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:06,359
to the grower did you replace the strain

1413
00:53:04,318 --> 00:53:07,800
he goes no no it's the same thing it's

1414
00:53:06,358 --> 00:53:10,199
the same thing but through a series of

1415
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:12,539
conversations and tests they realized

1416
00:53:10,199 --> 00:53:14,879
that he actually lost that specific

1417
00:53:12,539 --> 00:53:17,960
cultivar and replaced it with something

1418
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:21,358
very similar which caused this complete

1419
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:22,679
outbreak of multiple episodes so when

1420
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:25,259
you're talking about medicine that

1421
00:53:22,679 --> 00:53:26,699
that's that's that finite it's that

1422
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:28,859
specific

1423
00:53:26,699 --> 00:53:30,179
and then you come back to the States and

1424
00:53:28,858 --> 00:53:32,338
people are just making wild

1425
00:53:30,179 --> 00:53:36,000
recommendations about dosing on people's

1426
00:53:32,338 --> 00:53:38,400
Health yeah it's crazy but luckily you

1427
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:41,159
know it's it's a fairly safe plant it's

1428
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:43,139
not going to hurt you well in fact we

1429
00:53:41,159 --> 00:53:45,838
have a lot to learn right we have a ton

1430
00:53:43,139 --> 00:53:48,539
to learn on that level with chemovars

1431
00:53:45,838 --> 00:53:50,880
it's not just the cultivar it's also the

1432
00:53:48,539 --> 00:53:54,239
nutrition and environment that dictates

1433
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:55,380
the cannabinoid profile and so there

1434
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:57,139
could be a change in their environment

1435
00:53:55,380 --> 00:54:00,180
like they got a new fan and it could

1436
00:53:57,139 --> 00:54:02,098
produce a different chemovar at that

1437
00:54:00,179 --> 00:54:04,618
time in Israel it was all

1438
00:54:02,099 --> 00:54:06,838
um Greenhouse mostly shade structures

1439
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:09,358
right but throughout the year you could

1440
00:54:06,838 --> 00:54:10,679
if if you have lighting from the Sun you

1441
00:54:09,358 --> 00:54:11,940
could have a different product an end

1442
00:54:10,679 --> 00:54:14,039
product that had a different profile

1443
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:17,000
potentially sure and we still don't even

1444
00:54:14,039 --> 00:54:18,719
understand some of the there's so many

1445
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,159
cannabinoids that we don't even

1446
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:22,858
understand all of them because they're

1447
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:24,000
in such small amounts yeah yeah it's a

1448
00:54:22,858 --> 00:54:27,838
trip

1449
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:30,239
yeah so I mean the future of of medical

1450
00:54:27,838 --> 00:54:33,058
um for the scientists that really care

1451
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:33,779
and and the people that really care

1452
00:54:33,059 --> 00:54:35,819
um

1453
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:37,559
I'm looking forward to people feeling

1454
00:54:35,818 --> 00:54:39,480
like they're more dialed in because it's

1455
00:54:37,559 --> 00:54:42,480
a different consumer experience you talk

1456
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:46,019
to so many people that are like tried

1457
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:48,539
that Devil's lettuce once and wasn't for

1458
00:54:46,019 --> 00:54:50,400
me never again almost ended up in the

1459
00:54:48,539 --> 00:54:53,400
hospital thought you know most of the

1460
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:57,300
time it's anxiety attack from overdosing

1461
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:57,300
or taking too much yeah

1462
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:02,579
and and it happens quite often

1463
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:05,220
the more educated the consumer the

1464
00:55:02,579 --> 00:55:07,680
better right like we know we can't go

1465
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:09,118
buy a bottle of whiskey and drink it

1466
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:11,219
