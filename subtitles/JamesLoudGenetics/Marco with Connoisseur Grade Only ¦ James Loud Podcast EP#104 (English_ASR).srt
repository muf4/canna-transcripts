was quite an event. You know, we did the

24
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,438
food out there. I think Sergio put that

25
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:31,118
thing together and it was wild, man. The

26
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:32,719

00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:36,798
You was there from sun up to sun down.

29
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,400
Dang there. Two days. We We did shopping

30
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,680
one day. We did prep in the night and

31
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,359
then rocked it out the next day. It was

32
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,759
a lot of fun. I mean, I love those

33
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:45,438
collaborative events where it's like 15

34
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,439
people come together to make it special.

35
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,879
And like

36
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:50,798
literally, it just was the tie-in. We

37
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:52,560
got the good flour. We have the contest.

38
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,479
We got the rollers. We got the food. I

39
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,399
got my buddy who was a chef at the win.

40
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,560
Yes. You know, Ricky helping out. It's

41
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,320
like all these people contributing to

42
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,680
make something so much bigger than

43
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,359
themselves special. And you know, that's

44
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,200
what I'm all about. No, definitely, bro.

45
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:07,680

all going together, you know. Uh I

47
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,599

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,759

55

63
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:43,359

64
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,800
people can just get on it and just ride

65
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,280
around the little island for a little

66
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,640
bit. Nice. Definitely. Well, and I feel

67
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,719
like it's the right time of year to do

68
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,079
an event out in Rio Vista. Rio Vista is

69
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:53,519
a special place. So, I grew up in the

70
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,760
Bay Area. We used to go out and get

71
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,920
croads out in Rio Vista. Oh, nice, you

72
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,919
know. Yeah. So, so definitely I've been

73
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,679
fishing out in the Delta, uh, water

74
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,439
skiing, wakeboarding growing up. And so,

75
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,959
the Delta special. I go out there maybe

76
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:06,079
once a year and to be able to go out for

77
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,920
Hashole Island. It's going to be

78
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,200
exciting, man. I'm telling you, it is.

79
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:11,518
We got people coming out with their

80
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:13,199

a there's a dock right there. We also

82
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,878

83
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,719
cool. You know, people can bring out

84
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:20,799
whatever water activities they want to

85
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,318
come bring out. Maybe do a boat tie off.

86
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,680
You know, we never know. Yeah. And

87

89
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,879
wild how many people are doing hash

90
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,200

00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:31,119
let's dive into your history with uh

123
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,959
joints and history with cannabis. Let's

124
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,639
start out with when you started smoking,

125
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:36,560
how you started smoking, what area you

126
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,079
from. Oh, man. And I I'm from

127
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,079
Sacramento, California first and

128
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:41,918
foremost, you know, the city of trees.

129
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:43,599
Um I also want to say, yeah, I started

130
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:47,000
smoking around I think I was a teenager

131
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:50,320
around 13ish, 14 years old, you know,

132
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,439
and first time I smoked. It was in a

133
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:54,879
tree. I was hiding from my mom. Nice.

134
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:56,079
Those were the days though, man. I We

135
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:57,600
used to smoke in trees behind the

136
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:58,879
school. We climb up in the trees and

137
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,960
smoke. We're lucky we didn't break our

138
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,399
necks and stuff like that, but I think I

139
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:04,239
think I was smoking out of a can, too.

140
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:05,679
It was funny as [ __ ] Totally. popping

141
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,120
the little holes in the can. You bend it

142
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,959
and you pop the little holes and you hit

143
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,478
it with the lighter. Little aluminum

144
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:13,439
never hurt us. Just a little aluminum

145
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:14,959
never hurt us, you know. Bammer weed and

146
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:16,879
aluminum, bro. That, you know, I mean,

147
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,319
we had good bud, too. We smoked in cans,

148
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:19,759
but it was like the thing where you

149
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,038
didn't have to carry around a pipe. You

150
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,919
can get in trouble for carrying a pipe

151
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:24,478
when we were younger. Yeah.

152
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:26,560
Paraphernalia. Big trouble. Yeah.

153
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:28,879
Especially being under the age of 18 or

154
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,038
21, I guess it is, with me, man. I'm

155
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,319
telling you. So, yeah. But good times.

156
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:33,519
California has been a great place for

157
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:35,839
weed. You know, I feel like we're

158
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:37,839
somewhat the epicenter of cannabis

159
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:39,038
legalization, you know, from Oakland and

160
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:40,719
then all the way out in Sacramento.

161
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,240
There's so many big brands out there.

162
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,240
No, definitely all over, you know,

163
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,079
Northern California and SoCal. We're

164
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,319
like a mecca, you know. We are a mecca.

165
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,319
Yeah, for sure. Well, it's it's amazing.

166
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:52,319
Sacramento is just popping up with great

167
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:54,719
brands and great cultivators, great

168
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,399
rollers, uh, great everything, you know.

169
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,759
It's like they've got a good food scene

170
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:59,439
out there. You want good sushi, they

171
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,199
have some amazing sushi out there. But

172
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:03,439
like literally when it comes to

173
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,520
cannabis, Sacramento has its own thing

174
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:06,959
and own identity and I love that. Yeah.

175
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:08,560
No, definitely. You know, a lot of

176
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:10,478
people don't understand, you know, uh

177
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,560
Sacramento is the city of trees. You

178
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:14,079
know, we have the fire. That's why they

179
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,478
changed the narrative because they

180
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:18,240
didn't want that stigma on Sacramento as

181
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:20,159
being the capital of Sac of of

182
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,680
California. So, they had to change it.

183
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,280
But definitely, you know, come out, come

184
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,519
visit us, come check out the fire we

185
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:27,599
create. It's it's really cool. You know,

186
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,839
we we we encourage people to come visit

187
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,439
our city. You know, it's it's not LA,

188
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:33,599
but it's definitely, you know, it's it's

189
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:35,519
its own special little thing. Yeah, the

190
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,360
scene there is extra special. It's not

191
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,279
LA. It's not the Bay. It's not the

192
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,879
Emerald Triangle. It's its own thing.

193
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:42,239
They have their own energy. Like, I

194
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:44,159
mean, the Connect community, they do

195
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,120
events out there. You know, Sergio,

196
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,120
again, he does amazing stuff. Yeah, for

197
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,399
sure. So, yeah, it's it's amazing.

198
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,240
There's breeders out there, too. I mean,

199
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:53,599
you guys literally have it's you want

200
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,600
extract, you want breeders. They have

201
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,720
amazing extract artists out there.

202
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,160
Definitely, you know, and some of the

203
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,599
biggest brands are out there as well.

204
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,280
No. Yeah, you're right, man. Shout out

205
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:03,199
to all the all the big dogs out there

206
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,359
crushing it, man. On the daily. You guys

207
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,199
are straight inspiration. Yeah, it's

208
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,199
tough these days, you know, and I think

209
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,120
there's there's the one side of the

210
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,639
industry where everyone's like got jaded

211
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,560
and they're upset and it's like there's

212
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,240
still a lot of us that are excited about

213
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,240
the industry. I'm still excited every

214
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,319
day. I love coming to work. I mean,

215
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,160
yeah, of course there's times where it's

216
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,680
like, man, it sucks, but I'm also on the

217
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,520
genetic side, not on the cultivation

218
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,439
side. So, it'll be right. Being a

219
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:28,719
cultivator isn't easy these days. You

220
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:30,560
have to be the best. Like, if you're

221
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,000
going to do it, you better be the best,

222
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,680
right? Everything's batch to batch

223
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,519
nowadays. You know, you that wrong

224
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,280
batch, you know, might give you a bad

225
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:38,959
representation of what your product may

226
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:40,399
be and it just might have been a bad

227
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,918
week, you know? Right. You're only good

228
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:43,279
as like when when I was a chef, it was

229
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:44,399
you're only as good as your last meal,

230
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:46,399
right? But it's same thing with

231
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,000
cannabis. It's like you're only as good

232
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:49,839
as your last batch. If you put a batch

233
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,720
of crap out, you put a batch of hand

234
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:55,198
rolls that are [ __ ] cash holes,

235
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,639
something bad, you know? It's like it it

236
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,400
can ruin your reputation. It can ruin

237
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,918
your brand and and knock you down a few

238
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:01,198
steps. Definitely. But that's why it's

239
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:03,758
so important to be humble, too. You know

240
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,439
what I mean? And also quality assurance

241
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,240
is so important. You have to have that

242
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:10,399
quality control. Yes. And uh you know,

243
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,680
it's like these things aren't easy. And

244
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:13,120
especially if you want to perform at the

245
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,560
highest level, especially with hand

246
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,639
rolls, which I've known like we've been

247
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,000
going through it because I work with SF

248
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,960
Canaan and I work with several other

249
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,720
brands and it's like how do we do it to

250
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,959
where it's cost effective? Because these

251
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,879
days you can't charge what you used to,

252
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:28,878
but also to get a product that's your

253
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,560
quality is very very difficult. And I

254
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,000
think most people don't understand you

255
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,360
you don't just teach somebody how to

256
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,440
roll a joint. You have to be passionate

257
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,959
about joint rolling, right? First has to

258
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,399
be passion. There has to be the passion,

259
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,239
the love for it, you know. And if you

260
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,599
don't smoke, you have to have friends.

261
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,959
Everybody has to smoke around you

262
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,959
because it's like there's no way for you

263
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,719
to learn to see if it burns correctly

264
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,919
unless you're smoking literally cuz you

265
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,600
won't know. You know, like I was saying

266
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:51,679
earlier, it's all about pressure points.

267
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,839
You know, when you're rolling, you know,

268
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:55,599
too much pressure causes it to clog to,

269
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,680
you know, therefore then making it

270
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,440
combust at a hotter temperature then

271
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:00,639
then therefore burning up your chirps

272
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,640
and then when you go to hit it again,

273
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:05,120
it's going to taste like nothing. Yeah.

274
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:07,600
you know, compared to when you roll it

275
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,120
uh more looser, a little bit a little

276
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,159
loose, but a little tight, you know, not

277
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,480
too loose to where you're you got to

278
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:15,759
just, you know, like it's all airy.

279
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,959
That's definitely not the way you want

280
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:20,958
to smoke, but we can go into more of

281
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,399
that. Oh, yeah. Well, and there's so

282
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:23,759
many little details and I'd love to

283
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,839
share with the people that watch my

284
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:27,278
podcast because we haven't had someone

285
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,480
in a long We had Chris, professional

286
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:30,320
joint roller, come on the show before

287
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,759
and he has his own perspective and

288
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,600
outlook and I think he does really good

289
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:35,600
work as well. Yeah. Shout out to the guy

290
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,519
right there, dude. Yeah. And he really I

291
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,360
mean he basically goes and QC's everyone

292
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,799
else's work which I love. Somebody, you

293
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,639
know, somebody's got to do it. No, I

294
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:44,319
love it. Yeah. I I love when he was

295
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:46,159
doing that. He needed bring it back.

296
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,519
Yeah. Seriously, bring it back. That was

297
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:49,199
good stuff. And I feel like bring it

298
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,879
back. You know, I'm not the guy to put

299
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,560
people on blast, but if you want to do

300
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:54,000
that and you want to show people what's

301
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:55,518
actually out there, what's out there in

302
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,200
wreck, I mean, we were just looking at

303
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,360
some products that are from September

304
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,879
and it's like it's really tough when

305
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,720
you're trying to get your product out

306
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:04,320
there to a consumer and you want them to

307
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,759
smoke it immediately and they don't

308
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,760
smoke it for four months. What does that

309
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:09,600
look like in the jar, you know, or in in

310
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:12,240
the in the joint? No, that's true.

311
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,440
Definitely. you know, um it's like a big

312
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,519
gap between like the quality and the how

313
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,680
long it is like it lasts, the longevity

314
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,360
of the freshness cuz you know some

315
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:24,799
depending on how it's grown with salts

316
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,440
or if it's organic you know I feel as if

317
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:29,759
sometimes organic like the what is that

318
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,640
the synanics or with like salts and

319
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:34,319
organics right I love personally so like

320
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:37,360
I feel like that stuff lasts a little

321
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,160
bit longer than you know salts you know

322
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,480
and and sometimes organic you

323
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:44,879
doesn't really last long, but it does in

324
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,879
my eyes. It does sometimes because I had

325
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:53,200
a batch from October. Yeah, we're we're

326
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:55,039
on the last like 10 cases. But they're

327
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,879
from October, but they still taste like

328
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:58,399
they did when we rolled them. And that's

329
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:00,480
what's so crazy, you know, based on how

330
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,839
you roll them, that's how long, you

331
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,278
know, you'll roll them, how you store

332
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,519
them, all that. Yeah. It's really

333
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:07,278
interesting. And and with rolling

334
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,039
joints, I've been rolling joints since

335
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:10,559
the 90s, you know what I mean? Like my

336
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:12,319
joints have definitely gotten better,

337
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:14,319
especially over the last year. I really

338
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,079
stepped my game up since last year, you

339
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,760
know, and I I go down these deep dives

340
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:20,479
where I'm like, "Okay, which tip is the

341
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:21,919
best? What gauge tip is the best?" You

342
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,278
know, what paper is the best and let's

343
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:24,639
try them all and smoke. And I really

344
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:26,720
enjoy that part of it, too, because I

345
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:28,480
enjoy smoking. I I enjoy the R&amp;D side of

346
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,160
it. Definitely. You know, and then

347
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,320
getting into hasho now it's like, okay,

348
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:33,919
what kind of hash works the best? what

349
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,079
you know like there's so many different

350
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:37,679
types of hash even within rosin there's

351
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:40,078
several types of rosin there's several

352
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:43,359
grades you can work with will food grade

353
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:45,278
work will you know fresh flower pressed

354
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,800
rosin work you know it's like that

355
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:48,159
there's so many different options with

356
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:50,078
that yeah there's a lot of variables

357
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:52,000
with that definitely cuz you know you

358
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:55,759
have some uh fresh press that's going to

359
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,759
be you know less uh less stable and then

360
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:59,759
you have some that's really stable that

361
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:01,519
stays cold care for like 2 months

362
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:02,879
literally you know and then you have

363
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,120
something that literally turns over in

364
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:07,439
two days. You know, it just varies on

365
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,200
the st the stability of the actual

366
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,399
compound of, you know, either it being

367
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,639
fresh press or cold cure or or patella

368
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,879
or patella. Yeah, I like the Pella. And

369
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,519
you basically Pella yields 100% whereas

370
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:21,278
the second you squish it with rosin you

371
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,399
get, you know, you get a 80% yield. So,

372
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:25,919
you're losing 20%. But also, the Pella

373
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,240
is meant to be aged for a long time. And

374
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:30,000
so, I'm just now getting into it, you

375
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,680
know. All right.

376
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,958
But Frenchie is the motivation for all

377
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:35,278
this stuff and I feel like I'm doing

378
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,439
Frenchie justice and he would be smiling

379
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:38,399
right

380
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,839
now. You know what I mean? Oh yeah, I

381
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,240
know, man. We got something fire rolled

382
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,000
up. Yeah. And it's like so this stuff's

383
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,039
exciting for me and then it's like the

384
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,320
nuances with joint rolling. It's like

385
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:49,919
most people are like, "Oh, it's just a

386
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,839
joint." It's like it's not just a joint

387
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:53,919
because there's every every last little

388
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,680
detail needs to be con considered,

389
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:57,759
right? like whether it's the paper, the

390
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:00,000
tip, the gauge of the tip, the crutch

391
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:01,600
that's in the tip, and then even when

392
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,879
you're smoking it, there's ways you can

393
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,920
smoke it where if you don't smoke it

394
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:05,679
correctly, you're going to ruin the

395
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:08,000
experience. Definitely. You know, there

396
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:10,078
definitely is different ways to uh, you

397
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,600
know, consume the cannabis, especially

398
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:13,039
like when you're smoking, you're say

399
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,320
you're smoking something like this right

400
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:19,919
here. Yeah. This one is 2 g with a half

401
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,720
gram. Um, what did we put? Squirt with

402
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:25,639
some SB26 from Dream. All living Soil

403
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,920
right here. Um,

404
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:30,720
definitely, you know, like some people

405
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:32,479
are very big on white ash. Some people

406
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,480
don't really understand the difference

407
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,759
between white ash and black ash, gray

408
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,278
ash, you know, like living soil usually

409
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:41,519
doesn't really give you something that's

410
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:43,679
like a super bone white ash, you know,

411
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,440
based on the compounds and how it's

412
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,278
grown, right? And the way you're able to

413
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,560
flush stuff out of it. And, you know, I

414
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:52,639
mean, I think there's there's a lot to

415
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:54,399
it. And my opinion is is does it taste

416
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,680
amazing? Does it make you feel good? I

417
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,198
think those are the two most important

418
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:58,638
things. White ash is something that

419
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:00,078
we've only been talking about for a

420
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,680
while. And it's so funny that a lot of

421
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:04,078
guys it's their first thing on their

422
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:05,919
check. Does it burn white? Does it drip?

423
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:07,919
And I think that the drip is very

424
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:10,078
subjective to individuals. Is there that

425
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:11,759
oil ring? And I do love a good oil ring.

426
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:14,638
Don't get me wrong. I enjoy looking at a

427
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:17,198
good oil ring. And uh you know, someone

428
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:20,399
told me that with white ash it almost

429
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:23,039
always is smooth and with like the

430
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,039
grayer ashes or the the salt and pepper

431
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:26,879
it's like that could be hit or miss, you

432
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:28,559
know, but with white ash it always is

433
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:31,838
smooth. And I don't know whether I agree

434
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:33,518
with you calcium in there. Yeah. No,

435
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,839
definitely that's subjective for sure

436
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:39,120
like the guys say. Uh because you know

437
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:41,680
like this is burning pretty decent, you

438
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,639
know, but it does has a has a small

439
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:46,078
throat bite, like a small one. It's it's

440
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,720
really good. It's smooth, but it does

441
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:50,479
have a little bite. I I smoked one and

442
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,079
it did. I was like, "Oh, well, it had a

443
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,759
bite. I can't even get mad at it."

444
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:55,039
Right. You know, and sometimes the

445
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,799
flavor is so good, you just can't get

446
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:59,679
mad at it, for sure. Yeah. And that's

447
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:01,759
the burn so good. Like it hurts so good,

448
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:03,599
you know, because it's like it's good,

449
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:05,198
but it you feel that you're like, you

450
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,800
know, in the back of your throat. Yeah.

451
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:08,159
And it's some stuff. I love the gas. And

452
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:10,319
even if it has a little bit of burn,

453
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:12,480
that's okay. Uh straight Skittles. It

454
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,240
should be smooth all the way down to the

455
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,320
road. You should be tasting that flavor.

456
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,639
And then I like Skittles with Skittles

457
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,278
Rossin, too. Like, oh my god, the Zeon Z

458
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,120
goes crazy. Definitely. It's It's wild.

459
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:24,720
So, and and the beautiful thing is is

460
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,720
now we're getting also these flavor

461
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,320
combinations, too. Definitely, bro.

462
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,560
There's so many cool combos to come up

463
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,079
with. It's unlimited. Yeah. And then you

464
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,439
can blend rosin on top of that. So, we

465
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:35,039
could have the rosin blend. We could

466
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,720
even do the flour blend and combine

467
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:38,958
those where you got, you know, five or

468
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,000
six things blended. And now it becomes

469
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:43,679
almost like uh how wine is created in

470
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,440
these different blends. And I love that.

471
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:47,519
And now as time goes by, you know, they

472
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,720
do rolls cure up, you know, sometimes

473
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,879
they cure up for the best, sometimes

474
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,839
they cure for the worst. Yeah. you know,

475
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:55,919
um, and like you were saying, like

476
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:58,320
combos, doing flour blended with hash,

477
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:00,319
then rolled with rosin, you know, them

478
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,160
are great great ideas for people. Like

479
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,079
if you're coming up and you want to be

480
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:06,879
different in the industry, there's a tip

481
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:08,159
right there. Yeah. There's so many

482
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:09,519
little things that you can do to make

483
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:10,879
yourself a little bit different, you

484
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,720
know? It's just like even how these

485
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:14,240
rollers, every single roller I know has

486
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,920
their own way of doing it, you know? And

487
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,159
I love that, especially at the top

488
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:19,919
level, right? the guys at the top level.

489
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:22,159
I feel like you guys all have your own

490
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:23,360
specific way of doing it and there's no

491
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:25,759
right or wrong way. They're all

492
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,199
beautiful joints. They all know. Shout

493
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,079
out to all the big dogs out there. You

494
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:33,319
know, we got Bruno, we got Steuart

495
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:35,599
Dinks, we got uh Sav, we got

496
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:37,440
Strainchasers. Shout out to Ro BMC.

497
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,680
There's so many amazing top dog rollers

498
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,120
out there, you know. It's really cool to

499
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,638
see cuz everybody has their own

500
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,480
techniques, you know, and styles and

501
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,240
it's really cool to see. Yeah. Yeah. And

502
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,399
I I feel like you guys are just upping

503
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,079
the game for everybody else. And you

504
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,679
know, it's it's great being part of this

505
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:54,239
community, especially at this high

506
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:56,000
level. Definitely. So, and then the

507
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,320
access to Good Flower and Rosin, that's

508
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,919
just next level, too. Oh, literally.

509
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,519
It's cool, man. You know, we're coming

510
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:02,958
up with so many cool ideas, you know,

511
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,720
with different collaborations for the

512
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:06,000
wreck market right now. So, it's really

513
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,600
cool to see, you know, what we're able

514
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,038
to come up for the for the people of

515
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,958
California. Yeah. And we have a great

516
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:12,318
wreck market. you know what what there's

517
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,959
people that might want to hate on it or

518
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:16,399
whatever, but our wreck market is pretty

519
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:17,679
good and it's growing. It's definitely

520
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,839
one day at a time, we're making it

521
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,079
better. You know, brands like myself and

522
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:23,519
James and you know what he does, he's,

523
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:25,599
you know, obviously searching through

524
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:28,240
all these genetics, you know, popping

525
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:30,480
beans every day, night, day, you know,

526
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,798
and he's creating a new way for us, you

527
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,120
know, so we have new strains of of flour

528
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:36,639
and new strains of rosin to pair with,

529
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:38,079
you know, and it's really cool to see.

530
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,759
It's all about pushing the plant forward

531
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:42,558
and I feel like, you know, I'm trying to

532
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:44,240
do my job and also just stay in my lane.

533
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:45,918
What for as far as for breeding, like I

534
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,558
need to take a deep dive down rosin. So,

535
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,759
I go study rosin and how it's made and I

536
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:51,200
want to understand it. I don't need to

537
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:52,319
be an expert on it. Same thing with

538
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,759
joint rolling. I don't need to be the

539
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:55,038
best joint. I can roll good joints,

540
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:57,200
right? You know, I feel like I can roll

541
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:58,720
joints that you can sell because I feel

542
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,558
like it's important. I need to

543
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,558
understand the smokability. Also,

544
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:04,000
because when we do feno hunting, I give

545
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:05,200
out joints to people and I'm like, tell

546
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,279
me what you think about it. I don't give

547
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,720
nugs out really anymore. We do a little

548
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:10,079
bit, but for the most part, they're not

549
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,519
going to understand it. They're not

550
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:12,879
going to roll it the way they need to.

551
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:14,000
And one person to the next is going to

552
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,840
have a different experience. If he

553
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,839
smokes it in a pipe or he smokes it in a

554
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:18,720
bong or he smokes it in a vaporizer,

555
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:20,240
he's not going to have the same

556
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,759
experience as the guy who rolls a joint.

557
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,960
At least we can try to put people on the

558
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:26,240
same level. Yeah. Right. Same feedback.

559
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,558
And we're going through so many

560
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,440
different phenotypes constantly. There's

561
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:33,279
that one area where it's like it has to

562
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,440
be consumed. You got to tell me your

563
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:36,720
personal experience with it. We can't we

564
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,320
can't look at a piece of paper and it's

565
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,240
going to say, "Yeah, this one burns this

566
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:42,159
way or this one tastes this way." Even

567
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,919
though it has these tarpin profiles,

568
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,600
there's so many nuances within the

569
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,600
turppen and flavor combinations of

570
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:49,439
turppen. And it's not just turppen

571
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:51,439
because there's flavorants. There's all

572
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,679
these other components, right, that

573
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,679
basically sulfur based compounds that

574
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,280
make stuff gassy that, you know, I like

575
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,200
that. But you don't measure those with

576
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:00,480
tarpen. No, that's true. It's a lot, you

577
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,558
know, for people to understand, you

578
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,000
know, when it comes to, you know, we're

579
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:06,079
not just smoking, you know, it's really

580
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,038
something that we're it's a lifestyle,

581
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:09,359
you know, it's something that we're

582
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:11,200
learning to evolve into, too, as well,

583
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:13,519
you know, right? And trying to take it

584
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,798
seriously and as as scientific as

585
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:19,038
possible, but yet still considering all

586
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:21,519
the nuances and all the, you know, all

587
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:24,480
the details in a way that other people

588
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:26,079
can digest, right? Definitely. Can we

589
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,599
burn one in here? We better burn one in

590
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:29,279
here. Yeah. Let's get let's light one up

591
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:31,199
real quick. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm down.

592
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:34,319
So, we can start talking about ash

593
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,319
structure. And so, like another another

594
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:38,159
good thing like I want to show you guys

595
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:41,519
proper ways to light a joint, you know,

596
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:44,160
would be obviously there's a crown, you

597
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:47,359
know, using your torch. Torch is always

598
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:49,279
the best. Using torch is optimal. But if

599
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:51,119
you're not using a torch, use a big, you

600
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:53,160
know, I don't recommend it though, just

601
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:55,759
based on the flint

602
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:57,600
causes soot when you go to light it.

603
00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:01,440
That's that black little ash that goes

604
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:03,439
up. Yeah. It's not good for you.

605
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,759
Yeah. It's easier to get a nice cherry

606
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,480
going. You can get that nice even burn

607
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:10,160
on the top. And it's just Yeah. And I

608
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,558
think the Dutch crown is really special.

609
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,919
I think that's what differentiates the

610
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:15,759
good and the great rollers a lot of

611
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,440
times. Not always, but I feel like the

612
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:19,679
guys who do the Dutch crowns really good

613
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,279
do really good job. Definitely. I feel

614
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,360
that one. Yeah. I mean, there's a whole

615
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:24,879
art. So basically with our with our hand

616
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:27,359
rolls and our hash holes, we're going to

617
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,799
have a piece of paper. They'll have a QR

618
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,639
code, but also it's going to say

619
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:32,879
directions, and then there's literally

620
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,240
an 8 1/2 by 11 piece of paper with

621
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,000
instructions. We try to keep it light

622
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,480
and funny, but also at the same time,

623
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,919
it's important to educate people on how

624
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,679
to smoke it because you can't smoke it

625
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,679
like a cigarette, right? It's more like

626
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,120
a cigar, but also you have to hold them,

627
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,880
you know? There's a certain way you

628
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:48,239
should hold them, you know? And then

629
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,840
same thing with ash. A lot of people are

630
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,679
like, "Oh, I want to ash ash it." You

631
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:53,519
know, like don't don't ash my joint.

632
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,840
Like that's the one thing you don't want

633
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:57,038
to do. Right. And it's the one thing is

634
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:58,879
very counterintuitive cuz you're like,

635
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:00,480
"Oh, there's ash. I need to ash it,

636
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,760
right?" No, definitely. That is true.

637
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,279
There's so many times that, you know, I

638
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:04,720
was out there and when I was in LA a

639
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:06,720
lot, a lot of people aren't really too

640
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,839
educated, but there are a lot. So, it's

641
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,759
just funny when I was out there

642
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:12,240
chilling, I noticed that a lot of people

643
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:14,400
were just smoking casually, literally

644
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,480
hitting it back to back, back to back. I

645
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,440
was like, "Wait." But I didn't want to

646
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,599
say anything because I just want to

647
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,919
continue to see how other people smoke,

648
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:24,480
their interactions with the joint. And

649
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,559
everybody's just gonna

650
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,240
and just back to back and back to back

651
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:29,720
as big a hit as they possibly can,

652
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,798
literally. And I was just like, "Oh my

653
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,480
gosh, education is key, right? I wanted

654
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:36,279
to take a second to educate people, but

655
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,480
we're at a party, so it's not really a

656
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:40,558
time place to interrupt everybody and

657
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,839
say, don't ash it, smoke it slow." You

658
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:43,839
don't want the cherry to get too hot

659
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:45,279
because that'll destroy the turpps,

660
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:46,879
right? And that's the beauty with ash,

661
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:48,158
too, right? So, if you have a nice ash

662
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,679
on there, it's going to keep that cherry

663
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,000
nice and cool. Definitely, it insulates

664
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,200
the uh the heat like like none other.

665
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It's really cool, though, you know, when

666
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,120
you pay attention to like how a joint's

667
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,720
performing, you know, like how long it

668
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:00,479
takes for it to spark. Is it instant

669
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,400
combustion? Is it com is it combusting

670
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,720
correctly? Like, you know, when you're

671
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,798
smoking it, you know, sometimes people

672
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,360
will light a joint and they'll forget it

673
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:11,599
and it goes right out. Compared to like

674
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:12,879
if the flower has grown correctly, it's,

675
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:14,879
you know, been fed, it's been taken care

676
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,200
of, loved, you know, that joint will

677
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,720
stay lit for 10 minutes, 5 minutes, 6, 7

678
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,038
minutes, you know, it'll stay lit for a

679
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,640
long time. Oh, yeah. Even if it looks

680
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:24,759
like it's gone out, a lot of times it's

681
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,520
still it's still ready to go.

682
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:29,919
Literally, it's pretty good right here.

683
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:31,440
Nice. And then where you put the rosin

684
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,720
in the joint is so important too. You

685
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,159
want to put it back a little ways. Some

686
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,279
guys bring it all the way to the tip and

687
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,039
I don't think that's the right way to do

688
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:39,759
it. No, me I like to put it in the

689
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:42,158
middleish kind of like at least one/3

690
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:43,440
from the front. So the reason why is I

691
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,039
like to be able to let the flour

692
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,558
combust. Get it, you know, you get to

693
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:48,640
you want to try the flour. What are you

694
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:49,918
pairing it with? If you put the hash in

695
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,159
the front, you're not really going to

696
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,240
get that chance to experience the

697
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,080
flavor, you know, on your palette with

698
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,120
the actual like the flour, the turppines

699
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:59,119
from the flour.

700
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:06,159
This is good. Yeah, it's pretty good,

701
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:07,279
huh? It's a mandala uh squirt.

702
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,200
Yeah, it's got a little bit of that

703
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:10,720
Starburst taste to it. I love that. It's

704
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,880
funny cuz we put we paired it with some

705
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,120
Starburst. That's the perfect pairing.

706
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:18,559
Yeah, I put a squirt with Starburst

707
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:21,359
number 26. It's a feno that uh Dream

708
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:24,000
Dream by ESG out in Sacramento. They uh

709
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:25,839
that's one of their fenos right there.

710
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,440
Yeah, this is really special. So yeah,

711
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:28,798
we're doing a food show. We'll get you

712
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,519
back on the food show. And the food show

713
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:34,240
is going to be acas style where we pair

714
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:36,720
different food with with either joints,

715
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,079
dabs, you know, we'll use alcohol cuz I

716
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,600
seen some really good alcohol out there,

717
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:41,599
too. I was like, "Oh, man. A shot sounds

718
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:42,879
nice." Totally. Yeah. If you do, and you

719
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:44,879
don't even need a full shot. You just

720
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,720
need a little sip. And I think we have

721
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,080
the kitchen set up here so we can do the

722
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,919
food show. And it's going to be great

723
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:52,000
because we can incorporate my genetics.

724
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,559
Whether it's in the form of rosin,

725
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,159
patella,

726
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:57,839
joints, bong rips, you you name it. We

727
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,520
can smoke at any vaporizers. We get a

728
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:01,279
vaporizer company to come on the show,

729
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:02,639
show us their vaporizers and we try

730
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,240
different things. Right. There's a lot

731
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,640
of cool vaporizer companies out there

732
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,159
too as well nowadays. Oh, man. Yeah.

733
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,840
Stores in Bickl, too. They have a really

734
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,600
great, you know, they're the Volcano

735
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:13,759
manufacturer. Yeah. And I think they

736
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:15,199
they just do a really good job. But, uh,

737
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:17,038
so there's so many different companies

738
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,679
with devices that are good now. It's

739
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:21,440
like I'm a huge fan of Focus V and all

740
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,720
the stuff they're doing, you know. Yeah.

741
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,120
No, shout out to the homies over there

742
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:28,278
of Focus, you know. They're crushing it,

743
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:28,278
you know.

744
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:32,399
Yeah, that's that's special. Yeah, it's

745
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:33,918
pretty nice, man. I enjoy it. You know,

746
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,360
this is uh one of the roles that we

747
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,880
entered into the proper doink

748
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:39,439
competition.

749
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,760
10K. Wasn't it wasn't the 10K winner,

750
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,360
though. So, we're smoking it now,

751
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:46,079
though. We're enjoying it. Tastes good.

752
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:48,719
It's smooth. It It's got a little baby

753
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:50,720
bite. It It has a nice bite, though.

754
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,159
Like I feel like it's like That's how it

755
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,440
should be. That's how you know you're

756
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,840
smoking weed. You know what I mean? Like

757
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,440
it's got that It's full flavor, too.

758
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:59,599
It's not It's not like very Some of

759
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,200
these ones are very linear where it's

760
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:04,480
like it's one thing and it's like either

761
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,798
super candy or super papaya or even with

762
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,558
that GMO like you get the gaks and the

763
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:10,720
GMOs together where it's like those are

764
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:12,639
special too, right? But I love the

765
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,558
complexity where it's like multi-layered

766
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,278
and then as you burn it down like the

767
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:18,639
flavor gets intensified and then you're

768
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:20,159
like wait there's turpps I didn't even

769
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,520
taste on the first literally and then

770
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,679
there's one thing too you know there's a

771
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:26,158
couple things about our pallet you know

772
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:28,159
uh when we smoke you know from the left

773
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,278
to the right to the middle you know

774
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,559
you're going to you're going to your

775
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:32,400
pallet's going to interact different

776
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:34,558
with each hit just based on it different

777
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,720
taste buds you know with your pallet so

778
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:39,359
always remember that when you're smoking

779
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:43,839
try it out you know I'm not saying it's

780
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:47,119
back. It's bro science. So,

781
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:50,079
hit it from your left,

782
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:52,879
hit it from your right,

783
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:54,240
and once in the middle, and then you'll

784
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,559
be able to you'll you'll taste three

785
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,519
different You'll It It's It's crazy, you

786
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:01,519
know. But try it out out there if you

787
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:03,519
haven't tried it. Dude, this thing is

788
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:05,519
burning really nice. I mean, that's

789
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:07,119
exactly what you're looking for. No,

790
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:10,558
it's it's performing. It's doing a great

791
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:12,399
job. It's It's really smooth. Yeah. And

792
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:14,879
so, as far as tips, what are your

793
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,480
preferences on tips? So, I mean, it just

794
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,080
varies depending on the size of the roll

795
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,440
that I'm going to create. If I'm rolling

796
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:23,599
like a say I'm rolling one grammers, I

797
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,159
roll for the rec mark, I do a 1 g with

798
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:28,240
the 0 2. So, I do those with the 10 mil.

799
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,640
If I could, I'd get a 9 mil, honestly.

800
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,640
Yeah. Just because u the smaller in

801
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,600
diameter restricts air flow, therefore

802
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,960
causing it to burn at a slower rate. And

803
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:38,558
what happens when it burns at a slower

804
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:42,240
rate, you get a better accuracy of

805
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:43,839
flavor, right? You know, um, and I feel

806
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,919
like, you know, cuz like with that one,

807
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:48,240
it's it's a bigger tip. That's a 12 mil,

808
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,600
you know, and, uh, like it's it's like

809
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,038
when you hit it, it's like a cannon. It

810
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:53,038
just hits you. It's like, wo, it's it's

811
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:55,038
there compared to like when you're

812
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:57,679
smoking a smaller diameter tip. It's

813
00:26:55,038 --> 00:26:59,200
like it's a more slower hit. I'm still

814
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,400
on the fence of whether I like the 10 to

815
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,400
the 12, but I guess it's depending on

816
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,080
the amount of flour you use. Has a lot

817
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,240
to do with it. If you're using a lot of

818
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:10,720
flour, you got to use a 12. Definitely

819
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:13,120
anything over like 2.5, 2 g, 2 g and up.

820
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,600
Definitely a 12 mil is is good depending

821
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:17,759
on how the flour is though cuz Right.

822
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:19,359
There's some flour that's fluffy. Mhm.

823
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:22,000
And there's some flour that's really

824
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:24,558
dense. I mean, and a 2 g look like a 1.5

825
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,240
to you, right? You know, so sometimes it

826
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:27,918
just varies, right? The Z we got is

827
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:32,079
pretty fluffy, right? And so you you put

828
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:33,679
a 2 g Z next to a 2 G of GDP or

829
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:35,038
something really dense, you know.

830
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,240
Speaking of which, we got the ZDP

831
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:38,319
coming. We're going to have to do a

832
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,240
collab on that 100%. Oh, definitely.

833
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:41,519
Dude, uh that one's special and it's

834
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,359
everything you would, you know, like if

835
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:45,519
you if you hear ZDP, you're like, "Oh,

836
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:48,158
grandp leans heavy on the granddaddy

837
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:50,079
with a hint of Skittles." Oh, dang. So

838
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,799
now I'm over confluent like thinking, do

839
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:54,960
we put more Skittles rosin or do we put

840
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:57,519
like a grape gas uva rosin? you know,

841
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,519
something that has that grape flavor or

842
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:00,879
them Skittles. Yeah. I mean, Skittles

843
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:03,519
makes everything taste better pretty

844
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,440
much. So, it's always like I I always go

845
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:07,119
to Skittles right away, but it's like

846
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,399
what I should be doing is going towards

847
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:10,000
different things that compliment it more

848
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:11,199
cuz Skittles pretty much across the

849
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,960
board, you know what to expect. It's

850
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,480
going to be more candy. It's going to be

851
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,640
super sweet. It's going to be delicious.

852
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,240
It's smooth. You know, the rosin is

853
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,880
smooth. It's not overly strong. Like,

854
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,440
dude, that crippy rosin is [ __ ]

855
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,120
amazing, but it is so strong. Like even

856
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,360
in the pen, the vape pen, like you can

857
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:29,199
smoke Skittles, five hits. One hit of

858
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:32,798
the crippy is equal to five hits of the

859
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:35,200
Skittles. Jesus, that's crazy. Yeah. You

860
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:38,720
know, [ __ ] Um I was just thinking like

861
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:41,200
say with the flower of like say the ZDP

862
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,440
said it's a heavy GDP, meaning it's more

863
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,200
grapey, more like floral. It's that

864
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,640
lavender floral old school. But the

865
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,600
thing is is when you squeeze it, you're

866
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,360
like it smells just like granddaddy. all

867
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:54,558
that nostalgia coming back right when

868
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:56,398
you squeeze the bud and it's got a not

869
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:57,839
so great structure, right? And that's

870
00:28:56,398 --> 00:28:59,278
crazy because when you were talking like

871
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:00,720
when you said flora, the first thing

872
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:03,919
that I was going to say what I like to

873
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,759
pair certain flowers with is a floral uh

874
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,200
rosin, you know, cuz some people don't

875
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:08,720
really care for floral, but if you know

876
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,480
how to use it, it's really good, you

877
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,960
know, just based on what you're pairing

878
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,120
with, you know. Yeah. I love floral

879
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,278
turpps. I love that floral expression. I

880
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:18,719
like smoking it. I think it's uh like

881
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:20,240
that silky floral. Well, there's

882
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,079
something about it. It's like rose water

883
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,798
and like, you know, just something like

884
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:27,439
just Yeah, we had a a creme rose

885
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:29,519
Skittles. Tim and Kyle from Canon

886
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,278
Organics. It was from their seeds and we

887
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:33,759
were growing it and we had all of us

888
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:35,519
lost it. But dude, that creme rose was

889
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:38,398
like straight rose water and they had a

890
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:40,558
Skittles and it was just everything that

891
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:42,000
you could imagine about like candy and

892
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:43,519
rose water, which is great. And I've

893
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,119
been like searching for that ever since.

894
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:46,558
I talk about on my show. I've had some

895
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:48,239
people send me seeds. I've even popped

896
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:50,000
the seeds and just not found exactly

897
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,000
what I'm looking for. But yeah, there's

898
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,240
something special about those unique th

899
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,839
those outliers, those unicorns, you

900
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,278
know, they're out there. Yeah. No,

901
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:59,199
definitely they're out there. You know,

902
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:02,720
like White Thorn Rose has a crazy

903
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,640
floral, but it's funky and it's uh it's

904
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,399
got like

905
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:08,960
this I don't want to call it zest, but

906
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:11,839
it's like it's got this Yeah. You know,

907
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:14,000
that that that I don't know how to call

908
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:16,079
it, you It's just it's got that little

909
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,440
something in there, you know, and and

910
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:18,960
like that's what we're looking for for

911
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,880
the next strain, you know. Obviously,

912
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,558
that's the next level we want to come

913
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,399
with. I love Whiteth Thorn. I love White

914
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:26,798
I love the rosin. The White Thorn rosin

915
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:28,639
is so good. I mean, it even makes the

916
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:30,398
the the best rosin gummies I've ever had

917
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,679
were made with White Thorn Rose. Yeah.

918
00:30:30,398 --> 00:30:33,439
Right. And the effect from it is so

919
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,120
good, too. Big shout out to Johnny. I

920
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,038
talk about the strain on my show a lot.

921
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:38,798
Yeah. But it's special. I'm excited.

922
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:41,038
Yeah. The family, they're doing a whole

923
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:43,200
lineup with with them. uh whitethorn

924
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:44,960
rose crosses with over there at the cost

925
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,038
of floor family. Yeah, it's really cool.

926
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,319
It's gonna be awesome. Yeah, that's some

927
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:50,240
special stuff. So, so I'm actually

928
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:52,960
giving Johnny my ZDP. He's the only

929
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,960
cultivator outside of my circle that's

930
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,640
getting the ZDP and and we're going to

931
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,919
breed it together. I feel like it has a

932
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,759
similar effect where it has that

933
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,440
feel-good effect. Oh, yeah. And so,

934
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:03,200
there's just something special about

935
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,679
stuff like that, especially like on the

936
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,919
floral side. It's just as exciting as

937
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,679
the gassy and and also the [ __ ]

938
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,759
purple candy gas. I still like purple

939
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,679
candy gas, don't get me wrong, but it's

940
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:15,519
there's so much of it, right?

941
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,759
Everything's really gone that way. So

942
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:20,480
much candy gas out there. Cherry gas,

943
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:23,038
candy gas. Yeah, it's all it's all that

944
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,640
candy with gas and like those are really

945
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:26,640
strong, too. For the most part, they're

946
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,399
like really strong and sedative. Mhm.

947
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,640
Yeah. I know. Oh my god, man. I smoked a

948
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:33,278
joint yesterday. Yeah. I I think it was

949
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:36,000
the perm RS11.

950
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:37,200
I was out. Well, it's funny. The RS11 I

951
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,640
was talking to Dave cuz he's done

952
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,480
breeding with it. I've done some I have

953
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,960
my permanent midnight which is pretty

954
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,720
special and all this all the fenos

955
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,360
really have the permanent nose. He has

956
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,120
that I think it's candy paint. Oh yeah.

957
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:51,678
Yeah. He has a couple and then some of

958
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:54,719
them really lean towards that [ __ ] uh

959
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:57,120
marker. Oo no I love good marker crosses

960
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,798
man. I can't wait to see new marker

961
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:00,239
crosses coming out. First class

962
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:01,839
genetics. They do some good marker

963
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,159
crosses. That's where I got my cut of

964
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:06,639
permanent marker which from Yeah. First

965
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:07,760
class genetics. He's the secret nobody

966
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,159
knows about. The guy who gets the

967
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:11,839
genetics out there. Now we don't. So

968
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:13,600
yeah. Yeah. He's he's a good friend,

969
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:15,278
too. Awesome. That's dope. At the

970
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:16,879
highest level, the guys kind of work

971
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:18,240
together. I feel like even the breeders,

972
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,679
it's like I like collaborating with

973
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,960
people. I like sharing stuff. I like

974
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,559
sharing some stuff. Um, not everything.

975
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,840
Not everything. I don't think genetics I

976
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:27,278
want I don't want to share every last

977
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:29,599
little bit because a lot of times we go

978
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:31,440
through a lot of cost to pheno hunt

979
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:32,879
stuff, you know. But I I put everyone on

980
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,240
game with my book. So, anyone who wants

981
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,399
to learn how to breed, everything I do

982
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,240
is like literally in my book. It's I

983
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:39,599
don't I don't hold back information. You

984
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,960
want to know how I do reversals, all

985
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:43,119
that stuff is in there. I think

986
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,798
education is key, man. And sharing

987
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:46,639
education with everybody, especially the

988
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:48,000
guys who want to buy my book, a lot of

989
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,919
people are home growers. It's like

990
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,599
anybody can breed, anybody can do

991
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,840
selections. Maybe they can't do it on

992
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:55,278
the scale of other people, but like, you

993
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:56,959
know, and that's the future is genetics.

994
00:32:55,278 --> 00:32:58,159
I feel like that's what makes you separ

995
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,840
separate from everybody else. That's

996
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,200
what makes your brand stand out. You'll

997
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:03,119
stand out a lot more if you have

998
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,038
something unique and special.

999
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:07,359
Definitely. No, you're not lying, dude.

1000
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:09,038
Uh that is the that's the way to go. You

1001
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:11,119
know, creating your own genetics, you

1002
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:12,480
know, coming with your own lineups, you

1003
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:15,278
know, being different, not just going

1004
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,679
and buying a going to a dro and buying

1005
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:20,159
10 different candies and calling it 10

1006
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:22,159
different names. Yeah. Runs and LCGs all

1007
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,960
day long. Oh, this is runs back across

1008
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:27,200
the LCG with a little bit of candy gas.

1009
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,679
Yeah, it's Cayenne Rents. I got, you

1010
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,440
know, it's like I got the new color

1011
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:33,200
shout out to the new runs the line you

1012
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,200
got dropping right with that one dude.

1013
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,759
So we got chocolate runs and that that's

1014
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,840
a chalopee times runs. It's a LC. So

1015
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:41,359
basically we it's amazing though but

1016
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:43,199
it's got like the pheno we selected.

1017
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:45,038
There's one that's hazy. It's got a runt

1018
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,880
structure but has a hazy nose. We got

1019
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:48,720
the one in the middle. The number two is

1020
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,480
like just in the middle. It's very

1021
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,360
chocolateaty. It's runsy. And then we

1022
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:56,798
have one that leans towards that runy

1023
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:58,959
LCG [ __ ] cherry like the the candy

1024
00:33:56,798 --> 00:34:00,720
gas nose, right? Like the old school

1025
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,240
runs like it's it reminds me of the

1026
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,159
original runs that we smoked back in the

1027
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,599
day. The real candy. Yeah, the real

1028
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:08,800
candy. What got that? That's kind of

1029
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:10,559
what hyped up candy. It's like Gushers.

1030
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,879
Kind of like the Smarties candy back.

1031
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:14,799
Big was doing the Gushers like back in

1032
00:34:12,878 --> 00:34:16,559
the day. Like that was maybe six years

1033
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,159
ago or something. Man, I love me a good

1034
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:20,559
batch of the connected Gushers though

1035
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,960
when it was over there on for ridge. Oh,

1036
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:25,838
dude. So good. Yeah, Gushers is amazing.

1037
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:28,398
Yeah, I I really enjoy Gushers. Uh it's

1038
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:29,599
been a few minutes and it's still lit.

1039
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:30,960
Yeah, dude. That's the best part of it.

1040
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:33,119
Like we can sit here and talk and I

1041
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,119
think that's the way we consume joints

1042
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:37,440
now is so different from maybe 15, 20

1043
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,440
years ago where where we do roll them in

1044
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,119
a way where I used to roll big joints

1045
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,519
too, but it's like these ones we can

1046
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,280
actually just let it sit. We can talk.

1047
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:47,199
We can talk for 5 minutes, seven minutes

1048
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,720
before we puff. You don't want to smoke

1049
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,398
these too fast either. The second you

1050
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,480
start putting rosin and stuff, it's like

1051
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:54,319
taking dabs and smoking joints at the

1052
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,719
same time. Literally, it's like

1053
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,240
sedating. It's like you're like, "Yeah,

1054
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,439
cuz I do dabs and they wake me up a lot

1055
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:00,639
of times. I'll do a dab in the morning

1056
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,240
and I'm awake. It doesn't make me

1057
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:03,759
tired." Whereas, if I smoke a whole

1058
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:05,759
joint in the morning, but I don't smoke

1059
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,680
hasho. Oh, hasholes will put me out.

1060
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,839
Literally, I have to I can't smoke

1061
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:12,078
donuts in the morning. No, no, I I

1062
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:14,000
can't. Not unless I'm in Vegas. Unless

1063
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:16,240
I'm on vacation, I'm smoking donuts from

1064
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,719
sun up to sun down. But if I'm I have to

1065
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:20,559
work and I have business to do, I have

1066
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:23,199
to just smoke a flower roll or

1067
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:24,719
something, you know? It's rough. Yeah.

1068
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:26,399
Yeah. And then even flower, it's like I

1069
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:28,319
get so many effects from so many

1070
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,400
different things,

1071
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,838
you know. And I think hazes are making a

1072
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,240
comeback. Green is making a comeback.

1073
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:35,838
Oh, I love me a good haze. Crippy.

1074
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:37,279
That's going to be out there. It's It's

1075
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:39,838
already out there. What's your favorite

1076
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,680
haze right now? So, I'm feno hunting

1077
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:44,480
some blueberry haze times King Louis the

1078
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:45,919
13th from Dave Mesford that passed away.

1079
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,679
We got some of that going on and I'm

1080
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,920
super excited about it. But, I mean, I

1081
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:51,358
like Apollo Haze. I like I'm fo hunting

1082
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,320
Apollo Haze, too. I found some old

1083
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:56,559
brother Grim Seeds. Um, and I mean I

1084
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,920
like Super Silver. You can't go wrong

1085
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:00,000
with some Super Silver. Have you ever

1086
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,480
had uh the Nana's haze over there at Kaj

1087
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,079
Verde? No. Oh, bro. It's Sunset Sherbet

1088
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,679
with their uh with the Super Silver

1089
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:09,119
Haze, I believe. Wow. Bro, it's f fire,

1090
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:10,399
bro. Don't quote me on Super Silver

1091
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,920
Haze, though. I know it's a haze,

1092
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,599
though. It's a sherbet haze, but it's a

1093
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,440
sherbet haze crossing, bro. I promise

1094
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:17,599
you it's really good. Yeah. I mean, I do

1095
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,039
like that Super Silver Amnesia. Like,

1096
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:21,039
that's super nostalgic for me. It

1097
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:23,199
reminds me of Europe from [ __ ] 15

1098
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:25,320
years ago. Yeah. But, you know, it's

1099
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:27,639
like I like diversity, too. And I like

1100
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:30,400
sativas, like these narrow leaf

1101
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:31,679
varieties, like African ones. And I feel

1102
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,838
like it's funny because you can have

1103
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:37,838
these three African strains and people

1104
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:39,519
think of Durban, Malawi, and then Red

1105
00:36:37,838 --> 00:36:41,358
Congo, right? They're they're all from

1106
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:43,519
Africa, but they all have very different

1107
00:36:41,358 --> 00:36:45,679
effects. And like the Durban just kind

1108
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:47,920
of kicks your ass. Like it'll put you in

1109
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:49,679
the dirt real quick, right? Super super

1110
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,240
strong. And then you go over to the

1111
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:53,279
Maloi, and the Maloi is freaking

1112
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:54,879
amazing, too. But it's almost

1113
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,599
psychedelic. Like that [ __ ] sounds like

1114
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:00,160
it would give me freaking anxiety. Yeah,

1115
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,680
that Malawi is anxiety weed, but it's so

1116
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:03,759
super strong. It's like psychedelic

1117
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:05,838
strong weed. I think it's THCV. There's

1118
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,920
definitely THCV in there. Okay. And then

1119
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:09,279
you got the red congo. And the red congo

1120
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,880
gets you so high you're like a kid

1121
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,800
again. The red congo gets me high, but

1122
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,800
it makes me giggly laughing. Whereas the

1123
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,519
other ones are more on like the paranoia

1124
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,359
or like just out. Dude, that that red

1125
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:21,119
congo special. You know what? when

1126
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:22,639
you're saying that it kind of it sparked

1127
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:25,519
my interest and what I'm what I'm trying

1128
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:28,000
to d like like push my direction of like

1129
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:30,239
the brand is being able to like uh focus

1130
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,079
on like healing elements and stuff like

1131
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:33,598
like you said like with certain weed it

1132
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,839
makes you giggly and laugh you know cuz

1133
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:38,000
some people are battling depression and

1134
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:39,440
anxiety. So we when we're able to find

1135
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,358
strains like that that's going to make

1136
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,599
them happy and give them uplifting you

1137
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:45,598
know energy and that's the type of stuff

1138
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:47,440
that we want to be able to be like

1139
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:49,519
descriptive about you know when we

1140
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,679
package our stuff. So then people when

1141
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:54,000
they're out there shopping because it's

1142
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:55,598
not just something we do as to to have

1143
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,599
fun with this is medication at the end

1144
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,680
of the day we're medicating you know and

1145
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:02,880
so that's like that's one thing that I I

1146
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:05,199
like I'm working on right now for us as

1147
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,440
like cuz you like you said what you do

1148
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:10,159
you know with the genetics you we're

1149
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,480
creating the new wave creating more you

1150
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:14,879
know and being able to say cross you

1151
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,519
know that that that strain with a strain

1152
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,358
that's going to make a person hungry

1153
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:20,639
give them give them like, "Oh, I'm

1154
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:22,319
hungry." It's needed. There's people

1155
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:25,199
with cancer that are on chemotherapy

1156
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,480
treatments and it's like literally they

1157
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:28,559
need something that can help their

1158
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,880
nausea and make them eat, you know. But

1159
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:32,719
other other people are are also, you

1160
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,640
know, they're very thin and they need to

1161
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:38,078
put on weight and they don't need to

1162
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:39,358
smoke some some hazes to they they won't

1163
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,800
get the experience that they're looking

1164
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:42,078
for. They need to smoke something that's

1165
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,920
going to make them hungry literally

1166
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:46,079
because there's some some weed don't

1167
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,800
make me hungry. Like I'll be hungry as a

1168
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:50,800
mug and then I and then I'll smoke and

1169
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,640
then I'm not hungry no more. Totally.

1170
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,920
Like and I'm like, damn, I should have I

1171
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:57,759
should have ate before I But but that

1172
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,000
goes for it, you know, cuz sometimes it

1173
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,920
literally kills that hunger, right?

1174
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,440
Yeah. The GDP, stuff like that make me

1175
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,639
super hungry. I get the munchies from

1176
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,559
that. There's munchy weed and then

1177
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:08,159
there's stuff that's not munchy weed.

1178
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:10,000
Definitely. So, and then also the way I

1179
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:12,399
consume it, like depending on how high I

1180
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
get with certain things, it's like if I

1181
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,599
smoke first thing in the morning, then

1182
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,039
I'm more hungry sometimes. It just

1183
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,039
depends like if I do a dab, it doesn't

1184
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:20,880
usually make me hungry, right? So, like

1185
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:22,960
and I I like Skittles dabs. I've been

1186
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,640
smoking on the pen with that deep dive

1187
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,559
into Rossin. I've been like trying

1188
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:29,679
different pens and cartridges with my

1189
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:31,440
buddies, okay? And it's like literally

1190
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:32,639
there's you can have one cartridge to

1191
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,559
the next and you get a different

1192
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:36,159
experience. you get a different pull,

1193
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:38,400
different temperature, it could taste

1194
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:40,399
different. And so it's like all these

1195
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,559
things. If you're a breeder and you want

1196
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,079
to be not fully vertically integrated,

1197
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:45,119
but like if you want to have stuff in

1198
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,880
your brand where you're working with

1199
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,400
product SK, I'm a genetics guy, so I

1200
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,760
want to know what it the experience is

1201
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,119
in these different things. Eventually,

1202
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,720
we're going to breed specifically for

1203
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,559
carts as opposed to rosin, you know what

1204
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:57,358
I mean? Like yeah, we'll do rosin carts,

1205
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:59,039
but how is it experiencing in in a pen,

1206
00:39:57,358 --> 00:40:00,400
right? You know, and so I get excited

1207
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:01,838
about those deep dives. And so I'm like,

1208
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,680
well, I got to try all these pens. I got

1209
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:05,199
to try these different strains with the

1210
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:07,039
same pen to see which one tastes the

1211
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:08,639
best. Right. Cuz not every pen is going

1212
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:10,960
to give that same reflection of the

1213
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:13,279
turpp. No. And I've really I like the O2

1214
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,039
vape. The O2 vape is actually Cannabis

1215
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,760
Brothers use those. Those are the little

1216
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:19,759
square ones. Yeah. No, the they're the

1217
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,440
round thin ones. Okay. With the glass

1218
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,040
top. Oh, I know. They're maybe not the

1219
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,358
sexiest. Maybe some of these others you

1220
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:26,719
get more hardware, but like Yeah. And I

1221
00:40:25,358 --> 00:40:28,559
like the way they hit. I like the

1222
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:30,078
temperature of them. Okay. Uh you know,

1223
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:31,519
we tested a bunch of stuff. I mean, I

1224
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,519
some of the old school brands are really

1225
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:36,159
good still, too. But I learned something

1226
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:38,159
new. You don't want cotton in your

1227
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:39,440
cartridge. Like, a lot of them have the

1228
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:41,679
ceramic and then sometimes under the

1229
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:44,000
ceramic, they put cotton. You got to be

1230
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:45,919
careful because that'll give you cancer,

1231
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,679
right? And so, like, we're smoking to

1232
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,480
prevent lung. I mean, a lot of us smoke

1233
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:50,159
and they're like, well, we're not going

1234
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,358
to get lung cancer from smoking like you

1235
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:54,000
would cigarettes. And so, that's like

1236
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:56,078
one of the pluses. But if you're smoking

1237
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
cotton or smoking a shitty cartridge

1238
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:00,400
from China that's not made properly,

1239
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,400
right? or a bootleg or a bootleg that

1240
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,400
has [ __ ] problems with it where it's

1241
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,160
got pesticides or who knows what in it.

1242
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,358
Who knows? Yeah. No, definitely. So, you

1243
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:08,399
got to really be careful on what you're

1244
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:10,078
putting in your body, you know? It's

1245
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,079
like I try to eat mostly organic. I

1246
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,079
don't eat all organic, but I try to,

1247
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,680
right? And then same thing with smoking.

1248
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:19,280
I mean, I don't necessarily smoke all

1249
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:21,838
organic weed. It's mostly um and then

1250
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,519
even substrate. I don't have one 100%

1251
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:24,880
prefer. I I like certain things for

1252
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:27,838
certain things. I like rockwool for

1253
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:30,079
rockwool is amazing for uh certain

1254
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:31,838
environments. Living soil is amazing for

1255
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:33,599
other environments. Cocoa is great all

1256
00:41:31,838 --> 00:41:34,880
around. All strains, you know,

1257
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,160
definitely different homes for different

1258
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,000
strains, you know. Just like lights,

1259
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:40,399
too. Same thing with lights. HPS lights

1260
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,159
are great. Anybody who says HPS lights

1261
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,760
aren't good. I mean, they're not as cost

1262
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:45,759
effective, right? And they cost more to

1263
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,400
run, but as far as what you get out of

1264
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:50,400
it, you get a great product. Definitely.

1265
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,318
So, but yeah, this thing's still

1266
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,079
burning, still tasting great. She's

1267
00:41:52,318 --> 00:41:55,599
doing her thing.

1268
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,960
Well, and it's not like this next joint.

1269
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:58,079
When we smoke this next joint, we're not

1270
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,838
going to be able to drive for a couple

1271
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:02,318
hours. Yeah, that one's going to be The

1272
00:41:59,838 --> 00:42:04,078
crippy is just That crippy was very hard

1273
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:07,440
to roll up. I'm not going to lie. It was

1274
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:08,560
like Jesus Christ, this thing is sticky.

1275
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,200
I'm not going to lie. I'm a little bit

1276
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:12,960
afraid. Yeah, I'm afraid too because

1277
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:15,519
that's got the like at least a grandma

1278
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,440
patella of Skittles. Yeah. Well, it's

1279
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:18,880
like the Skittles might help it out. I

1280
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,519
think it might get That's a diva right

1281
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,200
there, you guys. Yeah. And so, uh, I

1282
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:25,519
when I was in Spain, I was hanging out

1283
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:27,598
with Eric from Flow Gardens and, uh, he

1284
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:30,239
had some hemp for me. This high CBD,

1285
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:33,838
very low THC, very turppy. He got third

1286
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:35,519
place at Spanabis for CBD. And so I got

1287
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:38,559
this funny idea that I was going to take

1288
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:41,199
CBD flour and smoke it with rosin, like

1289
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:42,799
THC rosin.

1290
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:45,039
You know, the funny thing is is I I

1291
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,760
could smoke whole joints of rosin, like

1292
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:50,639
like a half gram or a gram of rosin with

1293
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,920
a big old CBD joint, and I could smoke

1294
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:52,960
those to my head and smoke them all the

1295
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,358
way down. Just sit there and smoke them

1296
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,039
for 45 minutes or whatever. Mhm. And it

1297
00:42:55,358 --> 00:42:58,318
didn't get me over the top high with

1298
00:42:57,039 --> 00:43:00,559
some of the things that like if I would

1299
00:42:58,318 --> 00:43:02,639
have smoked a real traditional hash, it

1300
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:04,960
would have got me way too high, way too

1301
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:06,480
quickly. So, the CBD kind of balances it

1302
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,960
out. And I was still super lit. You know

1303
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:11,119
what I mean? Like CBD doesn't completely

1304
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,720
cancel out the THC. It just doesn't.

1305
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:14,480
It's not like that. I feel like it's

1306
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:16,639
like a 50/50 dang there. It's like

1307
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:19,039
fighting like I want to get you high but

1308
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:20,639
I I'm trying to heal you. Yeah. Well,

1309
00:43:19,039 --> 00:43:22,480
and so Eric and I, we've been talking.

1310
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:23,920
I'm going to start breeding one to ones

1311
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,000
specifically for that purpose cuz I

1312
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,318
really kind of like that effect too. And

1313
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,039
I'm curious is to the the rosin that's

1314
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:32,639
CBD rosin that has the CBD and THC.

1315
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:36,000
Yeah. The homie he grows he does some

1316
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:37,759
CBD rosin. He uh the Hawaiian candy.

1317
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,760
Yeah. Oh, it's fire. It's funny with

1318
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,200
hasholes, they really taste good all the

1319
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,640
way down. I mean, I like flour that

1320
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:45,199
tastes good all the way to the bottom,

1321
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:46,719
but like that it it hasn't lost a bit of

1322
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:47,919
flavor. It's still No, it still tastes

1323
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:49,118
really good, you know. And that's one

1324
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,480
thing I was going to tell you about like

1325
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,640
remember how we're talking about certain

1326
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,000
flowers and certain strains, you know,

1327
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:56,559
cross them, they give you certain

1328
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,318
healing ailments. Mhm. Uh that's the

1329
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:00,400
same thing with hasholes. You know, it's

1330
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:04,719
like, you know, the flowers main tarpin

1331
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:06,318
is XYZ and you know the main tarpine of

1332
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:10,159
the the rosin that you're going to pair

1333
00:44:06,318 --> 00:44:13,838
with it is ABC, you know. So those two

1334
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:15,598
together create elemento P, you know,

1335
00:44:13,838 --> 00:44:17,039
and it creates a different blend, right?

1336
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:19,760
Yeah. And then it what what it does is

1337
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:22,480
it creates like, you know, we say the

1338
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:24,960
anxiety, you know, creates uplifting

1339
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:27,199
energy, all that. Then and it creates

1340
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,920
you wanting to eat creates different

1341
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:31,358
like you know different type of like

1342
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,159
what is the word for it? I'm not too

1343
00:44:31,358 --> 00:44:36,078
sure like the synergistic effect the

1344
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:37,759
entourage effect how it blends together

1345
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:39,480
and all works together in the body.

1346
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,599
Yeah, totally. And it's it's pretty

1347
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:43,679
amazing. We still have a subjective

1348
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,960
experience. I feel like we can smoke the

1349
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:46,000
same thing and get a different

1350
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,559
experience because we have different

1351
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
body chemistries.

1352
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:52,239
But but that being said, I feel like

1353
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,239
some of these things you have a a

1354
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:55,679
similar effect with a lot of them and it

1355
00:44:54,239 --> 00:44:57,279
it you know it's like but it's hard for

1356
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:59,919
doctors especially to be like yeah you

1357
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:01,760
should try this or with this and this

1358
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,599
because from one person to the next it

1359
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,119
might it might not work really well or

1360
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:07,119
it might not work the same you know and

1361
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:09,680
it's like our canabonoid systems are so

1362
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:11,599
uniquely different. Uh I mean our whole

1363
00:45:09,679 --> 00:45:14,399
body chemistry is different and

1364
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:17,599
understanding how canabonoids work from

1365
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:19,838
a plant that's so complex. It's not just

1366
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:22,880
you know this one tarpine. We don't have

1367
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:24,559
a monoturp and one canabonoid you know

1368
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,640
doing the job. It's this entourage

1369
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:29,920
effect of all of them working together

1370
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:31,838
to give us these specific effects. So

1371
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,599
okay but yeah it's pretty exciting.

1372
00:45:31,838 --> 00:45:36,159
That's a lot of education right there.

1373
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:38,240
You know it's a good it's a good topic.

1374
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:39,838
You know, I feel like there's a lot of

1375
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:42,000
research that needs to be developed on

1376
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:44,559
that for different, you know, purposes

1377
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,480
of not just consuming to smoke a hashel,

1378
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:49,119
but what are the healing properties of

1379
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:52,000
that hashold that creates the like what

1380
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:53,358
we're going to do at uh the uh talk over

1381
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,719
there for the connect community. Oh,

1382
00:45:53,358 --> 00:45:55,598
yeah. Coming up, dude. That's going to

1383
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:57,039
be a good one. You're on the first

1384
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:58,240
panel. I'm on the second panel. Yeah,

1385
00:45:57,039 --> 00:45:59,599
it's going to be fire. Yeah, dude. It's

1386
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:00,879
It's funny cuz that's going to be a

1387
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:04,559
really good event. I'm looking forward

1388
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,920
to that with uh Sergio and you know

1389
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:07,679
we're it's we're talking about turpps

1390
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,838
and flavor you know it's definitely deep

1391
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:11,679
dives and then I believe he has a

1392
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:15,039
special guest coming she's going to be

1393
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:17,279
bringing through some dude yeah device

1394
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:19,759
special device and it's going to show us

1395
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:22,800
the carcinogens and everything of you

1396
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:24,880
know of the pool and like if it like how

1397
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,318
harmful it is for our body. Yeah. You

1398
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,000
know, and it's pretty cool cuz, you

1399
00:46:26,318 --> 00:46:30,880
know, I'm curious to see what is it

1400
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,039
going to be like for hash holes, right?

1401
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:35,039
You know. Yeah. And I also think that's

1402
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:37,119
subjective to the hashole cuz like

1403
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:38,480
they're they're not all made equal.

1404
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:39,838
Well, no, they're not because you got to

1405
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,760
remember hasholes burn at a higher

1406
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:44,559
temperature, right? You know, based on

1407
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:47,040
the rosin or fresh press or patella,

1408
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:49,119
right? That's why we urge people to take

1409
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:52,159
your time when smoking them. Let them

1410
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:53,599
cool down so you can enjoy them. Yeah.

1411
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:54,879
And it's all about the experience. I

1412
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:56,480
mean, some people want to rush to get

1413
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,599
real high, get as high as they can, and

1414
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,280
it's like no matter what, you're going

1415
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:01,519
to get high when you smoke a hashole,

1416
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:03,119
right? So, definitely it's like I like

1417
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:04,800
easing into them. I like taking smaller

1418
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:06,640
hits. I also like if I take too big a

1419
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,200
hit, I don't get the full flavor. And I

1420
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:10,480
I do like when the high comes on

1421
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:12,000
gradually. If you want to get really

1422
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,800
high, you just take a couple big hits

1423
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,480
and you're good. Mhm. Definitely. You

1424
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:19,440
take a good one. Oh, man. I think I have

1425
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:21,760
you coughing. Like a dab like And you

1426
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,599
get the effect, you know, cuz the THC is

1427
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:26,960
so high. Sometimes I'd be like, "Oh,

1428
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:29,359
hold up." Yeah. Seriously, one got me in

1429
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,800
Vegas. I got I got hit in Vegas. I took

1430
00:47:29,358 --> 00:47:32,318
a big huge hit off of somebody's

1431
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,680
hashole. Thought it was a joint, but I

1432
00:47:32,318 --> 00:47:34,719
took a big hit cuz I was running around

1433
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:35,919
so much. Yeah. You're like, "Hold on,

1434
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:37,279
let me hit this." Yeah. And then next

1435
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,119
thing you know, I'm like, "Wow, I'm

1436
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,880
freaking done." He's like, "Let me sit

1437
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:42,400
down real quick." Literally, I'm like,

1438
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:44,400
"I just got to do one thing and not try

1439
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,838
to do 20 things." There you go. Yeah. I

1440
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,519
know. It was a busy day that day,

1441
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:49,279
though. Yeah. And I had I had the torch.

1442
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:50,960
We were torching s'mores and that's when

1443
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,960
I was super high is I was like, "I got

1444
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:55,280
to go. I got to torch the s'mores. We

1445
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:57,440
had uh dab torch s'mores where we had

1446
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,280
giant marshmallows that we torched up

1447
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,639
and got them nice and brown and then put

1448
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,319
them with Yeah, that was a lot of fun.

1449
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:04,799
It was, man. It was a whole vibe, dude.

1450
00:48:02,318 --> 00:48:07,519
I had a great time.

1451
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:10,079
Yeah. I mean, I'm sure excited. I'm

1452
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:11,519
loaded right now. Next year in Vegas,

1453
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:13,519
it's going to be a lot of fun. It's too

1454
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:16,079
bad Spanabis is over. Uh I'm going to

1455
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:17,920
Mary Jane in June. They need more

1456
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:20,000
rollers in Mary Jane. We'll be there.

1457
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,760
I'll be there. I'm I'm I'm already

1458
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,039
working on everything. Dude, you should

1459
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,800
come. So, I got there's great

1460
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:26,639
cultivators out there. So, there's great

1461
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:29,039
flower in Germany now. So, I'm excited

1462
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:30,480
to check that out. I would love to go on

1463
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:32,639
a tour with you. Let's figure something

1464
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,240
out. That'd be fun. Absolutely. And then

1465
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:35,759
so I have two booths. One with

1466
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:37,279
Greenhouse where we're selling seeds and

1467
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,680
then we're doing live podcast from the

1468
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,599
Grove booth. Okay. Right. And so I'll be

1469
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:43,598
there doing live podcast with other

1470
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:45,838
podcasters and also other people. So,

1471
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:47,440
I'd love to do one for the German people

1472
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:48,799
where we can show them your rolling

1473
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,240
skills and kind of bring We'll show them

1474
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,599
how to roll, too. You know, we'll give

1475
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:53,199
them a little We'll give them a little

1476
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:54,480
taste of the education. Yeah. And they

1477
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:55,679
have their own tech. Some of these guys

1478
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,039
have their own ways of rolling. They're

1479
00:48:55,679 --> 00:48:59,759
really good, too. They're backstrap

1480
00:48:57,039 --> 00:49:01,838
rollers all day long. Don't worry. I got

1481
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,920
you. Yeah, they they peel the flag.

1482
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:05,519
Yeah, they got to peel it. You got to If

1483
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,960
you know, you know. Yeah. So, that's how

1484
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:08,719
I learned how to roll, too, was that

1485
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,720
reverse the reverse roll with the sticky

1486
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:12,480
on the outside and peeling the flag off.

1487
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:14,078
Yeah, definitely. That's the culture out

1488
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,760
there. Anyone can burn the flag. You got

1489
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:18,400
to tear it properly. That's that takes

1490
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:20,000
skill. Hey, literally I be I I flex on

1491
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,519
when I can get it all the way to where

1492
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,318
it's like there's still gum line

1493
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:27,599
showing. That's how that's the thinnest

1494
00:49:24,318 --> 00:49:29,039
paper possible from from tip to end. You

1495
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:30,960
know, that's that's the magic when you

1496
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:32,639
can do that. And I think I can roll them

1497
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:35,599
pretty tight around the wood crutches,

1498
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:37,118
too. U so yeah. So I I've been trying to

1499
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:38,640
incorporate that in. But it's hard to

1500
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:40,318
teach people. Like it's one of those

1501
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:42,318
ones where like it's it's hard to teach

1502
00:49:40,318 --> 00:49:43,599
people anyway. feel for it. Yeah. I

1503
00:49:42,318 --> 00:49:45,358
mean, it's hard enough teaching people

1504
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:46,480
how to roll just in general. And then

1505
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:47,920
you throw something like, "Oh, yeah.

1506
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,639
We're going to roll this in reverse."

1507
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,760
Yeah. We're going to roll this

1508
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:50,879
backwards. Yeah. We're going to have a

1509
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,520
piece of paper just sticking off that

1510
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:55,119
you have to tear off. And uh Yeah. So,

1511
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:56,719
but it's a lot of fun, man. No, it is.

1512
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:58,400
Especially when you rip it and it rips

1513
00:49:56,719 --> 00:50:00,318
the whole thing off. You're like, "Well,

1514
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,440
shit." Made a hole right in the middle

1515
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:02,800
of the joint. Like, you're tearing it

1516
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,159
off and all of a sudden you got a hole

1517
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,680
about that long right through. Yeah.

1518
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:07,440
You're like, you're like, "Oh, I didn't

1519
00:50:05,679 --> 00:50:08,799
see that there." Oh, yeah. No, it's

1520
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,720
frustrating. I've done that two times in

1521
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,318
a row when I'm high before and it's like

1522
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:14,879
so frustrating. I just want to smoke

1523
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:17,279
another joint. But like

1524
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,640
smoke two, but I want to smoke one more.

1525
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:21,280
Yeah. When I first started learning how

1526
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:23,440
to reverse roll, I was in Amsterdam in

1527
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:25,119
2013 staying with my friend Abba. He had

1528
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:27,519
a apartment that I stayed in with him

1529
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:29,039
there. Oh, nice. And he felt bad for me

1530
00:50:27,519 --> 00:50:30,639
when I was rolling joints cuz he was

1531
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:32,159
like, "Yeah, let me show you how to

1532
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:33,679
ride. You want to help me?" Cuz my

1533
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:35,440
joints were were pretty pathetic. I

1534
00:50:33,679 --> 00:50:37,039
mean, they smoked, right? I was But that

1535
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,720
was the culture. see the rolling culture

1536
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:40,480
out there was it's just dope to see cuz

1537
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:43,199
y was your journey of the doink, you

1538
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:45,039
know what I mean? Started in Amsterdam.

1539
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:47,199
Paper crutches, right? We never had

1540
00:50:45,039 --> 00:50:49,358
glass crutches or bamboo. We had paper

1541
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:50,719
crutches and the the rolling papers a

1542
00:50:49,358 --> 00:50:52,639
lot of times would come with them. The

1543
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:54,078
coffee shops had rolling papers and

1544
00:50:52,639 --> 00:50:56,239
crutches for free if you bought the

1545
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:57,839
flower that you know you could get that.

1546
00:50:56,239 --> 00:50:59,199
And so that's how I learned to roll with

1547
00:50:57,838 --> 00:51:00,480
the, you know, and basically it's real

1548
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:03,199
easy with the cardboard because the

1549
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:05,519
cardboard expands. So it's not like with

1550
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:07,039
wood or with glass where it's stable. So

1551
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:10,079
you have to really roll it tight around

1552
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:11,759
there. Yeah, I know. That's and it is a

1553
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:14,400
skill because not everybody possesses

1554
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,680
that. Yeah, but it's unamerican to not

1555
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,720
know how to roll a joint. Anthony

1556
00:51:15,679 --> 00:51:21,919
Bourdain said that. I feel that one.

1557
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:24,000
Yeah, it's the new standard literally.

1558
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,358
Yeah. No, man. I feel like uh there's a

1559
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,760
lot of people, you know, out there that

1560
00:51:25,358 --> 00:51:29,679
are starting their journey to the dwink

1561
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:31,680
and learning how to roll. And it's

1562
00:51:29,679 --> 00:51:33,279
really cool to hear that, you know, you

1563
00:51:31,679 --> 00:51:34,799
learned how to roll backstrap out there

1564
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:37,200
in Amsterdam cuz that's like literally

1565
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,559
where that's culture. That's culture out

1566
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:40,639
there to them. Yeah. And a lot of them,

1567
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:43,119
they smoke spliffs, too, with tobacco

1568
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:45,039
and hash, right? And this Pella will

1569
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:48,160
blow their minds, right? The Skittles

1570
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:49,519
Pella that I just made. Mhm. Uh it's

1571
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:51,118
special. So, we're looking to enter that

1572
00:51:49,519 --> 00:51:53,039
in some competitions. I think that the

1573
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:54,559
hash category, traditional hashes,

1574
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:55,838
people's got to step up their entries. I

1575
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:57,440
did the daby last year. There was a

1576
00:51:55,838 --> 00:51:58,799
couple good ones. There was some decent

1577
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,079
ones, but let's step this up. We're

1578
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,839
doing a dabadoo again. I'm looking

1579
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:04,559
forward to people entering really

1580
00:52:01,838 --> 00:52:06,318
awesome traditional hash with either

1581
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:08,319
really good old school flavors or some

1582
00:52:06,318 --> 00:52:10,079
really good new stuff. Not all the same

1583
00:52:08,318 --> 00:52:11,679
stuff as everybody else. And some of

1584
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:13,119
Just cuz it doesn't wash doesn't mean

1585
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:14,639
you shouldn't wash it. That's the other

1586
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:17,200
thing. It might not be commercially

1587
00:52:14,639 --> 00:52:18,400
viable to wash. But like Skittles is a

1588
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:20,399
great example of something that doesn't

1589
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,960
wash very well. You got to love it to

1590
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,480
wash it. Definitely. It's a it's a thing

1591
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,960
of passion because you want the best of

1592
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,880
the best. And there's a bunch of things

1593
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,400
like that. Like some people throw away,

1594
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,000
you know, plants that are literally

1595
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,318
going to change the world's perspective

1596
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,599
on turpps, you know, and just cuz it

1597
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:37,039
doesn't wash right or it doesn't, you

1598
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:38,640
know, it's not it doesn't look right,

1599
00:52:37,039 --> 00:52:40,639
you know, and that's it's so sad that we

1600
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:42,159
Well, in some ways it's so sad because

1601
00:52:40,639 --> 00:52:44,078
we live in this world that's based on

1602
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:46,879
looks, right? So social media

1603
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:48,720
perception. Yeah. I mean that it's

1604
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,720
exacerbated everything with social media

1605
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:52,078
to where you look at that and you're

1606
00:52:50,719 --> 00:52:53,598
like, "Oh man, that's amazing." And

1607
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:55,039
that's a qualifier is the way it looks.

1608
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:56,559
When I was growing up, we had cat piss

1609
00:52:55,039 --> 00:52:58,079
that was shreds in a bag. And so it was

1610
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:59,920
like I didn't care about the way it

1611
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:01,599
looked. I wanted to feel amazing. I

1612
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:03,680
wanted to taste amazing. You want that

1613
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:05,599
effect. Yeah. Yeah. And this this was

1614
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:07,679
the '9s. And so I think we're going back

1615
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:10,160
to that. But it's like I I see the

1616
00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:11,759
easiest way to get back to that is by

1617
00:53:10,159 --> 00:53:14,078
people like yourself and other people

1618
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:15,599
rolling joints and giving the people the

1619
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:16,880
experience in the form of a joint where

1620
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:18,800
they don't ever have to see the flower.

1621
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:20,160
If they trust the brand, they buy it,

1622
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,880
they love it, they're doing it for the

1623
00:53:20,159 --> 00:53:24,639
experience. And it really doesn't matter

1624
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,720
what that flower looks like or even what

1625
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:29,279
the rosin looks like. Did it make you

1626
00:53:26,719 --> 00:53:30,959
feel good? Did it make you feel amazing?

1627
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,079
And did it taste amazing? And did it

1628
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,440
leave you with a great experience to

1629
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:34,880
want you where you want to do it again,

1630
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,400
right? No, that's that's it. And that's

1631
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,838
what we strive for when we make our

1632
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,200
roles, you know, we want people to be

1633
00:53:37,838 --> 00:53:41,279
able to like, man, that was one of the

1634
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:43,358
best roles I had. Yeah. I want that

1635
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,800
again. Right. You know, well, and that's

1636
00:53:43,358 --> 00:53:46,078
the experience that you can provide for

1637
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,680
people. And it's like I tried to do that

1638
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:49,200
with genetics and I love it when other

1639
00:53:47,679 --> 00:53:51,039
people try to do that and they're on

1640
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:53,118
that level with other things, right? And

1641
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:54,318
there are guys that get focus V is a

1642
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:56,318
great example. They want to bring it up

1643
00:53:54,318 --> 00:53:58,239
to that next level for that experience.

1644
00:53:56,318 --> 00:54:00,000
And we're we're whether you guys know it

1645
00:53:58,239 --> 00:54:01,598
or not, we're creating experiences for

1646
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,679
the world. And that's really what my job

1647
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:05,440
is is to create a better experience

1648
00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:07,279
through genetics. Yours is a better

1649
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:09,039
experience through smoking, right? But

1650
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,480
it but it all ties in together. And

1651
00:54:09,039 --> 00:54:12,800
that's the beauty of this is whether

1652
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,400
it's the guys that are creating the

1653
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:16,000
[ __ ] extracts, it's the guys that are

1654
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,318
rolling, it's the genetics guys, the

1655
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,920
cultivators. Now there's so many people

1656
00:54:18,318 --> 00:54:21,440
that touch, there's all these touch

1657
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,440
points, right? It's really it's it's

1658
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:25,119
like a like really it's like a motor,

1659
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,559
you know. It's like every in order for

1660
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:28,559
this motor to work, you know, everybody

1661
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:30,880
has to do their job. And if you're not

1662
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:32,640
doing your job up to par, you know, the

1663
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,920
motor's not going to work the right way,

1664
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:36,078
you know. And there are people that

1665
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:37,519
will. Unfortunately, for some people,

1666
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:39,280
there are people that are willing to

1667
00:54:37,519 --> 00:54:40,800
step up and do the job and do it to the

1668
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:42,960
best of their ability. And it's so

1669
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:45,039
competitive, right? People were getting

1670
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,480
by on mids 10 years ago. And that just

1671
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:48,000
doesn't happen anymore. If you don't

1672
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,119
grow the best, if you don't roll the

1673
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,358
best, if you don't have the best

1674
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:54,318
genetics, it's a really tough place to

1675
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:55,598
be. Definitely. So, and we're in

1676
00:54:54,318 --> 00:54:57,358
California where it's even tougher

1677
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:59,039
because the dude the level the bar is

1678
00:54:57,358 --> 00:55:00,639
just so high. It just keeps getting

1679
00:54:59,039 --> 00:55:02,159
raised every day. Yeah. And then you

1680
00:55:00,639 --> 00:55:04,239
you're like, I'm there and they move the

1681
00:55:02,159 --> 00:55:06,639
needle, right? No, you're not there.

1682
00:55:04,239 --> 00:55:08,639
You're you're right almost there. That 2

1683
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:10,318
lb of light is now 4 lb of light. And

1684
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:12,639
that 4 lb of light will eventually be 4

1685
00:55:10,318 --> 00:55:14,159
and 12 lb of [ __ ] top shelf. You

1686
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:16,799
know, we got under canopy lights that

1687
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:18,639
are pushing over 3 lb of quality flower.

1688
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:20,160
Like, I never thought I'd really see

1689
00:55:18,639 --> 00:55:22,000
that in my life other than maybe through

1690
00:55:20,159 --> 00:55:24,480
octagons and stuff, but like really with

1691
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,159
technology, they're yielding amazing

1692
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,679
flower some of these guys growing, you

1693
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:28,960
know, and growing with whatever

1694
00:55:27,679 --> 00:55:30,399
substrates they're growing in, with

1695
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,358
whatever nutrients they're growing in,

1696
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,960
they're really pushing the plant

1697
00:55:31,358 --> 00:55:34,318
forward. We're not literally. It's

1698
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,159
really cool to see the under canopy

1699
00:55:34,318 --> 00:55:38,800
lighting and how to see that there

1700
00:55:36,159 --> 00:55:41,598
really ain't no more Smalls that all the

1701
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:43,039
people's mad there. It kind of went away

1702
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:44,400
from my game plan where I'm like, "Okay,

1703
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:45,838
we're going to take the kef. We're going

1704
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,880
to press that into rosin. Then we're

1705
00:55:45,838 --> 00:55:49,119
going to take the smalls and we're going

1706
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,480
to roll hashold." Right? So that sounds

1707
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:51,760
great on paper, but you start using

1708
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,679
under canopy lights, there's no more

1709
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:55,520
smalls. There's no more smalls.

1710
00:55:53,679 --> 00:55:58,879
Literally, it's less than 5% whereas it

1711
00:55:55,519 --> 00:56:00,880
used to be up to 25%, sometimes more

1712
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:03,119
depending on the cultivar. And so that's

1713
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:06,079
down now at 5%, you've increased your

1714
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:07,280
yield. There's still the trim. And it's

1715
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:09,119
like, so what do you do with your trim?

1716
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:11,359
Do you sell it to somebody in metric?

1717
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:13,280
You sell it to somebody to process. Do

1718
00:56:11,358 --> 00:56:15,759
you process it yourself and turn it into

1719
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:17,280
ke? Because now there's like CO2

1720
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,880
machines. You can use these tumblers and

1721
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:21,599
then separate the keef. You can turn

1722
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:23,280
that kef into static hash. Staticash is

1723
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:24,880
making this huge comeback now and it's

1724
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,240
like people are so excited. Been seeing

1725
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,680
a lot of it. So that's that's why I'm

1726
00:56:26,239 --> 00:56:29,439
like I'm [ __ ] with the patella

1727
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:30,960
because the [ __ ] staticash is so

1728
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:33,599
good. I think this is even better than

1729
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:35,280
staticash in my opinion. But I do love a

1730
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:37,760
good static, you know. No, no,

1731
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:39,200
definitely. Yeah. I mean, you know, uh,

1732
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:41,520
like that's one thing they were talking

1733
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:43,598
about. Remember mixing hash with flour

1734
00:56:41,519 --> 00:56:45,599
and then creating a doughnut or even

1735
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:48,000
just a nice good infused roll, you know?

1736
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:49,760
Yeah. Cuz cuz those do the they do the

1737
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,159
they do the trick like you were saying.

1738
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:53,680
Cost effective. You know, we're coming

1739
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:56,399
we're coming with the consumer grade

1740
00:56:53,679 --> 00:56:58,318
only for you guys. Yeah. Cost effective.

1741
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,720
Consumer grade only. Yeah, it's coming

1742
00:56:58,318 --> 00:57:01,920
because everybody wants to be able

1743
00:57:00,719 --> 00:57:04,480
consumer grade only instead of

1744
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:05,838
connoisseur grade only. I love it. You

1745
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,280
got the consumer. That's actually really

1746
00:57:05,838 --> 00:57:08,960
good. So, we can have the spin off of

1747
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,240
the the cheap stuff for you guys. It's

1748
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,679
okay. But, it's still going to be good

1749
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:13,118
product, though. And that's one thing

1750
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:15,199
we're going to strive on is finding

1751
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:17,280
still products that are cheap enough for

1752
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:20,399
us to give them to them at a cheaper

1753
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:24,880
price. And it might not be a hand rolled

1754
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:26,400
product. It might be a uh a what do we

1755
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:28,640
say? It's like one of those knockbox

1756
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:30,318
rolls, but but a different but with a

1757
00:57:28,639 --> 00:57:31,519
twist. You know, there's so many

1758
00:57:30,318 --> 00:57:33,759
different ones out there. We're not

1759
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:36,159
trying to come with a conventional cone

1760
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,440
little pre-roll funky little. We're not

1761
00:57:36,159 --> 00:57:38,558
trying to come that way. We're always

1762
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,440
trying to come different. So, it's

1763
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:41,119
always going to be a different

1764
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:42,480
experience regardless. So, it's like,

1765
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:44,160
you know, that's what it is though, like

1766
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:46,240
you're saying, the experience. People

1767
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:47,519
want to experience. Yeah. And people

1768
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:49,118
want to be part of the experience and

1769
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:51,119
some people can't afford they can't

1770
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:52,400
afford it, but that doesn't mean they

1771
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:54,400
shouldn't get the experience is how I

1772
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,680
feel. So, it's like how can we prov I'm

1773
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,599
in the same boat as you are. It's like

1774
00:57:55,679 --> 00:57:59,279
how can we provide an experience that

1775
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:00,798
that's cost effective for the consumer

1776
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:03,040
but they still get a quality product to

1777
00:58:00,798 --> 00:58:04,318
where they're happy. Yep. But not that

1778
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:06,159
we're not trying to take anything away

1779
00:58:04,318 --> 00:58:07,679
for our top shelf because we could never

1780
00:58:06,159 --> 00:58:10,558
sell our top shelf for that price.

1781
00:58:07,679 --> 00:58:13,118
Right. And so now I'm looking at where

1782
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:15,920
you know I've been talking to uh Artemis

1783
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:17,519
Copac and uh the guys up in Lake County

1784
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,960
about doing pre-rolls. I've talked to a

1785
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:20,960
couple different companies in metric

1786
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,240
about doing pre-rolls because I want to

1787
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,920
have something that's in shops where

1788
00:58:22,239 --> 00:58:25,358
everyone can try my product that they

1789
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:28,079
get a good experience. Definitely. You

1790
00:58:25,358 --> 00:58:30,880
sell something for three bucks, it'll go

1791
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:32,559
for $9 or, you know, like almost 10

1792
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,798
bucks barely. And that's what the

1793
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:37,599
average consumer wants to spend. Like I

1794
00:58:34,798 --> 00:58:39,838
went and did these demos for my brand

1795
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:41,359
and I asked these consumers. I was like,

1796
00:58:39,838 --> 00:58:42,798
"Hey, what's your a what do you what

1797
00:58:41,358 --> 00:58:46,239
what price do you usually spend for a

1798
00:58:42,798 --> 00:58:48,239
pre-roll?" "Oh, eight bucks." Mhm.

1799
00:58:46,239 --> 00:58:51,118
Yeah. I know. And I'm like, "Mine's 30

1800
00:58:48,239 --> 00:58:52,879
with tax," you know. Yeah. And I mean

1801
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:55,680
the funny thing is is we probably both

1802
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:57,280
smoke $50 joints on a like we would they

1803
00:58:55,679 --> 00:58:58,719
would be $50 retail in most of the

1804
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:01,280
shops. That's what we smoke on a daily

1805
00:58:58,719 --> 00:59:03,279
basis. We can't afford to in most cases

1806
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,559
we can't afford to give that to the

1807
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,400
cons. It's not that we can't afford it.

1808
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:08,160
It's most consumers don't want that.

1809
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:09,599
Yeah. Right. They they're okay with

1810
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:12,239
they're they want something at a cheaper

1811
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:13,920
price point that's similar quality.

1812
00:59:12,239 --> 00:59:15,598
They're okay with the stuff that's I

1813
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:17,599
feel like we get the special the best of

1814
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:19,119
the best and the next down. People are

1815
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:20,880
okay with the next down and it's still

1816
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:22,559
really amazing. That's the thing is like

1817
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,240
it's still really really good. Really

1818
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:26,400
good genetics, really good ros and all

1819
00:59:24,239 --> 00:59:29,519
this stuff, but it's not always that top

1820
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:31,280
top. N definitely, you know, and that's

1821
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:32,559
where like, you know, not everybody

1822
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:34,798
wants to, like you said, not everybody

1823
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:37,519
wants to spend 50 bucks with tax, you

1824
00:59:34,798 --> 00:59:39,838
know, it's like $70, right? Almost, you

1825
00:59:37,519 --> 00:59:41,920
know, with California taxes. Um, so

1826
00:59:39,838 --> 00:59:44,880
that's why we we came with the one gram

1827
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:46,159
with the 2 at like 30 bucks with tax.

1828
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:48,480
Yeah. Because you still get the same

1829
00:59:46,159 --> 00:59:50,719
experience. It's not the jumbo roll, but

1830
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:52,318
it's still a roll that will last about a

1831
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:53,838
good 20 minutes. And you can still get

1832
00:59:52,318 --> 00:59:55,759
the top flour. You can still get the top

1833
00:59:53,838 --> 00:59:57,358
rosin. Top flower, top ros. And you

1834
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:59,839
know, you still get that experience, but

1835
00:59:57,358 --> 01:00:02,239
at a better rate. Because I I I've seen

1836
00:59:59,838 --> 01:00:04,880
it, you know, like people are spending

1837
01:00:02,239 --> 01:00:06,798
70 bucks. But you have to understand the

1838
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:09,920
average consumer is only making about

1839
01:00:06,798 --> 01:00:12,798
50,000, not even $50,000 a year. And

1840
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:14,960
they're spending their last 40, 50 bucks

1841
01:00:12,798 --> 01:00:16,639
for the week. And they needed to go far,

1842
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:19,199
right? they needed to go far. And so the

1843
01:00:16,639 --> 01:00:20,719
$100 are really popular. You know, we

1844
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:22,239
got Dave from Preferred Gardens who's

1845
01:00:20,719 --> 01:00:23,598
leading the way with all that stuff. Oh

1846
01:00:22,239 --> 01:00:25,039
man, I'm trying to get in line. I need

1847
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:26,400
to get some rolls. I want to get some

1848
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:29,199
material with them. You know, they have

1849
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:31,200
great great great roll uh roll material

1850
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:32,798
like their their product. Their price

1851
01:00:31,199 --> 01:00:34,159
point is good and you get a good

1852
01:00:32,798 --> 01:00:35,838
experience with their stuff. We had them

1853
01:00:34,159 --> 01:00:37,279
on our show and they, you know, they we

1854
01:00:35,838 --> 01:00:38,400
we used to do the blind tastings on the

1855
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,559
show in the beginning and there's

1856
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:42,960
definitely one we had smalls. that it

1857
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:45,040
was I think the $10 ETH and that was

1858
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:47,280
[ __ ] mind-blowing how good it was for

1859
01:00:45,039 --> 01:00:49,920
the quality. For the price. Yeah. Right.

1860
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:51,440
Top quality for the price. And there's

1861
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:53,039
going to be people like that out there.

1862
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:55,440
And then there's still people that do

1863
01:00:53,039 --> 01:00:57,279
want to spend the big numbers, but these

1864
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,960
day this day and age, there's less.

1865
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:00,798
Yeah. I feel like there's less and less

1866
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:02,159
of the people that want to spend $100 on

1867
01:01:00,798 --> 01:01:03,519
a eighth, you know, but there's a

1868
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:05,118
there's a little market for that.

1869
01:01:03,519 --> 01:01:06,358
There's guys that buy thousand ounces

1870
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:08,240
still,

1871
01:01:06,358 --> 01:01:10,078
$1,800. I still have some of my

1872
01:01:08,239 --> 01:01:12,239
genetics. I'd love to have some of those

1873
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:14,400
elite ones selling for $500 an ounce and

1874
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:16,719
shops very right,000 bucks sounds nice

1875
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:18,160
to me. It does. It does. I mean I think

1876
01:01:16,719 --> 01:01:19,439
but that's something but I still want to

1877
01:01:18,159 --> 01:01:20,879
have something for everybody as well,

1878
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:23,358
you know. Yeah. The market's really

1879
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:25,599
interesting. I mean I think as it

1880
01:01:23,358 --> 01:01:27,279
evolves I think a lot of people are

1881
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:29,519
going to go for convenience and they

1882
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:31,519
want stuff that's in a cart. They want

1883
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:32,960
stuff that's in a joint. And that's my

1884
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:34,880
next product. I'm like thinking of

1885
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:36,880
making carts, you know, carts because

1886
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:40,240
people love things on the go.

1887
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:42,079
Convenience is key to access

1888
01:01:40,239 --> 01:01:43,759
accessibility, being able to do as you

1889
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:45,519
please when you're on the go, right?

1890
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:47,920
Just like, you know, when you're at a

1891
01:01:45,519 --> 01:01:50,559
Dodgers game or you're at a um

1892
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:51,920
basketball game and you're at the hockey

1893
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:54,000
game or you're, you know, you're just

1894
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:55,760
you're at your kids freaking softball

1895
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,199
game and you want to hit the pen real

1896
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:58,480
quick cuz you're you hit the pen, it's

1897
01:01:57,199 --> 01:02:01,439
like nothing, you know, it's like a vape

1898
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:03,280
to people. So that's definitely I feel

1899
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:05,440
like is one of the bigger markets right

1900
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:07,119
now that along with the pre-rolls and

1901
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:08,480
then you know obviously flower is always

1902
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:10,160
going to be one of the biggest markets

1903
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:11,920
you know. Well it's so funny cuz that

1904
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:13,920
space is so competitive with the pens

1905
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:16,079
and there's guys that are putting $10

1906
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:18,000
rosin that's outdoor rosin in against

1907
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:19,760
guys that are putting you know really

1908
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,760
expensive rosin in. So like where do you

1909
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:23,440
fit in? What's better? Is outdoor rosin

1910
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:25,440
better than indoor? Is indoor? I think

1911
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:27,679
ah man it's subjective bro because you

1912
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:30,318
know I love some good fullterm outdoor

1913
01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:32,239
rosin bro. I mean, it's some you cannot

1914
01:02:30,318 --> 01:02:33,759
replicate the sun. No. And some of these

1915
01:02:32,239 --> 01:02:36,639
guys have some interesting dip

1916
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:38,160
techniques where they dip it uh in in

1917
01:02:36,639 --> 01:02:40,480
different containers to actually clean

1918
01:02:38,159 --> 01:02:43,039
it off before they freaking go in the

1919
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:44,719
ice. You know, it's like it's pretty

1920
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:45,759
amazing the Yeah. the freeze drying

1921
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:47,919
techniques and some of these things

1922
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:49,359
these guys are doing to try to create a

1923
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:51,358
cleaner, a better product from an

1924
01:02:49,358 --> 01:02:53,199
outdoor material, right? You know, cuz I

1925
01:02:51,358 --> 01:02:54,798
work with some guys that just did like

1926
01:02:53,199 --> 01:02:56,719
freaking kill it with their indoor. It's

1927
01:02:54,798 --> 01:02:58,880
like even with the Skittles. Mhm. You

1928
01:02:56,719 --> 01:03:00,959
know, it's like next level Z, dude.

1929
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:04,318
Like, and then that the Z rosin from the

1930
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:06,400
Z Flower. Oh, bro. I love Strain.

1931
01:03:04,318 --> 01:03:08,318
Putting strain with strain. Oh, it's so

1932
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:10,000
good. Especially Skittles. Especially

1933
01:03:08,318 --> 01:03:11,440

1934
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,358

1935
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:15,280
I Your dirty Skittles is fire, bro. I'm

1936
01:03:13,358 --> 01:03:17,279
not going to lie. Yeah. I'd call it

1937
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:19,760
golden Skittles. That stuff is so heat.

1938
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:22,000
It just reminds me of like a great

1939
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:23,359
summertime Skittles. Like just Yeah.

1940

01:03:23,358 --> 01:03:26,798
like so you're smoking rosin with it cuz

1942
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:29,280

1943
01:03:26,798 --> 01:03:31,038
coat. It is that's extremely special. It

1944
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:34,000

01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:35,280
floral Z but like it's just that mouth

1946

1956
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:00,559
we're going to have to dive in. So, this

1957
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:02,000
is the one that Marco rolled earlier.

1958
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:03,760
We're going to go. This is the Crippy

1959
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,159
with the Pella. You know, he's one of

1960
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:08,319
the best joint rollers I know. Totally

1961
01:04:06,159 --> 01:04:10,159
blown away by the way these things burn,

1962
01:04:08,318 --> 01:04:11,358
the way they taste, and the overall

1963
01:04:10,159 --> 01:04:13,358
experience. These are all about

1964
01:04:11,358 --> 01:04:15,279
experiences. Jesus. You literally just

1965
01:04:13,358 --> 01:04:18,400
barely lit that thing and it combusted

1966
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:20,960
right away. Yeah. Like check out the oil

1967
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:23,760
ring's already right there. Just

1968
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:27,119
literally excreting.

1969
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:28,559
That's beautiful. Yeah. Yeah. I try to

1970
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:30,559
blow on it a little bit before I even

1971
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:32,240
take the first rip to get it.

1972
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:35,119
Definitely. Just to see how that cherry

1973
01:04:32,239 --> 01:04:36,639
is blowing. See how that ash is burning?

1974
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:38,960
How the cherry's going. I love it when

1975
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:40,719
you see it go from like the dark color

1976
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:42,480
to white ash. Yes. That's when you know

1977
01:04:40,719 --> 01:04:45,598
it's combusting. Yeah. Totally. Cuz you

1978
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:48,480
see how there's a gap from the uh from

1979
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:50,720
the oil the oil ring to the actual end

1980
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:53,199
of the paper where it meets the uh

1981
01:04:50,719 --> 01:04:54,879
amber. Yeah. You see that gap? That's

1982
01:04:53,199 --> 01:04:56,759
when you know it's uh it's perform it's

1983

01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:09,680
Like you can already taste the Z in it

1987
01:05:07,679 --> 01:05:12,798

with all the different rosins out there.

2032
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:42,159
It doesn't matter whether it's You can

2033
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:44,240
go GMO with it. You can go papaya with

2034
01:06:42,159 --> 01:06:45,838
it. You can go grape gas with it. Sounds

2035
01:06:44,239 --> 01:06:48,000
good. Some hash burger or something. Oh,

2036
01:06:45,838 --> 01:06:50,000
yeah. Exactly. I love I love that Donnie

2037
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,838
burger too in the form of rosin. I'm not

2038
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,559
a big flour fan as I've said before on

2039
01:06:51,838 --> 01:06:56,480
my show, but I really love it, dude.

2040
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:58,079
It's so good in rosin. Like even

2041
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:59,599
straight dabs, but like it's a one of

2042
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:01,200
those ones you can blend it. You could

2043
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:03,440
put that with some OG and it would taste

2044
01:07:01,199 --> 01:07:05,279
amazing, man. This right here tastes

2045
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:06,798
amazing, bro. Yeah, it's got And so

2046
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:08,640
that's uniquely different, too. I love

2047
01:07:06,798 --> 01:07:10,079
that cuz it's got the gas underneath,

2048
01:07:08,639 --> 01:07:12,558
but it's got something else, too. So,

2049
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:15,920
it's like um it's very smooth, though.

2050
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:18,000
It's like It's a mouth coat for sure.

2051
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:19,920
You know, hold on. When it's got the

2052
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,679
Skittles Pella

2053
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:25,358
right down the middle, you put a big old

2054
01:07:21,679 --> 01:07:27,038
It's like creamy Z but with earthiness

2055
01:07:25,358 --> 01:07:28,558
on the back end. When you like blow it

2056
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:30,160
out, it's like right here a little bit.

2057
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:32,559
It's like Yeah, there's a little bit of

2058
01:07:30,159 --> 01:07:34,798
pine in the earth is definitely

2059
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:37,599
pronounced.

2060
01:07:34,798 --> 01:07:39,358
Yeah, I like it. Road roadkill cush.

2061
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:40,960
Roadkill cush. It's like some roadkill

2062
01:07:39,358 --> 01:07:42,719
cush. You don't see roadkill anymore.

2063
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:44,159
That's like I got the roadkill. I made

2064
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:46,239
the way it looked looked like some

2065
01:07:44,159 --> 01:07:48,159
roadkill. It's crazy. Yeah, it's got the

2066
01:07:46,239 --> 01:07:49,838
crazy And it just dumps too. It's got

2067
01:07:48,159 --> 01:07:51,519
that texture. I can only imagine how it

2068
01:07:49,838 --> 01:07:53,759
dumps cuz the thing looked like it was

2069
01:07:51,519 --> 01:07:55,358
covered in trikes. Yeah, it's really

2070
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:57,119
special. I mean, even just in the bottom

2071
01:07:55,358 --> 01:07:58,318
of the bags. Mhm. Like when you're

2072
01:07:57,119 --> 01:08:00,079
[ __ ] with it, the bottom of the bags

2073
01:07:58,318 --> 01:08:01,519
have tricoms, you know? It's like old

2074
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:03,119
old school on the turkey bag where you

2075
01:08:01,519 --> 01:08:05,838
can scrape it with a Oh, yeah.

2076
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:08,240
Literally. Like literally razor blade.

2077
01:08:05,838 --> 01:08:10,400
You can scrape the trikes. I don't know

2078
01:08:08,239 --> 01:08:12,399
how safe that is smoking micro plastics,

2079
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:14,720
but you know,

2080
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:16,399
it looks the same. It's all right.

2081
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:18,880
You're breaking it down pretty good. So,

2082
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:20,798
I mean, I'm still here. Literally,

2083
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:22,480
though. No, definitely. You know, and I

2084
01:08:20,798 --> 01:08:25,119
love weed like that. just makes it a

2085
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:28,238
little bit harder to roll. But depending

2086
01:08:25,119 --> 01:08:30,399
on, you know, the the humidity of the

2087
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:32,158
weed and how it's like how it's actually

2088
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:33,838
cured, you know, cuz sometimes you have

2089
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:36,079
to let certain weed cure a little

2090
01:08:33,838 --> 01:08:38,158
longer, you know, so those the trikes

2091
01:08:36,079 --> 01:08:41,039
are not I wouldn't say like dried out,

2092
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:42,719
but that they're more well, they're

2093
01:08:41,039 --> 01:08:44,798
dehydrated a little bit. Yeah, they're

2094
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:46,880
more it basically would be more

2095
01:08:44,798 --> 01:08:50,319
dehydrated, but it's more of a stable

2096
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:52,239
type of stickiness compared to where if

2097
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:54,239
you you literally press it down one time

2098
01:08:52,238 --> 01:08:55,759
and it's stuck just like that. Yeah. I

2099
01:08:54,238 --> 01:08:57,039
mean, the viscosity is to totally

2100
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:59,679
different. You can have that sticky

2101
01:08:57,039 --> 01:09:02,158
versus like sticky versus like sticky

2102
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:04,640
and tacky versus like like stuff that

2103
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:05,920
just [ __ ] wants to liquefy. Yeah. So

2104
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:07,759
sometimes Skittles rosin wants to

2105
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:10,000
liquefy too. It's it's rare that you

2106
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:11,359
know you see it more stable cuz it's got

2107
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,960
so many turpps for one thing. So, it's

2108
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:14,880
all oily. No, definitely. That thing

2109
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:17,439
right there is like the the oil ring is

2110
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:19,279
bursting. It's I'm excited to see if we

2111
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:21,039
got a donut or a nipple. Oh, you got a

2112
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:23,359
donut in there, dog. You got a donut.

2113
01:09:21,039 --> 01:09:24,960
Deal, bro. That's a donut going to be in

2114
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:26,480
there, bro. Give it like We'll give it

2115
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:27,600
like two more rounds of us going around.

2116
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:30,158
That thing's probably going to start

2117
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:31,480
tasting like straight Z. It's so strong,

2118
01:09:30,158 --> 01:09:34,960
too, dude. I'm

2119
01:09:31,479 --> 01:09:36,399
like I'm not going to lie. Yeah, it's

2120
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:39,719
strong, dude. Like, it's good strong,

2121
01:09:36,399 --> 01:09:42,158
but it's [ __ ] strong. This thing is

2122
01:09:39,719 --> 01:09:44,319
smoking. Look how you see how high it is

2123
01:09:42,158 --> 01:09:46,399
from the paper to the where the oil ring

2124
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:49,120
is. Yeah. That's when you know the

2125
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:52,158
temperature of the of the the core heat

2126
01:09:49,119 --> 01:09:54,399
temperature is perfect. Optimal temps.

2127
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:56,158
It's going crazy. That crippy is it's

2128
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:57,920
strong. Yeah. I'm not going to lie. It's

2129
01:09:56,158 --> 01:09:59,439
burning. It's performing really nice.

2130
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:01,199
Yeah. Good flower. It's so funny cuz

2131
01:09:59,439 --> 01:10:02,719
even with cultivation, it's it's from

2132
01:10:01,198 --> 01:10:04,399
one genetic. You can have it grown by

2133
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:05,760
one guy to the next and the guy could

2134
01:10:04,399 --> 01:10:07,119
cure it right or wrong and you could

2135
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:09,760
have a really good or a really bad

2136
01:10:07,119 --> 01:10:11,599
product. Yeah, the cure is critical,

2137
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:13,199
bro. Yeah. And it's funny because some

2138
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,640
like you were saying, but some stuff you

2139
01:10:13,198 --> 01:10:16,799
can you can smoke it right after you

2140
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:18,400
harvest like Skittles faster you smoke

2141
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,840
it almost the better. Like you can get a

2142
01:10:18,399 --> 01:10:22,319
little bit of a cure and it's great

2143
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:23,840
still. But like I and sometimes it might

2144
01:10:22,319 --> 01:10:26,158
get a little smoother even if you go

2145
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:27,920
like 2 weeks after, but like you want

2146
01:10:26,158 --> 01:10:29,839
the freshest, loudest turpps. It's

2147
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:31,199
that's my favorite with Skittles.

2148
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:33,039
Whereas some of these other varieties,

2149
01:10:31,198 --> 01:10:34,879
you want to cure them a good 3 weeks or

2150
01:10:33,039 --> 01:10:36,880
four weeks and they're they're optimal.

2151
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:38,239
Definitely. Yeah, I would say that too.

2152
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:39,840
Yeah, there are certain strains that

2153
01:10:38,238 --> 01:10:41,678
like you wouldn't want to smoke it right

2154
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:43,920
away, but like with Z, definitely that's

2155
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:46,640
when you could just right away it's the

2156
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:48,158
best. That stuff was fresh. Yeah, when I

2157
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:50,880
was in Vegas with the with that dirty

2158
01:10:48,158 --> 01:10:54,759
this that that stuff was amazing. Yeah.

2159
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:54,760
And it's just mouth coating.

2160
01:10:55,119 --> 01:11:00,319
53 days. 53. That's That's nice. Yeah.

2161
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:02,320
Yeah. I mean, that's quick turnaround.

2162
01:11:00,319 --> 01:11:04,479
Mhm. Especially when sour is just so

2163
01:11:02,319 --> 01:11:06,399
much longer. I love good sour though. I

2164
01:11:04,479 --> 01:11:08,399
think that's making a comeback. No, it

2165
01:11:06,399 --> 01:11:09,920
is definitely. People want the real sour

2166
01:11:08,399 --> 01:11:11,359
though.

2167
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:14,399
Yeah. There's so much mediocre, you

2168
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:16,399
know, like we've seen uh even even a lot

2169
01:11:14,399 --> 01:11:18,559
of my friends have sour that's not like

2170
01:11:16,399 --> 01:11:20,879
the real sour. If it is the real sour

2171
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:22,960
cut, it's they're not making express

2172
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:24,960
real sour. Dave from Budeler, shout out.

2173
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:26,560
He's got the real sour. I brought some

2174
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:29,119
real sour in Vegas. I'm going to get

2175
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:30,719
some more real sour from him shortly.

2176
01:11:29,119 --> 01:11:32,479
It's uh it's special and it's one of

2177
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:34,079
those ones the effect from sour is what

2178
01:11:32,479 --> 01:11:35,439
I like about it the most. Even though I

2179
01:11:34,079 --> 01:11:37,760
love the flavor and everything else,

2180
01:11:35,439 --> 01:11:39,839
that effect is it's morning weed, it's

2181
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:41,199
afternoon weed, it's evening weed, it's

2182
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:43,679
weekend weed, it's one of those ones

2183
01:11:41,198 --> 01:11:45,198
where I smoke it, especially the way he

2184
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:46,880
grows it, right? And I can literally

2185
01:11:45,198 --> 01:11:48,559
smoke it any time of the day. And I

2186
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:50,319
don't feel like I get memory loss from

2187
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:51,679
it. Like some strains they make I have

2188
01:11:50,319 --> 01:11:53,119
to think about stuff a lot. I be

2189
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:54,560
forgetting some [ __ ] when I smoke.

2190
01:11:53,119 --> 01:11:57,399
That's why I have to stop smoking

2191
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:59,600
sometimes. It just gets me too loaded.

2192
01:11:57,399 --> 01:12:00,439
Yeah. Yeah. It's the balance, you know,

2193
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:02,960
and it's

2194
01:12:00,439 --> 01:12:04,158
like certain genetics work better for me

2195
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:06,480
for that kind of stuff, especially when

2196
01:12:04,158 --> 01:12:08,399
I'm doing podcasts all the time. I also

2197
01:12:06,479 --> 01:12:09,839
do mushroom coffee in the morning. So, I

2198
01:12:08,399 --> 01:12:11,439
go Yeah, that stuff right there gets

2199
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:14,640
your mind right, dude. It does. And for

2200
01:12:11,439 --> 01:12:17,039
memory recall, especially and basically

2201
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:18,480
being able to recall that faster, right?

2202
01:12:17,039 --> 01:12:20,079
So, I'm able to I don't have to think

2203
01:12:18,479 --> 01:12:22,319
about it too much. I can actually just

2204
01:12:20,079 --> 01:12:23,920
speak without trying to think. Yep. And

2205
01:12:22,319 --> 01:12:26,719
so mushrooms have really helped me. What

2206
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:28,880
brand is that? Rise. I do R Y Z. Not a

2207
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:30,560
shout like a shout out, but not an

2208
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:32,800
advertisement, but rise coffee is pretty

2209
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:34,880
amazing. My friends turned me on to it a

2210
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:36,480
little while back and yeah, I love the

2211
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:38,719
mushroom blender they have in there and

2212
01:12:36,479 --> 01:12:40,439
I've tried it and then stopped and

2213
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:42,880
didn't feel quite the same. And I went

2214
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:44,559
back the real effects of it. Oh yeah.

2215
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:46,880
And I feel it's I do it in the morning

2216
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:49,280
and instead of mixing it with hot water,

2217
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:51,359
I do mushrooms with with h protein

2218
01:12:49,279 --> 01:12:53,519
powder. So, I do my I do grass-fed

2219
01:12:51,359 --> 01:12:55,759
protein powder. Okay. Transparent labs.

2220
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:58,080
I do that and blend that up and that's

2221
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:59,920
been the focus. So, so yeah, pretty much

2222
01:12:58,079 --> 01:13:01,119
it's been a year. I lost 50 pounds over

2223
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:03,440
the last year and I lost it really

2224
01:13:01,119 --> 01:13:05,359
slowly. A lot of people they lose it

2225
01:13:03,439 --> 01:13:07,839
really fast within two or three months.

2226
01:13:05,359 --> 01:13:09,599
I mean, I've lost a bunch of weight in

2227
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:11,199
like literally a month before, but when

2228
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:12,719
I did it this time, I lost it really

2229
01:13:11,198 --> 01:13:14,158
gradually. Five to eight pounds. You can

2230
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:16,158
watch my old podcast if you literally

2231
01:13:14,158 --> 01:13:18,000
watch from last year at this time to

2232
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:20,158
now. It's it's amazing. No. Yeah. I'm

2233
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,158
not going to lie, man. You have from

2234
01:13:20,158 --> 01:13:25,119
when I seen you last year over there in

2235
01:13:22,158 --> 01:13:26,000
um I think it was Germany. Yeah. You

2236
01:13:25,119 --> 01:13:28,158
were sitting down with the other

2237
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:30,000
gentleman. Spain or it was I think it

2238
01:13:28,158 --> 01:13:31,119
was Spain. I think it was because it was

2239
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,158
on the street right there. You were

2240
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:33,519
chilling. I was like, "Oh, what's up,

2241
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:35,439
James? How are you doing?" Yeah. You

2242
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:37,520
were chilling with your friend and uh

2243
01:13:35,439 --> 01:13:39,198
Yeah. And you're a little bit, you know,

2244
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:40,880
bigger. I was bigger, you know, and I

2245
01:13:39,198 --> 01:13:42,079
didn't lose muscle was the one thing I

2246
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:43,600
really didn't want to lose muscle. For

2247
01:13:42,079 --> 01:13:45,519
the most part, I've maintained most of

2248
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:47,280
my muscle mass. I lost a couple pounds,

2249
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:48,880
but out of 50, that's normal. Some

2250
01:13:47,279 --> 01:13:51,840
people lose like half of their muscle

2251
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:53,679
mass or whatever equal amount of muscle

2252
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:54,840
and I wasn't about to do that. Like that

2253
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:57,039
your muscles will

2254
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:59,440
keepabolism. I still box. I still do

2255
01:13:57,039 --> 01:14:01,359
jiu-jitsu too. Yeah. Muscle memory it

2256
01:13:59,439 --> 01:14:03,599
doesn't doesn't really lose its, you

2257
01:14:01,359 --> 01:14:05,039
know, form, right? And all it takes is a

2258
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:06,800
lot of protein and working out, you

2259
01:14:05,039 --> 01:14:08,679
know. Definitely a lot of working out. A

2260
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:10,880
lot of lot of putting in the M hours.

2261
01:14:08,679 --> 01:14:12,239
Yeah. Yeah. I'm not a guy that likes to

2262
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:13,440
get on that [ __ ] treadmill either.

2263
01:14:12,238 --> 01:14:15,439
You know what I mean? Like even high

2264
01:14:13,439 --> 01:14:16,960
like I smoke weed in the morning. I'll

2265
01:14:15,439 --> 01:14:18,879
do a dab. like that'll get me there and

2266
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:20,719
I have to listen to music, but like 30

2267
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:23,199
minutes can feel like an hour sometimes.

2268
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:25,039
But if I go do jiu-jitsu or I go box,

2269
01:14:23,198 --> 01:14:26,799
dude, it's like it's a totally different

2270
01:14:25,039 --> 01:14:29,600
experience. No, I definitely I feel like

2271
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:31,840
it's way more hands-on, you know, more,

2272
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:34,159
you know, you're really in there. Yeah.

2273
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:36,000
And I don't The beauty of that stuff is

2274
01:14:34,158 --> 01:14:38,319
especially with cannabis, like one thing

2275
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,319
I I like is like a small dab before I go

2276
01:14:38,319 --> 01:14:41,519
do cardio. If I'm going to do cardio,

2277
01:14:40,319 --> 01:14:43,759
whether it's jiu-jitsu, boxing,

2278
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:45,520
whatever, I'll do some uh, you know, if

2279
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:47,440
I'm going to hit pads even, it's like I

2280
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:49,280
basically will take a hit and then I

2281
01:14:47,439 --> 01:14:51,039
don't even remember that I took a hit

2282
01:14:49,279 --> 01:14:52,559
and I'm hyperfocused on it. And it's

2283
01:14:51,039 --> 01:14:53,920
like I'm not thinking about time. I'm

2284
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:56,000
not thinking about anything but what I'm

2285
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:58,158
doing right there in the moment. And I I

2286
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,640
feel like we all need to find something,

2287
01:14:58,158 --> 01:15:02,158
some form of meditation to get us into

2288
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:04,159
the present, to get us into the moment.

2289
01:15:02,158 --> 01:15:06,000
I mean, it's so definitely. Yeah. No,

2290
01:15:04,158 --> 01:15:07,359
that's real. So, yeah. And cannabis can

2291
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,719
bring you in the moment real quick, too.

2292
01:15:07,359 --> 01:15:11,119
Like big dabs will bring you right in

2293
01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:13,359
the moment. Smack you right dab in the

2294
01:15:11,119 --> 01:15:16,399
face. Yeah. I mean, everybody has one of

2295
01:15:13,359 --> 01:15:18,799
those experiences. No, we do. I feel

2296
01:15:16,399 --> 01:15:22,000
like as humans, we all do have that, you

2297
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:23,679
know. Yeah. So, talk about one of the

2298
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,079
one time like one of the first times you

2299
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:28,079
got high on extract. Damn. I think it

2300
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:30,359
must have been like when there was

2301
01:15:28,079 --> 01:15:34,158
really no temp readers. It was

2302
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:38,079
[ __ ] titanium nail. [ __ ] Titanium

2303
01:15:34,158 --> 01:15:40,479
was terrible. It was just like hot ass.

2304
01:15:38,079 --> 01:15:43,198
They had the bells and the the Yeah. All

2305
01:15:40,479 --> 01:15:45,678
that stuff that the cap the metal cap on

2306
01:15:43,198 --> 01:15:49,119
top with the you know the titanium nail

2307
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:51,920
with the bong for sure. Yeah. Terrible,

2308
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:54,319
man. I'm talking like this was like

2309
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:56,000
2010s when they had those even. Yeah, it

2310
01:15:54,319 --> 01:15:58,359
was like Yeah, it was a It was like

2311
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:03,119
around that time. It was crazy cuz like

2312
01:15:58,359 --> 01:16:04,960
uh um like how like you know it would

2313
01:16:03,119 --> 01:16:07,279
just like the snot and it would just be

2314
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:08,640
cuz it was like 900 800 like you don't

2315
01:16:07,279 --> 01:16:10,639
even know what you're taking. It was red

2316
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:12,079
hot. We would take red hot dabs and

2317
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:13,600
there was guys, this is even in the

2318
01:16:12,079 --> 01:16:15,519
early days of Instagram, I remember this

2319
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:16,800
dude who used to make torches and

2320
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:18,239
somebody will know his name in the chat,

2321
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:20,960
but he used to make torches and he used

2322
01:16:18,238 --> 01:16:23,119
to take these 1 g or 2 g snakes and put

2323
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:24,880
them on the titanium Niles right down in

2324
01:16:23,119 --> 01:16:27,198
there. It's like the only way you could

2325
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:28,560
really smoke those that that much is if

2326
01:16:27,198 --> 01:16:31,359
you're burning it hot like that because

2327
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:33,120
that [ __ ] t like if you have a dude if

2328
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:34,960
you have any one of these new modern

2329
01:16:33,119 --> 01:16:37,279
rigs with the oil like basically with

2330
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:39,039
the with the bangers or the turpp slurps

2331
01:16:37,279 --> 01:16:40,000
is like two grams in a turpp slurp bro

2332
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:42,399

Oh, we do have a little hole here. Yeah,

2339

2340
01:16:56,479 --> 01:16:59,919
beginning. This is a monster piece. It's

2341
01:16:58,158 --> 01:17:03,359
a fat ass hole in there. So, it's

2342
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:05,279
probably way bigger in there.

2343
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:07,119
That's dope. Yeah. Yeah. I knew it was

2344
01:17:05,279 --> 01:17:09,119
going to because I I could tell the

2345
01:17:07,119 --> 01:17:11,920
texture of it. It would make a nice

2346
01:17:09,119 --> 01:17:13,920
little hole. Oh, that's pretty good.

2347
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:15,760
Yeah. It's got that nice toffee texture.

2348
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:17,840
It's really pliable. You can make snakes

2349
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:19,760
and shapes with it. Yeah. Some of the

2350
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:20,960
rosin, like me learning how to roll hash

2351
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:23,199
holes, I've been I've gotten a lot

2352
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:25,119
better. But even still, it's like using

2353
01:17:23,198 --> 01:17:26,639
it where you don't have a snake where

2354
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:28,158
the rosin isn't pliable where you have

2355
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:30,079
to scoop it out and drop like beads in

2356
01:17:28,158 --> 01:17:32,319
there to get the get the hole. Yeah.

2357
01:17:30,079 --> 01:17:34,319
Like you can do it. I just It's It's

2358
01:17:32,319 --> 01:17:35,599
been a struggle. Yeah, it's timeconuming

2359
01:17:34,319 --> 01:17:37,359
and to get it really cuz you want to get

2360
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:39,440
it straight where you roll it. If you're

2361
01:17:37,359 --> 01:17:40,799
rolling the the actual flower over it,

2362
01:17:39,439 --> 01:17:42,960
you want it to be centered and that's

2363
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:45,920
not always easy. No, not always. I mean,

2364
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:47,520
you know, just based on that that um

2365
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:49,440
like cuz some like we were talking about

2366
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:52,560
some flower is more fluffy and some is

2367
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:54,639
more dense. So, depending on how it is,

2368
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:56,640
that's why we uh we we we have the

2369
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:58,960
doughnut press for people that are like

2370
01:17:56,640 --> 01:18:01,039
beginner novice rollers. It's just

2371
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:02,880
easier, you know, to get the weed into a

2372
01:18:01,039 --> 01:18:04,880
form. Are you selling those? Yeah, we

2373
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:06,640
sell them. Uh we're creating Yeah, we're

2374
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:08,640
going to be creating packaging first.

2375
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:10,159
We're coming with the new packaging

2376
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:11,920
because we've just been like, you know,

2377
01:18:10,158 --> 01:18:14,238
like selling them like the press and the

2378
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:15,760
and the tamper together and then just I

2379
01:18:14,238 --> 01:18:17,599
love it. You guys, they're they're uh

2380
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:20,560
Yeah, those are You guys make those

2381

2382
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:24,159
through I go through third dab

2383
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:26,239
dimensions. Nice. Yeah, it's We've been

2384
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:28,158
doing it for No tariffs, guys. No

2385
01:18:26,238 --> 01:18:31,359

2386
01:18:28,158 --> 01:18:33,920

2387
01:18:31,359 --> 01:18:36,079
It's all good. You can have your own

2388
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:38,480
product if you would like. come with

2389
01:18:36,079 --> 01:18:41,600
your own tampers. Hey, I'll line you up.

2390
01:18:38,479 --> 01:18:43,519
Get you some James Loud um presses and

2391
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:45,520
everything. Yeah. You know, I would love

2392
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:47,360
to discuss putting together a little kit

2393
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:49,360
for people on our website that we collab

2394
01:18:47,359 --> 01:18:51,359
on and we put I'm I'm all about

2395
01:18:49,359 --> 01:18:53,279
collaboration these days. So, like if we

2396
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:55,519
do stuff, you're the you're the roller

2397
01:18:53,279 --> 01:18:57,119
guy. So, it's like for me, I feel like

2398
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:58,480
it's not as authentic. If I start

2399
01:18:57,119 --> 01:19:00,079
putting out, okay, all this these

2400
01:18:58,479 --> 01:19:01,439
rolling tools, yeah, it's kind of cool.

2401
01:19:00,079 --> 01:19:03,439
But if I can collaborate with somebody

2402
01:19:01,439 --> 01:19:05,119
and we can do it together, it's it's

2403
01:19:03,439 --> 01:19:07,279
that much more fun and it's that much

2404
01:19:05,119 --> 01:19:08,800
more authentic and authenticity sells

2405
01:19:07,279 --> 01:19:11,039
these days, right? That's better. Yeah.

2406
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:13,199
People people they they respect that

2407
01:19:11,039 --> 01:19:14,560
more and they understand it more. Yeah.

2408
01:19:13,198 --> 01:19:16,719
And they can appreciate it. And the

2409
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:18,800
collab collaboration model the

2410
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:20,640
collaboration model really is the future

2411
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:22,480
with everything that we're doing because

2412
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:24,480
now we don't all have to be experts at

2413
01:19:22,479 --> 01:19:26,319
everything to a degree. I mean, dude,

2414
01:19:24,479 --> 01:19:28,718
this is a beautiful hole. There's a nice

2415
01:19:26,319 --> 01:19:30,000
fat hole. So, we all don't have to be

2416
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:31,600
experts. It's like I can do what I'm

2417
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,119
good at, you can do what you're good at,

2418
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:34,880
you know, and we can even work under the

2419
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:37,198
same umbrella potentially. Like that's

2420
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:38,640
the beauty of these guys collaboration.

2421
01:19:37,198 --> 01:19:40,639
Yeah. No, definitely. That's our brand

2422
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:42,480
is based on a lot of collaboration, you

2423
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:44,320
know, with all a whole bunch of

2424
01:19:42,479 --> 01:19:46,639
different cultivators and hashmakers

2425
01:19:44,319 --> 01:19:49,119
throughout California. And that's what's

2426
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:51,039
so cool is having these relationships,

2427
01:19:49,119 --> 01:19:53,760
you know, with all these amazing brands

2428
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:55,679
and it's really cool. So, definitely

2429
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:57,199
always down for a collab, you know,

2430
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:58,480
let's get it. Well, yeah. And we're

2431
01:19:57,198 --> 01:19:59,839
going to be working in multiple states

2432
01:19:58,479 --> 01:20:02,000
and multiple countries. So like the

2433
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:03,679
potential is just so big for

2434
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,520
collaborating with people these days.

2435
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:08,399
You know, it's like we're working on

2436
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:09,920
Australia, Germany, and Thailand are the

2437
01:20:08,399 --> 01:20:12,158
next three places we're trying to go.

2438
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:14,560
Fire. Definitely. Germany is big.

2439
01:20:12,158 --> 01:20:15,920
Thailand. It's all big. My friends are

2440
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:17,440
already there. My friends are helping

2441
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:19,119
out. And it's like it's good having

2442
01:20:17,439 --> 01:20:21,359
friends in high places. It's good having

2443
01:20:19,119 --> 01:20:22,719
friends that are in the industry in

2444
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:24,960
other states. And it's like bringing

2445
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:26,399
their brands here and bringing my brand

2446
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:28,079
over there. It's like that's it's a

2447
01:20:26,399 --> 01:20:30,158
beautiful thing. Yeah, it's a lot of

2448
01:20:28,079 --> 01:20:32,479
work. You know, collaboration, you know,

2449
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:34,639
is really beautiful. It's all about, you

2450
01:20:32,479 --> 01:20:36,479
know, just taking your time and making

2451
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:37,840
it happen. You know, put in that effort,

2452
01:20:36,479 --> 01:20:38,799
putting in those hours. Yeah. And

2453
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:40,560
everyone holding their end of the

2454
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:42,880
bargain. I feel like working with good

2455
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:44,560
people that complement your brand, that

2456
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:46,000
are willing to put in the hours as much

2457
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:47,280
as you do. I feel like No, definitely.

2458
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,880
The passion has to be there, you know?

2459
01:20:47,279 --> 01:20:50,158
Passion. Passion and the hustle because

2460
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:51,679
it's you could love it all you want, but

2461
01:20:50,158 --> 01:20:53,679
if you're not going to [ __ ] get up

2462
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:55,039
and grind, it's like these are the days

2463
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:57,840
where we grind. And I think a lot of

2464
01:20:55,039 --> 01:21:00,479
people are missing some of this stuff in

2465
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:02,400
the sense like these aren't the times to

2466
01:21:00,479 --> 01:21:04,559
relax, right? We're in the we're in an

2467
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:07,279
unstable market. Our economy isn't doing

2468
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:09,120
good. Today is the day to grind, right?

2469
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:11,439
Tomorrow morning if you didn't grind

2470
01:21:09,119 --> 01:21:13,279
today, you better get up and grind. Like

2471
01:21:11,439 --> 01:21:15,599
you may not have a job if you don't for

2472
01:21:13,279 --> 01:21:16,960
one thing, but also if you do, there's

2473
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:19,120
nothing that's going to stop you. You

2474
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:20,319
know, it's like and you may have to

2475
01:21:19,119 --> 01:21:22,399
grind for two years, you may have to

2476
01:21:20,319 --> 01:21:23,679
grind for 5 years, but there is light at

2477
01:21:22,399 --> 01:21:26,000
the end of the tunnel. And this is a

2478
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:28,960
great space to be in. Definitely it is.

2479
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:31,279
It It's amazing cuz you know uh I got in

2480
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:33,840
the industry I've been in the industry

2481
01:21:31,279 --> 01:21:36,000
for a few years you know like when I was

2482
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:38,000
a I was I was mainly like a construction

2483
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,279
worker for a while and it's just like

2484
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,880
it's a lot of work you know doing

2485
01:21:39,279 --> 01:21:44,238
construction building custom homes and

2486
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:48,079
stuff and I'm just like you know I love

2487
01:21:44,238 --> 01:21:50,399
weed. I I'd rather be around weed you

2488
01:21:48,079 --> 01:21:52,158
know and I'd rather be around a plant or

2489
01:21:50,399 --> 01:21:54,000
figure out how I can do it you know.

2490
01:21:52,158 --> 01:21:55,679
Mhm. And I could still remember the

2491
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,359
conversation is like I wanted to be in

2492
01:21:55,679 --> 01:21:59,359
the industry. How am I going to get in

2493
01:21:57,359 --> 01:22:01,519
there? Right? Well, at first I didn't

2494
01:21:59,359 --> 01:22:04,399
know like I wanted to try grow. I tried

2495
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:06,400
growing wasn't too good at it because uh

2496
01:22:04,399 --> 01:22:07,759
the flowering process part is it's not

2497
01:22:06,399 --> 01:22:09,519
easy. You got to it's a lot of time and

2498
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:10,639
a lot of effort you know it's all it is

2499
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:12,960
and a lot of knowledge you got to

2500
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:14,400
educate yourself on. So I was like okay

2501
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:15,679
I'm not too good at this. So let me

2502
01:22:14,399 --> 01:22:17,960
figure something else out that's going

2503
01:22:15,679 --> 01:22:21,359
to be easier. And

2504
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:24,719
um then the home I met the homie who

2505
01:22:21,359 --> 01:22:28,559
went to go smoke and he had a Fidel's

2506
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:30,719
hashel and he u had it all tied up from

2507
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:31,920
uh he's from All Tied Up were so I don't

2508
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:33,359
they're not around anymore. No. Yeah,

2509
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:34,560
he's around. Oh, really? He's back.

2510
01:22:33,359 --> 01:22:36,559
Well, he's back, dude. That's amazing.

2511
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:38,800
We need him on the show. I got some

2512
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:41,199
[ __ ] stories about some All Tied Up

2513
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:43,760
[ __ ] adventures. Like that was like

2514
01:22:41,198 --> 01:22:45,439
if you got contacts, I would love to get

2515
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:47,039
him on the show. All tied up. I got some

2516
01:22:45,439 --> 01:22:48,879
history with his brand. I don't know him

2517
01:22:47,039 --> 01:22:50,800
personally, but he's kind of the guy

2518
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:52,000
that [ __ ] set all this off, dude. To

2519
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:53,679
where we're at these days with hash

2520
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,880
holes. Yeah. No, definitely, bro. And

2521
01:22:53,679 --> 01:22:57,359
he's like one of the biggest

2522
01:22:54,880 --> 01:23:00,000
inspirations for me along with like So

2523
01:22:57,359 --> 01:23:01,359
when he had it, I'm like, oh man, I want

2524
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,520
to smoke one of those. I've been wanting

2525
01:23:01,359 --> 01:23:05,279
to smoke one of those for a long time.

2526
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:06,800
And then I was like, boom, that's it. I

2527
01:23:05,279 --> 01:23:09,279
figured it out. There's not enough

2528
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:11,760
rollers. There's not enough people

2529
01:23:09,279 --> 01:23:13,279
curating making amazing [ __ ] like this.

2530
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:14,880
There still is not. I know. There's

2531
01:23:13,279 --> 01:23:17,119
still literally there still is not. But

2532
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:19,920
yeah, you're 100% right. That's like and

2533
01:23:17,119 --> 01:23:21,279
and being in this space, you need to be

2534
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:22,960
a solution to a problem. It doesn't

2535
01:23:21,279 --> 01:23:24,639
matter what you do. Just be a solution

2536
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:26,239
to a much bigger problem and you're

2537
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:27,679
going to be successful. You know, I

2538
01:23:26,238 --> 01:23:29,119
think you if you're a solutions based

2539
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:30,480
business, you're a lot better than just

2540
01:23:29,119 --> 01:23:32,079
being a hype business that's trying to

2541
01:23:30,479 --> 01:23:33,759
do what everybody else is doing, right?

2542
01:23:32,079 --> 01:23:35,840
So, and what sets you apart, you know,

2543
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:37,520
and it's like you're in the perfect

2544
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:39,920
place at the perfect time because I feel

2545
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:41,280
like with this unstable market where

2546
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:42,399
it's going into wreck, we have this

2547
01:23:41,279 --> 01:23:44,399
product that's going to be in high

2548
01:23:42,399 --> 01:23:46,079
demand no matter what on all these

2549
01:23:44,399 --> 01:23:47,839
levels. We can always have machines to

2550
01:23:46,079 --> 01:23:49,198
do the pre-rolls, but the high-end stuff

2551
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:50,719
is still going to have to be done by

2552
01:23:49,198 --> 01:23:52,079
hand no matter what. Definitely. You

2553
01:23:50,719 --> 01:23:53,840
know, and that's what's so cool, man.

2554
01:23:52,079 --> 01:23:55,920
I'm not going to lie. I'm really excited

2555
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:58,960
for the future for cannabis, you know,

2556
01:23:55,920 --> 01:24:02,000
and uh we literally uh I won't say that

2557
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:04,079
me myself, but a lot of the big rollers

2558
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:06,800
out there, you know, that are doing it

2559
01:24:04,079 --> 01:24:08,719
and myself, we created a whole rollers

2560
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:11,039
economy, you know, within the industry.

2561
01:24:08,719 --> 01:24:13,679
It's like a whole another subculture in

2562
01:24:11,039 --> 01:24:16,399
the industry now just for hasholes and

2563
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:19,359
and doinks and flower rolls and just

2564
01:24:16,399 --> 01:24:20,799
handcrafted products that are uh you

2565
01:24:19,359 --> 01:24:22,799
know, something that people like are

2566
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:24,239
very proud of. You know, it's like art.

2567
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:26,320
Yeah. So, it's really cool, you know. I

2568
01:24:24,238 --> 01:24:28,399
mean, it's exciting cuz like, you know,

2569
01:24:26,319 --> 01:24:30,479
I can't wait to see different small

2570
01:24:28,399 --> 01:24:32,960
brands turn into big brands for the

2571
01:24:30,479 --> 01:24:35,119
California Bre market and then therefore

2572
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:38,239
wherever else, you know, cuz, you know,

2573
01:24:35,119 --> 01:24:40,158
pretty soon it's going to the the laws

2574
01:24:38,238 --> 01:24:42,238
are going to be changing, you know, and

2575
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:44,158
everything's going to be changing and if

2576
01:24:42,238 --> 01:24:46,079
you're not in the industry, you're out

2577
01:24:44,158 --> 01:24:47,119
of the industry. And it's Yeah. There's

2578
01:24:46,079 --> 01:24:48,559
a certain point where you're not going

2579
01:24:47,119 --> 01:24:50,559
to be getting back into the industry if

2580
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:52,719
you're not in it now. Yeah, the people

2581
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:55,440
now if you and the other thing I believe

2582
01:24:52,719 --> 01:24:56,880
100% I wholeheartedly believe that if

2583
01:24:55,439 --> 01:24:58,158
you make it through these times you are

2584
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:00,400
going to be very successful if you're in

2585
01:24:58,158 --> 01:25:02,158
this space you just have to suck it up

2586
01:25:00,399 --> 01:25:03,920
and it's going to suck for a while and

2587
01:25:02,158 --> 01:25:05,679
as a brand that's growing right now cuz

2588
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:07,440
we're are a small brand like it's just

2589
01:25:05,679 --> 01:25:09,359
me. I don't have no investors. I don't

2590
01:25:07,439 --> 01:25:12,000
have really nothing. It's the best way.

2591
01:25:09,359 --> 01:25:14,319
But we're Hey, it's hard but you know

2592
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:16,238
it's it's it's gradually getting there.

2593
01:25:14,319 --> 01:25:18,719
You know we're getting bigger now. We

2594
01:25:16,238 --> 01:25:22,238
we've lo we've al like literally locked

2595
01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:24,960
in big accounts for uh you know

2596
01:25:22,238 --> 01:25:27,678
different cannabis dispensaries and so

2597
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:30,319
now we're over we're in over like 30

2598
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:32,480
plus stores. We started out with like

2599
01:25:30,319 --> 01:25:33,840
five and now we're like 30 and I'm

2600
01:25:32,479 --> 01:25:36,479
really excited. So, it's just going to

2601
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:39,279
keep growing, you know, and as a small

2602
01:25:36,479 --> 01:25:41,359
brand, I just tell people, keep working

2603
01:25:39,279 --> 01:25:43,920
hard, you know, keep collaborating.

2604
01:25:41,359 --> 01:25:46,079
Don't don't let your head get bigger

2605
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:48,319
than your body, you know, just stay

2606
01:25:46,079 --> 01:25:50,399
humble and keep working. Persistence

2607
01:25:48,319 --> 01:25:53,439
pays off, you know, and getting up every

2608
01:25:50,399 --> 01:25:55,599
day and and working. And I feel like

2609
01:25:53,439 --> 01:25:57,198
even when you want to give up, the tough

2610
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:59,280
days are the most important to get up

2611
01:25:57,198 --> 01:26:00,719
and go grind, you know? It's like you

2612
01:25:59,279 --> 01:26:02,639
don't stay home. You don't stay home in

2613
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:03,920
bed. And I I can't do it anyway cuz it's

2614
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:06,079
like I work seven days a week. There's

2615
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:07,920
no like hanging out, no no getting

2616
01:26:06,079 --> 01:26:10,079
depressed. Like it doesn't matter. Like

2617
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:11,279
even the days where I do have I so I I

2618
01:26:10,079 --> 01:26:12,880
have days where I'm depressed, but I do

2619
01:26:11,279 --> 01:26:15,359
have We're human, bro. And that's that's

2620
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:18,159
that's big to just say, you know, like

2621
01:26:15,359 --> 01:26:21,399
we're human, bro. Anxiety and depression

2622
01:26:18,158 --> 01:26:24,119
and you know, uh our own

2623
01:26:21,399 --> 01:26:26,960
self-guilt feeling like we meet

2624
01:26:24,119 --> 01:26:28,559
expectations of society's measures. And

2625
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:30,399
it's hard, you know, cuz we're human,

2626
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:33,840
you know, and everybody wants us to

2627
01:26:30,399 --> 01:26:35,519
perform at exceptional levels at on at a

2628
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:37,360
on a day-to-day basis every day,

2629
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:39,920
literally. But some days aren't like

2630
01:26:37,359 --> 01:26:41,359
that, you know. So, it's it's big for us

2631
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:43,440
as men, you know, there isn't a lot of

2632
01:26:41,359 --> 01:26:45,599
space for us to talk about our emotions,

2633
01:26:43,439 --> 01:26:47,359
right? So, definitely you guys make sure

2634
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:49,360
you tell your you know, you guys out

2635
01:26:47,359 --> 01:26:50,799
there, make sure you guys talk about

2636
01:26:49,359 --> 01:26:52,960
that, you know, with someone that you

2637
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:56,239
love, man, because it's important, you

2638
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:58,239
know, men's health is very important.

2639
01:26:56,238 --> 01:26:59,839
Yeah, for sure. Especially these days, I

2640
01:26:58,238 --> 01:27:02,959
feel like it's it's so easy to get

2641
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:05,440
caught up in the news, in the media, in

2642
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:07,760
social media, and none of these things

2643
01:27:05,439 --> 01:27:09,519
are really reality. Like, we live a

2644
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:11,760
reality outside of each one of these

2645
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:13,600
things, right? And so, you know, these

2646
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:14,960
people, it's all an illusion. It's all

2647
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:16,480
these things are an illusion, and all

2648
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:18,880
these things are just part of a much

2649
01:27:16,479 --> 01:27:20,718
bigger thing, you know? And it's like,

2650
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:22,159
uh, you know, it's it's so funny because

2651
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:23,840
if you read too much into the news and

2652
01:27:22,158 --> 01:27:26,079
you get all scared and freaked out and

2653
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:28,560
stuff, you can get anxious. on fire when

2654
01:27:26,079 --> 01:27:30,719
I hit it. That's amazing. That

2655
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:33,520
[ __ ] combusted into a big ass

2656
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:36,560
flame, dude. That's what's up, though.

2657
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:40,120
That's some fire right here. Yeah. Yeah.

2658
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:40,120
That's the real deal.

2659
01:27:40,238 --> 01:27:44,079
That thing. Did you see that [ __ ] I

2660
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:46,880
didn't see the flame. No, that

2661
01:27:44,079 --> 01:27:48,079
[ __ ] went Damn. We'll get the

2662
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:49,920
run back on that one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2663
01:27:48,079 --> 01:27:52,000
We'll get instant replay. We got to make

2664
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:53,600
that a short. Yeah, for sure. The

2665
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:56,399
instant replay. This thing is magical,

2666
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:59,120
though. It's got a It's still smoking,

2667
01:27:56,399 --> 01:28:01,119
bro. That thing is crazy slow. That's

2668
01:27:59,119 --> 01:28:02,639
crazy. The Pella I I haven't done a

2669
01:28:01,119 --> 01:28:04,559
hashole with it yet. That's the first

2670
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:06,159
one. But it's perfect. Now you know.

2671
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:07,360
Yeah, that one's going to be good. Yeah,

2672
01:28:06,158 --> 01:28:10,399
I'll say. You're going to be like this.

2673
01:28:07,359 --> 01:28:11,920
Watch this, guys. Exactly. Easy to roll,

2674
01:28:10,399 --> 01:28:13,599
too. Like when you can do those snakes

2675
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:15,600
like that where it's like It's a perfect

2676
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:17,520
It's honestly perfect texture right now.

2677
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:21,120
I feel like it's really good. You can

2678
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:23,920
just like nice little like 3es with like

2679
01:28:21,119 --> 01:28:25,599
a 1.5. It's perfect. Yeah, I've been

2680
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:27,039
using my atom smasher with it, too. So,

2681
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:28,880
I got a old atom smasher where you heat

2682
01:28:27,039 --> 01:28:30,399
the rod up. That's how we used to smoke

2683
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:31,760
dabs, too, and hash back in there. You

2684
01:28:30,399 --> 01:28:33,439
heat the rod up and you put it in the

2685
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:35,760
bowl and the instead of a hole in the

2686
01:28:33,439 --> 01:28:37,439
bottom, it's got in the side of the wall

2687
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:39,760
of the bowl, right? So, when you hit it,

2688
01:28:37,439 --> 01:28:41,439
the smoke goes through there. And I got

2689
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:44,320
I got a bong attachment and I got the

2690
01:28:41,439 --> 01:28:45,599
pipe and I just I love that style. Damn.

2691
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:47,119
So, and that's from the 90s. We used to

2692
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:48,639
do all kinds of crazy [ __ ] back in the

2693
01:28:47,119 --> 01:28:50,639
day. I mean, I still have the hookah

2694
01:28:48,639 --> 01:28:53,600
from back in the day. We got the hookah

2695
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:55,119
for hash. Mhm. And uh but yeah, and then

2696
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:56,960
what was the other one? The coal. You do

2697
01:28:55,119 --> 01:28:58,960
the hot piece of coal. You get the with

2698
01:28:56,960 --> 01:29:00,319
the torch, you get the coal going, and

2699
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:02,158
it's burning hot. You kind of blow on

2700
01:29:00,319 --> 01:29:04,238
it, let it cool down a little bit, and

2701
01:29:02,158 --> 01:29:06,719
then you put your dab on with a [ __ ]

2702
01:29:04,238 --> 01:29:08,000
little tube. Jesus Christ. Like Like

2703
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:10,239
that's like freaking What is that?

2704
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:12,079
Hookah. It's almost like hookah but with

2705
01:29:10,238 --> 01:29:15,839
[ __ ] with dabs in with hash. That's

2706
01:29:12,079 --> 01:29:17,279
crazy. Yep. This was pre- ros. Throw a

2707
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:18,480
big lump of freaking hash on there. Oh

2708
01:29:17,279 --> 01:29:19,759
yeah, we used to have bubble hash we

2709
01:29:18,479 --> 01:29:24,000
used to do that with back in the day.

2710
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:27,199
And then the butter the the whipped ph.

2711
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:30,158
Oh [ __ ] That stuff was so strong. Oh my

2712
01:29:27,198 --> 01:29:32,238
god. That was the Jesus Christ. Not

2713
01:29:30,158 --> 01:29:35,279
anymore, though. We got solventless

2714
01:29:32,238 --> 01:29:37,759
rosin. Amen. It's W. Seriously, dude. I

2715
01:29:35,279 --> 01:29:39,759
love I love the rosin now. And I love

2716
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:42,560
the solventless rosin. Like like these

2717
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:44,560
levels of just from the hair hair uh

2718
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:45,840
hair straightener to what we have now

2719
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:47,679
with these guys with their presses.

2720
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:50,159
Shout out to all the rosin makers out

2721
01:29:47,679 --> 01:29:52,239
there for doing the Lord's work in many

2722
01:29:50,158 --> 01:29:53,920
ways. That's a lot of work. Yeah. And

2723
01:29:52,238 --> 01:29:55,519
even the machines that do it now, dude,

2724
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:58,000
it's like pulling bags in these things

2725
01:29:55,520 --> 01:30:00,000
these guys do. It's really impressive to

2726
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:02,960
the level that they've taken it from

2727
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:05,600
where it was when it was just original

2728
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:07,119
hash styles and and I love it all. I

2729
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:10,239
love all of it. No, definitely. I mean,

2730
01:30:07,119 --> 01:30:13,238
I feel like there's different uh levels

2731
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:15,919
to hash, bro. Honestly, when you got

2732
01:30:13,238 --> 01:30:19,119
machine-made hash compared to handmade

2733
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:22,158
hash Yeah. like it's defin definitely a

2734
01:30:19,119 --> 01:30:24,319
little bit different, you know. Um some

2735
01:30:22,158 --> 01:30:26,000
machines I mean and I know there's some

2736
01:30:24,319 --> 01:30:28,639
good machines out there that make that

2737
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:30,079
what is it like uh they they separated

2738
01:30:28,639 --> 01:30:31,679
it through like electricity or

2739
01:30:30,079 --> 01:30:33,920
something. Oh yeah, static electricity.

2740
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:36,719
They use a plasma plasma separators with

2741
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:38,560
static electricity. [ __ ] Creek, I know

2742
01:30:36,719 --> 01:30:40,239
about you guys. You guys are killing it.

2743
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:42,080
Like dude, that shit's wild, dude.

2744
01:30:40,238 --> 01:30:43,198
Static hash. That shit's crazy, bro.

2745
01:30:42,079 --> 01:30:45,519
Well, you know how they used to make

2746
01:30:43,198 --> 01:30:47,359
static hash originally before the before

2747
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:48,880
the machine, the plasma machine is like

2748
01:30:47,359 --> 01:30:50,238
you'd have a glove and you'd rub it

2749
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:51,679
around on parchment with the plant

2750
01:30:50,238 --> 01:30:53,919
material and then you go brush it into a

2751
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:55,840
bowl. Yeah. And they like did like the

2752
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:59,279
serious labor going into making the

2753
01:30:55,840 --> 01:31:00,880
hash. And I think Yeah. And I I think

2754
01:30:59,279 --> 01:31:02,559
it's pretty amazing stuff where you're

2755
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:04,639
able to separate those heads with static

2756
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:07,520
electricity. And it's the process.

2757
01:31:04,639 --> 01:31:09,520
Really cool. Yeah, definitely. So, if

2758
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:12,159
you had one piece of advice for your

2759
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:14,130
younger self, what would that one piece

2760
01:31:12,158 --> 01:31:15,759
be? Bitcoin.

2761
01:31:14,130 --> 01:31:17,440
[Laughter]

2762
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:19,800
I love it. That's an original answer,

2763
01:31:17,439 --> 01:31:22,158
but hell yeah, dude. Like, Bitcoin.

2764
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:24,000
Bitcoin. We all knew about it. I mean,

2765
01:31:22,158 --> 01:31:26,399
most of us did. We knew about that [ __ ]

2766
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:29,198
when I know. My god. Damn. We would be

2767
01:31:26,399 --> 01:31:30,559
rich. Yeah. But um No, man. Just don't

2768
01:31:29,198 --> 01:31:33,359
give up. You know, everything gets

2769
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:35,440
better. It always gets better every gets

2770
01:31:33,359 --> 01:31:37,439
worse and then it gets better. It It's

2771
01:31:35,439 --> 01:31:40,158
life. If it's ups and downs, smiles and

2772
01:31:37,439 --> 01:31:42,399
frowns, you know, but at the end of the

2773
01:31:40,158 --> 01:31:43,679
day, if you are persistent enough,

2774
01:31:42,399 --> 01:31:48,319
you're going to get where you want to be

2775
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:52,158
in life. You know, one thing I do say is

2776
01:31:48,319 --> 01:31:54,238
spend the money. Don't save it. Spend it

2777
01:31:52,158 --> 01:31:57,439
because you can make more. Memories are

2778
01:31:54,238 --> 01:31:59,839
worth more than money. Tomorrow's not

2779
01:31:57,439 --> 01:32:02,960
promised. Always remember that. It's

2780
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:05,920
big, bro. I was told by somebody once

2781
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:08,079
that money's value is in its use and not

2782
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:10,000
in its possession. That part definitely

2783
01:32:08,079 --> 01:32:12,800
is, man. It it definitely is. Thanks,

2784
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:14,880
Cousin Ed, and thanks, uh, Daryl, cuz

2785
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:16,719
them guys right there educated me all on

2786
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:18,079
that. And it's right. You know, it's all

2787
01:32:16,719 --> 01:32:20,319
about purpose of what you use your money

2788
01:32:18,079 --> 01:32:22,158
for. Like, you know, if you really want

2789
01:32:20,319 --> 01:32:24,079
to succeed, then make sure you use that

2790
01:32:22,158 --> 01:32:25,920
money correctly. Well, if you start

2791
01:32:24,079 --> 01:32:28,639
learning about inflation, especially

2792
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:30,000
these days, yeah, you got to figure out

2793
01:32:28,639 --> 01:32:31,760
how to invest your money and how to use

2794
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:35,119
it correctly. And I think it can be used

2795
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:37,199
as a a very positive tool. It it can be

2796
01:32:35,119 --> 01:32:38,880
used in a positive way, in a positive

2797
01:32:37,198 --> 01:32:39,919
light to make your world a better place

2798
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:42,639
than the people around you because

2799
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:45,279
really we're we're alive to to live on

2800
01:32:42,639 --> 01:32:47,199
have experiences and to make the world

2801
01:32:45,279 --> 01:32:49,119
of the lives around us a lot better.

2802
01:32:47,198 --> 01:32:53,359
Definitely. That's that's why I was
