1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,780
really with ourselves on this line we

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:06,778
just want it to be as clean as possible

3
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:08,089
like yeah nothing touched it but ice

4
00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:12,000
cubes and water

5
00:00:08,089 --> 00:00:13,439

you a nice little tour of kind of what

13
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:27,899
we're doing we're kind of really getting

14
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:29,759
ready for production here in a few weeks

15
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:31,678
bro this place was sick I'm uh yeah

16
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,820
kudos to you and your team for pulling

17
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:34,558
this off man and the build-out's

18
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,539
Beautiful the facility is awesome so

19
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:39,899
great stuff to see what you guys do here

20
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:42,058
yeah yeah so we go back a few years like

21
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,939
four or five years and you guys have

22
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:46,679
been doing x-ray for quite a while 10

23
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:48,419
years our 10-year anniversary is Jetty

24
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:50,519
so 10 years we've been doing extracts

25
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:54,059
and we started way back in the 215 days

26
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,760
and you know we started doing

27
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:58,019
CO2 and the reason we started with CO2

28
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:00,599
even though it's not like the best

29
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,359
extract method we just saw a lot of

30
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,280
people getting charges getting hemmed up

31
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,859
because everybody's open blasting and

32
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,540
you know tons of butane canisters

33
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:11,040
everywhere dumped on the side of the

34
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,799
road and just we thought it was a

35
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,360
cleaner safer method of extraction you

36
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,580
know fast forward we learned a lot about

37
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,799
terpene terpene preservation in the

38
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:21,719
extraction process so you know from

39
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,240
there you know evolved to ethanol and

40
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:26,579
distillate and you know live resin and

41
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,859
hydrocarbons and you know now it's full

42
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:30,420
circle back to rosin and solventless and

43
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:32,759
washing hash like we were you know 15

44
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,500
years ago so pretty amazing I think the

45
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,118
industry's come a long way since using

46
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,159
straightening irons to make the rosin

47
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:40,078
yeah yeah that was uh certainly some

48
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,700
rudimentary Tech but you know it got us

49
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:43,559
where we are today so totally It's

50
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,840
amazing And then coming back from bubble

51
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,340
hash you know in the 90s to seeing where

52
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,140
bubble houses turned you know it's

53
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,359
turned into rosin today and now these

54
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,579
rosin carts you know you know it's

55
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:55,560
pretty amazing that you can put rosin in

56
00:01:53,578 --> 00:01:57,059
a carton smoke okay yeah yeah I mean

57
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,219
yeah like you said back in the day it

58
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,680
was you know before like the really the

59
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:03,478
extract craze really hit and you know

60
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,280
had a dispensary in San Diego in like

61
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:08,038
2009-10

62
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,020
and our concentrate shelf was Tiny and

63
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:11,878
the only things we had was you know it

64
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,800
was full melt three-quarter melt it was

65
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:15,539
all just different Bubbles and caviars

66
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,520
and sifts and things like that and just

67
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:18,598
right seeing the whole Evolution to

68
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,580
where it is today I mean we couldn't

69
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:22,139
even smoke a dabbing like we didn't know

70
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,060
how to even smoke oil when it first came

71
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:26,519
on the scene you know seriously we're

72
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,319
like putting it in joints smoking it on

73
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,540
coal there was all kinds of you know

74
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,159
yeah yeah I mean yeah all sorts of ways

75
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:34,500
and then the swing arms and the bells

76
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,120
and all those funky devices came in the

77
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,800
big huge yeah we were talking this on a

78
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,560
couple podcasts ago but yeah the giant

79
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,719
dab rigs yeah now we have small yeah you

80
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,280
know portable electronic ones that you

81
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,439
don't have to you know use a big torch

82
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,000
to light up yeah the whole scenes come a

83
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:50,280
long way and you know the tech has

84
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,378
obviously evolved immensely as well so

85
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,419
it's been pretty cool to to witness and

86
00:02:52,378 --> 00:02:57,359
be a part of yeah it's wild it's wild

87
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:58,859
and it's even more crazy the future I

88
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,000
think I think it's starting to stabilize

89
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,040
a little bit but there's a lot of

90
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,259
potential for the future yeah yeah there

91
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:07,318
is I mean it's you know this

92
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:09,179
space in this industry is always full of

93
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:12,658
innovators and people thinking like how

94
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,760
to preserve and more terpenes how to get

95
00:03:12,658 --> 00:03:16,019
a different cannabinoid ratio out so you

96
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:18,598
know we're going to see some cool stuff

97
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:20,759
in the future for sure totally so let's

98
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:23,579
go from the future to the Past we'll

99
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:25,079
talk about your uh your origin story how

100
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:28,379
you got into the industry when did you

101
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:31,680
start smoking you know teenage years 14

102
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:33,658
15 probably started smoking I grew up in

103
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,519
Upstate New York and buffalo and you

104
00:03:33,658 --> 00:03:38,039
know this is you know before we really

105
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,319
got like the Beast or BC Bud kind of

106
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:41,579
that was a big thing like later on in my

107
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:43,919
years but when I first started smoking

108
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:46,260
it was like Maxi swag weed you know

109
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,479
seeds and stems Brown gnarly stuff brown

110
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:50,579
or green yeah not a lot of options yeah

111
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,859
yeah exactly exactly yeah and there was

112
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,780
there was options as far as green but a

113
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,159
lot of it didn't even have names yeah or

114
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,259
they called it strawberry because the

115
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,840
shape of it or you know whatever yeah

116
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:02,219
when we first saw like good no seed weed

117
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,539
I would say like that was kind button

118
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:05,459
that's what people called it yeah I was

119
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:07,739
wrong oh you got kind butter swag you

120
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:09,840
know there's no other option right yeah

121
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:10,860
the Brad mud was interesting you know it

122
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,438
would definitely get you really high

123
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:15,840
give you a headache too yeah yeah it was

124
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:17,339
pretty funky I mean imagine having some

125
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,139
of that stuff now and putting it through

126
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:21,799
some testing regimen and see what was in

127
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:23,939
it it'd be pretty pretty gnarly I'm sure

128
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,319
seriously well it's hard to say you know

129
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:27,000
the pesticides were different back then

130
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:28,800
that's true that's true I think they

131
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,360
were real limited with pesticides and

132
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,639
they probably used a heavy concentration

133
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,919
of whatever they had yeah or they just

134
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,019
didn't give a [ __ ] you know so I'm

135
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:38,639
pretty sure I saw some weed a few times

136
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:40,939
that was like people are like oh look at

137
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:44,100
the crystals but it's just mold Man

138
00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:45,660
heavy mold yeah yeah for sure PM back in

139
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,520
the day before a lot of people knew what

140
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,979
PM was they were like oh yeah it's extra

141
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:52,379
crystals exactly exactly so when was the

142
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:55,199
first time you saw Hash Hash I would say

143
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:57,659
you know I saw it growing up like

144
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,340
Upstate New York it was really hard to

145
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,880
get but the first time I went to

146
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:04,918
Amsterdam was when I saw like good hash

147
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:08,040
and variety of it and that was nice

148
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:11,099
probably like late 90s 2000 right around

149
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,060
there wow um nice did a trip out there

150
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,460
and like

151
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,079
you know the the bud was impressive but

152
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:17,939
the hash at that time I think was like

153
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:20,579
really what blew me away I was never a

154
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:23,100
big fan of Amsterdam weed except for the

155
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:24,538
California stuff for American stuff over

156
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,759
there but like that definitely the hash

157
00:05:24,538 --> 00:05:28,978
was on a whole nother level yeah I think

158
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,660
you guys brought a lot of game to

159
00:05:28,978 --> 00:05:32,459
Amsterdam all you guys that went over

160
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,780
there back in the day for sure genetics

161
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:35,519
wise and everything I mean I think the

162
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:37,079
good genetics really originated here and

163
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:38,339
then you know they had their they had

164
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:41,038
their run with the seeds and with the

165
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:42,839
genetics and you know I think to a

166
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:45,120
degree they they started doing stuff at

167
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:47,099
scale long before they did in the states

168
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,620
as far as you know seed companies

169
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:52,199
especially yeah yeah and pushing the

170
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:55,199
envelope with stuff yeah yeah I mean I

171
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:57,600
no doubt they've had you know a lot of

172
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,520
influence on where we are today but yeah

173
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,379
I think that's kind of no offense to

174
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:02,459
anybody out there in Amsterdam but you

175
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:04,740
know I think we've always had them beat

176
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:06,659
on flower for sure yeah and Quality

177
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:10,199
quality flower I feel like we've really

178
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:12,180
had like that and just I feel like you

179
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:14,639
know in certain places of the world

180
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,620
there's things where you know they

181
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,439
originate like I feel like California is

182
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:21,300
the epicenter for Quality cannabis for

183
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:22,620
new genetics I feel like a lot of it's

184
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,240
you know and not that it's not coming

185
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,160
from other places too but I feel like

186
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,918
the starting point a lot of it has come

187
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,419
from Northern California it's the

188
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:32,459
building blocks of it oh man for sure

189
00:06:30,418 --> 00:06:34,139
for sure absolutely and there's a lot of

190
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:36,120
passionate people you know I I give a

191
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:37,978
lot of credit to the Grateful Dead being

192
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,120
here and kind of the you know I feel

193
00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:40,560
like there's some connection to the

194
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,720
Grateful Dead with everybody that's been

195
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,459
around here long enough yeah yeah I mean

196
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,740
I was just talking about that with my

197
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:49,799
friend the other night and exactly like

198
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,960
that that was a foundation and really

199
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,939
like touring and all that stuff really

200
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:55,799
spread a lot of the varieties all around

201
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:57,660
the country which is amazing yeah

202
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,360
absolutely and even bubble house in the

203
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:01,979
90s yeah you know totally totally I

204
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,840
really like that 90s bubble hash I mean

205
00:07:01,978 --> 00:07:05,459
it was even before bubble bags I think

206
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:07,619
people were using like we did silk

207
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:09,000
screens and we were drying them on the

208
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,399
screen before we'd scrape it off the

209
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,279
screen right right hand stir for 15

210
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:17,239
minutes One Direction

211
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:19,619
they had a recipe that you'd follow yeah

212
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,879
it was amazing like when I you know

213
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,740
because I was like

214
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:24,300
fast forward a couple years from like

215
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,460
when I first started smoking but I was

216
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,680
living in Utah and we were selling

217
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:30,959
cannabis and you know a lot of the Cali

218
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,000
guys would bring packs over to Utah and

219
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:35,339
right you know it was great and you know

220
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,019
we had a very limited market we had

221
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:38,459
really good weed and they just couldn't

222
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:40,019
get rid of the bubble hash so it'd

223
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:41,818
always be like sell these couple peas

224
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:43,439
for me I'll uh give you a quarter pound

225
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:44,759
of bubble hash and to me I was like I

226
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:46,199
like totally want the hash you know what

227
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:48,180
I mean so

228
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,860
um yeah it was is interesting like just

229
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,538
how people used to do it back in the day

230
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:54,240
just from trim and just get rid of it

231
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:55,680
and it wasn't as valued as high for sure

232
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,240
there was a point where trim was free

233
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,478
like you would get trimmed for free and

234
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,939
a lot of us did we'd trim wet and so

235
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:04,860
trimming wet you get uh you know you get

236
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:06,300
a lot you get a lot of Sugar Leaf too

237
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,220
you know some of the stuff we just mix

238
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,780
it all in together but like we that's

239
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,099
how we get great fresh frozen because we

240
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:12,959
trim wet and then we just throw it right

241
00:08:11,098 --> 00:08:15,120
in the freezer we make bubble hash from

242
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,519
that that stuff was amazing I remember

243
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,680
getting some amazing Hues of bubble hash

244
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:21,899
you know where you have like the orange

245
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,660
colored bubble hash that was just from

246
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:26,279
purple wheat or whatever yeah they're

247
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,780
really nice blondes too like the sour

248
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:29,698
always made that really nice blonde

249
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:31,679
bubble hash yeah yeah and long before we

250
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:33,300
had freezers the Harvest rights to you

251
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,860
know get blonde hash you know we were

252
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:36,598
getting some good blonde bubble you know

253
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,658
Keith and bubble hash that was just

254
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:41,459
pretty amazing yeah yeah I mean love

255
00:08:39,658 --> 00:08:44,218
those days and just kind of the old

256
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:46,079
stories and people taking Maytag washing

257
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:48,180
machines and hooking them up and trying

258
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,940
to get freaking you know it automated

259
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:52,500
and not hand paddle and five gallon Buck

260
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,300
I mean I started with five gallon Home

261
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,100
Depot buckets you know totally so Five

262
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:57,479
Guys same thing with the bubble bags too

263
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:00,180
with the five gallon bucket with the

264
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,940
bubble bags I never I didn't like using

265
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:05,099
all seven bags or whatever yeah yeah so

266
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,779
it's it was a lot of work to pull all

267
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,820
those bags for you know not that much

268
00:09:06,778 --> 00:09:11,220
reward but yeah yeah I mean there was a

269
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,260
point where we had a bunch of bags on it

270
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,040
we had a big tree in my backyard and we

271
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:17,039
had

272
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:19,980
five bags set up at one point yeah where

273
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:21,838
we are five five buckets we were pulling

274
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,180
yeah you could actually tie it off so

275
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,040
it'd drip because lift in a heavy bag

276
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:27,599
it's like just wears on your back I'm

277
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:28,980
too old for that [ __ ] now yeah it's a

278
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,540
lot of work dude yeah we always say it's

279
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,339
yeah it's a young man's job even like

280
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:34,079
with the fancy automated washers we have

281
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:36,360
now these days it's still you know

282
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,800
there's big bags a lot of water in those

283
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,720
bags and just sifting through it's just

284
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:42,059
yeah so you guys are still manually

285
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,339
doing some of it yeah yeah there's a lot

286
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:45,719
of yeah like kind of the sifting of the

287
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:47,100
bags and things like that get in the

288
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,839
water to drain all that stuff's done

289
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,440
manually so you know when you got you

290
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,600
know

291
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,459
five gallons of water in a bag it's it's

292
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,659
heavy and it's heavy you know just

293
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:56,639
cleaning out the machines you know we're

294
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:58,559
doing you know 15 pound runs and things

295
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,659
like that 15 pounds of wet so cannabis

296
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:02,579
with well 35 pounds doesn't seem like

297
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:04,980
that much weight but try shaking 35

298
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,720
pounds yeah up and down for a while and

299
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,820
then like doing it again and then five

300
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,160
minutes later ten minutes later and yeah

301
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,600
I'm the same man I'm an old old guy it's

302
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:14,100
hard work for me but yeah the young guys

303
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,019
in there are just yeah they're stoked to

304
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,399
do it and they're all like that they're

305
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:19,379
all feeling good too

306
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:21,480
yeah and to a degree some of this stuff

307
00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:23,820
I feel like it's still considered

308
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,899
Innovative I feel like we're still you

309
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,820
know I mean especially with the

310
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:28,139
automated systems that they're doing

311
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:30,240
today where you can do it at scale

312
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:31,980
because that's a long you know that's

313
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,019
that's a lot further from the five

314
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,300
gallon bucket yeah yeah I mean that's

315
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:38,339
kind of it like I said like it's still

316
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:39,719
pretty labor intensive it's you know as

317
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:42,300
far as like our solvence department it's

318
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,160
our biggest team for you know minimal

319
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:45,479
throughput compared to hydrocarbon or

320
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:48,120
ethanol extraction or something like

321
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,759
that so you know the the Manpower it

322
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:53,039
takes to produce you know a kilo of live

323
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:55,919
rosin versus a kilo of you know live

324
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:57,480
resin is drastically different so you

325
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:59,819
guys are still doing live resin yeah

326
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,519
yeah we do um you know it's not a huge

327
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:04,440
category for us but you know we do it

328
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:06,659
and you know the one good thing about it

329
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,760
is like the strain variety you can

330
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:10,139
basically put any fresh frozen you know

331
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:11,458
in a butane extractor and you're gonna

332
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:13,379
get a good product out as long as it's

333
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:15,359
good coming in where the solventless

334
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:17,278
genetics you know the rosin genetics are

335
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,800
a little bit harder to find the ones

336
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:22,980
that that hit genetics play a huge role

337
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:25,439
yeah you know and yield especially yeah

338
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:28,139
yield is you know

339
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,820
it's hard because the consumer want you

340
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:31,259
know they don't want to pay 100 a gram

341
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,060
for certain things yeah and you can't

342
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:34,500
charge them more necessarily for stuff

343
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:36,359
that doesn't yield as well yeah they

344
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,620
don't see that you know it's hard to do

345
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,240
that there's a few brands that have

346
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,578
pulled that off but it's a it's a tough

347
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,480
thing to do and ultimately you're just

348
00:11:41,578 --> 00:11:44,659
seeing

349
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,639
you know when you look at the data it's

350
00:11:44,659 --> 00:11:50,100
unfortunate but you know the more price

351
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:51,659
conscious Brands and value Brands and

352
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,800
value products are what's kind of

353
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:54,719
pulling off the shelves these days

354
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:56,099
especially in with the recession and all

355
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,500
that stuff you know yeah people don't

356
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,120
have as much money anymore and some are

357
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:03,179
willing to sacrifice quality for

358
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,100
quantity yeah yeah I'd say the majority

359
00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:07,259
of the consumers are like that

360
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,600
unfortunately so yeah we're just really

361
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:11,700
trying to you know a big Focus for us

362
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,139
with the solventless play is getting you

363
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,660
know stuff that hits at least four

364
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:17,399
percent to wash and if we can do that we

365
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:19,139
can keep our price point like

366
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:21,419
somewhat competitive with everybody else

367
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:23,399
so what's your opinion on live resin

368
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:25,500
versus live rosin I've seen coas

369
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:28,259
comparing the two where you actually get

370
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,360
more more terpenes obviously water

371
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:32,939
soluble terpenes get lost in the mix

372
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,860
when you're washing but uh what's your

373
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:38,519
opinion on the whole thing yeah man I

374
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:40,620
mean you know I'm not like religiously

375
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:41,879
you know one way or the other I want a

376
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,919
good product at the end of the day I

377
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:46,799
want something that tastes good there's

378
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:47,939
certain profiles and certain strains

379
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,578
that I think come out great with

380
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,860
hydrocarbon we just one Emerald cup for

381
00:12:50,578 --> 00:12:54,899
first place for our Super Lemon Haze

382
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,100
which is classic strain well that would

383
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,958
never come out in the wash we would

384
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,820
never be able to like taste that strain

385
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:02,278
that way if we didn't run it through

386
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:04,620
hydrocarbon so right so you know just

387
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:06,360
having the optionality to do both I

388
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,339
think is good and just kind of doing the

389
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,320
plant Justice and you know again it's

390
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:12,240
like as long as you're doing it right

391
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,800
it's purged right it's clean it's safe

392
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,480
at the end of the day you know I really

393
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:17,879
have no problem with it but it tastes

394
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,560
amazing yeah that's my opinion it's all

395
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:21,480
about dude put a blindfold on and like

396
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:24,059
what tastes good and yeah you know it's

397
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:26,339
clean you know it's good but that said I

398
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:28,799
don't know there's just something just I

399
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:29,760
I think even in the analytics like what

400
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:33,240
we're seeing you know they're only

401
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:35,100
testing for 40 something terpenes these

402
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,139
days they're not testing for flavonoids

403
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:39,778
Esters any other yeah you know aromatic

404
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:41,399
compound yeah so so I think there's like

405
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:43,559
you know because there is like a

406
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:46,078
complexity to like rosin that like you

407
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:47,458
can't really put your you know the data

408
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:48,419
you can't really see it in the data but

409
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:50,278
you know it's there there's like

410
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:51,958
something really flavorful when you and

411
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:53,578
it doesn't hits hard too yeah it hits

412
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:55,319
hard you know you just have more

413
00:13:53,578 --> 00:13:57,659
compounds a fuller spectrum of compounds

414
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,940
which is yeah I think you know does

415
00:13:57,659 --> 00:14:01,559
something to your CB1 CB2 receptors

416
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:04,620
whatever up in your brain you know that

417
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:06,239
yeah that you know we're not even sure

418
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:08,820
of yet yeah there's so much new science

419
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,680
that's yet to be discovered so you know

420
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,940
yeah we got a bunch of receptors and

421
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:14,458
we're still figuring out how they all

422
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:16,260
work together it's pretty awesome yeah

423
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:17,879
and what terpene and then the terpene

424
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:19,679
Matrix with this terpene and how those

425
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:21,958
things affect it synergistically and so

426
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:24,000
yeah a lot of really amazing cool stuff

427
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:26,278
that we're just learning and still

428
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,320
discovering new cannabinoids like dude

429
00:14:26,278 --> 00:14:29,939
with the you know now with these hemp

430
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,019
conversions and things like that I mean

431
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:33,420
I just feel like there's a new

432
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:35,578
cannabinoid I see out at in they're in

433
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:37,860
gas stations and wherever the Midwest

434
00:14:35,578 --> 00:14:39,659
but I have a feeling the farm bill next

435
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,879
month which might come out around the

436
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:44,458
time this episode airs is gonna change

437
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:46,078
some of that yeah I mean I think

438
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:47,578
because I'm seeing that too it's like

439
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:51,120
you know there's all these different

440
00:14:47,578 --> 00:14:53,399
versions of THC and it's like they're

441
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,980
all they're they're not natural yeah

442
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:57,299
they're you know yeah conversions some

443
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,159
of them are you know synthetically

444
00:14:57,299 --> 00:15:02,219
derived and all sorts of crazy stuff so

445
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:04,078
yeah it's uh it's really interesting and

446
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:06,540
yeah I think we got to be like a little

447
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:07,859
careful on you know what we're doing and

448
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:10,198
how we're putting things out and try to

449
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:12,419
keep it what we're putting bodies yeah

450
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:13,559
Mama nature freaking you know put out in

451
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:15,539
the plant in the first place and those

452
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:17,099
ratios right and I I don't think there's

453
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:18,719
anything wrong personally my opinion on

454
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,800
the conversions like Delta eight I don't

455
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,180
think there's anything wrong with it if

456
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:23,039
you're using good starting material and

457
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:25,259
you're using the process correctly it's

458
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:26,698
if you're just taking pure [ __ ] and

459
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:28,919
you're you're basically converting that

460
00:15:26,698 --> 00:15:30,198
and calling it Delta eight I don't think

461
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:32,879
you're going to get a good end product

462
00:15:30,198 --> 00:15:35,578
necessarily yeah yeah in their opinion

463
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:37,198
powders and catalysts you know that are

464
00:15:35,578 --> 00:15:39,599
used in some of those conversions and

465
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:41,939
just making sure it's clean and you know

466
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,259
you know a safe product for the consumer

467
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:46,260
at the end of the day

468
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:48,419
yeah I mean I'm a big fan of pure thca

469
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:50,039
you know to ingest pure it doesn't get

470
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:51,179
you high it doesn't get me high but it

471
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:53,039
you know as you get the medicinal

472
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:54,778
benefits I get the medicinal benefit of

473
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:56,639
it yeah I have ulcerative colitis yeah

474
00:15:54,778 --> 00:15:57,838
it's just it's a game changer I think

475
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,759
nice

476
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,519
um yeah and Delta 8 I love Delta 8 it's

477
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,980
conversion I love Delta 8 for sleep yeah

478
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:07,919
and it's a fifth the strength of

479
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:10,339
you know Delta 9 THC yeah it's got a

480
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:12,719
yeah kind of intro you know because

481
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:15,720
CBD it's just like it does you don't

482
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,220
really feel anything you know but so I

483
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,600
feel some of my family members that are

484
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,860
like kind of new to the scene I'm like

485
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,360
kind of give them a little Delta eight

486
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:23,519
and it's like just kind of in between

487
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,100
you know like kind of the starter Stoner

488
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:29,159
well you know what I really like is CBG

489
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:31,259
yeah I really like CBG I like smoking

490
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:33,719
CBG even I haven't found really good

491
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:36,720
tasting CBG yet but I really like the

492
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:39,000
relaxing effect of CBG where CBD kind of

493
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,100
like just makes me tired I don't get a

494
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,379
lot out of just smoking good CBD flour

495
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:46,079
although CBD could I've tasted some

496
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:48,179
really good CBD flowering joints CBG

497
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:49,379
I've yet to taste any so if anybody out

498
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:52,258
there is watching and they have some

499
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:54,659
good CBG genetics that taste amazing

500
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:56,399
I'd love to hear about it yeah yeah I

501
00:16:54,659 --> 00:16:58,078
agree that's you know one of the cool

502
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,299
things that you guys are doing and just

503
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:02,578
you know bringing these kind of

504
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:04,740
alternative caminoids breeding them up

505
00:17:02,578 --> 00:17:06,720
having good terpene profiles because

506
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:09,539
like you said you know CBD generally was

507
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,939
hemp and it sucked and now there's CBD

508
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:13,980
varieties out there that taste like sour

509
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:15,360
diesel and totally beautiful and like

510
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,818
you're like holy [ __ ] man and there's

511
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,979
actually a market for the genetics I

512
00:17:17,818 --> 00:17:21,779
think the CBD you know I think there's a

513
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:24,000
market for everything for the flower for

514
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:26,279
the genetics for all of that like good

515
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,318
high-end CBD flower that's smokable like

516
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:30,240
there's a huge Market of people that if

517
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:31,558
it tastes great and they had access to

518
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,759
it and they knew about it they would buy

519
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:37,740
it bro yeah I mean you know tobacco is

520
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:39,960
one thing but yeah if you can smoke more

521
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,579
of a medicinal herb and yeah you don't

522
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,200
get high or a little relaxed just like

523
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:44,699
you're smoking a square or freaking

524
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,080
Newport whatever but it's yeah way

525
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,120
healthier for you like why wouldn't you

526
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:50,279
you know so I think there's a you know

527
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:51,719
we can talk conspiracy and big tobacco

528
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:53,579
and all that stuff later but sure you

529
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,019
know I'm sure they're a little scared or

530
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:58,379
also trying to get in the game you know

531
00:17:55,019 --> 00:17:59,460
natural Menthol CBG there you go yeah I

532
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,140
mean those are things that can be bred

533
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,600
in for sure I've seen Menthol come out a

534
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:05,820
lot in cannabis you know we used to Cull

535
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:07,379
most of this the Menthol stuff because I

536
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:10,558
feel like Menthol isn't necessarily

537
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:12,000
desirable characteristic so because it

538
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:14,879
can throw off all kinds of other stuff

539
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,759
interesting interesting so is that just

540
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,100
a terpene I don't think I I think it's

541
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:22,019
more in line with a thile okay than a

542
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:24,538
terpene but it could be terpene specific

543
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:26,400
yeah I'm not sure we'd need to identify

544
00:18:24,538 --> 00:18:28,019
CEOs because we just usually you know

545
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,100
it's not like I'm looking at the CIA and

546
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:31,740
pulling them I'm just pulling them

547
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:33,538
because I'm like yeah yeah that's it

548
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,279
yeah more just more analytics more

549
00:18:33,538 --> 00:18:36,599
standards because yeah like you know for

550
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:38,700
you know what are we testing 20

551
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:41,699
cannabinoids and 44 terpenes like it's

552
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:44,038
just the tip of the iceberg well and not

553
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,298
all terpenes are created equal so you

554
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:48,359
can have one that's in high

555
00:18:45,298 --> 00:18:50,879
concentration that basically

556
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:52,500
that is that you don't taste very much

557
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,140
of whereas something in a small

558
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:57,058
concentration is super super potent and

559
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,980
pungent yeah yeah and we're seeing that

560
00:18:57,058 --> 00:19:00,538
like you know in a lot of the extracts

561
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,460
we do and you know the more we can

562
00:19:00,538 --> 00:19:06,599
preserve the monos through our process

563
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:08,400
like yeah they're minor but they make a

564
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:11,099
big difference in how everything tastes

565
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,419
versus like we can tell if we added a

566
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:13,740
little bit more heat to the press or

567
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:15,179
this that and the other thing you know

568
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,440
it's just like night and day as far as

569
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:18,780
flavor goes you want to talk about the

570
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,620
jar Tech a little bit basically taking I

571
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:21,660
mean

572
00:19:19,619 --> 00:19:23,339
the simple rudimentary way is just

573
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,440
taking live rosin you want to D

574
00:19:23,339 --> 00:19:28,259
basically to put anything in a vape you

575
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,320
need it decarboxylated so getting the

576
00:19:28,259 --> 00:19:33,720
oil to the red consistency the more thca

577
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:35,839
you leave in your product in a vape you

578
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:38,940
know more poorly it's going to function

579
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:41,519
so we want to

580
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:43,740
you know decarboxylate that oil

581
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:45,240
um with while preserving the terpenes

582
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,500
like that's kind of the art in it right

583
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,419
so

584
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:51,240
um you know with jar Tech

585
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:53,280
take the rosin put it in the jar heat it

586
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,779
up slowly some people eat it fast you

587
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:56,339
know you have your own kind of recipe as

588
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:58,079
a chef you would know you know just sure

589
00:19:56,339 --> 00:20:00,839
certain things certain heat certain

590
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:02,699
pressure yeah so you know kind of figure

591
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:04,199
that out but it's pretty amazing yeah

592
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,240
that's what I mean that you know it's

593
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,100
like the building blocks are still there

594
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,538
from like the old school methods we're

595
00:20:08,099 --> 00:20:11,699
doing especially on the wash and things

596
00:20:09,538 --> 00:20:12,839
like that but you know just little you

597
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,419
know and these are things that are

598
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:17,279
pretty common I think as far as you know

599
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:18,960
you talk to you know people that work

600
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:21,000
and you know the chemistry industry or

601
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,620
science and you know work in different

602
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,660
types of extraction methods we're like

603
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:26,879
oh yeah that's super simple and makes

604
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:28,440
total sense but it's still relatively

605
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,200
new to cannabis as we kind of bring

606
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,460
bring new processes on yeah I mean holy

607
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,600
water I don't know if you remember holy

608
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:38,519
water back in 2013 we we uh when I was

609
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:40,500
with loud seeds or we had loud seeds we

610
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:42,240
brought that to Denver we had two booths

611
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,819
and we entered holy water with the holy

612
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,038
water guys big shout out yep Mikey in

613
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:48,480
the Korea yeah yeah they they did not

614
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:51,480
know how to judge it and they appall

615
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,980
apologize because it was amazing and

616
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,019
they had given me a bunch of samples and

617
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:57,798
I was literally I had a rig with an

618
00:20:55,019 --> 00:21:00,359
email and was literally pouring yeah

619
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:01,700
it's to everybody yeah you know and that

620
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:05,519
was like some of that stuff was like 30

621
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:07,679
30 Terps yeah yeah that stuff yeah that

622
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:09,179
was freaking amazing what they they came

623
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,580
up with back in the day and definitely

624
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:13,320
you know set the trend of the HTE and

625
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:14,819
all that good stuff but yeah when it

626
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:16,619
first came out yeah it was Game Changer

627
00:21:14,819 --> 00:21:18,839
it was it was a game changer now there's

628
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:21,058
definitely other things that are amazing

629
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:22,619
as well but yeah it's it's funny all

630
00:21:21,058 --> 00:21:24,960
these stages we've gone through to get

631
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:26,699
to where we're at now yeah exactly and

632
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,319
yeah that's what's exciting about you

633
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,779
know keeps us I think all charged up for

634
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:33,240
the Futures new genetics new strands new

635
00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:34,859
profiles new tech I think we've figured

636
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,720
out a lot of the tech now it's like okay

637
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:38,038
let's get the genetics dialed in and

638
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,419
then they may come out with new tech in

639
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:40,500
the future that's kind of really what we

640
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:42,120
you know we would talk about that

641
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,679
internally like what's the new tech is

642
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:45,479
there a new thing coming out and it's

643
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,519
just like what we're all excited about

644
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,079
is like what are the new profiles like

645
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:51,119
you know like we were talking earlier

646
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:53,158
just you know what are you breeding that

647
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:54,959
you know you can finish a little quicker

648
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:57,179
as a different profile because we're all

649
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,620
freaking sick of GMO and you know all

650
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:00,179
kind of the normal hash strains totally

651
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:02,219
so what do you think the new flavors are

652
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:05,220
for hash the big washer is going to be I

653
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:07,319
mean I think I've seen the banana conda

654
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:09,360
banana Oreos some of some of those

655
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:10,619
banana lines yeah the banana lines are

656
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:12,119
definitely you know that one like

657
00:22:10,619 --> 00:22:13,918
definitely fan favorite we've been

658
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:15,418
running different you know banana creams

659
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,460
banana punches and stuff for the last

660
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:19,259
couple years and yeah you know those are

661
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:21,058
the ones that always win the awards or

662
00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:22,919
you know like they just have a you know

663
00:22:21,058 --> 00:22:25,319
you look at the analytics too just a

664
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:27,179
different terpene profile so yeah you

665
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:29,519
know I'm seeing some more oranges I

666
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:31,740
haven't seen like citrus really come

667
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:34,139
into play so I'm curious if we can get

668
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:36,298
like I said like Super Lemon Haze not

669
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,620
that you know just different citruses

670
00:22:36,298 --> 00:22:39,599
yeah that's a tough one doesn't really

671
00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:42,538
wash that well but yeah but is it

672
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:43,399
possible yeah yeah yeah or is it the

673
00:22:42,538 --> 00:22:45,480
specific

674
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,220
terpenes that give the resin the

675
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,659
structure that it has you know where

676
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,400
you're looking at the trichome heads and

677
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:52,559
that's a big part of it it's hard to say

678
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,600
we've been really kind of also geeking

679
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:56,339
out on trichomorphology and just like

680
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:58,259
the different trichome structures and

681
00:22:56,339 --> 00:23:00,240
what makes a washer a washer and you

682
00:22:58,259 --> 00:23:02,038
know the bulbous head and you know how

683
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,839
thick is the cuticle and what the

684
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:05,940
cuticle just get crushed by the ocean

685
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:08,459
water and all the resin just washes

686
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:10,259
through the bag versus you know just one

687
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:12,419
that has like the right head the right

688
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:14,279
neck stem all that structure so what is

689
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:15,980
that if you don't mind sharing or is

690
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:18,779
that I mean

691
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:20,759
you know we don't have like we're you're

692
00:23:18,779 --> 00:23:22,639
still working on it yeah we're we're

693
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:26,700
we're definitely

694
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:28,860
studying it we unfortunately the market

695
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:31,200
is

696
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:33,418
slow and that costs a lot of money to do

697
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,400
like a really good research program and

698
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:38,940
grow out a bunch of strains and really

699
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:41,220
get good trichomorphology data right but

700
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:44,159
we have hunches of what's making washers

701
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:46,620
and we're you know keeping that in mind

702
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,360
with you know our farm partners and

703
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:49,859
things like that so so I get a whole

704
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:51,359
chapter in the book that's coming out

705
00:23:49,859 --> 00:23:53,879
later this year on breeding cannabis

706
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:56,519
nice and uh yeah there's a whole chapter

707
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,140
on on and I'm trying to get as much data

708
00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:00,240
as I can we're in the final stages of

709
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:02,940
the book but I feel like it's such an

710
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,558
important thing and it's kind of like

711
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,480
the future of breeding is all not not

712
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:08,158
all of it but there is a good chunk of

713
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,538
it that's like how do we breed for

714
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,240
extraction

715
00:24:09,538 --> 00:24:14,220
yeah I mean you know depending on the

716
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,620
method I think you know because like I

717
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:18,538
said with hydrocarbon you can

718
00:24:16,619 --> 00:24:20,579
pretty much put anything good in and

719
00:24:18,538 --> 00:24:23,579
you're going to get a good product out

720
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:25,439
um right with you know ice water hash

721
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:27,599
certain sift certain you know you can

722
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,179
talk about crazy extraction methods

723
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:33,480
using sound and all that fun stuff but

724
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:34,860
you know electrostatics so electrostatic

725
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,240
is a new one that I don't think a lot of

726
00:24:34,859 --> 00:24:38,279
people even know about but like just

727
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,880
it's almost like old school new school

728
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:44,038
yeah totally yeah we uh we did an entry

729
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,440
for that in the emerald cup it's very

730
00:24:44,038 --> 00:24:49,259
hard to scale and but a really cool

731
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,820
process to see and do you know well so

732
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:53,400
there's the way with the the glove where

733
00:24:50,819 --> 00:24:55,259
they're yeah that's what we did yeah you

734
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,480
brush off the glove yeah yeah it seems

735
00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:59,460
like it's a lot of work yeah yeah yeah

736
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,319
it is but you know like I said like at

737
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,640
some point somebody's gonna you know

738
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:03,960
like the hair straighteners at the

739
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,840
beginning like somebody might figure out

740
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:09,360
how to scale it with some crazy you know

741
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:12,199
freaking scientific magnet freaking

742
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:12,199
thing or something yeah

743
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,520
how cool would that be yeah where you

744
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,919
can turn the magnet on and off yeah

745
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:21,900
totally yeah totally so yeah I mean I

746
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,700
you know those are a lot of things that

747
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:26,278
we've been tracking

748
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,480
um you know nitrogen's interesting some

749
00:25:26,278 --> 00:25:29,220
people have messed around with that

750
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,380
haven't really cracked the code but

751
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:32,640
that's one I've you know when we were

752
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:35,640
kind of first

753
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:38,038
pitched on some nitrogen Tech it was

754
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,740
like we're going to bring a big giant

755
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:42,900
air gas truck full liquid nitrogen out

756
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:45,000
to the farm and we're basically just

757
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,740
gonna freaking blast everything with

758
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,319
liquid nitrogen and we're going to

759
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:52,079
harvest all the heads take all the heads

760
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:53,700
and you just leave the farm with instead

761
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:55,558
of with all the biomass that we end up

762
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,558
tossing at the end of the day all the

763
00:25:55,558 --> 00:26:00,298
post-ran stuff all that waste material

764
00:25:57,558 --> 00:26:02,759
stems and leaves Etc all we leave the

765
00:26:00,298 --> 00:26:04,319
farm with was just heads and track homes

766
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:05,700
you know totally so there's some

767
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:07,379
interesting methods out there I think

768
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,700
that we'll figure out which one's real

769
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:10,500
and which I think that makes a lot of

770
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,419
sense though I think whether it's using

771
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,278
that that method of extraction but but

772
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:15,659
field extraction where you're extracting

773
00:26:14,278 --> 00:26:17,339
on the field to a degree where you're

774
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:19,559
not having to leave and put the stuff in

775
00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:21,240
a huge Warehouse super inefficient you

776
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:22,918
know we got freezer trucks and freezer

777
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,620
containers all over the goddamn State

778
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:27,179
it's like it's uh yeah if we could just

779
00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:28,918
have the trichomes because that's the

780
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:30,840
juice that's what we're going for as

781
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:33,299
extractors um you know that would

782
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:34,918
certainly be a either way most people

783
00:26:33,298 --> 00:26:36,658
don't realize how expensive it would be

784
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:39,120
to refrigerate a hundred thousand square

785
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:41,700
foot Warehouse yeah yeah it's just the

786
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:43,139
cost it's it's not cheap and yeah talk

787
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,120
about when you're you know the power

788
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,380
goes out and you know a freezer goes

789
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:47,939
down or your truck breaks down on the

790
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:50,039
side of the road and right all your

791
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:52,278
material turns to freaking mush it's uh

792
00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:54,658
that's scary it's a rough one yeah

793
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:56,640
redundancies yeah life's about

794
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:58,440
redundancies I think yeah God I have a

795
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,000
lot of those in place but you learn from

796
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,159
your mistakes too and it only takes a

797
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,359
few of those mistakes yeah absolutely I

798
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,159
feel like we made everyone in the book

799
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:07,079
so yeah we'll keep making them sure but

800
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:08,700
me too me too I'm the same way I feel

801
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:10,199
like but I feel like I've learned from a

802
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:12,419
lot of mistakes that's that's kind of my

803
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,919
growing process have to man we wouldn't

804
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:16,679
be here if we didn't you know yeah for

805
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,240
sure yeah especially as you start

806
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:20,640
getting into scale it's better to make

807
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,620
your mistakes early on than to make your

808
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,240
mistakes small mistakes are much easier

809
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:26,459
to recover from the big mistakes yeah

810
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,558
absolutely absolutely yeah and it's yeah

811
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:30,960
there's certainly a lot more consequence

812
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:32,639
now than ever before so yeah we've

813
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,740
learned to you know we we've made that

814
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,360
mistake too and learned to start like

815
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,339
small batch pilot and just make sure

816
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:41,519
everything's right before we go into big

817
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:43,259
production runs totally yeah seed

818
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:44,639
reversals doing reversals making sure

819
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:45,778
you have redundancies for those those

820
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,159
are always important when you're making

821
00:27:45,778 --> 00:27:48,599
seeds is like having some sort of

822
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:50,640
redundancy if you're making feminized

823
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:52,139
seeds because what if that reversal

824
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,880
doesn't happen and then you've got all

825
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:56,340
these plants that are in veg that need

826
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,840
pollen when they're in flour wow yeah

827
00:27:56,339 --> 00:28:00,240
yeah that's true

828
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:01,859
yeah there's a lot yeah a lot of things

829
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,700
that can go wrong if you're not planning

830
00:28:01,859 --> 00:28:03,959
for it

831
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,759
um you're gonna end up getting nipped

832
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,319
that's for sure totally so what kind of

833
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:08,640
products do you got here today to share

834
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:10,139
with us

835
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:14,400
um let's see man I you know I brought

836
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:16,980
you a couple Vapes this one is uh The

837
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,778
Jetty solventless it's Amarillo

838
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:21,000
um this one's in a different package

839
00:28:18,778 --> 00:28:22,859
because it's ocal certified I don't know

840
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,880
if you know ocal but

841
00:28:22,859 --> 00:28:30,658
basically we can't say anything's USDA

842
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:32,520
organic in right cannabis so the state

843
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:34,740
love them or hate them you know but they

844
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:37,379
came up with a program

845
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:38,880
um that mimics comparable to the USDA

846
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,679
organic program it's actually a little

847
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,919
more strict there's a couple pesticides

848
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:45,360
on there that aren't even on the USDA

849
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:48,419
organic list so that's good that's a

850
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:49,798
good thing yeah and um you know our farm

851
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:51,600
partner because it kind of starts with

852
00:28:49,798 --> 00:28:52,740
them our farm partner Coastal Sun I mean

853
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:55,019
they've been working on regenerative

854
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:57,419
soil and organic practices for a long

855
00:28:55,019 --> 00:28:59,940
time they have a blueberry farm that is

856
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:01,919
organic USDA organic certified on their

857
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:04,200
farm so they're in the practice of kind

858
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:06,778
of doing that and all that upkeep that

859
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:08,400
and just kind of you know using all

860
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:10,440
sorts of natural Pest mitigations and

861
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,880
all that good stuff so they're in the

862
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,980
habit of doing that so they got

863
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:16,200
certified and

864
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:17,460
in that program manufacturers can get

865
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,600
certified you know if you're using

866
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:21,120
solvents and stuff but you can't get

867
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:25,740
certified but a non-solvent process you

868
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:27,959
can so we got the ocal certification so

869
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:31,140
now we're slowly switching all the lines

870
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:33,538
to like basically us comparable to USDA

871
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:35,340
organic so that's why this one's in the

872
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:37,140
white package to kind of it's

873
00:29:35,339 --> 00:29:40,319
differentiating it we're just going to

874
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:42,480
Market with it but you know it's as

875
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:44,038
organic as it can be you know or Beyond

876
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,620
Organic really I mean it's regenerative

877
00:29:44,038 --> 00:29:48,419
it's it's it's amazing so you know I

878
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:50,158
know really with our solving this line

879
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:52,380
we just want it to be as clean as

880
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:55,200
possible like yeah nothing touched it

881
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:57,840
but ice cubes and water in the process

882
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,919
and um you know it's just a really

883
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:00,898
awesome

884
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:02,940
process and a really good program like

885
00:30:00,898 --> 00:30:05,158
I'm just generally what I eat I try to

886
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:06,778
eat organic I try to you know same stay

887
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:09,240
on the healthier side I should be mostly

888
00:30:06,778 --> 00:30:11,880
organic yeah it's gnarly the [ __ ] they

889
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,798
put in food dude so seriously and I mean

890
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,539
if you're eating bananas it might be

891
00:30:13,798 --> 00:30:18,240
okay but other stuff you know it's like

892
00:30:15,538 --> 00:30:20,220
lettuce yeah any sort of greens yeah you

893
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,659
should be eating organic yeah totally

894
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:23,159
berries berries another one that's

895
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:24,960
another one if you're eating berries you

896
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:26,820
probably should be eating organic the

897
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,759
wine industry or grape Industries like

898
00:30:26,819 --> 00:30:32,519
the biggest consumer of microbutanol

899
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:33,960
like on the planet like brand Eagle 20

900
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:36,720
all over everything you know and then

901
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:39,000
we're eating it you know so Hamel on the

902
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,220
other hand they're in Sonoma and they

903
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,898
are biodynamic and they do not use any

904
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:44,640
of the bad stuff and I really like that

905
00:30:42,898 --> 00:30:46,739
you know I I drink a little wine now and

906
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,120
then but Hamill is amazing I think

907
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:49,919
there's a bunch of amazing there's yeah

908
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:51,479
there's some some Hattie folks out there

909
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:53,399
doing it the right way but you know the

910
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,798
big box people are just yeah just

911
00:30:53,398 --> 00:30:57,239
crushing pesticides everywhere mono

912
00:30:55,798 --> 00:30:58,918
cropping you know it's another thing

913
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,778
these guys do is they're you know wrote

914
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:03,259
rotating crops and things like that so

915
00:31:00,778 --> 00:31:05,640
it's just not mono cropping it's

916
00:31:03,259 --> 00:31:07,919
packaged food if you're looking at you

917
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:10,200
know packaged food stuff that's pre-made

918
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:12,299
most of it is made from

919
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,759
I wouldn't say great quality ingredients

920
00:31:12,298 --> 00:31:16,079
most of the time yeah yeah so yeah I

921
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:17,940
mean that's kind of like you know our

922
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:19,678
way and just you know I think we just

923
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:21,298
all want to live like a good healthy

924
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,220
life I believe food is medicine I

925
00:31:21,298 --> 00:31:25,619
believe cannabis is medicine and whether

926
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:27,600
you believe it is or not yeah yeah want

927
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:29,339
to make it as clean as possible and you

928
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:30,959
know the old Cal certification just adds

929
00:31:29,339 --> 00:31:32,158
a little you know we can differentiate

930
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,259
our product that way there's a lot of

931
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,000
other rosins out there you know where

932
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:37,859
it's a little more costly we've got to

933
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,740
pay the certification fees it's a lot

934
00:31:37,859 --> 00:31:42,599
more logging and cleaning and things

935
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:44,278
like that in between the processes but

936
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:45,839
you know we're we just want to give that

937
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:48,599
to the consumer like that's the end of

938
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:50,220
the day really cool yeah yeah I'm a fan

939
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:51,719

940
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:54,240
give me really good stuff yeah this is

941
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:56,759
another Jetty solvingless cart and then

942
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,278
um here we're doing a little uh tasting

943
00:31:56,759 --> 00:32:01,440
flight which is pretty cool so it's uh

944
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:03,419
live rosin we're doing like these little

945
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,980
half grammars

946
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:07,860
um kind of like a plate of beer you know

947
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:09,360
so you get to taste all the uh

948
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:10,979
you know some of our favorite flavors

949
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:13,079
things like that so

950
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:14,159
um just some really nice cold cure good

951
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:17,158
stuff

952
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:19,320
a lot of fun and I feel like

953
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:21,840
a half gram goes a long ways for a lot

954
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:24,178
of people like me I do cold start when I

955
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:25,918
do dabs if you cold start I use small

956
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:27,899
amounts I like tasting Terps I like

957
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,159
Flavor yeah so at the end of the day I

958
00:32:27,898 --> 00:32:31,619
mean I like the effect too don't get me

959
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:33,899
wrong the effect is important but I also

960
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:35,819
like Flavor especially I might take five

961
00:32:33,898 --> 00:32:37,079
or six well that's great to have

962
00:32:35,819 --> 00:32:38,579
different flavors variety is the spice

963
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:40,619
of life right so yeah we're just trying

964
00:32:38,579 --> 00:32:43,259
to offer that and that was um

965
00:32:40,619 --> 00:32:47,038
you know as far as like it seems simple

966
00:32:43,259 --> 00:32:49,500
but like metric and compliance and all

967
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:51,658
the [ __ ] to put four different skus

968
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:53,339
in one package right freaking nightmare

969
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:54,720
but it becomes a big issue yeah yeah

970
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:56,158
it's a tough one yeah

971
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,179
um but yeah at the end of the day it's

972
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,740
just we kind of wanted to offer

973
00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:00,480
something so it's two grams total half

974
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:03,058
grams they're in these cool little like

975
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,798
pop back jars which actually like vacuum

976
00:33:03,058 --> 00:33:06,599
seal themselves so really good for

977
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:08,038
terpene preservation so right and is

978
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:10,918
there a lot of diversity between each

979
00:33:08,038 --> 00:33:12,119
product or you use similar ones or no I

980
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:13,679
mean there's you know we have all the

981
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:15,599
profiles underneath but yeah like

982
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,860
there's like an orange there's a papaya

983
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:18,240
there's you know something that's a

984
00:33:16,859 --> 00:33:20,579
little on the sweeter side a little more

985
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,859
on the gassy side so we tried to be you

986
00:33:20,579 --> 00:33:24,720
know as diverse as possible but that

987
00:33:22,859 --> 00:33:25,979
said that's where like I'm hoping your

988
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,140
breeders come up with even more

989
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:29,519
diversity in the terpene absolutely I

990
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,140
know so what are the most popular

991
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:35,220
flavors right now that you guys are

992
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:37,019
experiencing you know it's like what do

993
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:39,419
we like and what are we smoking on and

994
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:41,419
like what is like the general consumer

995
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:43,559
and the data kind of tell you it's

996
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:46,679
vastly different

997
00:33:43,558 --> 00:33:49,558
um like what the heady crew and like

998
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:51,059
really heavy users are you know on and

999
00:33:49,558 --> 00:33:52,980
you know I think the traditional Market

1000
00:33:51,058 --> 00:33:55,678
always moves a little bit faster so

1001
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:57,778
there's new strains out that

1002
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:00,179
you know I'm getting but we can't even

1003
00:33:57,778 --> 00:34:01,919
commercialize them or get them out so it

1004
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:04,019
it's crazy to me I mean not in the

1005
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,179
solventless side but you know Fatso is

1006
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:08,398
one that kind of sells really good for

1007
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:09,740
us I mean GMO as much as we all like see

1008
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:12,118
it everywhere

1009
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:14,219
it is yeah it's similar like they're all

1010
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:16,559
kind of similar profiles

1011
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:18,539
um we did a cereal milk recently that's

1012
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:20,759
sold like crazy

1013
00:34:18,539 --> 00:34:22,259
um how's that one wash though it's not

1014
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,839
the greatest but we got it to hit

1015
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:27,179
numbers nice um yeah so they're I think

1016
00:34:24,838 --> 00:34:29,219
there's certain phenos of it that will I

1017
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:30,480
get a zeros cross that I think would

1018
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:32,759
work really well but the same thing it

1019
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,619
doesn't yield crazy the flavor profiles

1020
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:38,099
and that's kind of you know we'll like

1021
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:40,320
make exceptions if it hits a different

1022
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:41,580
bucket on the terpene profile you know

1023
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,838
so

1024
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:44,579
um you know as long as kind of our

1025
00:34:42,838 --> 00:34:46,079
average yield when we're watching like a

1026
00:34:44,579 --> 00:34:49,500
bunch of strains in a month kind of hit

1027
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:51,838
those numbers where right we're okay but

1028
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:53,159
um yeah it's it's really depending on

1029
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:54,480
like what the flavor of the month is but

1030
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:56,460
yeah like I said I mean you know you're

1031
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,900
talking about zyrias and you know the

1032
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:00,119
new banana crosses and things like that

1033
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:02,880
that are like things that we can't get

1034
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:04,619
commercially yet so the consumers used

1035
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,539
to kind of what we were I feel like

1036
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:09,180
smoking a year or two years ago

1037
00:35:06,539 --> 00:35:11,338
sometimes right lcg yeah totally yeah

1038
00:35:09,179 --> 00:35:12,838
totally you know the data and you know

1039
00:35:11,338 --> 00:35:15,420
when you look at like bdsa and like

1040
00:35:12,838 --> 00:35:18,000
these big kind of like you know data

1041
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:19,559
aggregate companies there it's like blue

1042
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,019
dreams still holds strong in California

1043
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:23,639
it's freaking crazy totally I made Blue

1044
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:26,219
Dream crosses last year that I'm about

1045
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:27,420
to release nice uh on the website I

1046
00:35:26,219 --> 00:35:29,399
think

1047
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:31,500
people like blue dream yeah people like

1048
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:34,019
blue dream and whether I like it or not

1049
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:36,179
I mean as far as like

1050
00:35:34,019 --> 00:35:38,099
I think it holds its place I think it's

1051
00:35:36,179 --> 00:35:40,440
something I can enjoy every once in a

1052
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:42,480
while I think the the Terps are cool the

1053
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,679
effect is just very subjective do you

1054
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,300
like the effect of it you know because

1055
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:46,858
it's more more mild yeah it's

1056
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,599
lightweight for sure it tastes good like

1057
00:35:46,858 --> 00:35:50,039
the extract tastes great

1058
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:52,140
yeah and it was like always a fan

1059
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:54,059
favorite for like cultivators back in

1060
00:35:52,139 --> 00:35:56,639
the day but I think we all just blew it

1061
00:35:54,059 --> 00:35:58,799
up and grew so much of it freaking 10 15

1062
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:01,139
years ago just like totally so beat and

1063
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,240
I just it it blows me Crack yeah yeah it

1064
00:36:01,139 --> 00:36:05,279
blows me away that you know it's still

1065
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:07,139
trending and like you know when you look

1066
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,820
at just kind of the it's a different

1067
00:36:07,139 --> 00:36:10,618
consumer you know where like probably

1068
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:12,720
your viewers and like a lot of people we

1069
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:13,980
talk to are just like so inside it and

1070
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:16,019
like what's the new strain what's the

1071
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:19,019
new flavor but you know you kind of look

1072
00:36:16,019 --> 00:36:21,300
at what selling consistently and pulling

1073
00:36:19,019 --> 00:36:23,280
off you know retailer shelves dispensary

1074
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:25,200
shelves it's like yeah it's blue dream

1075
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,660
and people know Blue Dream yeah totally

1076
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:29,699
it's crazy you know Sour Diesel and you

1077
00:36:27,659 --> 00:36:32,338
know like kind of the old classics it's

1078
00:36:29,699 --> 00:36:33,838
funny yeah Green Crack I wonder how

1079
00:36:32,338 --> 00:36:36,539
that's going to go over in metric yeah

1080
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:37,679
totally totally yeah we've changed the

1081
00:36:36,539 --> 00:36:39,358
name on that one

1082
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:41,460
um a couple even when I had dispensary

1083
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:43,199
freaking 10 15 years ago you know it's

1084
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,820
like green bubble and this and that

1085
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:46,559
people just were kind of offended by the

1086
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:48,359
name but man that one like was another

1087
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:51,000
crazy one it finished in six and a half

1088
00:36:48,358 --> 00:36:53,039
weeks weeks it was freaking loud it was

1089
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,539
interesting yeah totally so I had a

1090
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:56,759
green crack that you I could grow it

1091
00:36:54,539 --> 00:36:59,219
side by side with blue dream and it grew

1092
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:03,359
almost identical like as far as like it

1093
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:06,419
was a 10 plus weaker yeah so 70 to 77

1094
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:08,639
days okay and but the Green Crack was

1095
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:10,019
super strong you would smoke it and but

1096
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:12,179
you would build a tolerance to it almost

1097
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:13,259
immediately really but like if you're

1098
00:37:12,179 --> 00:37:14,159
smoking it all the time you give it to

1099
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,420
your friends you're knocking your

1100
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:17,759
friends out and they're like what the

1101
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:20,159
[ __ ] is this but like it was like a

1102
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,000
really short high yeah yeah that was it

1103
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:23,338
too

1104
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,139
yeah my buddy had a Fino of it in Lake

1105
00:37:23,338 --> 00:37:26,759
County crushed it with it it was

1106
00:37:25,139 --> 00:37:28,500
beautiful and that was six and a half

1107
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,720
weeks finished so quick which was like

1108
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:33,659
pretty amazing yeah yeah it was a it was

1109
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:35,639
a Crusher for many many years

1110
00:37:33,659 --> 00:37:38,940
um you did great with that one

1111
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:40,440
nice yeah I think bringing back old

1112
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,940
flavors is another thing that's going to

1113
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,920
happen yeah you know because I think we

1114
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:45,780
still have access to either seeds or

1115
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,240
people have preserved the genetics yeah

1116
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:50,760
the cuts yeah yeah there's

1117
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:52,858
you know we uh recently

1118
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,960
got the brand into the East Coast into

1119
00:37:52,858 --> 00:37:58,199
New York and you know it's a slow roll

1120
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:00,000
out there but like the ogs that have

1121
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:02,578
been there for a while and like you know

1122
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,440
the chem and like the the kind of old

1123
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:06,000
East Coast strains

1124
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,559
um people still are hoarding those and

1125
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,480
have those beans have those genetics

1126
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:11,099
they've been sitting on so yeah it's

1127
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,719
exciting and you know it's like man I

1128
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:15,059
kind of feel like sour got lost out here

1129
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:16,858
for a while but like there's it's such

1130
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:18,299
high demand right a couple guys like

1131
00:38:16,858 --> 00:38:19,980
with these little closets you know

1132
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:22,079
little small warehouses that are like oh

1133
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:23,639
just still have like that you know great

1134
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,140
East Coast hour man it's pretty cool

1135
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:26,819
before we rolled the cameras we were

1136
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:29,819
talking a little bit of hop late and I

1137
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:31,859
feel like sour was kind of the vector to

1138
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:33,240
a degree of hop Layton or one of them

1139
00:38:31,858 --> 00:38:35,338
and

1140
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:37,319
Sour Diesel was amazing and most people

1141
00:38:35,338 --> 00:38:38,639
haven't been able to ex like lately have

1142
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,019
not been able to experience the sour

1143
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:41,699
diesel like we used to get and I think a

1144
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:44,759
lot of it is due to hop late and there's

1145
00:38:41,699 --> 00:38:46,319
viruses and also just age yeah you know

1146
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:48,839
some of these genetics are sold if you

1147
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,000
think a lot of that stuff was early 90s

1148
00:38:48,838 --> 00:38:53,159
like it's not like it was today like the

1149
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,900
91 is still pretty awesome yeah yeah

1150
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:56,039
yeah that's it man and that's what's

1151
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:58,139
cool about what you guys are doing here

1152
00:38:56,039 --> 00:38:59,338
I think with that TC stuff and you know

1153
00:38:58,139 --> 00:39:01,618
being able to bring it back and

1154
00:38:59,338 --> 00:39:03,358
Revitalize those old school genetics

1155
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:04,858
gonna be totally cool well and being

1156
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:06,420
able to use for us using him for

1157
00:39:04,858 --> 00:39:09,000
breeding you know we have the nursery

1158
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:11,099
model too but I think really using them

1159
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,099
for breeding and creating new stuff and

1160
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:15,300
I think we'll be able to Pivot in any

1161
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:16,680
direction the market goes because it's

1162
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:19,019
not always about what I like because I

1163
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:21,779
like you know as a chef too I don't

1164
00:39:19,019 --> 00:39:23,280
always cook the food that I love but I I

1165
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:25,740
love cooking for people and I love

1166
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,940
making genetics for people and also I

1167
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:29,699
want to bring the market what the market

1168
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:32,519
wants and everybody has different needs

1169
00:39:29,699 --> 00:39:34,679
and wants and you know I think it's it's

1170
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:36,838
really interesting kind of the way

1171
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:38,699
the market is shaped up we're in this

1172
00:39:36,838 --> 00:39:39,900
place where people want new stuff every

1173
00:39:38,699 --> 00:39:42,000
two months well that's not going to be

1174
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:44,519
like that forever I think there'll be

1175
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,900
always a interest in that stuff but I

1176
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:47,699
think a lot of the stuff will stabilize

1177
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:49,858
we'll find stuff that's really amazing

1178
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:52,679
and then companies will settle on that

1179
00:39:49,858 --> 00:39:54,719
is their own proprietary thing yeah so

1180
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:56,279
and I'm looking forward to that I'm also

1181
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:57,899
you know in in the sense where a company

1182
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,880
can do that but also where a home grower

1183
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:02,460
can grow his own just like how a micro

1184
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:04,380
bird can grow or brew beer sure home

1185
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:06,240
grower can grow his own and you know I

1186
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:08,820
think the future's wide open to a degree

1187
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:10,618
it's scary on some notes yeah yeah

1188
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:13,260
especially if you're in metric or yeah

1189
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:15,780
wreck yeah we're uh yeah we're fully

1190
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:17,579
there and it is scary it's uh it's a

1191
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:20,160
tough place to operate man it's you know

1192
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:21,960
I think whether it's the economy whether

1193
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:23,159
it's over saturation of this that and

1194
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,720
the other thing it's

1195
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:26,699
it's tough you know there's a lot of

1196
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:28,319
companies laying people off and just you

1197
00:40:26,699 --> 00:40:30,419
know kind of hitting this other downturn

1198
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:32,099
in the market and people aren't going

1199
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:34,079
into retailers like they used to and

1200
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:36,539
right you know part of it like we can

1201
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:37,440
again like taxation things like that you

1202
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:40,019
know we can kind of get into that

1203
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,940
taxation over taxation yeah it's just

1204
00:40:40,019 --> 00:40:43,800
like yeah like let us be competitive

1205
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:45,900
with the traditional market and you know

1206
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,880
be able to get more product out to the

1207
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:50,220
people and you know everybody wins and

1208
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,720
then again where does the tax money go I

1209
00:40:50,219 --> 00:40:53,639
still see freaking tons of homeless

1210
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:56,098
people out and just like it the roads

1211
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:58,799
are [ __ ] and it's like it's a that's a

1212
00:40:56,099 --> 00:41:00,539
whole can of worms but um yeah here in

1213
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,460
Oakland Oakland's scary yeah I thought

1214
00:41:00,539 --> 00:41:04,139
was scary too I mean compared to how it

1215
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,639
used to be and I've been in Oakland my

1216
00:41:04,139 --> 00:41:08,279
whole life and I just don't like Oakland

1217
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:10,679
anymore in the sense that it's dangerous

1218
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:13,560
yeah it's freaking wild there dude yeah

1219
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:16,019
it's getting Wilder and Wilder and yeah

1220
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:18,719
I mean there's you know we've been

1221
00:41:16,019 --> 00:41:21,420
broken into and robbed plenty of times

1222
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:23,578
and you know I tell people.com it's just

1223
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:24,900
like yeah like you know it's not a

1224
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:25,920
matter if but when your window's gonna

1225
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,539
get smashed make sure you take your

1226
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,099
backpack I like you know all these noobs

1227
00:41:27,539 --> 00:41:31,619
coming up and you know coming up from

1228
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:33,660
wherever even San Diego LA or just

1229

people visiting I'm like dude you yeah

1230
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:38,940
do not leave anything in your car like

1231
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:40,679
it's gonna happen you know so

1232
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:42,900
um yeah it's wild I mean just stores

1233
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:46,679
just broad daylight you know tons of

1234
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:48,119
retailers in stores like yeah I know the

1235
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:49,799
lady that was on the news that got

1236
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:52,500
carjacked and they ended up catching the

1237
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:54,359
guys on Skyline Boulevard yeah she had

1238
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:57,300
cameras and they used the cameras to

1239
00:41:54,358 --> 00:41:59,039
identify the the thieves that carjacked

1240
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:00,839
her yeah but I mean that's Skyline

1241
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:02,639
Boulevard and that's like the nice part

1242
00:42:00,838 --> 00:42:04,380
of Oakland yeah yeah it doesn't matter

1243
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:05,578
where you got to have your head on a

1244
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:07,680
swivel out there dude for sure

1245
00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:10,200
absolutely but it's still a beautiful

1246
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:12,539
city I mean I still love Oakland mm-hmm

1247
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:13,618
yeah it is it's great you know it's home

1248
00:42:12,539 --> 00:42:17,099
it's been

1249
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:19,320
a great Hub and like very welcoming City

1250
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:21,539
with cannabis I think like

1251
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:24,119
in the 215 days when we were kind of

1252
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:26,039
operating then and you know I took

1253
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:27,780
plenty of raids whether that be in like

1254
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:29,400
Nevada County and we started the company

1255
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:31,320
in San Diego and it was super

1256
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,480
conservative there and right you know

1257
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:34,500
like

1258
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:37,260
they were just coming after everybody

1259
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:39,059
like we had a small grow my brother had

1260
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:41,220
a dispensary we converted it to a

1261
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:43,980
delivery at a four lighter dude tiny

1262
00:42:41,219 --> 00:42:45,598
little grow five thousand scripts like a

1263
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:47,940
whole Collective backing of four later

1264
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:49,920
it was crazy and they still came in

1265
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:51,720
raided them charged them with a felony

1266
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,579
you know they had to get a wobble

1267
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:55,858
misdemeanor all this stuff but it's just

1268
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:58,560
like you know the it was night and day

1269
00:42:55,858 --> 00:43:00,838
so you know Oakland was always friendly

1270
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:03,119
to cannabis and you know had an

1271
00:43:00,838 --> 00:43:05,759
ordinance for extraction it's like you

1272
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:07,858
know it was I I came home and did a lot

1273
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,800
of things right when it came to cannabis

1274
00:43:07,858 --> 00:43:12,838
legalization from medical transitioning

1275
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,940
into Rec and the way they wanted to do

1276
00:43:12,838 --> 00:43:17,338
the green zone they looked at the PG e

1277
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:19,500
bills and they basically faced the green

1278
00:43:17,338 --> 00:43:21,179
zone on the PG e structure they let

1279
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:23,280
people come into compliance like you

1280
00:43:21,179 --> 00:43:25,559
could operate there you know kind of

1281
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,420
under the medical guidelines and then

1282
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:29,159
they let you come into compliance which

1283
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:31,200
was cool you know it gave everybody

1284
00:43:29,159 --> 00:43:32,940
everybody that was old school that

1285
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:36,838
wanted to give it a try a shot you know

1286
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:38,639
which was nice yeah yeah I mean Oakland

1287
00:43:36,838 --> 00:43:41,219
yeah kind of the birth of a lot of this

1288
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:42,779
stuff okay yeah yeah no it's been the

1289
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:44,879
Hub and just you know everybody coming

1290
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:46,079
down off the mountain like that's it was

1291
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,180
the place to go like that's where you

1292
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:51,240
went yeah Harborside going big you know

1293
00:43:48,179 --> 00:43:53,818
I think Harborside was like the real big

1294
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:55,559
as far as also the focus that the

1295
00:43:53,818 --> 00:43:57,000
government had on dispensaries because

1296
00:43:55,559 --> 00:43:58,318
they were pushing the limit on what they

1297
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,539
were doing they were making all kinds of

1298
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:02,579
money and they were getting scrutinized

1299
00:44:00,539 --> 00:44:05,099
and they were the model you know and

1300
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:07,200
like yeah as a grower an extractor to

1301
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:09,300
get your product on that shelf back in

1302
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:10,799
the day was like you know you felt like

1303
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:12,240
you made it finally you know oh I have

1304
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,619
stories they're a pain in the ass to

1305
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:15,479
deal with to a degree though and they

1306
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:17,880
didn't pay you right away I like places

1307
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:19,858
where you go in the dispensary they'd

1308
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:21,660
slap the cash down and it was like a

1309
00:44:19,858 --> 00:44:23,639
transaction where it wasn't like you get

1310
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:24,960
a little slip of paper yeah and two

1311
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:26,159
weeks later like come pick your product

1312
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,420
back up yeah you didn't have to

1313
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:28,739
everybody was back gonna get in there

1314
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:30,180
but yeah saying when we I had a

1315
00:44:28,739 --> 00:44:32,759
dispenser in San Diego and it was very

1316
00:44:30,179 --> 00:44:35,159
much like that where you know would pay

1317
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,900
somebody on the spot and we called them

1318
00:44:35,159 --> 00:44:38,399
vendors you guys were vendors back in

1319
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:40,800
the day and come in with your duffel

1320
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:43,139

1321
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,660
bunch of different flavors and two or

1322
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:47,400
three of the best peas and

1323
00:44:44,659 --> 00:44:49,139
anyway yeah yeah I mean Harborside would

1324
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,960
buy some decent quantities of stuff too

1325
00:44:49,139 --> 00:44:53,519
though and it's amazing how much product

1326
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:56,460
they move through there and how much

1327
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:58,559
money they made back in the day today it

1328
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:01,500
was an amazing model it was it was yeah

1329
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:03,239
it was it One of a Kind first of its

1330
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:04,619
kind and

1331
00:45:03,239 --> 00:45:06,299
um you know it's

1332
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:07,980
it's interesting The Way It All Shook

1333
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:09,599
out now but yeah I mean you got to give

1334
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:12,059
them props for kind of breaking the mold

1335
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,859
and you know helping you know yeah the

1336
00:45:12,059 --> 00:45:15,420
industry move forward well and then even

1337
00:45:13,858 --> 00:45:17,098
like so we can talk about Purple Heart

1338
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,940
there was purple heart back in the day I

1339
00:45:17,099 --> 00:45:20,220
don't know if you went to Purple Heart

1340
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:21,960
at all hours I was down south back then

1341
00:45:20,219 --> 00:45:24,118
but you know I knew of it for sure yeah

1342
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:25,500
and so they weren't Harborside they were

1343
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:26,519
doing their own thing and they were but

1344
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,559
they were

1345
00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:30,358
all about helping people out they had

1346
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:32,219
really knowledgeable people working

1347
00:45:30,358 --> 00:45:33,900
there yeah which was great they had a

1348
00:45:32,219 --> 00:45:35,818
good buyer

1349
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:37,500
yeah I didn't like yeah I wasn't up here

1350
00:45:35,818 --> 00:45:39,480
that much like we were just come up and

1351
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:41,519
kind of just basically were coming up

1352
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,780
and grabbing you know this like I said

1353
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:44,099
it was the meeting place everybody would

1354
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:46,140
come off the mountain I'd come grab a

1355
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:48,359
bunch of packs for SoCal dispensaries

1356
00:45:46,139 --> 00:45:49,980
and stuff like that so didn't spend too

1357
00:45:48,358 --> 00:45:51,420
much time in the clubs you know up here

1358
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:53,219
but right

1359
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:56,280
um certainly uh

1360
00:45:53,219 --> 00:45:58,078
a hub and an epicenter for you know a

1361
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:00,900
lot of transaction and trade which was

1362
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:03,599
always fun yeah when did you get into

1363
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:05,700
hashmaking and all the stuff that became

1364
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:07,920
Jetty you know like I said jetty's been

1365
00:46:05,699 --> 00:46:09,659
around for about for 10 years now in

1366
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,159
October it'll be a 10th year anniversary

1367
00:46:09,659 --> 00:46:13,500
which I'm stoked on because we're still

1368
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:17,460
here and a lot of people aren't so at a

1369
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:20,940
dispensary 2009 10 that got shut down by

1370
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:23,039
the feds sometime in 2011. civil they

1371
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:24,119
gave us a letter said basically my

1372
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:25,679
landlord they're like we're going to

1373
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:28,200
seize this property unless you kick out

1374
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:30,899
your marijuana tenant yeah so gave us a

1375
00:46:28,199 --> 00:46:33,419
45 day to cease and desist so we moved

1376
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:34,980
all that to a delivery I kind of

1377
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:37,079
mentioned a delivery model I had a

1378
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:39,719
couple gross spotted up around San Diego

1379
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:41,760
and right but you know when I had the

1380
00:46:39,719 --> 00:46:44,279
dispensary it was like talked about like

1381
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:47,579
our concentrate shelf like you know

1382
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:49,319
being just you know some full melts and

1383
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:52,619
just bubble hash and things like that

1384
00:46:49,318 --> 00:46:54,420
and then towards the end like yeah 10 11

1385
00:46:52,619 --> 00:46:55,858
something like that you know you'd start

1386
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:58,318
to see like oils you're like damn what

1387
00:46:55,858 --> 00:47:00,119
the hell is this like Amber oil and

1388
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:01,800
sometimes it'd be poop soup like a dark

1389
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:03,119
gross [ __ ] but

1390
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,980
um we really didn't know how to smoke it

1391
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:07,740
and what to do with it yet

1392
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:09,719
um and then you know I saw like a really

1393
00:47:07,739 --> 00:47:12,959
shitty vaporizer pen like it was like

1394
00:47:09,719 --> 00:47:14,699
with glycol and the cotton wicks yeah it

1395
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,380
was terrible like it was just terrible

1396
00:47:14,699 --> 00:47:19,199
but I still have my general yeah yeah

1397
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:21,358
it's like you know this is [ __ ] cool

1398
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:22,559
and it's gonna probably be something but

1399
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:25,259
it's not something yet but it really

1400
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:27,059
sparked my interest right and you know

1401
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:29,280
really seeing like our concentrate Shelf

1402
00:47:27,059 --> 00:47:31,739
at the dispensary go from like

1403
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,940
you know a little slice and a little bit

1404
00:47:31,739 --> 00:47:34,439
of market share a little bit of sales

1405
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:36,960
and it got bigger and bigger and bigger

1406
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:38,940
and more variety and more offerings and

1407
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,260
you know it's like weird like honey Buds

1408
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:42,059
and this and that and like all these

1409
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:43,859
different you know uh moon rocks moon

1410
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:45,659
rocks yeah all that yeah like fun stuff

1411
00:47:43,858 --> 00:47:47,639
like people were doing and it started

1412
00:47:45,659 --> 00:47:49,318
evolving and then you know a lot of like

1413
00:47:47,639 --> 00:47:51,598
the glass blowing homies were like yeah

1414
00:47:49,318 --> 00:47:53,279
we don't really blow like the [ __ ]

1415
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:54,720
bong or a pipe anymore everybody wants

1416
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,160
these rigs dude like I'm just selling

1417
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:57,959
these Rigs and people are coming in the

1418
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:00,059
dispensary asking for Rigs and nails and

1419
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:02,519
bangers and this and that you know and

1420
00:48:00,059 --> 00:48:04,799
uh you know the the method of smoking

1421
00:48:02,519 --> 00:48:06,659
and vaporizing and dabbing really kind

1422
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:09,599
of took on and we're just like wow this

1423
00:48:06,659 --> 00:48:11,818
is like becoming a huge category and

1424
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:13,380
this is like there barely was any Brands

1425
00:48:11,818 --> 00:48:15,239
back then man it was just like strain

1426
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:17,099
names there was a couple like Mom and

1427
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:18,719
Pop cookie companies that were like

1428
00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:20,760
edible Brands but there wasn't really

1429
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:22,199
much branding then yeah there's two big

1430
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:25,380
glass companies that I remember is

1431
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:27,419
Hitman Glass and silica yeah those two

1432
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:30,300
Brands kind of had the most of the

1433
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:33,000
market share yeah they definitely did

1434
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:35,220
and like I think yeah Hitman Dougie and

1435
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,920
like that crew definitely had a lot to

1436
00:48:35,219 --> 00:48:39,959
do with kind of like evolving the method

1437
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,480
of smoking which really helped evolve

1438
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:45,240
yeah

1439
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:46,920
he's an amazing guy you know yeah he's

1440
00:48:45,239 --> 00:48:49,078

1441
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:51,300

1442
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:53,220

00:48:53,219 --> 00:48:57,059
really like helped Pioneer and pave the

1445
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:58,800
way for what it is now and it's really

1446
00:48:57,059 --> 00:49:00,599
cool to see that Evolution like I said

1447
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:03,000
but yeah really that's kind of how we

1448
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:05,818

1449
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,039
feds what are we gonna do

1450
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:09,420
um let's try to find a safe way to do

1451
00:49:08,039 --> 00:49:10,920
extraction because everybody's either

1452
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:13,318
blowing up their garages by open

1453
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:16,079
blasting doing stupid [ __ ] or getting

1454
00:49:13,318 --> 00:49:17,639
like these crazy charges which was like

1455
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,500
I don't know like the same charge you'd

1456
00:49:17,639 --> 00:49:20,759
get if you had a meth lab you would

1457
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,900
intent to manufacture or something I

1458
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,160
can't remember what it was but a bad

1459
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:26,160
felony

1460
00:49:23,159 --> 00:49:27,358
um so we thought oh CO2 is safer so my

1461
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:28,980
partner

1462
00:49:27,358 --> 00:49:32,098
um two partners back then but you know

1463
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:34,260
one came in he was kind of had some real

1464
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:35,818
estate money sold and you know basically

1465
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:37,200
he's like yeah I'll throw down for a CO2

1466
00:49:35,818 --> 00:49:38,639
machine and we didn't know what the [ __ ]

1467
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:40,799
we were doing so that was like kind of

1468
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:42,900
the first thing was this pre-like Eden

1469
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:45,359
lab CO2 or what it was right around the

1470
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:47,280
same time that was the Apex CO2 so I was

1471
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:49,858
like those were the two I think the

1472
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:52,440
first CO2 rig I saw was an Eden thing we

1473
00:49:49,858 --> 00:49:54,779
had a we had to grow in a two-story

1474
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:57,300
building but the tenant was like leasing

1475
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:59,579
it to all cannabis people Apex had Terps

1476
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:01,619
still whereas the Eden was like crude

1477
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:04,200
yeah like the orange peanut butter yeah

1478
00:50:01,619 --> 00:50:06,000
totally yeah yeah some really weird

1479
00:50:04,199 --> 00:50:08,519
consistencies would come out of that

1480
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,380
like just how waxy it was yeah the high

1481
00:50:08,519 --> 00:50:11,940
pressures and the heat it was mostly wax

1482
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:13,559
yeah yeah totally and they're like oh I

1483
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:15,960
got a huge yield and it's like freaking

1484
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:17,578
30 you know what I mean so

1485
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:20,940
um yeah it was certainly you know not

1486
00:50:17,579 --> 00:50:23,460
the best method of extraction but what

1487
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:25,200
it you know once we winterized it and it

1488
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:26,818
worked really well even though it didn't

1489
00:50:25,199 --> 00:50:29,818
have good terp profile but it got to a

1490
00:50:26,818 --> 00:50:31,739
good consistency or a pen and that kind

1491
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:33,420
of really got us like we're kind of just

1492
00:50:31,739 --> 00:50:36,479
focused on extracts in general but

1493
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:38,940
having that CO2 rig kind of got us you

1494
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:40,559
know more into selling more Vapes and

1495
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:41,818
more pens because that's the only thing

1496
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:44,639
we could really make from that machine

1497
00:50:41,818 --> 00:50:45,420
so right it kind of evolved I guess you

1498
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:47,279
know

1499
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:50,280
naturally from there

1500
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:52,099
awesome yeah so and that was 10 years

1501
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:55,319
ago and then you started out just doing

1502
00:50:52,099 --> 00:50:59,099
CO2 and that evolved you did that for

1503
00:50:55,318 --> 00:51:01,920
five years maybe yeah probably you know

1504
00:50:59,099 --> 00:51:03,720
it was a couple years of CO2 and then

1505
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,880
you know kind of went into the ethanol

1506
00:51:03,719 --> 00:51:07,618
distillate thing

1507
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:09,180
um hydrocarbon live resin because we had

1508
00:51:07,619 --> 00:51:11,460
to wait for like licensing and things

1509
00:51:09,179 --> 00:51:13,199
like that so

1510
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:14,699
um you know every couple years it seems

1511
00:51:13,199 --> 00:51:15,539
like we evolved to a different type of

1512
00:51:14,699 --> 00:51:18,598
uh

1513
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:20,099
type of extraction awesome yeah yeah as

1514
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:21,480
the market changed you were kind of on

1515
00:51:20,099 --> 00:51:23,460
The Cutting Edge of what's new and

1516
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:25,260
trying it out tried to be you know like

1517
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:25,980
a lot of it like I said it was just kind

1518
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:28,079
of

1519
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:29,880
we you know we may have pigeonholed

1520
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:31,380
ourselves into a few methods that you

1521
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:33,000
know looking back on it it got us where

1522
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:34,140
we are today but

1523
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,880
um

1524
00:51:34,139 --> 00:51:37,379
you know the good thing is we never like

1525
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:41,220
over built for anything like there's

1526
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:43,380
some Mega CO2 Labs or Mega ethanol Labs

1527
00:51:41,219 --> 00:51:45,239
that are out there that you know

1528
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:46,619
basically are getting sold off for parts

1529
00:51:45,239 --> 00:51:49,379
right now because no one's using those

1530
00:51:46,619 --> 00:51:50,940
methods so we were at least pivoting

1531
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:52,680
every couple years knowing there's going

1532
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:54,420
to be a new trend or new tech coming out

1533
00:51:52,679 --> 00:51:56,759
you know yeah those are like the cool

1534
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:58,139
tubes yeah totally totally yeah I mean

1535
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:59,339
the quest was to really make something

1536
00:51:58,139 --> 00:52:01,799
that

1537
00:51:59,338 --> 00:52:04,679
tasted as good or better than the flower

1538
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:07,079
you know so that was kind of always the

1539
00:52:04,679 --> 00:52:09,838
mission and why we evolved I think nice

1540
00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:13,519
yeah would you like to try some uh

1541
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:13,519
banana Skittles yeah dude

1542
00:52:16,739 --> 00:52:21,719
some fun stuff so that's uh

1543
00:52:19,318 --> 00:52:26,279
banana OG times banana punch then back

1544
00:52:21,719 --> 00:52:27,598
to the Skittles and Fino hunted by uh my

1545
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:29,819
good friend's house of cultivar in

1546
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:31,318
Seattle okay so they're doing all kinds

1547
00:52:29,818 --> 00:52:32,099
of fun stuff with extraction up there

1548
00:52:31,318 --> 00:52:34,440
and

1549
00:52:32,099 --> 00:52:36,119
I'm big fan of the live resin with this

1550
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:38,280
plant but it's it's very open bud

1551
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:40,200
structure I don't know if you remember

1552
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:42,599
Williams wonder where it was like yeah

1553
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:44,699
yeah yeah totally yeah nice okay where

1554
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:47,160
the Brax really stuck up in foxtail kind

1555
00:52:44,699 --> 00:52:48,899
of like sour have foxtails I like that

1556
00:52:47,159 --> 00:52:51,000
structure man I don't know sometimes you

1557
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:52,619
know like the nice tight pretty nug is

1558
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,179
cool but like

1559
00:52:52,619 --> 00:52:57,680
I like it when it does its own thing you

1560
00:52:54,179 --> 00:52:57,679
know it kind of like comes out all weird

1561
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,880
not bad right yeah

1562
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:04,859
okay I definitely get the Skittles in it

1563
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:07,380
yeah

1564
00:53:04,858 --> 00:53:09,420
it's it's skiddly it's got banana I feel

1565
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:11,579
like it's

1566
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:13,680
the flower actually smells kind of

1567
00:53:11,579 --> 00:53:18,318
pungent but you don't get the pungency

1568
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:18,318
with the extract so let me smell it

1569
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:26,760
yeah it's got a little more Skittles to

1570
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,679
it for sure

1571
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:30,240
yeah and I like it Skittles structure is

1572
00:53:28,679 --> 00:53:33,419
always bad like

1573
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:35,578
if you wanna it's a hard one like to get

1574
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:37,680
to wash well right for us and hit

1575
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:39,660
numbers but the bananas definitely will

1576
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:40,679
work good

1577
00:53:39,659 --> 00:53:42,239
um

1578
00:53:40,679 --> 00:53:43,558
yeah there's a fine line with this yeah

1579
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:45,239
there's a little banana in there I got

1580
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:47,420
more of the Skittles though yeah for

1581
00:53:45,239 --> 00:53:47,419
sure

1582
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:54,659
the plant when you squeeze some of the

1583
00:53:51,539 --> 00:53:56,818
Expressions it's just straight like

1584
00:53:54,659 --> 00:53:59,578
banana OG like that really yeah yeah

1585
00:53:56,818 --> 00:54:02,159
banana OG nice and then the banana punch

1586
00:53:59,579 --> 00:54:04,019
those plants get so big so you can you

1587
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:06,358
can really see the different like if you

1588
00:54:04,019 --> 00:54:07,920
look at the Skittles you take the three

1589
00:54:06,358 --> 00:54:10,139
plants because they they definitely all

1590
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,700
have different structure but when you're

1591
00:54:10,139 --> 00:54:13,279
looking at the progeny you can really

1592
00:54:11,699 --> 00:54:15,899
see

1593
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:18,240
what uh was inherited from which parent

1594
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:20,639
uh that's cool man

1595
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:22,259
I don't spend nearly enough time in in

1596
00:54:20,639 --> 00:54:25,078
the grow room in the fields as I'd like

1597
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:27,300
to yeah it's uh that's a cool thing

1598
00:54:25,079 --> 00:54:29,940
about the whole you know how the extract

1599
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:32,280
scenes evolving and how we're

1600
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:34,019
you know more in cahoots with the farmer

1601
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:35,040
and the the producer and the cultivator

1602
00:54:34,019 --> 00:54:37,380
then

1603
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:39,539
then ever before and just like you know

1604
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:41,460
breeding more for

1605
00:54:39,539 --> 00:54:42,659
extraction and soft and less genetics

1606
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:44,159
and stuff like that there's just a lot

1607
00:54:42,659 --> 00:54:45,420
more data sharing and like you know

1608
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:47,399
we're looking at galaxies and we're

1609
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:49,818
looking at trichomes together and it's

1610
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,818
fun man

1611
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:54,720
yeah and breeding for specific types of

1612
00:54:52,619 --> 00:54:56,039
extraction it's like gotten it's not

1613
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:59,098
like you're reading for everything it's

1614
00:54:56,039 --> 00:55:01,558
not yeah across the board yeah

1615
00:54:59,099 --> 00:55:03,059
yeah so there's some fun uh fun new

1616
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:05,220
stuff I think yeah that's the thing that

1617
00:55:03,059 --> 00:55:07,200
excites me the most is just

1618
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:10,318
what new strains are on the Forefront

1619
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:11,399
you know for sure you know I think Lemon

1620
00:55:10,318 --> 00:55:14,900
Cherry

1621
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:16,800
and I think these uh gelato

1622
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:19,380
derivatives

1623
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:21,000
they have their place but I think I see

1624
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:23,700
over in New York they're really happy

1625
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,858
with the pith they're going hard with

1626
00:55:23,699 --> 00:55:28,078
like some of this the sativa varieties

1627
00:55:25,858 --> 00:55:30,719
these hazes yep totally I love it I

1628
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:32,280
think that's great to have the diversity

1629
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:33,480
I don't always want to smoke a haze I

1630
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:36,240
don't want to smoke a haze on this show

1631
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:38,159
necessarily done that before and it's

1632
00:55:36,239 --> 00:55:40,078
just like one of these joints that

1633
00:55:38,159 --> 00:55:42,659
doesn't have a ceiling man it could just

1634
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:44,099
keep getting cheap escalated some of

1635
00:55:42,659 --> 00:55:45,899
them creep up you on you too so like

1636
00:55:44,099 --> 00:55:47,880
you'll smoke it and then it just keeps

1637
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:49,619
you get getting you more High yeah I

1638
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:51,180
just yeah we just don't see it out here

1639
00:55:49,619 --> 00:55:53,338
man I wish there was more hazes

1640
00:55:51,179 --> 00:55:55,679
available and there's little markets

1641
00:55:53,338 --> 00:55:58,380
like niche market like uh gold seal in

1642
00:55:55,679 --> 00:56:00,659
San Francisco they do their uh Congo

1643
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:02,640
yeah Congo yeah that Congo is crazy dude

1644
00:56:00,659 --> 00:56:04,318
it's a good one it's a good one and I

1645
00:56:02,639 --> 00:56:05,338
think that that hop late in two for a

1646
00:56:04,318 --> 00:56:07,679
while and I'm not sure if they

1647
00:56:05,338 --> 00:56:10,199
remediated or not but yeah we were

1648
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:12,179
you know we had uh kind of some friends

1649
00:56:10,199 --> 00:56:14,159
of ours operating out of our facility

1650
00:56:12,179 --> 00:56:16,379
Oakland extracts they were really like

1651
00:56:14,159 --> 00:56:18,960
Old School Oakland ogs and pick up to

1652
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:20,640
Terence Tran but uh yeah they were

1653
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:22,740
rocking that gear for a while always

1654
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:24,779
getting the gold till Congo and it was

1655
00:56:22,739 --> 00:56:28,799
just man it had just such a cool profile

1656
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:30,540
loved it yeah Gucci super stoned as yeah

1657
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:33,660
it's it's strong it's strong in effect

1658
00:56:30,539 --> 00:56:35,219
but that's one where I had a I had a big

1659
00:56:33,659 --> 00:56:38,279
bag of it and over the period of a week

1660
00:56:35,219 --> 00:56:41,399
your body really starts to get used to

1661
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:43,200
it and so even the strongest stuff you

1662
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:45,119
can build a tolerance to yeah absolutely

1663
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:47,519
absolutely so and that's one thing like

1664
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:49,500
if you're used to doing dabs or you're

1665
00:56:47,519 --> 00:56:51,179
used to smoking I feel like the

1666
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:52,980
difference between the two if you switch

1667
00:56:51,179 --> 00:56:54,419
to the other one dude yeah yeah I don't

1668
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:56,579
smoke flour for a while I'm freaking

1669
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:58,619
ripped off at you totally it's nice

1670
00:56:56,579 --> 00:57:00,900
smoke some Skittles and also yeah yeah

1671
00:56:58,619 --> 00:57:03,000
but but yeah whereas I'm the same way

1672
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:04,920
whereas I've been mostly smoking flour

1673
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,300
lately we've been going through a lot

1674
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:07,980
we're doing a lot of selections and so

1675
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:09,839
I'm always trying new stuff so I'm is

1676
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:12,719
getting high for that for the most part

1677
00:57:09,838 --> 00:57:14,759
but then I go to take a dab or even just

1678
00:57:12,719 --> 00:57:16,679
hitting you know doing doing one of

1679
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:18,119
these cold starts that I do it's like I

1680
00:57:16,679 --> 00:57:21,000
can get ripped off those pretty easily

1681
00:57:18,119 --> 00:57:22,500
okay yeah yeah totally feel that yeah

1682
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,539
and even strain The Strain you know just

1683
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:26,460
like the way you build tolerances is

1684
00:57:24,539 --> 00:57:28,318
another thing I think we're just like

1685
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:30,240
learning more and more about and right

1686
00:57:28,318 --> 00:57:32,579
you know but yeah I mean I'll switch to

1687
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:34,500
smoking whatever OG the whole time and

1688
00:57:32,579 --> 00:57:35,880
then just switch to something that's you

1689
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:37,199
would think is lightweight and mellow

1690
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:38,700
but it's got that different terpene

1691
00:57:37,199 --> 00:57:40,799
profile or whatever hits you totally

1692
00:57:38,699 --> 00:57:42,419
different right yeah yeah when people

1693
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:44,460
ask me what was my favorite thing to

1694
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:45,480
smoke is it's like I like a lot of

1695
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:47,039
different things but whatever the best

1696
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:49,380
is right now because it's a fresh

1697
00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:51,239
product that's what I like and they're

1698
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:52,800
usually like always whatever I have

1699
00:57:51,239 --> 00:57:55,019
that's the best is the one I want to

1700
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:56,460
smoke the most of and I might have a

1701
00:57:55,019 --> 00:57:57,900
bunch of different flavors and then all

1702
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:59,519
of a sudden I get a bunch of this I

1703
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:01,740
might smoke all that before I go back

1704
00:57:59,519 --> 00:58:03,420
into anything else yeah just because I

1705
00:58:01,739 --> 00:58:05,939
really enjoy it I like the taste I like

1706
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:08,460
the way it makes me feel and yeah

1707
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:11,280
yeah I'd say like gas man I don't know

1708
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:13,858
being in San Diego and SoCal for like so

1709
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:15,540
long in the early days was just OG OG so

1710
00:58:13,858 --> 00:58:17,940
did you see cat piss back in the day oh

1711
00:58:15,539 --> 00:58:21,199
yeah yeah so was the cat piss more like

1712
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:24,539
OG gas or was it more like skunk like

1713
00:58:21,199 --> 00:58:27,299
roadkill skunk yeah yeah it's more skunk

1714
00:58:24,539 --> 00:58:30,058
by a little Citrus to it than it was

1715
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:31,800
yeah the other way yeah it's interesting

1716
00:58:30,059 --> 00:58:34,019
yeah I mean there was like the SoCal

1717
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:35,940
there was the NorCal yeah and

1718
00:58:34,019 --> 00:58:38,818
everybody's arguing over what cat piss

1719
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:41,099
is and my my argument is the cat pisses

1720
00:58:38,818 --> 00:58:43,920
a flavor profile and I've seen it come

1721
00:58:41,099 --> 00:58:47,280
up as expressions and stuff A5 for

1722
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:49,440
instance A5 the A5 Haze I don't know

1723
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,420
that one is definitely like it's it's

1724
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,559
similar profile yeah it's yeah I mean

1725
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:55,380
it's cat piss

1726
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:57,298
but it doesn't smoke as pissy and

1727
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:59,519
ammonia it still has like but on the

1728
00:58:57,298 --> 00:59:02,039
nose it is ammonia yeah and that was cat

1729
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:05,099
piss was like skunky ammonia without the

1730
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:08,239
gas it wasn't gas like OG or Kim it was

1731
00:59:05,099 --> 00:59:10,740
like this foul skunky

1732
00:59:08,239 --> 00:59:12,239
ammonia and it would stink up a little

1733
00:59:10,739 --> 00:59:14,399
tenth of a gram would smell the whole

1734
00:59:12,239 --> 00:59:15,959
room up yeah I love those yeah there was

1735
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,298
again a couple guys like closet guys

1736
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:20,639
back in New York when I grew up that had

1737
00:59:18,298 --> 00:59:22,679
like that funk and it was just yeah I

1738
00:59:20,639 --> 00:59:24,420
don't it was like I'd walk into like a

1739
00:59:22,679 --> 00:59:25,739
bar or a crowded room people be like

1740
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:27,720
what the [ __ ] who's smoking weed you

1741
00:59:25,739 --> 00:59:28,739
know and yeah like you just don't you

1742
00:59:27,719 --> 00:59:30,000
don't see that you don't see that

1743
00:59:28,739 --> 00:59:31,500
anymore now well everybody smells like

1744
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,818
weed yeah yeah I guess so maybe we're

1745
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:34,679
all used to it I don't go to the airport

1746
00:59:32,818 --> 00:59:36,058
and I smell weed and I'm like is that me

1747
00:59:34,679 --> 00:59:37,919
and then I realize it's somebody else

1748
00:59:36,059 --> 00:59:39,720
yeah it's so nice to be able to go to

1749
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:42,059
airports and like not have to worry as

1750
00:59:39,719 --> 00:59:44,519
much yeah I don't know everyone at the

1751
00:59:42,059 --> 00:59:46,980
Oakland Airport smells like weeds yeah I

1752
00:59:44,519 --> 00:59:48,239
mean I've seen people yeah go in and out

1753
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:50,159
of there and through TSA and they're

1754
00:59:48,239 --> 00:59:51,779
looking at it this that this bag of weed

1755
00:59:50,159 --> 00:59:53,098
and put it back and send them on their

1756
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:55,140
way you know it's amazing

1757
00:59:53,099 --> 00:59:57,359
so what do you uh see as the future of

1758
00:59:55,139 --> 00:59:58,739
the industry shoot I wish I had the

1759
00:59:57,358 --> 00:59:59,519
crystal ball for that one dude yeah me

1760
00:59:58,739 --> 01:00:01,318
too

1761
00:59:59,519 --> 01:00:03,000
hard to say man I mean we're in like

1762
01:00:01,318 --> 01:00:05,219
survival mode I feel like a lot of the

1763
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:07,199
you know regulated

1764
01:00:05,219 --> 01:00:08,399
folks like ourselves are just trying to

1765
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:09,899
survive

1766
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:12,960
um well you're still here that's a good

1767
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:17,099
sign still here I think 10 years I mean

1768
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:19,798
what's the future uh you know I see just

1769
01:00:17,099 --> 01:00:21,480
an actual you know it was crazy like

1770
01:00:19,798 --> 01:00:22,798
back in the day we were drug dealers and

1771
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:25,920
then it was like a movement we're like

1772
01:00:22,798 --> 01:00:27,838
fighting for just cannabis to be legal

1773
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:29,818
and now it's like

1774
01:00:27,838 --> 01:00:31,318
here and it's legal but it's still in

1775
01:00:29,818 --> 01:00:33,000
its infancy like federal government

1776
01:00:31,318 --> 01:00:34,500
might be doing some rescheduling like

1777
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,420
that just came out which is I don't

1778
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,980
necessarily like it they're scheduling

1779
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:39,599
it to a schedule three well let's

1780
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:41,358
schedule tobacco as a schedule for you

1781
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:43,559
yeah that's my opinion

1782
01:00:41,358 --> 01:00:46,078
I don't want to be in the same category

1783
01:00:43,559 --> 01:00:48,000
as heroin and freaking cocaine so I'm

1784
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:49,559
glad it's moving out of schedule one but

1785
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,659
I agree with this whole scheduling

1786
01:00:49,559 --> 01:00:52,859
things there's it's a little silly for

1787
01:00:51,659 --> 01:00:53,940
cannabis I mean I think if we're gonna

1788
01:00:52,858 --> 01:00:55,798
do that let's go ahead and schedule

1789
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:57,358
tobacco as well yeah I don't think

1790
01:00:55,798 --> 01:00:59,338
that's a good point you know because I

1791
01:00:57,358 --> 01:01:02,460
think tobacco is my opinion is way worse

1792
01:00:59,338 --> 01:01:04,139
for you you know and it doesn't get me

1793
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:05,940
high that's what I'm saying like yeah I

1794
01:01:04,139 --> 01:01:08,578
mean switch the tobacco industry to like

1795
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:11,059
CBD flower you know everybody's gonna be

1796
01:01:08,579 --> 01:01:13,140
mellow and just I don't know

1797
01:01:11,059 --> 01:01:15,359
not getting lung cancer it's an

1798
01:01:13,139 --> 01:01:17,639
expectorant you know so there's there's

1799
01:01:15,358 --> 01:01:19,259
a lot of benefits uh to doing something

1800
01:01:17,639 --> 01:01:20,940
like that yeah it's

1801
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:22,260
unfortunately the tobacco industry

1802
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:24,720
probably has too much money to Lobby

1803
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:27,599
against going on any sort of schedule

1804
01:01:24,719 --> 01:01:29,399
for the DEA right yeah the last podcast

1805
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:30,298
I did we talked actually the one that's

1806
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:32,099
airing

1807
01:01:30,298 --> 01:01:34,019
when Heston we were talking about the

1808
01:01:32,099 --> 01:01:35,160
lobbyists yeah and you know

1809
01:01:34,019 --> 01:01:37,259
unfortunately there's not a lot of

1810
01:01:35,159 --> 01:01:40,519
lobbyists for the home Growers yeah the

1811
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:40,520
small Guys small companies

1812
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:46,559
exactly yeah and whether they're evil or

1813
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:47,700
not I'm not going to speak to that but a

1814
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:50,579
lot of them I don't think have the best

1815
01:01:47,699 --> 01:01:52,618
intentions no I don't know if it's like

1816
01:01:50,579 --> 01:01:54,720
it's it's not a

1817
01:01:52,619 --> 01:01:56,099
good and evil thing for them it's just

1818
01:01:54,719 --> 01:01:57,480
money they're looking at the money and

1819
01:01:56,099 --> 01:01:58,619
you know we can look at it as good and

1820
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,940
evil or whatever and they're just

1821
01:01:58,619 --> 01:02:01,500
worried about the bottom line like how

1822
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:02,818
can we make the most out of money that's

1823
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:04,440
not always the best approaching business

1824
01:02:02,818 --> 01:02:05,880
people do [ __ ] up [ __ ] to make the

1825
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:07,740
most amount of money so yeah when you

1826
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:10,858
start focusing on money you're willing

1827
01:02:07,739 --> 01:02:12,779
to sacrifice things like to make your

1828
01:02:10,858 --> 01:02:15,480
product quality right and like you know

1829
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:16,920
it can go in any extreme and consumer

1830
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:19,318
safety you know what I mean like you

1831
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:21,059
sacrifice that or knowingly spray

1832
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:22,558
something with a pesticide you know it

1833
01:02:21,059 --> 01:02:23,519
was cancer-causing but you're still

1834
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:25,260
going to put it on your product anyway

1835
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:27,960
because it's cheaper totally yeah so

1836
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:29,640
like that side of it's not great but no

1837
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:31,980
it's it's not great but there's always

1838
01:02:29,639 --> 01:02:34,259
the thing is is I feel like the truth

1839
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:36,358
comes out with that kind of stuff the

1840
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:38,579
truth comes out so at the end of the day

1841
01:02:36,358 --> 01:02:40,019
people start recognizing the good brands

1842
01:02:38,579 --> 01:02:41,640
and what they're doing and the efforts

1843
01:02:40,019 --> 01:02:42,900
they're making towards it you get a

1844
01:02:41,639 --> 01:02:45,719
following and that builds up over time

1845
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:48,059
that it takes years to build a brand

1846
01:02:45,719 --> 01:02:50,939
properly for people that think they're

1847
01:02:48,059 --> 01:02:53,160
just going to start cultivating and open

1848
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:54,480
an extract company or a seed company and

1849
01:02:53,159 --> 01:02:57,480
just right off the gate it takes years

1850
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:59,159
to really do it right exactly exactly

1851
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:02,059
yeah a lot of these guys are just big

1852
01:02:59,159 --> 01:03:04,379
msos open up you know whatever

1853
01:03:02,059 --> 01:03:05,880
thousand square foot indoor facilities

1854
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:07,140
all around the country and yeah it's

1855
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:09,660
nothing good coming out of there because

1856
01:03:07,139 --> 01:03:12,259
no it's not easy to do man it's not easy

1857
01:03:09,659 --> 01:03:15,179
it's way better to start off small

1858
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:16,500
and do it right yeah so yeah as far as

1859
01:03:15,179 --> 01:03:18,618
the future of the industry you know I

1860
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:22,139
mean I think it's going to become

1861
01:03:18,619 --> 01:03:23,640
more normalized I think you know you're

1862
01:03:22,139 --> 01:03:26,098
going to be able to go to

1863
01:03:23,639 --> 01:03:27,539
hotels and you know on the little mini

1864
01:03:26,099 --> 01:03:29,160
bar menu you're gonna have your spliff

1865
01:03:27,539 --> 01:03:31,858
too and I think there's going to be just

1866
01:03:29,159 --> 01:03:33,598
more access I mean will 7-Eleven be

1867
01:03:31,858 --> 01:03:36,598
selling joints at some point probably In

1868
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:39,298
Our Lifetime you know so I hope yeah so

1869
01:03:36,599 --> 01:03:41,818
you know and there'll be craft scenes in

1870
01:03:39,298 --> 01:03:43,739
different types of events and tastings

1871
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:45,900
and stuff like that so I think I'm

1872
01:03:43,739 --> 01:03:47,578
excited for that side of it and like it

1873
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:49,740
to normalize and people to consume more

1874
01:03:47,579 --> 01:03:51,839
cannabis like I think is obviously going

1875
01:03:49,739 --> 01:03:54,659
to be great for the world but right you

1876
01:03:51,838 --> 01:03:56,699
know just surviving and you know making

1877
01:03:54,659 --> 01:03:58,318
sure the industry stays somewhat has

1878
01:03:56,699 --> 01:04:00,598
some integrity at the end of the day I

1879
01:03:58,318 --> 01:04:03,119
think is going to be important and kind

1880
01:04:00,599 --> 01:04:05,940
of like uh keeps me going you know right

1881
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:09,119
so if you were to give yourself one

1882
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:10,858
piece of advice back when you started

1883
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:12,000
looking back at yourself that you know

1884
01:04:10,858 --> 01:04:13,440
you've been in the industry one or two

1885
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,400
years what what advice would you give

1886
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:16,019
yourself

1887
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,280
um

1888
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:21,199
man

1889
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:21,200
a lot of lessons learned I guess

1890
01:04:22,039 --> 01:04:25,579
I would say just

1891
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:32,099
go for go bigger man like don't be

1892
01:04:29,639 --> 01:04:34,078
scared to

1893
01:04:32,099 --> 01:04:36,539
kind of step out you know especially

1894
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:38,400
back in the day it was like stick and

1895
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:40,619
move a little bit you know and just kind

1896
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:42,240
of like we're scared to really go

1897
01:04:40,619 --> 01:04:44,460
forward a really brand your product and

1898
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:46,500
stuff like that but seeing other people

1899
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:48,659
that have come out with like

1900
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:51,480
interesting branding and just kind of

1901
01:04:48,659 --> 01:04:52,980
like going for you know getting their

1902
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:54,539
stuff out there more you know like

1903
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:55,980
exactly what you guys are doing a lot of

1904
01:04:54,539 --> 01:04:58,199
these genetics guys and things like that

1905
01:04:55,980 --> 01:05:00,900
like the seeds guys have been doing it

1906
01:04:58,199 --> 01:05:02,460
for a long time and pushing cannabis out

1907
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:04,079
into the world and I think like going

1908
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:06,659
back I just push more cannabis out into

1909
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:07,859
the world yeah you know yeah it's a good

1910
01:05:06,659 --> 01:05:09,239
thing I think it makes the world a

1911
01:05:07,858 --> 01:05:11,759
better place yeah I think we all do

1912
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:13,078
that's why we're here yeah but um yeah I

1913
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:14,880
remember getting seed packs like way

1914
01:05:13,079 --> 01:05:16,680
back when and it was all sketchy and you

1915
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:18,119
had to you know dude send it to

1916
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:19,440
somebody's house and this and that but

1917
01:05:18,119 --> 01:05:21,358
you know like they've been doing it

1918
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:24,000
forever and just like pushing it out and

1919
01:05:21,358 --> 01:05:26,219
Yeah I think that's what I'd do more of

1920
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:29,159
right yeah yeah it's been an interesting

1921
01:05:26,219 --> 01:05:33,539
process from where we were you know I

1922
01:05:29,159 --> 01:05:35,519
was born in 78 or 77 so from 77 even

1923
01:05:33,539 --> 01:05:38,099
now it's pretty wild the Cannabis

1924
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:40,980
industry and still relatively new and

1925
01:05:38,099 --> 01:05:42,359
yeah it's young dude yeah we're talking

1926
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:43,740
about I don't know who's talking about a

1927
01:05:42,358 --> 01:05:46,199
bit like Pro a bit comparing it to

1928
01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:48,419
Prohibition of alcohol back in the day

1929
01:05:46,199 --> 01:05:50,639
to now so different it's different dude

1930
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:52,260
it's like there's way more regulation

1931
01:05:50,639 --> 01:05:53,460
there's you know all these govern you

1932
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:56,040
know there was no OSHA and [ __ ] like

1933
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:57,838
that back then four big there's four big

1934
01:05:56,039 --> 01:06:00,960
companies out of prohibition that were

1935
01:05:57,838 --> 01:06:03,358
allowed to brew beer it was the big four

1936
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:05,579
yeah and they're still here yeah and

1937
01:06:03,358 --> 01:06:08,519
they're still here yeah exactly but it

1938
01:06:05,579 --> 01:06:10,619
wasn't until the 70s and yeah until we

1939
01:06:08,519 --> 01:06:12,059
had these microbrews coming online yeah

1940
01:06:10,619 --> 01:06:14,338
yeah

1941
01:06:12,059 --> 01:06:16,559
so that's a whole nother podcast yeah

1942
01:06:14,338 --> 01:06:18,480
totally yeah it's uh yeah it's a lot so

1943
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:20,339
yeah I mean I think

1944
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:22,559
it's come a long way it's hard to really

1945
01:06:20,338 --> 01:06:25,558
know what the future holds but you know

1946
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:28,260
and eventually just like trying to make

1947
01:06:25,559 --> 01:06:29,819
good product and put it out there to the

1948
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:31,619
people I think is the best thing we can

1949
01:06:29,818 --> 01:06:33,239
do totally

1950
01:06:31,619 --> 01:06:35,338
well man it was really great having you

1951
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:36,919
on the podcast today if somebody has a

1952
01:06:35,338 --> 01:06:39,239
question on where they can find you guys

1953
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:41,159
uh how can they get in touch with you

1954
01:06:39,239 --> 01:06:42,838
guys where can they find you dispensary

1955
01:06:41,159 --> 01:06:45,000

1956
01:06:42,838 --> 01:06:46,199
um you know I couldn't say we're in a

1957
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,599
good amount of dispensaries in

1958
01:06:46,199 --> 01:06:51,239
California we're in New York we're in

1959
01:06:48,599 --> 01:06:54,059
Colorado we're likely going to be in New

1960
01:06:51,239 --> 01:06:55,558
Jersey by the end of the year MSO yeah I

1961
01:06:54,059 --> 01:06:58,440
guess so small I mean I don't know if

1962
01:06:55,559 --> 01:07:00,240
like we are that but you know we're ours

1963
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:02,099
well you're in multiple States so you

1964
01:07:00,239 --> 01:07:04,858
are technically in MSL but you're a good

1965
01:07:02,099 --> 01:07:06,599
Ms yeah totally yeah so yeah but yeah

1966
01:07:04,858 --> 01:07:09,058

1967
01:07:06,599 --> 01:07:10,920
very like heavy touch we're there we're

1968
01:07:09,059 --> 01:07:13,260
producing it in those markets you know

1969
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:15,960
with partners and stuff like that so

1970
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:17,339
it's a hard thing it's not like a gummy

1971
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:19,740
where you just give somebody a recipe

1972
01:07:17,338 --> 01:07:21,298
and here you go here's my recipe sugar

1973

1974
01:07:21,298 --> 01:07:24,420
little bit of cannabis and here's my

1975
01:07:22,858 --> 01:07:25,500
product so right especially with

1976

solventless and stuff like that it's

1977
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:28,500
real Hands-On so it's fun being in those

1978
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:30,298
markets

1979
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:32,280

1987
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:47,220
