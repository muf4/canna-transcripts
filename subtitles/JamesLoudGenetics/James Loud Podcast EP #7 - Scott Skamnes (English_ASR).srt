00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,359
that's why we're here today yeah yeah we

18
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:50,899
met originally at the black sheep boot

19
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:53,640
camp I think five years ago almost now

20
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:54,660
uh we we did some events where you were

21
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,000
talking about soil and I was talking

22
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:58,619
about genetics and uh a lot of fun

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,939
there's some there was a good group of

24
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:01,439
people I mean we had some of the top

seen one of the episodes so tell us a

43
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:40,438

uh keeping in touch you know you and I

45

46
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:46,859
client that needs seeds you're pretty

47
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,020
much the only person that I go to and uh

48
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:50,459
so we talk here and there and keep up on

49
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:52,019
the industry stuff and I've been

50
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:54,298
watching some of your episodes and

51
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:56,219
trying to keep track of them all and you

52
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:59,220
just had Chris Castle on who's a living

53
00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:00,599
Soul grower in Northern California and I

54
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:02,700
kind of remember exactly what you said

55
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:04,798
but in the first few minutes you're

56
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,899
talking about how you've seen some

57
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,379
significant obstacles with living soil

58
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:12,780
at scale and maybe even haven't seen a

59
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:15,539
real solid example of successful living

60
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:18,300
soil which I would agree with there's a

61
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:21,239
lot of uh well obstacles I guess you

62
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,459
could say to doing living soil scale and

63
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:25,259
to be honest most people haven't figured

64
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:28,979
it out really and most people haven't

65
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:31,139
seen really solid examples of successful

66
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:33,359
living soil and you know I like to pride

67
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:36,719
myself on that the Consulting that my

68
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,300
wife and I do are is directing some of

69
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:41,340
those um very successful examples that

70
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,840
you might know and what's really

71
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,959
interesting about living soil and I

72
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:48,239
guess really any Market is is that those

73
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:49,680
that are working in extremely

74
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,280
competitive environments they don't

75
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,840
exactly produce a Manifesto and a how-to

76
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,419
of what they're doing to be successful

77
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,700
and especially now in these early years

78
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:01,619
of regulated cannabis there's not a lot

79
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:03,959
of people that are actually just telling

80
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,959
you exactly what they're doing so that's

81
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:09,780
leading to a lot of Confusion And I

82
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,400
think there's the added complexity of as

83
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,959
if you're having a conversation with a

84
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,158
hydroponic Farm they just say I'm doing

85
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,378
rock wool and that's pretty

86
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:18,479
straightforward you can expect a tray

87
00:03:16,378 --> 00:03:19,919
table with Rockwell cubes if you're

88
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:23,098
doing undercurrent you say you're doing

89
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:25,738
undercurrent right and but if somebody's

90
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:27,299
in soil using bags of grow more and

91
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,939
spraying Eagle 20 they're calling it

92
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,980
living soil so there's people that are

93
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:34,378
taking a lot of liberties with the word

94
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:35,280
living Soul right now and I think I

95
00:03:34,378 --> 00:03:38,579
think that's part of the problem

96
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,318
actually so you know living soil is

97
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,700
becoming a popular buzzword and so

98
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:43,560
people are trying to jump on that train

99
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:46,259
which I think leads to some of the

100
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,060
confusion yeah 100 agreed I mean there's

101
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,679
a lot of stuff out there that I I will

102
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,019
tell you right now it is not living soil

103
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,000
and if it is I I don't know what to tell

104
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:55,799
you yeah yeah and I'm definitely a

105
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,598
believer in living soil and you know I

106
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:59,879
come from a really qualified hydroponic

107
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:01,798
background one of my main mentors was a

108
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:03,539
guy named Randall

109
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:05,760
um and he built a facility called

110
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:07,620
candescent and regardless of how you

111
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,598
feel about candescent or what they did

112
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,219
they were the first to have the most

113
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:13,500
flour on the Shelf in the entire State

114
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:14,938
of California which is most people's

115
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,238
goal they're trying to dominate those

116
00:04:14,938 --> 00:04:20,459
markets and so you know I I came up in

117
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,978
what I would assume is a similar type

118
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:24,660
and quality of hydroponic culture and

119
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:27,060
success of what you were doing the Bay

120
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,919
Area and just most of my connections

121
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,139
were in SoCal so it was all hydroponic

122
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:34,799
like I didn't read any I didn't meet any

123
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:38,280
real uh NorCal organic people until like

124
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,680
2014 2015 and um

125
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:42,299
you know the organic people that I met

126
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,400
growing up there's only like two dudes

127
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,439
the entire time that I met the dude

128
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,719
Organics and it was it was for the

129
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:50,759
passion it was for the Hobby and they

130
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,120
definitely were not paying the bills so

131
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:56,460
in my you know Inner Circle and culture

132
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,899
of Hydroponics that I came up in you

133
00:04:56,459 --> 00:05:00,000
know we were plain and simple we were

134
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:02,159
making fun of those guys and so when I

135
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,680
found Dr Elaine and started getting into

136
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,080
living so I started becoming one of

137
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,879
those guys they made fun of and you know

138
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:10,978
I I get it there there was successful

139
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:12,478
Organics going on in other regions I

140
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:14,159
just was not in those regions so I

141
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,800
didn't see it and you know I didn't get

142
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:20,100
into my first Northern California

143
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:21,780
organic farm until like 2014 2015 and

144
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:24,539
that was the first time I ever saw like

145
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:27,179
truly really legit you know Organics

146
00:05:24,538 --> 00:05:28,860
doing well and paying the bills well

147
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,660
some of those hobby guys still grow some

148
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,038
of the best stuff you know but it's in

149
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,560
such small batches you know and it's

150
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:37,139
like so much easier to control your

151
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,000
inputs and everything else if you're

152
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:40,860
going in a small environment a small

153
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,959
batch so

154
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,419
which is what most people learn when

155
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,739
they go to scale in general and that's a

156
00:05:45,418 --> 00:05:49,500
lot that's where a lot of our services

157
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,840
come in handy and we started guiding

158
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,000
commercial Farms back in 2014 started

159
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:56,159
getting into the Colorado markets in

160
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,079
2016. you know I come from an

161
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,419
agricultural family so in those earlier

162
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,698
years of cannabis Growers getting the

163
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:05,639
first opportunity to do large scales or

164
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:07,680
even outdoor open acreages you know

165
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:09,300
comparatively I had a lot of scale

166
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,038
experience because I grew up in a

167
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,199
produce brokerage office I grew up

168
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,939
around Farmers that were doing hundreds

169
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,680
or thousands of Acres

170
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:18,839
and I guess you could say that that was

171
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,759
a lot of experience for the time so

172
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:22,679
combining that with my cannabis

173
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:24,360
experience and what we knew from other

174
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,660
hydroponic techniques I was able to

175
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:30,479
provide analytics and assistance to

176
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:34,080
those to those farmers at that time but

177
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:36,360
but basically what my mindset was is you

178
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:38,639
know if I saw a guy take a Bubba Kush

179
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,319
variety or OG or whatever it was and you

180
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,478
put it in an undercurrent system and you

181
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,340
got a certain result and if he put it

182
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:46,620
into a Rockwell system and got a certain

183
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:48,719
result if we weren't getting those same

184
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,160
results in Organics I personally believe

185
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,560
that it was something that we were doing

186
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,419
as a cultivator that was limiting the

187
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,879
genetic potential of that plant because

188
00:06:54,418 --> 00:06:59,879
clearly that plant had a certain genetic

189
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:03,180
potential to do something in different

190
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:06,779
systems like current culture or excuse

191
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:08,400
me under current uh you know dwc

192
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:09,779
I'm not trying to name anybody by name

193
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:12,060
sorry about that

194
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:15,000
um but I basically became obsessed with

195
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:18,120
why is this organic system growing

196
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,220
slower producing less when the same

197
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,620
exact variety could go into another

198
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:25,440
system and significantly out produce

199
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:28,620
those results so I just became basically

200
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:31,740
obsessed with what were the conditions

201
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:34,259
that led to a fast-growing plant as

202
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:36,418
translated to soil-based organic systems

203
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:39,360
well and there's so many other things

204
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:40,918
like pathogens like hot plate and Vera

205
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,199
do you know I think operate virid is the

206
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:45,060
big topic right now and you you have

207
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,978
living soil beds and you get up late and

208
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,360
veroid in your your soil bed I mean

209
00:07:46,978 --> 00:07:51,180
you're pretty [ __ ]

210
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:54,479
well I mean I would actually disagree

211
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:56,340
because that that's where living soil

212
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:57,959
gives its greatest advantage in the

213
00:07:56,339 --> 00:07:59,758
regulated market because you bring in

214
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:02,818
these functions of nature that humans

215
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,680
can't just do right so

216
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:06,900
um one of the main advantages of living

217
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,120
soil is that these biological creatures

218
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:11,459
do all these magical things for us when

219
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,098
we put them into the right situation and

220
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:16,098
conditions so what we learned from Dr

221
00:08:14,098 --> 00:08:19,319
Lane Ingham is that

222
00:08:16,098 --> 00:08:22,199
when the plant has proper nutritional

223
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:23,759
balance and high biological activity all

224
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:26,160
these other different biological

225
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,840
functions are able to be performed and

226
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,840
problems are able to be dealt with that

227
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:32,278
you don't get in a hydroponic system so

228
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:34,259
one of the interesting things about

229
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:37,259
living soil is if you get to a certain

230
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:39,360
point of biological activity and ratios

231
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:42,418
between bacteria and things that eat

232
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,278
bacteria and beneficial fungi is that

233
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:48,600
the plant has the ability to actually

234
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:49,860
quarantine off the virus material and

235
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,620
sometimes what it does is it'll make

236
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,600
like a callus so if the the branch is

237
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:56,339
coming up or whatever that virus

238
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,019
material will get calloused off and make

239
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:59,580
like a weird knuckle halfway up the

240
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:02,759
branch and then typically everything

241
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:05,759
above that tends to be clean of

242
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:08,580
uh the different virus material and

243
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:10,019
sometimes it will then coordinate off to

244
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,180
an entire Branch so a lot of times

245
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:14,159
you'll see a plant that looks pretty

246
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:16,620
healthy but then one branch will just

247
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:19,379
look all dudded and shiny or you know

248
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,480
variegated or whatever it is and you

249
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:23,159
know I I personally believe based on my

250
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,080
observation of working with literally

251
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:29,519
millions of square feet of regulated and

252
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:33,120
unregulated cannabis is that as our IPM

253
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,860
choices went up in frequency so did the

254
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,600
virus material as well and so back in

255
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,300
the older days we'd make one light

256
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,278
application of Eagle 20. I'm not saying

257
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:44,219
it was kosher or healthy or tasty or

258
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:46,080
even past testing now but people were

259
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,639
doing like one single application for

260
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,940
powdered mildew now people are

261
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:55,860
absolutely bombarding the plants with

262
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:57,779
citric acids uh oils and rubbing

263
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:00,000
alcohol-based pesticides over and over

264
00:09:57,778 --> 00:10:02,879
and over and over and so as somebody

265
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,980
that creates monitors and provides

266
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:08,100
analytics to the Cannabis space I can

267
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:11,759
tell you very clearly the overlapping of

268
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:13,560
of Trends or you know dead on right so I

269
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:15,600
think most of this virus material is

270
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:17,879
because of our choices in this

271
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,220
repetitive over and over applications of

272
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:22,559
IPM which in living soil you can't

273
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:25,259
really do that so in order to get these

274
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:27,659
high biological populations in order to

275
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:30,419
have the plant clean out its own virus

276
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:34,919
material you also can't be spraying IPM

277
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:37,559
products right so it it's I think all

278
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:39,899
this virus boogeyman is mostly due to

279
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:41,579
our current set of behaviors and

280
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:44,159
cultural practices within the Cannabis

281
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:46,259
space which weren't going on in Prior

282
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:48,600
times when this virus is not around so

283
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:51,360
so with hoplite I mean what I've seen is

284
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,220
there's there's guys that have it and

285
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,959
they they deal with it and it's not a

286
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,540
big deal they'll pull out like the the

287
00:10:54,958 --> 00:11:00,299
dotted branches and not just hop late

288
00:10:57,539 --> 00:11:02,159
and we're talking about like pythium and

289
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:04,078
you know there's so many different

290
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:05,639
things there's some so many different

291
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:07,559
pathogens I mean and there's there's

292
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:08,458
some that you know they don't do a lot

293
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:10,739
and there's some that definitely

294
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:12,539
copulating that is definitely affecting

295
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,740
people but I see some Grows Where guys

296
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:15,778
have it and it doesn't really affect

297
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,940
them or it affects branches and then

298
00:11:15,778 --> 00:11:20,820
they give clones to another guy and then

299
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:24,060
it just decimates the whole facility

300
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:25,440
yeah yeah so so I would argue again that

301
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:27,838
that there's still an underlying

302
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,880
nutritional issue so with the cultivator

303
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,220
that only has a branch here and there

304
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:35,838
that's being affected I would say that's

305
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:37,800
the hydroponic nutritional

306
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,720
manifestation of what I was just

307
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:42,719
describing from a biological standpoint

308
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,899
so if you're if your mineral chemistry

309
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,000
is on with your feeding strategy you can

310
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:49,740
through mineral nutrition allow the

311
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,720
plant to do the same type of virus

312
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,639
cleaning of its of its plant material

313
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,440
and that would be the guy that has just

314
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:57,480
one branch kind of Go Daddy and you cut

315
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,579
it off and they're not that affected by

316
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,740
it but if you've got somebody that their

317
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:05,519
entire crop gets decimated by the

318
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:07,560
viruses I bet you paychecks that if you

319
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,299
analyze their Reservoir it's all out of

320
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:11,518
whack right so probably way too high in

321
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:14,039
nitrogen not near the amount of calcium

322
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,360
and probably way too much potassium so

323
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:18,360
kind of what's happened just through

324
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,820
experiential evidence or observational

325
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,519
science which I think Legacy cannabis

326
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:25,440
Growers are experts in making a way

327
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,879
without data and analytics you know they

328
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,700
just started tweaking the recipes until

329
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:32,578
it worked right and and I think what

330
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,980
kind of ended up is long story short you

331
00:12:32,578 --> 00:12:37,139
end up with low levels of calcium high

332
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:40,200
levels of potassium and phosphorus which

333
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:43,019
leads to a more stable substrate so that

334
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:45,180
as you're not managing water content of

335
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:46,919
that root Zone you still get stability

336
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:50,099
of the nutrients and you don't get an

337
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:53,159
uneven stacking as they would say which

338
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:56,100
creates maybe short spindly plants low

339
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:59,159
yields or handy buggy problems so that's

340
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,540
why crop steering is so influential

341
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:03,240
right now because yeah the yield

342
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:05,578
increases significant when you start to

343
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,440
actually manage the water content in

344
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:09,419
that substrate properly to be able to

345
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,420
stack those nutrients in a way that's

346
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:13,679
productive right so under that type of

347
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:16,500
water chemistry when you're running

348
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:18,659
significantly deficient calcium high

349
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,458
levels of phosphorus and potassium and

350
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:22,620
all these nitrogen usually

351
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:24,599
you will get the yield you will get the

352
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:27,120
bag appeal you will get the potency and

353
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,639
the quality but there's typically going

354
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,799
to be some sort of susceptibility

355
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:33,539
depending on the variety and context I

356
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:35,819
guess if your environment's good or not

357
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:38,338
good you tend to get either powdery

358
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:40,379
mildew or Mite issues and then how we

359
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:43,500
start to control those might and mildew

360
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:45,480
issues I believe is where this

361
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,578
virus material started to come in

362
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,680
because

363
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:52,078
um most of the Consulting that we do

364
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:54,719
splits into two basic groups those that

365
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:56,159
just had catastrophic crop loss in the

366
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,500
regulated market that are trying to find

367
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:00,299
a way around it or those that are doing

368
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,639
quite well and are trying to find Peak

369
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:03,958
Performance so we don't really work with

370
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,159
a lot of like Middle Ground we're

371
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:08,159
working with

372
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:10,259
after everything went to hell or those

373
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:12,778
that are respected doing quite well and

374
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:15,059
they're trying to get an extra Edge and

375
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:17,458
in that Journey we've done a tremendous

376
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:20,399
amount of analytics of

377
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:22,439
I guess we say problems that arise and

378
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,299
then we then the first thing that I do

379
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,519
is start taking the data points so

380
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:29,939
analyze the reservoir check out the

381
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:31,560
environment things like that and these

382
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:34,079
very consistent patterns reveal

383
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:36,958
themselves when virus material is more

384
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:40,319
common I guess we could say

385
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:42,599
but the but the reason why I'm such a

386
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,879
fan of living soil is that nature has a

387
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,040
solution for these things and that's

388
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:49,259
you know kind of hard to wrap your mind

389
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,778
around but what we see experientially is

390
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:54,000
if you take a plant with high levels of

391
00:14:51,778 --> 00:14:56,039
virus material in it and you put it into

392
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,958
a properly balanced soil from a

393
00:14:56,039 --> 00:15:01,019
chemistry standpoint and then you get

394
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:03,179
the biological activity up to and above

395
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:05,940
the minimum thresholds defined by Dr

396
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:08,698
Lane's work the plant now has other

397
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:10,500
abilities to deal with problems so if

398
00:15:08,698 --> 00:15:12,240
there is virus material in that plant it

399
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,458
either shuttles it to one branch and

400
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,799
then that Branch looks like [ __ ] or

401
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:18,359
it'll form like a callus around a

402
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:21,778
certain point and everything above it

403
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:23,820
grows clean so I would I would assume

404
00:15:21,778 --> 00:15:25,500
that those people in your network that

405
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,540
you know that the viruses aren't a

406
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:30,778
problem are likely running more ideally

407
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:32,159
balanced nutrient Solutions and you can

408
00:15:30,778 --> 00:15:34,559
also do this from a nutritional

409
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:35,879
management standpoint you just have to

410
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:38,338
be dialed in on your nutritional

411
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:39,778
management if you're not dialed in on

412
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:42,300
your nutritional management and you're

413
00:15:39,778 --> 00:15:43,679
running deficient in calcium or what I

414
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:45,659
would Define as deficient in calcium

415
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:48,599
high in nitrogen phosphorus and

416
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:50,759
potassium those plants from a from a

417
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,639
mechanism of nutrition are going to be

418
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:55,259
more susceptible to that virus material

419
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:58,079
decimating I think that's why that

420
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:59,759
happens no no I would say the data we've

421
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:01,739
observed shows that's really why it's

422
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,319
happening so I believe that you

423
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:08,399
absolutely can clean up virus material

424
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,320
through hydroponic means I think just

425
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,639
um

426
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,560
industry-wide by and large most people

427
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:15,959
aren't

428
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:18,599
um will say specifically analyzing what

429
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:20,879
they're feeding you know to to know what

430
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,199
these targets and ratios are I think a

431
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:25,019
lot of people just get really good at

432
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:26,458
running a brand so to speak like within

433
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:28,019
reasonable ranges

434
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:30,419
but then from Harvest to harvest

435
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:32,639
sometimes there's fluctuation and those

436
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:34,319
fluctuation and results are I would I

437
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,600
would say is coming from a fluctuation

438
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,420
in the products you're using

439
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,159
but most people aren't doing

440
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:42,360
you know most people aren't analyzing

441
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:46,078
their fertilization basically

442
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,820
interesting yeah yeah pretty crazy let's

443
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:51,719
talk about aggressive soil what you guys

444
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:53,940
do you and Sarah are uh you know pretty

445
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,278
booked up and you have a group as well

446
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:58,620
of people that you work with

447
00:16:56,278 --> 00:17:01,620
yeah we we do we've we've worked with

448
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:03,120
quite an interesting mix of people along

449
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,578
the way like I said I come from a

450
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,919
hydroponic World I'll still periodically

451
00:17:05,578 --> 00:17:09,779
pick up hydroponic Farms not very often

452
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,059
anymore I'm really selective at this

453
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:14,399
point but to me I just want to see

454
00:17:12,058 --> 00:17:16,619
anybody that's been doing it stay in it

455
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,179
and so along the way I've been able to

456
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:20,879
help some pretty well respected

457
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:23,280
hydroponic names uh mostly from like

458
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,959
procedural standpoints so you can take

459
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:26,879
somebody that was world famous in the

460
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,580
Legacy markets they're still new to the

461
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,740
regulated process right so one of the

462
00:17:29,579 --> 00:17:34,319
main ways I help some of the you know

463
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:36,298
salt-based Farmers is just managing the

464
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:38,579
regulated aspect and you know keeping

465
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:40,798
from test fails uh we also help people

466
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:43,699
with analytics of what they're feeding

467
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:47,099
or fertilizing in the living soil world

468
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:50,038
you know I'd like to think that we were

469
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:52,619
a major influential part in one of the

470
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:54,119
reasons why it's popular because my wife

471
00:17:52,619 --> 00:17:57,000
and I were the first people to put the

472
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:58,859
analytics to the process so what's

473
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,599
interesting is like I said I come from a

474
00:17:58,859 --> 00:18:02,459
very data driven

475
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:04,439
you know kind of almost militant

476
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,940
hydroponic culture you know that was

477
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,160
very strict in their behavior and

478
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,538
dealings and and how they did things and

479
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,400
then when I got into Organics everybody

480
00:18:09,538 --> 00:18:15,298
wants to be like

481
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:17,340
you know and that's just that just ain't

482
00:18:15,298 --> 00:18:20,339
good for me and and

483
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:22,019
um you know in in the hydroponic World

484
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:23,879
there there are data and analytics that

485
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:26,519
you can do you can measure your

486
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,500
environment you can manage VPD you can

487
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:31,139
if you have the tools available measure

488
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:33,900
the water content of your substrate and

489
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:36,120
in Organics when I started to follow Dr

490
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:37,798
Lane and take her courses and and you

491
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:40,139
know I met nobody

492
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:43,200
really for years it was doing any level

493
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:44,640
of analytics you'd meet the random

494
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,700
person here or there that would do the

495
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:50,280
occasional soil chemistry analysis and

496
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,538
that you know basically I'm an obsessor

497
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:53,639
I'll stay up all night thinking about

498
00:18:51,538 --> 00:18:56,519
stuff and

499
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:58,559
by taking data points it allowed me to

500
00:18:56,519 --> 00:19:00,538
sleep at night and so that was basically

501
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:02,339
what we offered to the organic

502
00:19:00,538 --> 00:19:05,700
cultivators in the regulated space was

503
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:07,798
we would come into a legal facility that

504
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,840
either recently had a problem or was

505
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:11,700
afraid of having a problem and we'd take

506
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:14,399
a bunch of soil chemistry we do a lot of

507
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,140
biological assessment organize that into

508
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,298
some sort of

509
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:20,340
digestible format and then present it to

510
00:19:18,298 --> 00:19:22,980
the farmers so that they could act on

511
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:25,918
that and in the case of living soil if

512
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:27,839
you start doing a biological assessment

513
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,419
of your facility either from corner to

514
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:33,779
corner or rows or whatever it starts to

515
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:36,960
reveal a picture of where the problems

516
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:40,019
are starting from basically and from our

517
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:43,079
Viewpoint we've done so many of these

518
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:45,418
um analysis of farms of all size there's

519
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:48,058
some very clear patterns from my

520
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:51,000
standpoint so basically what we do is

521
00:19:48,058 --> 00:19:53,759
try to direct the farm through data

522
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,679
to change their procedural

523
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:57,660
what we would call cultural practices so

524
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,780
how they water how they dispense

525
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:02,880
nutrients how they do teas or don't do

526
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:06,000
teas or what have you and try to

527
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,700
streamline that into a process or

528
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,740
package that leads to desirable numbers

529
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:13,740
on these various tests and once you do

530
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:16,620
that in living soil most of if not all

531
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:18,120
the problems go away which I realize is

532
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:20,159
a pretty bold statement but that's

533
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:22,079
really the truth of it if you're if

534
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,298
you're doing a microscope assessment of

535
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:26,339
your soil and managing Behavior based on

536
00:20:24,298 --> 00:20:27,538
those results powdery mildew is the

537
00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:30,418
easiest thing to remove from your

538
00:20:27,538 --> 00:20:32,879
facility it's a pretty clear percentage

539
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:34,919
and the ratio between what we call oh my

540
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,500
seats and what we would categorize as

541
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:39,179
benefit beneficial fungi so if you

542
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,640
manage your watering manage your

543
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:43,740
techniques to reduce those levels then

544
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,538
powdery mildew is not really a thing

545
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:49,279
which I know is a pretty bold statement

546
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:51,960
but that's how it goes so even VPD even

547
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:54,240
VPD is like so so going from like the

548
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,919
Legacy Market as a legacy grower and all

549
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,620
of a sudden you're approach with these

550
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,940
GPD numbers I think for for a lot of us

551
00:20:58,619 --> 00:21:01,979
that have been growing for 30 years you

552
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:04,380
always had your humidity below 50

553
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:06,240
percent which is almost the exact

554
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:08,400
opposite of what you want to do if

555
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,140
you're cultivating correctly but it's a

556
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,298
scary thing you know

557
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:14,160
it's terrifying to most people yeah

558
00:21:12,298 --> 00:21:16,558
having high humidity because we

559
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,779
associate powder milk with high humidity

560
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:20,759
which is a reasonable concern you know

561
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:22,859
and

562
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:26,220
um the first time I ever saw the VPD of

563
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:28,379
con VPD as a concept was one of the guys

564
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,940
that I would Define as my mentors was a

565
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,980
pretty solid grower and he had some

566
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,419
equipment fail and they were you know

567
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:36,480
Bubba Kush

568
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:38,220
60 degree room I mean they were sub

569
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,839
cooling the [ __ ] out of their buildings

570
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:41,279
and

571
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:43,139
um some of his equipment broke and all

572
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:45,839
of a sudden he was like mid 80s and high

573
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:47,400
humidity and at towards the end of

574
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:48,839
harvest he like brought us into this

575
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,538
room he's like you guys check this out

576
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:53,279
and that was the biggest nugs any of us

577
00:21:51,538 --> 00:21:55,619
have ever seen were like what are you

578
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:57,980
doing in here he's like I don't know the

579
00:21:55,619 --> 00:22:00,839
equipment broke and I just went with it

580
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:03,000
it just kind of like through the hand of

581
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:04,798
God put him into like the VP dark you

582
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,380
know the green on the chart or whatever

583
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:09,418
I don't know and that was mind-blowing

584
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:11,640
to me because that entire

585
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:14,100
group there was you know like I said

586
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,900
they were growing Bubba cushions and you

587
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:18,178
know trying to get it to 60 or whatever

588
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:21,780
they were doing and to walk into a room

589
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:23,340
that was like 83 degrees 80 humidity

590
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:25,798
we were just mind-blown that it was

591
00:22:23,339 --> 00:22:27,959
still working I I think we can attribute

592
00:22:25,798 --> 00:22:30,720
some of the increases in yields to

593
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:32,700
actual VPD adjustments I mean I would

594
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,038
say that that's one of the biggest

595
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,779
changes over the last you know 15 years

596
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:38,519
where we were excited that that's when

597
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:41,460
we went from getting two pounds of light

598
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:42,900
on a four by four to getting three or

599
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,240
more

600
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:47,100
yeah agreed yeah and it's crazy how

601
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:50,099
these like little incremental changes of

602
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:53,158
being able to use data to guide your

603
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:56,158
process now I don't like to make data or

604
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:58,679
analytics like the the only holy thing

605
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:00,480
you still have to I still believe that

606
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:02,220
the farmer is the best calibrated tool

607
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,319
right but

608
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:06,120
what's happening with VPD is so they

609
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:07,859
call it the vapor pressure deficit which

610
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:10,199
basically is there's a differential

611
00:23:07,859 --> 00:23:11,939
between the osmotic pressure on the

612
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:15,538
outside of the leaf and on the inside of

613
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:17,700
the leaf so in hydroponic systems That's

614
00:23:15,538 --> 00:23:19,319
essential for drawing water nutrients

615
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,779
through the plant out through the leaves

616
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:25,980
on transpiration which is how you fill

617
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:28,918
up fat flowers basically so when we were

618
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:31,500
keeping it below 50 humidity we might

619
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:34,020
have been mitigating powdery mildew

620
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:36,359
but in a rock wool or cocoa or other

621
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:38,819
hydroponic techniques you're limiting

622
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:40,979
the plant's ability to transpire which

623
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:42,599
is basically sweating and that's how

624
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,700
they move nutrients they are literally

625
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:46,619
moving nutrients through

626
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,058
I guess a change in osmotic pressure

627
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:49,379
between

628
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:51,658
I guess you could say all the way from

629
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:53,220
the root Zone up and out the leaves and

630
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:55,980
that's how all that humidity gets into

631
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:58,380
the air is because the water movement is

632
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:00,120
bringing the nutrients to the highest

633
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:02,760
growth tip

634
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:04,379
um and so that's why sometimes in a Hot

635
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:07,079
Corner you've got some spider mites

636
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:09,480
because that difference difference in

637
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:11,399
temperature that's maybe slightly hot is

638
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:14,599
affecting this vapor pressure deficit

639
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:17,340
and it seems to impact calcium the most

640
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:20,339
and as you get as you start to have

641
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:22,199
Calcium deficiency you run into Mite

642
00:24:20,339 --> 00:24:24,418
issues often

643
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:27,298
typically too much nitrogen will produce

644
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:30,299
powdery mildew issues not enough calcium

645
00:24:27,298 --> 00:24:33,599
will start to be more like a might pest

646
00:24:30,298 --> 00:24:37,019
issue so yeah and if you're making seeds

647
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:39,058
you want to run High nitrogen so exactly

648
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:40,740
that's the seeds are seeds are made of

649
00:24:39,058 --> 00:24:42,359
nitrogen right so yeah that makes sense

650
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,679
when you said that in our little group

651
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:46,259
that kind of blew my mind like I never

652
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,298
even thought about that but we use seed

653
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:50,339
in our composting because it's high in

654
00:24:48,298 --> 00:24:51,658
nitrogen and so I don't even think about

655
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:52,678
that

656
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:54,179
um that was pretty interesting little

657
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:57,000
tidbit

658
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:59,280
yeah yeah yeah so you had some uh you

659
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,558
had some uh diagrams that you wanted to

660
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:03,298
share with the group oh yeah let's uh

661
00:25:01,558 --> 00:25:06,599
yeah let's do that so I guess I'm really

662
00:25:03,298 --> 00:25:09,119
big on slideshows and keynote I like to

663
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:10,798
show visual examples

664
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:13,439
um you have some good ones too you

665
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:15,298
absolutely yeah I think I do so let me

666
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,759
try and give a couple so this is to

667
00:25:15,298 --> 00:25:19,980
answer the question as to why your

668
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:21,839
living soil may not be working the way

669
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:24,000
that you want to

670
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:25,740
um and so one of the main Concepts that

671
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,558
I think is actually the biggest barrier

672
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:30,179
to success in living soil biologically

673
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:33,000
driven systems is something called

674
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:35,640
ecological succession so ecological

675
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,159
succession is the scientific term for

676
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,500
what nature is doing on an ecosystem so

677
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:43,440
it starts at bare rock or what they

678
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:46,079
would call primary ecosystem so lava

679
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,700
flow flood whatever and then it starts

680
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:51,298
to what they call early successional

681
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:53,278
grasses shrubs and small trees

682
00:25:51,298 --> 00:25:55,980
um the other type of trees and then

683
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:58,200
eventually an old growth forest and this

684
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:59,700
progression I guess this progression

685
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,519
would be

686
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:05,400
um called ecological succession and what

687
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:07,740
people completely are missing I believe

688
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:10,320
in in all areas of cultivation whether

689
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:11,220
it's carrots tomatoes or cannabis is

690
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:14,579
that

691
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:17,700
as this ecological succession takes

692
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:20,460
um takes its process on and plants get

693
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:22,259
more diverse as you go the biological

694
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:24,240
system that supports these various

695
00:26:22,259 --> 00:26:26,220
systems becomes more complex and

696
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,859
actually starts to change so over here

697
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:31,798
in a primary ecosystem you have mostly

698
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:33,359
or if not all bacteria you start to get

699
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:36,000
a little bit of fungi which are these

700
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:38,399
orange dots As you move higher in

701
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,740
succession and when you get finally to

702
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:43,500
an old growth forest you start to

703
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:45,058
actually have more fungi than bacteria

704
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:47,819
and I think this is one of the reasons

705
00:26:45,058 --> 00:26:49,798
why there was such success had when

706
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:51,839
people went into the forests of Humboldt

707
00:26:49,798 --> 00:26:54,298
and Mendocino and Northern California

708
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:57,119
and plop their plants in you were

709
00:26:54,298 --> 00:26:58,798
plopping it into this system and as

710
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:01,859
canvas got more and more legal we

711
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:05,099
cleared these trees out and all this

712
00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:07,019
system kind of fell apart and based on

713
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:09,178
the work of Dr Lane and the stuff that

714
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:12,480
I've seen you could generally put

715
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:15,120
cannabis into this range so if you're

716
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:18,659
relying on packaged bacteria products

717
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:20,819
you're over here if you're not using any

718
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:23,460
sort of compost that legitimately has

719
00:27:20,819 --> 00:27:25,678
the proper quantities and ratios of

720
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:28,140
biological organisms which we would turn

721
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,179
biologically complete compost or Dr

722
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:32,340
lean's trademark term of bile complete

723
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:35,038
compost biocomplete and biologically

724
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:36,778
complete just means that your compost is

725
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:39,179
taken into consideration these other

726
00:27:36,778 --> 00:27:41,220
organisms that need to be in there so

727
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:44,038
basically what happens is

728
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:46,620
if cannabis evolved on the planet in

729
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:48,720
this type of ecosystem and from a

730
00:27:46,619 --> 00:27:51,178
biological standpoint your system is

731
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,278
only providing this bacteria you're not

732
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:55,620
supporting this system with any of the

733
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:58,019
things that it's accustomed to and that

734
00:27:55,619 --> 00:28:01,678
basically is the Cascade of events that

735
00:27:58,019 --> 00:28:04,079
leads to past slow growth and what have

736
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,840
you the most common pests in living soil

737
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:08,639
people call thrips Susan Wade rat would

738
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:11,819
argue that it's not always thrips but

739
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:14,220
whatever the specificity of it the the

740
00:28:11,819 --> 00:28:16,079
the the bug that leaves little shiny

741
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:18,720
holes in the leaves the drive living

742
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:21,178
soil Growers nuts

743
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:24,000
100 of the time I have analyzed the

744
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:26,278
biological assessment of a soil that is

745
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,679
claiming to have thrips is way over here

746
00:28:26,278 --> 00:28:30,778
and what I would assert that to is

747
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:32,880
without this level of biological

748
00:28:30,778 --> 00:28:35,099
activity nutrients are not being

749
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,799
delivered to that plant at a rate that's

750
00:28:35,099 --> 00:28:39,899
fast enough that equals the demand on

751
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:42,058
growth we're putting on this plant with

752
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:44,759
high intensity lighting short life

753
00:28:42,058 --> 00:28:46,798
cycles fast flips and all that stuff so

754
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:49,558
in order for living soil to have the

755
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:51,179
growth rates proper you need to be I

756
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:53,700
mean you got to at least get into this

757
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:55,320
first realm and once you start to get

758
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,600
basically what we would Define as

759
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:59,579
nutrient cycling which is happening over

760
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:01,918
here most of your problems start to go

761
00:28:59,579 --> 00:29:04,379
away pretty heroic things start to

762
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,880
happen over here and those would be the

763
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,380
situations that most people don't talk

764
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,419
about and what we would Define as fish

765
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:10,799
stories because when you do try to talk

766
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:13,559
about them people just interrupt you

767
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:16,079
with your line right so but if you get

768
00:29:13,558 --> 00:29:18,240
into this range pretty magical things

769
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:21,119
start to happen

770
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,159
um and from a soil chemistry standpoint

771
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:24,959
that's actually one of the bigger issues

772
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:26,940
because most people aren't looking at

773
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,798
this the people that design your soil

774
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:31,500
don't seem to care as much as they

775
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:33,720
should I think and so chemistry in the

776
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:36,898
soils we're working with is wacky as can

777
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:39,720
be so from a general standpoint a

778
00:29:36,898 --> 00:29:41,819
healthy soil so an actual soil whether

779
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:43,558
that's native soil or potting soil that

780
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:46,798
you've manufactured should have

781
00:29:43,558 --> 00:29:49,379
somewhere roughly around 68 to 72

782
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:52,079
percent of that mineral being calcium

783
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:54,600
somewhere between 10 and 14 percent of

784
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:57,000
that mineral nutrition as magnesium and

785
00:29:54,599 --> 00:30:01,678
somewhere between four and seven percent

786
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:03,960
as potassium if we go and look at a um

787
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,940
maybe say like Fox Farms or something

788
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:10,259
it's going to have this breakdown it's

789
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:14,278
going to be like 50 40 and 20. if you

790
00:30:10,259 --> 00:30:16,379
look at any of the dry mineral top dress

791
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:19,319
products that we like and a lot of them

792
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:21,960
are great products but the problem is if

793
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:24,000
they put this much calcium into the mix

794
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,640
the three numbers on the bag would be

795
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,480
zero zero zero because you diluted the

796
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:33,419
potassium so low so at best you get 10

797
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:36,000
calcium and like five to seven percent

798
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:38,340
potassium because nobody is going to go

799
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,898
into the store and buy a zero zero zero

800
00:30:38,339 --> 00:30:42,959
so it's not

801
00:30:39,898 --> 00:30:45,298
uh you know I don't know but basically

802
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,220
what happens is if you buy any of the

803
00:30:45,298 --> 00:30:49,440
pre-packaged mineral dry top dress

804
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:51,120
products and rely on those for your

805
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,940
mineral nutrition and the soil based

806
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:56,359
system every time you add them to your

807
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:58,620
soil you are maintaining the same

808
00:30:56,359 --> 00:31:00,719
dysfunctional mineral chemistry balance

809
00:30:58,619 --> 00:31:02,939
and it doesn't really take any sort of

810
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,159
scientists to realize that if this is

811
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:07,080
what the plant needs to see in your soil

812
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:08,340
based system and this is what you're

813
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:11,220
getting there's going to be some

814
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:13,798
problems so the consequence of this

815
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:16,679
mineral chemistry over here is you have

816
00:31:13,798 --> 00:31:19,319
a functional deficiency in calcium some

817
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:22,100
advisors would argue that 80 percent of

818
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:25,139
the plant's biomass requires calcium

819
00:31:22,099 --> 00:31:27,418
and magnesium and cannabis is a yield in

820
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:29,360
quality killer so once you get above

821
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:31,860
let's say 20 percent

822
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:35,699
magnesium you start to significantly

823
00:31:31,859 --> 00:31:38,158
impact bag appeal yield Frost potency

824
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:41,700
things like that and when you start to

825
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:43,980
get a significant quantity of potassium

826
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:45,840
you're creating weak and watery cells

827
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:47,880
because the way that the plant wants to

828
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:49,678
build a cells it brings calcium up into

829
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,419
that plant and it builds the main

830
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,600
structure of that cell with calcium

831
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:56,640
starts to fill with all the other stuff

832
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:59,278
um if you're feeling it with potassium

833
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,799
or rather if there's a deficiency of

834
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:03,960
calcium the plant can substitute it with

835
00:32:01,798 --> 00:32:07,200
potassium to keep its life cycle moving

836
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:09,120
but you're now creating a cell filled

837
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,278
with an electrolyte which potassium is

838
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:13,259
an electrolyte which creates a weak

839
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:15,960
watery cell which is kind of what I was

840
00:32:13,259 --> 00:32:18,599
talking about earlier about how under

841
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,919
this condition of high Potassium and low

842
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:22,199
calcium

843
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:25,620
in a way you're making your plants more

844
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:27,179
uh susceptible to really any problem and

845
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:29,459
especially some of the virus material

846
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:31,200
and these are some pictures this is my

847
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:33,360
wife here she's like five foot one I

848
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,298
think five two something like that this

849
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:38,759
was a project we did in 2018 when I met

850
00:32:36,298 --> 00:32:41,519
my wife she had was living in Utah was

851
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:43,798
not around any cannabis cultivation at

852
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:46,679
all and so when we started Consulting

853
00:32:43,798 --> 00:32:47,879
together in 2014 I had all the Cannabis

854
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:49,798
experience so she would do the

855
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,360
microscope assessment and I would

856
00:32:49,798 --> 00:32:54,720
basically handle all the Cannabis

857
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:57,479
related uh functionality and so by 2018

858
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,100
she had done so much Consulting with me

859
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,778
that she was becoming her own little

860
00:32:59,099 --> 00:33:04,019
cannabis

861
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:06,119
um uh official I guess and so this was a

862
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:08,278
project in 2018 with two cultivators we

863
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:10,739
had worked two two years prior to that

864
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:14,339
as a guy named Sean used to go by push

865
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:16,079
farms and Sarah LED this entire project

866
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:18,240
without me so I just kind of took

867
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:20,519
pictures and hung out but this was kind

868
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,500
of like Sarah's senior project

869
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:24,480
um of cannabis and she led all the

870
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,339
fertilization all the stuff I just kind

871
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,519
of hung out but basically what you're

872
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:31,259
looking at is this is our control so

873
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,778
um we like to try and maintain a control

874
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:36,359
anytime we we're trying to do research

875
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:39,659
and so this is

876
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:41,879
um seed plants dug into a hole and just

877
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:44,580
planted there was no soil prep there was

878
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:47,039
no biological treatments these plants

879
00:33:44,579 --> 00:33:49,678
did receive the same fertilization they

880
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:52,200
did receive the same foliar feeding but

881
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:56,278
they didn't receive any biological

882
00:33:52,200 --> 00:34:00,720
treatments native soil native soil 100

883
00:33:56,278 --> 00:34:01,980
yeah this is native soil and obviously

884
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,179
there's some like weird gaps here

885
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,798
because like we said we're trying to

886
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:06,840
keep this as a control this was at the

887
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:08,159
top of one of the plots

888
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:10,378
um and so we didn't get like a full

889
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,419
planting density obviously we were

890
00:34:10,378 --> 00:34:15,000
mostly looking at plant growth response

891
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:18,239
yield potential and whatnot but if you

892
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,338
were to take this size plant and do

893
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:22,559
proper planting density do proper row

894
00:34:20,338 --> 00:34:24,599
count per acre you'd end up somewhere

895
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:26,820
around a thousand you might get maybe

896
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:31,019
1200 pounds per acre or something like

897
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:33,240
that and at this time in 2017 2018 most

898
00:34:31,019 --> 00:34:36,418
of the farmers that were hiring us for

899
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:38,098
broad acre scale work you know their

900
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:40,500
main goal was like if they've got 12 to

901
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:42,000
1500 pounds per acre they would feel

902
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,800
pretty good about themselves if they had

903
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,199
two thousand pounds per acre they would

904
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:48,419
be stoked right so just kind of as a

905
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:50,579
visual size this might get you about a

906
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:52,980
thousand pounds per acre at a proper

907
00:34:50,579 --> 00:34:55,619
planting density and and row structure

908
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:58,320
over here on this side these are the

909
00:34:55,619 --> 00:35:00,440
same genetics same seeds same grower

910
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,420
same cultivator same property

911
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:05,820
but this row got

912
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:08,039
um what's called a yeoman plow so the

913
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:09,780
plow does a deep rib that goes about 30

914
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:12,539
inches deep and it breaks up the

915
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:15,420
compaction and we hooked up a compost

916
00:35:12,539 --> 00:35:17,639
extract tank that would inject compost

917
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:19,019
extract deep down into that hole so

918
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:20,639
basically what we were doing is we were

919
00:35:19,019 --> 00:35:23,880
breaking up the agriculture compaction

920
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:26,460
and we made sure that the top 30 inches

921
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:29,280
of soil were properly inoculated with

922
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:31,019
Biology and then once we transplanted we

923
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,960
did another compost extract treatment

924
00:35:31,019 --> 00:35:36,838
and I believe they received two more in

925
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:38,699
the course of this thing so both are

926
00:35:36,838 --> 00:35:41,279
coming from the same seed stock same

927
00:35:38,699 --> 00:35:43,618
breeders same crew same cultivator same

928
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,839
fertilization same foliar feeding same

929
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:49,019
canopy management this one was just

930
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:52,139
plopped into a hole this one got up to

931
00:35:49,019 --> 00:35:55,320
you know what we would call uh let me

932
00:35:52,139 --> 00:35:57,659
see here go back up to this guy

933
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:59,940
so from a biological standpoint they got

934
00:35:57,659 --> 00:36:02,460
into this range right

935
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:05,400
yeah and that's the difference so plants

936
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:08,099
on the left it's this range plants on

937
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:10,019
the right are kind of maybe this range I

938
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:11,579
guess you could say there was kind of a

939
00:36:10,019 --> 00:36:14,099
bit of obstacles at this type of scale

940
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:15,839
gets really hard to do everything there

941
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:17,400
was some significant budget constraints

942
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:18,659
on this property

943
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,000
um so we weren't able to do everything

944
00:36:18,659 --> 00:36:23,159
that we wanted but nonetheless there's a

945
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,838
significant change in plant growth and

946
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:26,519
on this side they ended up with four

947
00:36:24,838 --> 00:36:29,338
thousand pounds per acre of durable

948
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:32,338
flour I have some COA somewhere on my

949
00:36:29,338 --> 00:36:35,699
computer but they're all 26 to 28 THC

950
00:36:32,338 --> 00:36:38,940
highly desirable outcome and so you know

951
00:36:35,699 --> 00:36:40,679
you know when you said living soil kind

952
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:42,659
of struggles this is the image I think

953
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:44,279
you had in your head and then when I

954
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:46,980
heard it this is the image I have in my

955
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:49,200
head it's like well when you're truly

956
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:51,059
doing living soil

957
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:53,460
um that's you know it looks a little bit

958
00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:55,858
different and that's what most people

959
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:58,740
are kind of unaware of and I think

960
00:36:55,858 --> 00:37:01,440
that's one of the biggest issues with

961
00:36:58,739 --> 00:37:02,699
just kind of the organic culture and I

962
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,019
gotta be really careful when I say this

963
00:37:02,699 --> 00:37:06,539
because I don't want to be inflammatory

964
00:37:04,019 --> 00:37:09,059
or or I'm not trying to say this trying

965
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:10,380
to be a jerk but

966
00:37:09,059 --> 00:37:12,059
um

967
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:14,220
there's some significant cultural

968
00:37:12,059 --> 00:37:17,578
differences between the hydroponic world

969
00:37:14,219 --> 00:37:20,098
and the organic living soil world and in

970
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:22,440
the living soil World results are less

971
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:24,480
important right so if you go to like

972
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,220
jungle Boys on Instagram they're not

973
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,659
like writing you poetry and stuff they

974
00:37:26,219 --> 00:37:28,559
just put a picture of their grow and

975
00:37:27,659 --> 00:37:31,618
says

976
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:32,940
you know I forget you know Double

977
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:35,820
Diamond cookies

978
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:37,440
June 2023. you know what I'm saying they

979
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:39,420
just this is what I did today you know

980
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,980
what I mean like they're not they're not

981
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:42,358
even necessarily talking about what they

982
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,800
did or they're not giving you recipes

983
00:37:42,358 --> 00:37:46,139
they're just like yo this is what I did

984
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,700
you know and like if you go to the

985
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:50,098
organic world and especially the living

986
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:51,659
soil world the community is the most

987
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:53,760
valuable thing

988
00:37:51,659 --> 00:37:55,920
um being non-threatening is the most

989
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,720
important thing supporting the gurus is

990
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,579
the most important thing I guess we

991
00:37:57,719 --> 00:38:01,679
could say right in Hydroponics nobody

992
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:04,619
cares about that [ __ ] and where I came

993
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:07,259
from like you weren't even allowed

994
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:09,180
just to say I read on the internet you

995
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:10,740
would get slapped like a like a meme or

996
00:38:09,179 --> 00:38:12,838
something like get out of here kid you

997
00:38:10,739 --> 00:38:14,519
know what I mean it was like if you

998
00:38:12,838 --> 00:38:16,078
started a sentence with I read on the

999
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:18,480
internet they'd be like nope not here

1000
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,740
player and they'd be like go apply to

1001
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,740
your garden

1002
00:38:19,739 --> 00:38:24,179
bring the flower we'll smoke it and if

1003
00:38:22,739 --> 00:38:25,559
it's worth the [ __ ] we'll talk about

1004
00:38:24,179 --> 00:38:28,559
what you read on the internet like it

1005
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:30,059
was so disallowed almost violently and

1006
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:33,420
in the organic world we just have this

1007
00:38:30,059 --> 00:38:35,699
Echo chamber of things that don't work

1008
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:37,740
have not worked have never worked are

1009
00:38:35,699 --> 00:38:39,179
probably never going to work but

1010
00:38:37,739 --> 00:38:40,799
everybody wants to be part of the

1011
00:38:39,179 --> 00:38:43,799
community talking about these things

1012
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,960
right and so especially if you're just

1013
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:48,720
like a normal grower trying to decipher

1014
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:50,159
how to take a pathway into living soil

1015
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:54,379
and you're only outlet for information

1016
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:56,819
is Instagram or some of the forums it is

1017
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:59,400
extremely difficult to truly be

1018
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:01,500
successful I think and you know

1019
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:04,740
especially because the predominant

1020
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:06,659
narrative in living soil the ironic part

1021
00:39:04,739 --> 00:39:09,479
about it is there's a lot of really loud

1022
00:39:06,659 --> 00:39:12,960
voices to try to silence anybody talking

1023
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:15,240
about quantifying biology and I think

1024
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:17,940
you know part of that is by Design you

1025
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:19,679
know the other major difference is you

1026
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:22,079
know I worked for a hydroponic um

1027
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:23,759
organization very massive very well

1028
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:26,460
known you definitely know who they are

1029
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,400
and you definitely know their investors

1030
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:30,900
um this is a 2018 and they hired me for

1031
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:33,300
the value I could provide to their Farm

1032
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:35,880
but at the same time they had a lobbyist

1033
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:38,339
on the organic regulation board for

1034
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:41,039
California called ocal to make it more

1035
00:39:38,338 --> 00:39:44,099
difficult for organic cultivators right

1036
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:46,980
so in 2018 and I would say so we're

1037
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:48,838
working with the first indoor Farm to be

1038
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:52,380
okal certified I've worked with

1039
00:39:48,838 --> 00:39:54,960
literally hundreds of organic farms none

1040
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:56,820
of them know anything about they don't

1041
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,320
even know it's called ocal but you go to

1042
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:00,119
the hydroponic world or the chemical

1043
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,460
World they have lobbyists making it more

1044
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:03,720
difficult for the Organics right and I

1045
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:05,880
don't go too much more down that rabbit

1046
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:09,000
hole sounding like a kook but that's

1047
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:11,039
another major issue is there's people

1048
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,659
from different areas of chemical

1049
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:15,420
agriculture that infiltrate

1050
00:40:12,659 --> 00:40:17,940
misinformation in order to make it

1051
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:19,400
difficult for you to be successful so if

1052
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:22,380
you're if you don't have any commercial

1053
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:23,880
connections you know like I know you you

1054
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:26,220
know like if there's something going on

1055
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,358
popular Trend I'd be like hey James what

1056
00:40:26,219 --> 00:40:28,919
do you think about these things going on

1057
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:30,420
be like yeah no that's

1058
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,858
that's a pay to play I don't think

1059
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:34,400
they're really doing it you know that's

1060
00:40:31,858 --> 00:40:37,500
a sponsored deal yeah right

1061
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,480
you know like but in the organic world

1062
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,980
there's a tremendous amount of effort on

1063
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:43,199
these pay-to-plays I've worked for some

1064
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:46,440
of these Farms I kind of take a major

1065
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:48,659
stance to not do any of those anymore

1066
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:50,400
um or well if I'm working with a farm

1067
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:51,659
that's just doing something to promote a

1068
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,858
product I usually don't mess with those

1069
00:40:51,659 --> 00:40:54,179
kind of people

1070
00:40:52,858 --> 00:40:56,639
um I need you to be about what you're

1071
00:40:54,179 --> 00:40:59,279
doing and not just taking a sponsorship

1072
00:40:56,639 --> 00:41:00,779
deal you know people don't realize you

1073
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,400
know in NASCAR the stickers on the car

1074
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:04,260
and cannabis the sticker's not on the

1075
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,539
car right there's still sponsored deals

1076
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:08,880
there's right there's still stuff right

1077
00:41:06,539 --> 00:41:11,759
imagine imagine these guys though with

1078
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:14,039
jackets and cannabis it'd be kind of

1079
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,900
goofy

1080
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:18,719
I think it would be funny is to see the

1081
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:20,639
organic gurus with a syngenta sticker on

1082
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:23,879
their back right yep um because that's

1083
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:25,440
definitely a deal but so you know for

1084
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,300
the commercial cultivators that have

1085
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,559
commercial connections it's a little bit

1086
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,599
easier because you're in a certain

1087
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:31,858
Community adding to a certain point if

1088
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:34,200
you get to a certain scale and you've

1089
00:41:31,858 --> 00:41:36,179
made it this far you're able to discern

1090
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:37,980
on your own if a new trend is going to

1091
00:41:36,179 --> 00:41:40,379
be real or not right like if somebody

1092
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:42,719
popped up some new hydroponic Trend you

1093
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:44,400
have enough personal experience to go

1094
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:46,319
yeah I don't think that's going to shake

1095
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:50,940
out you know what I mean like

1096
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:52,680
yeah right and so 100 right so but most

1097
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:55,079
your average living soil people don't

1098
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:56,759
have that and a large majority of the

1099
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:58,680
people getting into living soil are

1100
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,480
coming from other areas of

1101
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:01,919
Agriculture and that's most of my

1102
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,838
clientele

1103
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,760
um I get a lot of flack for that from

1104
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:09,000
people in the living soil Community but

1105
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:11,099
again I'm here because I came from a

1106
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,920
qualified crew I was not the lead grower

1107
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:16,980
I was not the facility owner I was the

1108
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,900
guy that did Anna data and analytics and

1109
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:21,838
help people be in business way back when

1110
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:23,400
I was calculating kilowatt hours I was

1111
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:26,099
helping people manage you know I just

1112
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:28,320
was the nerdy math guy and the group and

1113
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:31,019
so as legalization continued forward

1114
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:32,640
that's still my role and so I'm here

1115
00:42:31,019 --> 00:42:34,858
because I'm trying to keep people with

1116
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:37,379
cannabis experience in the Cannabis game

1117
00:42:34,858 --> 00:42:39,119
and so if you previously did Coco core

1118
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:41,940
drained a waste or hydroponic whatever

1119
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:43,500
and you want to now do living soil I'm

1120
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:46,500
probably going to help you do that you

1121
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:48,480
know and and again like if you're just

1122
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:50,400
trying to succeed with your growing

1123
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,199
system in rockwool sometimes I'll still

1124
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,519
help you too right

1125
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:56,879
um and

1126
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:59,818
and I think for the new entrance to the

1127
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:02,160
market so to speak good luck deciphering

1128
00:42:59,818 --> 00:43:04,079
what's shared on Instagram or whatever

1129
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:06,358
it's a real good way to go out of

1130
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:08,400
business and right now there's some

1131
00:43:06,358 --> 00:43:10,799
really popular trends that are the

1132
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,900
swiftest way to end your career in

1133
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,859
cannabis you know by following what

1134
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,119
they're talking about on the internet

1135
00:43:13,858 --> 00:43:17,279
and

1136
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:19,079
you know I I used to kind of try to be a

1137
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,400
little more vocal to try and stop some

1138
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:21,720
of those things I've just gotten out of

1139
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,460
the way of that train I just kind of

1140
00:43:21,719 --> 00:43:26,399
work privately behind the doors almost

1141
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:28,318
exclusively and so yeah I just don't

1142
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,639
even bother anymore

1143
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:31,858
um which again that's why I was here I

1144
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:34,019
want to be an educator we used to do um

1145
00:43:31,858 --> 00:43:36,000
presentations and workshops we don't

1146
00:43:34,019 --> 00:43:37,199
really do those anymore uh you know I

1147
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
think one of the last ones I did was

1148
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:41,879
probably with you and black sheep I

1149
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:45,119
think I maybe done one since then

1150
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:48,000
um but now we do classes so now we have

1151
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:50,640
what we call master classes where

1152
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,838
I mean we work with 4x4 tent Growers you

1153
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:54,118
know we've got a couple other commercial

1154
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:56,279
Farms that go through our um our master

1155
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:58,680
classes but basically we've distilled

1156
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:01,440
down the full complexity of our

1157
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:03,598
Consulting work into five and eight week

1158
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,659
modules where we meet through Zoom like

1159
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:08,640
this and we have a private forum and we

1160
00:44:06,659 --> 00:44:10,739
meet once a month with all members which

1161
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:13,139
is what you came to so you came to and

1162
00:44:10,739 --> 00:44:14,699
was a really our first guest speaker to

1163
00:44:13,139 --> 00:44:16,799
our monthly meetings which was pretty

1164
00:44:14,699 --> 00:44:18,539
badass people are just raving about that

1165
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,760
show dude that was cool you have a great

1166
00:44:18,539 --> 00:44:22,980
group too I think I do yeah a lot of

1167
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:24,780
passionate people and you know it's the

1168
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:26,159
four light Growers if you're growing

1169
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:27,720
four lights you're passionate about it

1170
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:28,379
it's not about money anymore there's no

1171
00:44:27,719 --> 00:44:30,899
way

1172
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:32,579
so yeah it's a beautiful thing seeing

1173
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:35,639
people really growing with you know four

1174
00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:37,500
lights or even one light you know in a

1175
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:39,118
four by four

1176
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,559
yeah and sometimes that's where the

1177
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:43,380
greatest Innovation comes from actually

1178
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:44,818
and so I you know at the same time we

1179
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:46,980
were working with some of the largest

1180
00:44:44,818 --> 00:44:49,079
Farms on the planet literally by

1181
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:50,940
definition and at the same time still

1182
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:53,220
doing one-on-one Consulting calls for

1183
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:55,440
four light Growers single tank Growers

1184
00:44:53,219 --> 00:44:57,959
and a lot of times some of the most

1185
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,760
interesting things of innovation are

1186
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:01,920
coming from those little two by fours

1187
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,240
and just you know nobody from the

1188
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,858
industry that just comes up with a

1189
00:45:03,239 --> 00:45:06,539
different angle or some random product

1190
00:45:04,858 --> 00:45:08,519
from their hardware store or something

1191
00:45:06,539 --> 00:45:09,779
and sometimes a lot of the most

1192
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:12,420
interesting things come from those

1193
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:14,339
smaller Growers but in years past our

1194
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:16,200
business was not set up to help those

1195
00:45:14,338 --> 00:45:17,818
smaller Growers and that was kind of

1196
00:45:16,199 --> 00:45:19,858
some of the Flack we got from the living

1197
00:45:17,818 --> 00:45:21,000
soil Industries you know they thought we

1198
00:45:19,858 --> 00:45:23,219
were just helping some of the biggest

1199
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,219
farms which that's just what I like to

1200
00:45:23,219 --> 00:45:27,598
do you know like I came from you know

1201
00:45:26,219 --> 00:45:30,059
some legitimate

1202
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:31,440
you know company back in the day and you

1203
00:45:30,059 --> 00:45:32,940
know two of my cousins that are like my

1204
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,139
brothers went on to be NASCAR crew

1205
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:36,539
chiefs like I'm not trying to be third

1206
00:45:34,139 --> 00:45:38,039
place like I want to be in the biggest

1207
00:45:36,539 --> 00:45:41,039
stadiums I want to have the biggest

1208
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:43,980
impact I want to do the coolest [ __ ] and

1209
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:46,380
so that that took us to just some big

1210
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:47,940
that's just what I like and but what I

1211
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:49,980
like now we're still doing those jobs

1212
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:52,559
but now we've got a functional format

1213
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:54,240
for the smaller Growers or even now hell

1214
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:55,739
everybody's pinched on money right now

1215
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:57,959
and so we're we're helping some

1216
00:45:55,739 --> 00:46:00,479
commercial farms in our master classes

1217
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:02,699
because it's a minor fraction of what

1218
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,139
our personal Consulting costs and

1219
00:46:02,699 --> 00:46:06,239
actually uh we just had our first

1220
00:46:04,139 --> 00:46:09,118
student win a cup so we've been working

1221
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:10,979
with Cup winners since day one we now

1222
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:14,460
just had our first student and he won

1223
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:16,019
the emerald cup and he won uh a High

1224
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:17,240
Times cup I'm not which not sure which

1225
00:46:16,019 --> 00:46:19,920
one

1226
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:21,659
yeah and and so that's for hemp flower

1227
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,119
so he's got

1228
00:46:21,659 --> 00:46:25,980
um I think about 6 000 square feet of

1229
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:27,660
greenhouse in Illinois his name is

1230
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:31,940
Justin his Brand's called Stony Branch

1231
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:31,940
who would have thought Illinois you know

1232
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:36,660
this place I think they grow good

1233
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:38,160
cannabis but it's not the first place

1234
00:46:36,659 --> 00:46:41,399
that's for sure and I mean I have my

1235
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:42,598
friend Rick mosca from Moscone you know

1236
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,579
there's there's people crushing in

1237
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:47,220
Illinois and you know all over the

1238
00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:49,140
United States yeah and that's the trippy

1239
00:46:47,219 --> 00:46:50,818
part about this last couple years like

1240
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:52,259
they're popping up all over the place

1241
00:46:50,818 --> 00:46:54,358
man like

1242
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:55,980
you'd never think man you know we

1243
00:46:54,358 --> 00:46:58,440
especially us from California you from

1244
00:46:55,980 --> 00:47:00,599
the bay me from you know basically San

1245
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:02,880
Fernando Valley Orange County San Diego

1246
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:05,460
like some real players came from that

1247
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,900
zone so it's hard to think oh someday

1248
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:08,280
someone from Illinois is going to crush

1249
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:11,280
it you're like yeah right we got it

1250
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:14,519
thanks you know or Utah Utah so the

1251
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:16,619
highest THC tested Autos I I have some

1252
00:47:14,519 --> 00:47:18,440
of my that have tested above 30 for

1253
00:47:16,619 --> 00:47:20,940
Autoflower and this is grown at scale

1254
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:22,800
and you know this is not an average but

1255
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:24,300
this individual plants testing above 30.

1256
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,859
that was in Utah

1257
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:28,740
get out of here who would have thought

1258
00:47:25,858 --> 00:47:31,619
yeah so that's where I live now I never

1259
00:47:28,739 --> 00:47:32,818
thought I'd end up in Utah and uh we

1260
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:34,380
haven't been involved with any of the

1261
00:47:32,818 --> 00:47:37,800
farms around here we had a client from

1262
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:39,240
California that applied and Utah is kind

1263
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,980
of it's like one of the most good old

1264
00:47:39,239 --> 00:47:44,039
boy place kind of New Yorkie or

1265
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:46,500
something and uh they assigned like nine

1266
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:48,719
or 12 licenses I think our client got

1267
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:50,699
like 15th out of I think they only

1268
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:52,318
signed nine or something but I think

1269
00:47:50,699 --> 00:47:54,358
they're all hydroponic Farms too I don't

1270
00:47:52,318 --> 00:47:57,480
think they awarded any organic farms at

1271
00:47:54,358 --> 00:48:01,019
all wow um yeah so it's kind of

1272
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:03,199
interesting uh how that works here but I

1273
00:48:01,019 --> 00:48:07,318
like living here but yeah the weed sucks

1274
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:10,019
so gotta grow your own yeah I don't know

1275
00:48:07,318 --> 00:48:12,539
man we do so we do so much zoom and

1276
00:48:10,019 --> 00:48:15,000
we're so high profile man I'm I'm

1277
00:48:12,539 --> 00:48:16,858
terrified to light my house up but I I

1278
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,500
will never not have a plant in my

1279
00:48:16,858 --> 00:48:21,420
backyard never it's always you know it's

1280
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:24,000
like I made some seeds in my backyard I

1281
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:25,920
love I just like having plants right now

1282
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,599
I'm with you do this hard for me I mean

1283
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,880
I've scalped all kinds of bedrooms to

1284
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:31,380
keep going in the back and when we lived

1285
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:33,059
in Northern California was able to do

1286
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:36,180
the first full-term outdoor which was

1287
00:48:33,059 --> 00:48:37,440
cool I've only done three outdoor runs

1288
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:38,519
because I only lived there for three

1289
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,500
years

1290
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:41,818
um but yeah it's way I mean this is the

1291
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,679
snitch state so you gotta be real

1292
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:45,900
careful people don't even talk about

1293
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:47,460
smoking weed here it's pretty sketchy

1294
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:49,500
um so right now I'm doing chickens I got

1295
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:53,179
a chicken coop and I'm gonna do some

1296
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:55,380
selective breeding it's nice

1297
00:48:53,179 --> 00:48:57,000
so I'm applying the principles of

1298
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:59,099
cannabis to my chicken coop and that's

1299
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,420
kind of cool yeah but yeah hopefully

1300
00:48:59,099 --> 00:49:02,160
someday I'll be able to sneak a planet

1301
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:03,920
I'm just still I'm only been here one

1302
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:07,980
year I'm a little nervous you know so

1303
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:10,318
yeah yeah it's Gotta Go some CBG or CBD

1304
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:14,539
I know right just out of the backyard

1305
00:49:10,318 --> 00:49:17,039
all boom big old 12-footer yeah

1306
00:49:14,539 --> 00:49:18,719
we live up against the mountain and we

1307
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:20,159
get legitimate like 70 mile an hour

1308
00:49:18,719 --> 00:49:22,078
winds coming off the mountain into the

1309
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:24,539
back of our house and we set up a garden

1310
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:26,460
that blows down the street so I ordered

1311
00:49:24,539 --> 00:49:27,779
I ordered a little two by two light for

1312
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:30,179
Sarah and we're gonna set up a little

1313
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:31,319
tomato inside the kitchen by the front

1314
00:49:30,179 --> 00:49:33,358
door

1315
00:49:31,318 --> 00:49:35,338
um so I'm gonna grow a tomato plant for

1316
00:49:33,358 --> 00:49:36,719
inside because that poor Sarah that

1317
00:49:35,338 --> 00:49:39,380
outdoor Garden just keeps blowing down

1318
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:42,179
the street like we can't even hardly

1319
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:44,460
it's crazy so I got a question for you

1320
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:47,519
where do you see the industry in the

1321
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:50,460
next five years and in the next 10 years

1322
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:52,139
from what aspect from where we're at now

1323
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:55,039
from where we were before to where we're

1324
00:49:52,139 --> 00:49:58,618
at now as far as

1325
00:49:55,039 --> 00:50:01,440
companies quality uh where do you see

1326
00:49:58,619 --> 00:50:02,940
the genetics going uh you think more

1327
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,760
people will be going to scale are we

1328
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:07,920
going to have less indoor and more

1329
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:08,940
Greenhouse supplemental lighting which I

1330
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,079
I kind of think is the perfect

1331
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:12,960
environment

1332
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:13,980
yeah I I love I love uh light up

1333
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,358
Greenhouse

1334
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:18,000
um it's kind of The Best of Both Worlds

1335
00:50:15,358 --> 00:50:20,759
uh we work with a lot of indoor Growers

1336
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,460
and it's it's hard to say how long

1337
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:25,079
economically that's going to pan out

1338
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:27,119
um I think there's some brands that will

1339
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:28,440
always be around regardless of Economics

1340
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:32,579
right so I've worked with some of those

1341
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:34,679
girls that their brand will carry on

1342
00:50:32,579 --> 00:50:37,800
um I know this one guy Sam he's the lead

1343
00:50:34,679 --> 00:50:39,000
cultivator of a farm in Northern

1344
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,200
California I think they're the largest

1345
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,420
permit holder in Northern California

1346
00:50:40,199 --> 00:50:45,059
something like that

1347
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:48,180
um but he said his analytic team made

1348
00:50:45,059 --> 00:50:50,400
the claim that here in the next year or

1349
00:50:48,179 --> 00:50:52,318
so the only flower in the state of

1350
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:54,599
California that's going to maintain an

1351
00:50:52,318 --> 00:50:57,000
eighth price over fifty dollars will be

1352
00:50:54,599 --> 00:50:59,220
a living soil grown aside from the

1353
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:02,219
cookies you know those handful of brands

1354
00:50:59,219 --> 00:51:04,318
that will always maintain that

1355
00:51:02,219 --> 00:51:05,639
um which is pretty interesting to me

1356
00:51:04,318 --> 00:51:07,079
um you know I've done a lot of Economics

1357
00:51:05,639 --> 00:51:09,239
for all types of farms that's part of

1358
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:10,200
what I do for my Consulting

1359
00:51:09,239 --> 00:51:12,419
um you know I also have a business

1360
00:51:10,199 --> 00:51:13,980
degree and the weed knowledge so I'm

1361
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:16,200
able to sit at the table with the grower

1362
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:18,240
and the business guys I do a lot of

1363
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:20,338
spreadsheet analytics forecasting things

1364
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:21,779
like that so I know all the economics

1365
00:51:20,338 --> 00:51:24,659
the cost of production and things like

1366
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:27,359
that and you know back in 2018 everybody

1367
00:51:24,659 --> 00:51:29,578
was kind of saying or even really 2016

1368
00:51:27,358 --> 00:51:31,318
2017 a lot of people were kind of

1369
00:51:29,579 --> 00:51:35,339
professing you need to be below 600

1370
00:51:31,318 --> 00:51:37,980
below 400 all in cost per pound and in

1371
00:51:35,338 --> 00:51:41,578
like 2018 people we're still like 890

1372
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:43,800
920 you know nowhere near that

1373
00:51:41,579 --> 00:51:46,079
um I think you can get that with any

1374
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:49,559
cultivation style but you have to be on

1375
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:51,240
point and I think what I see shaking out

1376
00:51:49,559 --> 00:51:52,920
is regardless if you're growing

1377
00:51:51,239 --> 00:51:55,618
Hydroponics or regardless if you're

1378
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:57,480
growing living soil if you're not data

1379
00:51:55,619 --> 00:51:58,800
driven in some way I mean you still need

1380
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:00,838
to be an artist you still need to be the

1381
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,400
cultivator but if you're not measuring

1382
00:52:00,838 --> 00:52:04,739
your process I don't think you're going

1383
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:07,740
to survive right whether you're Legacy

1384
00:52:04,739 --> 00:52:08,879
or legal because it's getting down to I

1385
00:52:07,739 --> 00:52:11,639
was having this conversation yesterday

1386
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:13,019
with one of my classes it's like you

1387
00:52:11,639 --> 00:52:15,480
know when pounds were four thousand

1388
00:52:13,019 --> 00:52:16,980
dollars you could afford to cut a crop

1389
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:18,659
down if it went sideways you could

1390
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:20,460
afford to scrub a room down you can

1391
00:52:18,659 --> 00:52:21,838
afford to shut down you could afford to

1392
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:24,000
not look at your numbers

1393
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:25,739
you could and more importantly nailed it

1394
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,739
on the head you could afford to not even

1395
00:52:25,739 --> 00:52:30,479
care about financials and I say this in

1396
00:52:28,739 --> 00:52:32,219
the most loving way possible but most of

1397
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:35,159
us were very sloppy Financial myself

1398
00:52:32,219 --> 00:52:36,838
included like I still barely manage my

1399
00:52:35,159 --> 00:52:38,879
finances the way I should even though

1400
00:52:36,838 --> 00:52:40,558
that's part of my job you know helping

1401
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:43,380
people keep their money straight and

1402
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:46,440
annabis made me sloppy with my

1403
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:48,720
profitability so to speak and if you're

1404
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:50,039
not I think on a basic level if you

1405
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:53,759
start with all the things you can

1406
00:52:50,039 --> 00:52:56,279
quantify if you're not analyzing what

1407
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:58,020
you're feeding every Harvest I don't

1408
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,760
think you're gonna make it because you

1409
00:52:58,019 --> 00:53:02,280
don't know why things go sideways you

1410
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:04,079
don't know why things go well if

1411
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:05,460
somebody comes to me it's usually when

1412
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:06,839
things aren't going well and then they

1413
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:09,000
start taking a data point you're like

1414
00:53:06,838 --> 00:53:12,719
okay great you now have a numerical

1415
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:15,539
assessment of not good when things are

1416
00:53:12,719 --> 00:53:16,919
going well you need to analyze that so

1417
00:53:15,539 --> 00:53:19,558
that you can at least get back to it

1418
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:21,900
that's how I learned what these targets

1419
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:24,359
were well things are going well let's

1420
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:27,059
send an analysis of our fertilization

1421
00:53:24,358 --> 00:53:29,400
recipe to Wallace labs for example in El

1422
00:53:27,059 --> 00:53:32,040
Segundo they're fantastic fantastic I

1423
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:34,139
think they provide the most accurate

1424
00:53:32,039 --> 00:53:36,239
um assessment of a fertilization recipe

1425
00:53:34,139 --> 00:53:38,639
you know whether that's Organics or

1426
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:40,078
water chemistry so I didn't get bare

1427
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:42,118
minimum you need to be doing regular

1428
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:45,180
water chemistry tests because your water

1429
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:47,640
changes in Denver Colorado half the year

1430
00:53:45,179 --> 00:53:49,440
your water is a 6.2 and comes from a

1431
00:53:47,639 --> 00:53:51,000
certain water source another part of the

1432
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:53,039
year it's 8.4 and comes from another

1433
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,539
water source if you're pouring the same

1434
00:53:53,039 --> 00:53:56,519
mils per gallon of your Advanced

1435
00:53:54,539 --> 00:53:58,920
Nutrients or whatever in there

1436
00:53:56,519 --> 00:54:00,599
you're gonna have one good part of the

1437
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:02,539
year and one bad part of the year in a

1438
00:54:00,599 --> 00:54:05,400
really simple fashion

1439
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:07,079
more important than that no matter how

1440
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:08,760
much you like your products they vary

1441
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:11,099
quite wildly sometimes throughout the

1442
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:14,520
year and so part of the analytics I do

1443
00:54:11,099 --> 00:54:16,318
are four products helping them be more

1444
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:18,539
consistent you know like right now

1445
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:20,099
Athena is really popular I think Athena

1446
00:54:18,539 --> 00:54:22,259
is really popular simply because they're

1447
00:54:20,099 --> 00:54:24,180
doing some of these analytics right so

1448
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:25,440
they're trying to produce a higher

1449
00:54:24,179 --> 00:54:27,239
quality and I don't even necessarily

1450
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,800
care for them I just think that's why

1451
00:54:27,239 --> 00:54:31,558
people are jumping on it and like having

1452
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:33,000
a little bit more success I think Athena

1453
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:34,859
is doing a little bit more

1454
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,539
due diligence so to speak you know and

1455
00:54:34,858 --> 00:54:38,219
there's other good brands too you know

1456
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:42,539
and CES I think has been pretty good

1457
00:54:38,219 --> 00:54:44,159
he's a extremely data driven uh guy

1458
00:54:42,539 --> 00:54:46,019
there you know so there's other brands

1459
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:48,420
that are good some of this stuff might

1460
00:54:46,019 --> 00:54:51,420
be a 300 variation in what's in that

1461
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:53,099
bottle yeah so I I like Cutting Edge I'm

1462
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:55,500
a big fan of Cutting Edge I'm a big fan

1463
00:54:53,099 --> 00:54:58,079
of United you know there's a lot of

1464
00:54:55,500 --> 00:55:00,239
stuff and then you know Emerald Harvest

1465
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:02,960
as far as organic

1466
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:05,219
you know I think they have interesting

1467
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:07,380
they have interesting products for sure

1468
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:09,980
yeah you know but I'm not married to any

1469
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:12,480
one product I'm not sponsored by anybody

1470
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:15,000
we don't I don't you know I don't take

1471
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:16,139
endorsement money so no no no yeah I

1472
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,420
don't think that even needs to be said

1473
00:55:16,139 --> 00:55:21,179
with you but so if you just talk about

1474
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:22,920
like a cost production standpoint so you

1475
00:55:21,179 --> 00:55:24,358
know some of the larger hydroponic Farms

1476
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:26,818
that I've worked with you know they come

1477
00:55:24,358 --> 00:55:29,460
in running heavy 16 running Advanced

1478
00:55:26,818 --> 00:55:30,119
yeah uh you know running

1479
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:31,920
um

1480
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:33,900
what was the other one

1481
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,980
the San Fernando Valley guys I can

1482
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:37,200
picture the label I can't think of my

1483
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:39,900
name right now but anyways in 2018 that

1484
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:41,699
stuff was 350 a square foot nutrient

1485
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:43,920
input cost per Harvest

1486
00:55:41,699 --> 00:55:46,739
most things have gone up 40 to 50 to 100

1487
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:49,920
so I'd say in 2023 if you're running

1488
00:55:46,739 --> 00:55:50,519
heavy 16 Advanced

1489
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,338
um

1490
00:55:50,519 --> 00:55:55,559
uh you know any of those you're probably

1491
00:55:53,338 --> 00:55:58,558
three four maybe five dollars a square

1492
00:55:55,559 --> 00:56:00,180
foot nutrient input cost I know CES is a

1493
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:02,280
little bit cheaper um but if you talk

1494
00:56:00,179 --> 00:56:04,799
about like General Hydroponics you're

1495
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:06,660
probably two to fifty per square foot if

1496
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,859
you're using floor Pro I think floor Pro

1497
00:56:06,659 --> 00:56:09,480
is a little cheaper you know you're

1498
00:56:07,858 --> 00:56:10,920
using some salt Salt's floor Pro is

1499
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:13,260
actually a pretty good product if we're

1500
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:16,079
talking you know something that's a

1501
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:17,760
two-part that's a salt mix you know I've

1502
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:20,220
used it for seed production and I I

1503
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:21,900
basically will try anything I love

1504
00:56:20,219 --> 00:56:23,338
especially for seed production I love

1505
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:25,619
trying different things and seeing what

1506
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:27,358
kind of results I get you know we we hit

1507
00:56:25,619 --> 00:56:30,960
the mark the other the other day when we

1508
00:56:27,358 --> 00:56:32,880
harvested it over 45 000 seeds per 4x4

1509
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:35,338
which is that's crazy yeah it's pretty

1510
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:37,440
wild that's been crazy

1511
00:56:35,338 --> 00:56:38,699
so back when I started if you would have

1512
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:40,559
told me those are the kind of numbers we

1513
00:56:38,699 --> 00:56:42,500
could get I would have really strived a

1514
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:44,519
lot harder to get those numbers

1515
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:46,858
right it's like the four minute mile

1516
00:56:44,519 --> 00:56:48,358
nobody nobody strove for it they didn't

1517
00:56:46,858 --> 00:56:50,159
know it was possible you know and that's

1518
00:56:48,358 --> 00:56:52,139
I think that's the best part about

1519
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:54,838
legalization and it brought stuff out

1520
00:56:52,139 --> 00:56:56,639
into the open and I think it gave people

1521
00:56:54,838 --> 00:56:58,619
something to chase you know there was

1522
00:56:56,639 --> 00:57:00,480
all those little pockets of dudes

1523
00:56:58,619 --> 00:57:01,980
crushing it and once you got to be able

1524
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:03,539
to put it on Instagram I think it's like

1525
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:06,119
the four minute mile it's like wow I can

1526
00:57:03,539 --> 00:57:07,980
do that yeah you know but but if you're

1527
00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:09,900
not measuring these things you're gonna

1528
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:12,719
you're gonna struggle to stay relevant

1529
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:14,460
whether you're well financed or not and

1530
00:57:12,719 --> 00:57:16,558
you know one of the things that I do is

1531
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:19,079
I help transition people from bottles to

1532
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:21,780
just bag soft formulations so you can go

1533
00:57:19,079 --> 00:57:23,760
from like you know three four five

1534
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:25,800
dollars a square foot down to a dollar a

1535
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:27,900
square foot and get the same production

1536
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:31,079
or sometimes better if you're balancing

1537
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:34,619
the npnk and all that stuff living soil

1538
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:36,900
comparatively so my full program Guild

1539
00:57:34,619 --> 00:57:39,420
you know you know push to the max put

1540
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:40,858
pushing industry leading quality you

1541
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:43,380
know it's like a dollar dollar twenty

1542
00:57:40,858 --> 00:57:45,239
square foot all in yeah and so you

1543
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:48,059
compare that to the absolute lowest

1544
00:57:45,239 --> 00:57:50,338
price bag salt which is about a buck

1545
00:57:48,059 --> 00:57:52,019
right now and you know you're two three

1546
00:57:50,338 --> 00:57:54,058
four dollars a square foot it's not

1547
00:57:52,019 --> 00:57:56,099
going to take very long for living soil

1548
00:57:54,059 --> 00:57:58,800
to get a significant advantage over that

1549
00:57:56,099 --> 00:58:00,599
just from your reoccurring costs you

1550
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:03,300
know and yeah and it pays for itself

1551
00:58:00,599 --> 00:58:04,740
right so like over time absolutely pays

1552
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:06,599
for itself your your investment is

1553
00:58:04,739 --> 00:58:07,379
initial right so like in your soil and

1554
00:58:06,599 --> 00:58:09,660
then

1555
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:10,920
as you go it gets cheaper and cheaper

1556
00:58:09,659 --> 00:58:13,440
and cheaper

1557
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:15,358
yeah yeah I think both can be managed

1558
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,858
though but like if you're in that two

1559
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:17,940
three four dollars a square foot you

1560
00:58:16,858 --> 00:58:20,279
probably better take a look at that

1561
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:22,019
moving into the future and

1562
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:24,059
more importantly you can't afford to

1563
00:58:22,019 --> 00:58:27,539
have one fall off like you need to know

1564
00:58:24,059 --> 00:58:29,099
why you had a 20 loss on this run you

1565
00:58:27,539 --> 00:58:31,440
know you need to know why that's

1566
00:58:29,099 --> 00:58:34,019
happening you know five years from now

1567
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:37,260
where do you see the industry

1568
00:58:34,019 --> 00:58:39,659
my honest answer yep I I see the only

1569
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:42,960
people still able to cultivate whether

1570
00:58:39,659 --> 00:58:44,699
it's Legacy or regulated are those

1571
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:46,920
people that are incorporating the

1572
00:58:44,699 --> 00:58:49,019
available analytic tools and the tools

1573
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:50,400
to guide your cultivation process I'm

1574
00:58:49,019 --> 00:58:51,960
not saying we're not going to be artists

1575
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,700
anymore I'm not saying the cultivator is

1576
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:55,199
not the best thing anymore but I'm

1577
00:58:53,699 --> 00:58:57,298
saying if you're not analyzing your

1578
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:59,578
water if you're not analyzing your feed

1579
00:58:57,298 --> 00:59:01,679
every time you buy nutrients you just

1580
00:58:59,579 --> 00:59:02,880
will not make it I think and I don't

1581
00:59:01,679 --> 00:59:04,980
know I think just that's a broad

1582
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,358
statement that if you're not you know if

1583
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:08,519
you're in Hydroponics and you're not

1584
00:59:06,358 --> 00:59:10,078
measuring volumetric water content

1585
00:59:08,519 --> 00:59:12,298
you're going to get smoked by the people

1586
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:13,680
that are absolutely smoked and you can

1587
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:15,298
buy little handheld meters you don't

1588
00:59:13,679 --> 00:59:17,338
need to buy some like crazy growing

1589
00:59:15,298 --> 00:59:18,858
stuff you can buy a handheld meter just

1590
00:59:17,338 --> 00:59:22,019
like a pH pen

1591
00:59:18,858 --> 00:59:23,578
and in the living soil world you're not

1592
00:59:22,019 --> 00:59:25,079
you're not going to make it if you're

1593
00:59:23,579 --> 00:59:26,339
not analyze if you're not paying

1594
00:59:25,079 --> 00:59:28,140
attention to soil chemistry numbers

1595
00:59:26,338 --> 00:59:29,460
because the people that are producing

1596
00:59:28,139 --> 00:59:31,739
soil aren't hitting the numbers for you

1597
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:32,880
there's not and if you're not paying

1598
00:59:31,739 --> 00:59:34,019
attention to the biological numbers

1599
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,818
you're going to have slow growth

1600
00:59:34,019 --> 00:59:38,099
production so they're not going to make

1601
00:59:35,818 --> 00:59:39,599
it and you know with all the tools that

1602
00:59:38,099 --> 00:59:43,380
are available to now you know even troll

1603
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:46,019
Master grow link Arroyo like things have

1604
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:47,940
changed in the last couple years like I

1605
00:59:46,019 --> 00:59:49,440
like with these faux lights and the

1606
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:50,940
growl links and just all these

1607
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:52,318
analytical tools man it's got me

1608
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:54,059
scratching trying to light up another

1609
00:59:52,318 --> 00:59:56,039
room just be like I want to use these

1610
00:59:54,059 --> 00:59:57,420
tools you know and I'm not saying you

1611
00:59:56,039 --> 00:59:59,219
got to go spend a bunch of money to be

1612
00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:01,920
productive but if you're not starting

1613
00:59:59,219 --> 01:00:04,199
with a 90 water test or even Logan Labs

1614
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:05,880
can do a 40 water test if you're not

1615
01:00:04,199 --> 01:00:07,318
starting there you're not going to be

1616
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:09,900
able to build a foundation to remain

1617
01:00:07,318 --> 01:00:11,099
relevant and I see that I see that I

1618
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:13,318
mean I've worked with straight up famous

1619
01:00:11,099 --> 01:00:14,338
people you know like to know names it

1620
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:15,838
doesn't matter it doesn't matter if

1621
01:00:14,338 --> 01:00:17,759
you're famous doesn't matter if you're

1622
01:00:15,838 --> 01:00:21,119
running a two by four

1623
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:23,819
I do these analytics a 68 soil test

1624
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:26,160
always comes back in profitability and

1625
01:00:23,818 --> 01:00:27,719
yield in a 4x4 10 always

1626
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:29,460
you know when people look at these

1627
01:00:27,719 --> 01:00:32,159
numbers like an obstacle so if you look

1628
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:33,480
at the cost of doing business as an

1629
01:00:32,159 --> 01:00:35,699
obstacle I don't think you're gonna make

1630
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:37,679
it right you have to you have to figure

1631
01:00:35,699 --> 01:00:39,118
out I'm not saying blow money that's the

1632
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:40,500
other thing we're great at as we guys

1633
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:43,440
are just like throwing money at problems

1634
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:46,679
not saying that but like if you look at

1635
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:48,900
from a scarcity mindset that your pie is

1636
01:00:46,679 --> 01:00:51,598
shrinking and you say I get this every

1637
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:53,220
day I can't afford a 68 wire test I can

1638
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:54,420
tell you as somebody with a finance

1639
01:00:53,219 --> 01:00:56,159
degree that does economics for the

1640
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:59,159
Cannabis industry that return on

1641
01:00:56,159 --> 01:01:02,338
investment comes out of 4x4 10. you

1642
01:00:59,159 --> 01:01:04,259
don't you know so if you're in any size

1643
01:01:02,338 --> 01:01:05,818
commercial facility and you're not doing

1644
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:07,319
that every Harvest you're not going to

1645
01:01:05,818 --> 01:01:08,940
make it you're gonna get blown by the

1646
01:01:07,318 --> 01:01:10,380
people that are and a lot of those

1647
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:12,798
people are new entrants and that's what

1648
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:16,079
kind of sucks like you know I come from

1649
01:01:12,798 --> 01:01:18,599
these you know pedigrees and there's

1650
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:21,180
less and less people with experience as

1651
01:01:18,599 --> 01:01:22,859
I go and that bums me out

1652
01:01:21,179 --> 01:01:25,078
um but the reality is this Market's

1653
01:01:22,858 --> 01:01:26,338
going to move on with or without you and

1654
01:01:25,079 --> 01:01:28,079
if you're stuck in this position

1655
01:01:26,338 --> 01:01:29,519
unwilling to move to this next

1656
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:31,680
requirement of you you're going to get

1657
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:33,599
left behind regardless of who you are

1658
01:01:31,679 --> 01:01:35,279
and I think that goes for everybody and

1659
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:37,019
that's why you wear are where you are

1660
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:39,059
because in your world you're doing that

1661
01:01:37,019 --> 01:01:40,920
you're one of the most data driven Hydro

1662
01:01:39,059 --> 01:01:43,260
dudes I've met there's only one other

1663
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:44,760
guy I can think of that does similar

1664
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:46,380
type things to you and he would be

1665
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:48,900
considered world famous like you you

1666
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:51,838
know and there's a lot of other people

1667
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:54,119
that could get good at managing genetics

1668
01:01:51,838 --> 01:01:56,639
managing process managing employees

1669
01:01:54,119 --> 01:01:58,318
having a good out having a good Market

1670
01:01:56,639 --> 01:02:01,679
far away

1671
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:03,420
that's all fine but if your strategy is

1672
01:02:01,679 --> 01:02:05,159
to ship it to Virginia like that market

1673
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:08,400
is shrinking you maybe got one more year

1674
01:02:05,159 --> 01:02:10,259
for that yeah yeah if that like that's

1675
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,880
wrapping up pretty quick and it's just

1676
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:13,559
simply because

1677
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:15,720
I think that goes back to the Eagle 20

1678
01:02:13,559 --> 01:02:17,700
talk of why that is the consumer's tired

1679
01:02:15,719 --> 01:02:19,379
of ringing ears tingling tongues and

1680
01:02:17,699 --> 01:02:21,179
burning throats yeah and a lot of the

1681
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:23,579
Legacy Growers are still laying on the

1682
01:02:21,179 --> 01:02:25,558
Eagle 20 Avid and floramite and the

1683
01:02:23,579 --> 01:02:28,079
consumers over that and so if that's the

1684
01:02:25,559 --> 01:02:30,000
product you're producing not that many

1685
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:32,339
people want that anymore and they don't

1686
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,079
want to pay 35 in taxes for an eighth or

1687
01:02:32,338 --> 01:02:35,400
whatever the hell it is right now but it

1688
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:38,099
doesn't make your ears ring doesn't make

1689
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:39,720
your tongue tingle and so if if your

1690
01:02:38,099 --> 01:02:42,240
legacy grower that's trying to continue

1691
01:02:39,719 --> 01:02:43,919
moving you have to find out what's wrong

1692
01:02:42,239 --> 01:02:45,779
nutritionally as to why you need that

1693
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:48,000
eagle 20. because in the regulated

1694
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:49,740
market we figured that out it's math

1695
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,019
it's nitrogen levels it's calcium

1696
01:02:49,739 --> 01:02:53,338
quantities it's not pushing potassium so

1697
01:02:52,019 --> 01:02:56,099
hard you don't need that stuff anymore

1698
01:02:53,338 --> 01:02:57,838
yeah so you got you gotta put down and

1699
01:02:56,099 --> 01:02:59,160
now to be fair what I said earlier that

1700
01:02:57,838 --> 01:03:01,259
information is very hard to come into

1701
01:02:59,159 --> 01:03:04,318
contact you can just Google this stuff

1702
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:05,760
so I'm sympathetic to that obstacles

1703
01:03:04,318 --> 01:03:07,440
um but I didn't know it before I knew it

1704
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:09,480
you just got to put in the work you know

1705
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:12,059
right or reach out or reach out to

1706
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:13,500
someone you know I help I hope nobody's

1707
01:03:12,059 --> 01:03:14,940
all the time you know people that nobody

1708
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:17,099
knows and

1709
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:18,358
sure and I think if you're watching this

1710
01:03:17,099 --> 01:03:21,059
and you don't know the difference

1711
01:03:18,358 --> 01:03:23,219
between living soil as far as why it's a

1712
01:03:21,059 --> 01:03:25,200
better product I it's the it's the end

1713
01:03:23,219 --> 01:03:27,659
product in my opinion it's the effect

1714
01:03:25,199 --> 01:03:29,159
more than anything else it's the effect

1715
01:03:27,659 --> 01:03:32,519
from the living soil you can take two

1716
01:03:29,159 --> 01:03:34,618
cultivars grow one with cocoa and you're

1717
01:03:32,519 --> 01:03:36,960
gonna get good results you give you your

1718
01:03:34,619 --> 01:03:38,280
Skittles in both you grow any of these

1719
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:39,539
cultivars that are popular right now

1720
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:42,119
you're going to get good results in both

1721
01:03:39,539 --> 01:03:44,219
but the effect hands down I mean I think

1722
01:03:42,119 --> 01:03:46,318
flavor wise you can get good flavoring

1723
01:03:44,219 --> 01:03:49,919
cocoa you can get great flavor but the

1724
01:03:46,318 --> 01:03:51,179
effect and the effect and the flavor you

1725
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,619
know and the structure I feel like

1726
01:03:51,179 --> 01:03:54,419
there's you know there's something

1727
01:03:52,619 --> 01:03:57,119
special about living soil and the way it

1728
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:59,460
cures out too it's very different than

1729
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:01,500
stuff that's grown in other substrates

1730
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:04,500
so I think the main difference for that

1731
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:05,760
is and what I would you know what I

1732
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:07,679
would attribute to as the greatest

1733
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:09,660
Advantage when you compare just

1734
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:12,298
Hydroponics to living any type to living

1735
01:04:09,659 --> 01:04:14,699
soil as the as the market moves forward

1736
01:04:12,298 --> 01:04:17,579
I think the greatest Advantage is while

1737
01:04:14,699 --> 01:04:19,858
Hydro is Flushing I'm still feeding and

1738
01:04:17,579 --> 01:04:21,480
we don't flush in living soil because in

1739
01:04:19,858 --> 01:04:24,179
Hydroponics you're taking a nutrient

1740
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:26,639
that takes a salt and sticks it to a

1741
01:04:24,179 --> 01:04:28,318
mineral and that's called chelate or

1742
01:04:26,639 --> 01:04:30,539
yeah chelate it's a hard word to think

1743
01:04:28,318 --> 01:04:32,279
of the context but anyways you're they

1744
01:04:30,539 --> 01:04:34,259
have they have to stick that nutrient to

1745
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:35,819
something so they stick it to a salt so

1746
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:37,619
when you water that plant with that

1747
01:04:35,818 --> 01:04:39,420
salt-based fertilizers both those go

1748
01:04:37,619 --> 01:04:40,740
into the plant and then towards the end

1749
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:44,039
of the Harvest cycle you got to take

1750
01:04:40,739 --> 01:04:45,719
that salt out and so I don't know that

1751
01:04:44,039 --> 01:04:48,119
just the salt comes out I think you're

1752
01:04:45,719 --> 01:04:50,639
pulling things back out in order to get

1753
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:52,200
that clean burning flavor and we don't

1754
01:04:50,639 --> 01:04:53,940
contribute anything that needs to be

1755
01:04:52,199 --> 01:04:55,379
flushed and it's not a good idea to

1756
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:57,720
flush in living soil you create a whole

1757
01:04:55,380 --> 01:05:00,119
other problem and so in those several

1758
01:04:57,719 --> 01:05:02,459
weeks while people are flushing we're

1759
01:05:00,119 --> 01:05:05,280
still pushing and so I think that's

1760
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:07,199
where that added complexity comes from

1761
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:09,119
um and where those at I guess whatever

1762
01:05:07,199 --> 01:05:10,078
the stuff that pops up on the test and

1763
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:12,059
things we haven't even figured out how

1764
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:13,380
to measure yet I think that's the one

1765
01:05:12,059 --> 01:05:15,119
single

1766
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:17,220
one of the one of the main single

1767
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:18,358
advantages honestly other than stability

1768
01:05:17,219 --> 01:05:19,858
if you know what you're doing with

1769
01:05:18,358 --> 01:05:22,199
living soil and you're quantifying these

1770
01:05:19,858 --> 01:05:23,400
things it's very resilient you know if

1771
01:05:22,199 --> 01:05:25,500
you're not paying attention to the

1772
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:28,139
microbial population it feels like a

1773
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:30,298
[ __ ] show you know yeah so it's that

1774
01:05:28,139 --> 01:05:31,920
extra buffer as far as a cultivator you

1775
01:05:30,298 --> 01:05:33,119
do get buffer from soil as opposed to

1776
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:35,519
rockwool

1777
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:37,079
yeah yeah but you can do some great

1778
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:38,818
things in those I'm not at all you know

1779
01:05:37,079 --> 01:05:41,400
like I said I'm working with a 30 000

1780
01:05:38,818 --> 01:05:42,480
square foot Rockwell facility right now

1781
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:44,280
um I just

1782
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:46,619
I've been in the kitchen and in the

1783
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:48,540
laundry room of all of them and you know

1784
01:05:46,619 --> 01:05:50,099
so I can see what's potential and what's

1785
01:05:48,539 --> 01:05:52,259
problematic and so that's why I've

1786
01:05:50,099 --> 01:05:55,440
doubled down so hard on living soil

1787
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:57,420
is just on the powdery mildew issue it's

1788
01:05:55,440 --> 01:06:00,179
not an issue for us if you're managing

1789
01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:03,298
these things it doesn't even exist

1790
01:06:00,179 --> 01:06:06,000
um usually in our Consulting work we do

1791
01:06:03,298 --> 01:06:08,219
four month packages most Farms

1792
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,079
get to the point of no Patty mildew in

1793
01:06:08,219 --> 01:06:11,639
that first harvest

1794
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:13,380
um some of them takes a little bit

1795
01:06:11,639 --> 01:06:15,000
longer into the Second Harvest but once

1796
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:17,880
they understand what we're teaching them

1797
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:20,099
and they implement it and it has that

1798
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:21,720
effect even after we leave years after

1799
01:06:20,099 --> 01:06:23,099
the powder middle doesn't come back

1800
01:06:21,719 --> 01:06:24,959
because they continue to manage for

1801
01:06:23,099 --> 01:06:26,519
those things so that's another

1802
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:28,318
tremendous Advantage like we don't have

1803
01:06:26,519 --> 01:06:29,759
a powdery milde protocol We Don't Spray

1804
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:32,880
nothing for it we don't try to control

1805
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:34,920
it we use math and microscope

1806
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:36,720
assessments to stay out of

1807
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:38,818
the Realms of powdery mildew now in

1808
01:06:36,719 --> 01:06:40,679
Hydroponics you can do that as well but

1809
01:06:38,818 --> 01:06:42,900
it has to do with nitrogen and calcium

1810
01:06:40,679 --> 01:06:45,659
and calcium and potassium and then

1811
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:47,099
obviously your environment so I just

1812
01:06:45,659 --> 01:06:49,858
think most people aren't aren't really

1813
01:06:47,099 --> 01:06:52,559
doing that that's what I really enjoy

1814
01:06:49,858 --> 01:06:54,960
the most I just a math nerd you know

1815
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:56,880
right so yeah

1816
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:59,519
well if people want to hear more about

1817
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:02,519
what you're doing and follow uh follow

1818
01:06:59,519 --> 01:07:05,599
your footsteps or uh check everything oh

1819
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:09,780
there we go you make it so easy

1820
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:11,760
I zoom all day long dude one of the one

1821
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:13,920
of those things with Kobe is I had to

1822
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:16,319
become a virtual assistant here so yeah

1823
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:18,659
but my website's crashesol.org like I

1824
01:07:16,318 --> 01:07:20,099
said coming out of Legacy markets out of

1825
01:07:18,659 --> 01:07:21,719
stone one day and pick a hard to spell

1826
01:07:20,099 --> 01:07:23,940
hard to write word thinking that'd make

1827
01:07:21,719 --> 01:07:26,219
me hard to find had no clue by that

1828
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:27,960
point they already had um audio

1829
01:07:26,219 --> 01:07:31,379
thumbprints of us all logged in the

1830
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:33,720
system you know but anyways uh my

1831
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:35,640
personal email is Scott chrysosol.org if

1832
01:07:33,719 --> 01:07:37,919
you got a specific question

1833
01:07:35,639 --> 01:07:39,598
um like I said we we do Consulting for

1834
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:41,099
any size Farm

1835
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:43,019
um we've worked with foreign governments

1836
01:07:41,099 --> 01:07:45,960
famous dudes people you've never heard

1837
01:07:43,019 --> 01:07:48,480
of two by four hobbyist Growers

1838
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:51,900
um I just I just like growing cannabis

1839
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:53,338
man and I like I like to see people have

1840
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:54,900
that moment you know I don't care if

1841
01:07:53,338 --> 01:07:57,599
you're a hydro grower or a living soil

1842
01:07:54,900 --> 01:08:00,180
grower I like it when it clicks in you

1843
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:03,119
and we change one minor thing and

1844
01:08:00,179 --> 01:08:04,379
everything becomes better and there's

1845
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:06,780
just like something really cool about

1846
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:08,099
that where it just clicks and then my

1847
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:10,440
favorite thing to hear people say is

1848
01:08:08,099 --> 01:08:12,420
I've been growing this many years I've

1849
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:15,358
never seen that from my genetics that's

1850
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:16,380
my favorite favorite thing to do and you

1851
01:08:15,358 --> 01:08:18,539
can do that through nutritional

1852
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:20,640
management Hydroponics measuring your

1853
01:08:18,539 --> 01:08:22,979
substrate and hydroponics or just living

1854
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:24,838
soil in general Done Right does that as

1855
01:08:22,979 --> 01:08:26,338
well and that's just my favorite thing

1856
01:08:24,838 --> 01:08:29,219
you know we're getting ready to fire off

1857
01:08:26,338 --> 01:08:31,679
another Master Class today's you know

1858
01:08:29,219 --> 01:08:33,420
June 2nd I think next Friday our next

1859
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:35,100
master class starts we do those a few

1860
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:37,739
times a year where we take people

1861
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:39,660
through our Consulting programs I've got

1862
01:08:37,738 --> 01:08:42,718
a mineral chemistry class coming up in

1863
01:08:39,659 --> 01:08:44,698
July where I teach people the math on

1864
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:46,739
how to do their own mineral chemistry

1865
01:08:44,698 --> 01:08:49,500
whether you're a consultant or a

1866
01:08:46,738 --> 01:08:52,198
hobbyist grower or a farm it's all good

1867
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:53,759
we have everybody in between in there I

1868
01:08:52,198 --> 01:08:55,858
think mineral chemistry is one of the

1869
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:57,420
biggest lacks in all living soil there's

1870
01:08:55,859 --> 01:09:00,298
only a handful of dudes that are doing

1871
01:08:57,420 --> 01:09:02,819
it and I just one of my main goals right

1872
01:09:00,298 --> 01:09:04,560
now is get way more people equipped to

1873
01:09:02,819 --> 01:09:07,020
professionally and properly manage

1874
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:08,520
mineral chemistry of their soil because

1875
01:09:07,020 --> 01:09:10,380
that's a major issue in the whole

1876
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:12,299
industry you know and then obviously we

1877
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:14,338
do the microscope my wife teaches a

1878
01:09:12,298 --> 01:09:16,259
microscope class so that's the thing

1879
01:09:14,338 --> 01:09:19,140
we've been teaching the longest in 2013

1880
01:09:16,259 --> 01:09:20,640
2014 I started teaching organic Growers

1881
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:23,819
how to use the microscope for their

1882
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:26,579
needs my wife Sarah now teaches a class

1883
01:09:23,819 --> 01:09:28,920
it's about five weeks long lasts for an

1884
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:31,259
entire year but you have five in-person

1885
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:33,060
sessions and monthly meetings and she

1886
01:09:31,259 --> 01:09:34,920
basically sets you up through zoom on

1887
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:37,020
how to use the microscope as an actual

1888
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:38,759
analytical tool which I think if you're

1889
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:40,560
any soil based system if you're not

1890
01:09:38,759 --> 01:09:43,979
incorporating the microscope assessment

1891
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:45,539
in any way this can't is not likely to

1892
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:47,338
be fruitful for you moving into the

1893
01:09:45,539 --> 01:09:49,019
future you got to get on that I think

1894
01:09:47,338 --> 01:09:50,519
you want to talk about that a little bit

1895
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:51,660
more about what you guys do Under the

1896
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:53,160
microscope because I think a lot of

1897
01:09:51,659 --> 01:09:55,619
people are curious

1898
01:09:53,159 --> 01:09:56,760
oh yeah exactly is what you guys are

1899
01:09:55,619 --> 01:10:00,119
what you guys are doing under the

1900
01:09:56,760 --> 01:10:01,140
microscope yeah so so we use a you know

1901
01:10:00,119 --> 01:10:02,340
what's called a compound light

1902
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:03,480
microscope

1903
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:05,460
um so there's two main types of

1904
01:10:03,479 --> 01:10:07,738
microscope a stereo which you look down

1905
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:09,179
like to look for bugs on a leaf we use

1906
01:10:07,738 --> 01:10:10,738
one where light shines through the

1907
01:10:09,179 --> 01:10:12,840
bottom you put a cover slip and look for

1908
01:10:10,738 --> 01:10:14,159
bugs like in science class in high

1909
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:16,739
school

1910
01:10:14,159 --> 01:10:19,679
um and Dr Lane Ingham is the person that

1911
01:10:16,738 --> 01:10:22,379
kind of took these

1912
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:25,500
uh scientific tools and turned it into

1913
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:29,039
an agricultural assessment and she all

1914
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:32,579
through the 90s early 2000s I think by

1915
01:10:29,039 --> 01:10:34,079
1997 2003 she had it dialed

1916
01:10:32,579 --> 01:10:35,760
um she's gotten a lot of flack and a lot

1917
01:10:34,079 --> 01:10:38,819
of resistance I'm not saying everything

1918
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:40,560
that she says right but I I would put

1919
01:10:38,819 --> 01:10:43,139
her at the top of my list of influential

1920
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:45,719
people in my life and I became qualified

1921
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:47,640
to guide commercial Farms because of her

1922
01:10:45,719 --> 01:10:49,679
guidance you know she taught me how to

1923
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:50,880
be a professional analyst she taught me

1924
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:53,158
how to manage

1925
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:55,079
um cultivators basically I was good at

1926
01:10:53,158 --> 01:10:56,579
growing weed basically working

1927
01:10:55,079 --> 01:10:58,380
one-on-one with her taught me how to be

1928
01:10:56,579 --> 01:11:00,119
a professional

1929
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:03,119
um and how to truly guide people to

1930
01:11:00,119 --> 01:11:06,179
success and and using the microscope

1931
01:11:03,119 --> 01:11:07,738
method to keep it to a data point my

1932
01:11:06,179 --> 01:11:10,319
favorite saying is we got to move it off

1933
01:11:07,738 --> 01:11:13,019
of the emotion and onto a data point you

1934
01:11:10,319 --> 01:11:15,599
know and and so we take the soil we're

1935
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:18,000
counting bacteria we're counting um

1936
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:20,579
oxygen loving aerobic what I would say

1937
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:23,279
beneficial fungi we're comparing those

1938
01:11:20,579 --> 01:11:25,019
two uh we're looking at the predators of

1939
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:27,179
bacteria they're called protozoa so

1940
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:30,179
we're counting them and then we count

1941
01:11:27,179 --> 01:11:31,980
nematodes beneficial non-beneficial and

1942
01:11:30,179 --> 01:11:35,399
then what we would call the anaerobic

1943
01:11:31,979 --> 01:11:36,959
indicators or decreased oxygen organisms

1944
01:11:35,399 --> 01:11:39,299
so there's like a light switch that

1945
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:40,619
turns on in biology they have very

1946
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:44,219
specific functions under certain

1947
01:11:40,619 --> 01:11:46,679
conditions so when oxygen drops below

1948
01:11:44,219 --> 01:11:48,239
four parts per million a whole Suite of

1949
01:11:46,679 --> 01:11:50,158
organisms go to sleep and go to

1950
01:11:48,238 --> 01:11:51,658
endorment stage and then a whole bunch

1951
01:11:50,158 --> 01:11:54,238
of other organisms wake up and start

1952
01:11:51,658 --> 01:11:56,158
functioning that transition is where all

1953
01:11:54,238 --> 01:11:59,399
disease takes place so when you talk

1954
01:11:56,158 --> 01:12:00,839
about pythium fusarium Antonio I don't

1955
01:11:59,399 --> 01:12:03,299
even care about the name it means you're

1956
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:05,460
on this side of decrease oxygen and you

1957
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:09,840
need to address it so

1958
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:12,060
there's basic patterns inside these

1959
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:14,640
um different organism ratios for example

1960
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:18,420
powdery mildew we did a major project in

1961
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:20,760
2018 in um in Santa Barbara after the

1962
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:22,920
major fires and floods and we had a one

1963
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:25,079
acre greenhouse full of 30 gallon pots

1964
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:27,060
of moms where some had powdery mildew

1965
01:12:25,079 --> 01:12:29,399
and some did not have powdery mildew we

1966
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:32,640
went through each 2200 square foot Bay

1967
01:12:29,399 --> 01:12:34,859
and we counted all the soil from plants

1968
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:36,539
that didn't have powdery mildew and we

1969
01:12:34,859 --> 01:12:37,979
counted all the soils from plants that

1970
01:12:36,539 --> 01:12:43,319
were showing visible signs of powder

1971
01:12:37,979 --> 01:12:44,039
mildew through all uh 16 of those Bays

1972
01:12:43,319 --> 01:12:45,840
um

1973
01:12:44,039 --> 01:12:48,539
there was a pattern within four percent

1974
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:50,460
of a certain ratio so the ratio between

1975
01:12:48,539 --> 01:12:53,100
what we call oh my seats which are water

1976
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:56,460
molds powdery mildew causing basically

1977
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:58,860
molds and those that are oxygen loving

1978
01:12:56,460 --> 01:13:01,079
aerobic organisms there was about a four

1979
01:12:58,859 --> 01:13:03,059
or six percent difference in that ratio

1980
01:13:01,079 --> 01:13:04,260
in the plants that showed Perry mildew

1981
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:07,260
and those that did not show powdery

1982
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:10,260
mildew and that pattern continues to be

1983
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:12,060
the most undeniable consistent thing

1984
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:15,600
doesn't matter if you're growing in

1985
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:17,760
Zimbabwe in the ground or in Southern

1986
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:19,260
California in a back bedroom the

1987
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:21,360
relationship between this thing we call

1988
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:24,420
oh my seats and beneficial fungi

1989
01:13:21,359 --> 01:13:26,039
determines most of the outcome

1990
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:28,199
um and if your your threshold for

1991
01:13:26,039 --> 01:13:29,760
powdery mildew so that's basically how

1992
01:13:28,198 --> 01:13:31,519
we use that microscope we're looking for

1993
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:34,320
patterns we're looking for quantities

1994
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:36,360
and there's certain

1995
01:13:34,319 --> 01:13:38,039
ranges I guess you could say where good

1996
01:13:36,359 --> 01:13:39,839
things happen and there's certain ranges

1997
01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:41,219
where all the problems happen and so

1998
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:43,619
that's what we're doing with a

1999
01:13:41,219 --> 01:13:45,300
commercial facility if if you've been

2000
01:13:43,619 --> 01:13:48,539
growing at a smaller scale and you now

2001
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:50,100
go to this any larger scale sometimes

2002
01:13:48,539 --> 01:13:53,340
massive scale

2003
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:55,500
with the most stringent constraints ever

2004
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:57,600
devised for plant cultivation not even

2005
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:59,640
cannabis we're what you and I are doing

2006
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:01,500
in regulated cannabis is the most

2007
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:03,960
stringent production of plants on the

2008
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:07,439
planet right from what I understand

2009
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:09,600
absolutely not even close right and the

2010
01:14:07,439 --> 01:14:11,460
most stringent would be GMP weed for the

2011
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:13,739
European market which has even stricter

2012
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:16,319
parameters in California California is

2013
01:14:13,738 --> 01:14:19,379
one of the strictest and so when you're

2014
01:14:16,319 --> 01:14:21,719
entering that activity

2015
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:23,579
you need to be precise right so

2016
01:14:21,719 --> 01:14:25,140
basically what we do is we chop up the

2017
01:14:23,579 --> 01:14:26,340
facility do a bunch of biological

2018
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:28,320
assessments

2019
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:30,779
and instead of spraying for powdery

2020
01:14:28,319 --> 01:14:33,238
mildew every plant every week we say

2021
01:14:30,779 --> 01:14:36,000
zone four is out of whack let's address

2022
01:14:33,238 --> 01:14:38,218
zone four everything else is fine so we

2023
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,619
basically help people identify where

2024
01:14:38,219 --> 01:14:42,300
their vulnerabilities are

2025
01:14:40,619 --> 01:14:43,979
um through biological means and then

2026
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:46,380
usually making those slight Corrections

2027
01:14:43,979 --> 01:14:47,759
changes most things uh when we first

2028
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:49,619
started really getting into the

2029
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:52,320
commercial markets in late 2016 early

2030
01:14:49,619 --> 01:14:54,420
2017 the only thing that I did was

2031
01:14:52,319 --> 01:14:56,579
biological assessment and Corrections

2032
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:58,679
because I was not at all about to

2033
01:14:56,579 --> 01:15:01,920
profess that I knew what to do in these

2034
01:14:58,679 --> 01:15:03,539
600 light rooms you know yeah I had a

2035
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:04,859
great legacy but I'm not going to try

2036
01:15:03,539 --> 01:15:07,800
and tell people what to do at that stage

2037
01:15:04,859 --> 01:15:10,799
so we only did microscope assessment and

2038
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:12,060
made suggestions now obviously we do

2039
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:13,800
full design and the whole whole

2040
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:16,380
everything but

2041
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:18,239
um at that point all we were doing was

2042
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:21,659
biological assessment and the people

2043
01:15:18,238 --> 01:15:23,579
that were respected well known when you

2044
01:15:21,658 --> 01:15:26,279
tuned up that biological thing right off

2045
01:15:23,579 --> 01:15:28,679
the bat you get 30 to 40 percent more of

2046
01:15:26,279 --> 01:15:31,079
everything you'd get 30 to 40 percent

2047
01:15:28,679 --> 01:15:33,840
faster growth rates which led to a week

2048
01:15:31,079 --> 01:15:36,300
less of vegetative time across the board

2049
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:38,400
you'd get 30 to 40 percent increase in

2050
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:40,800
yield you'd also get 30 to 40 percent

2051
01:15:38,399 --> 01:15:43,079
increase in potency all these

2052
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:45,420
combinations would translate to also 30

2053
01:15:43,079 --> 01:15:46,800
to 40 percent reduction in cost because

2054
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:48,719
you're not fighting problems you're

2055
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:50,159
making more yield increasing profit

2056
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:52,260
basically

2057
01:15:50,158 --> 01:15:54,000
um so you're never going to convince me

2058
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:56,400
that biology is not worth measuring like

2059
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:59,399
it's you know that's that's the main

2060
01:15:56,399 --> 01:16:01,439
Drive of what we're doing and so what we

2061
01:15:59,399 --> 01:16:03,719
do we've termed at the crash of method

2062
01:16:01,439 --> 01:16:05,279
for cultivation simply because we're

2063
01:16:03,719 --> 01:16:07,140
doing something different and what we're

2064
01:16:05,279 --> 01:16:10,319
doing is

2065
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:12,900
any decision we make if it affects that

2066
01:16:10,319 --> 01:16:14,519
biological assessment negatively is out

2067
01:16:12,899 --> 01:16:15,960
and it doesn't matter what it is there's

2068
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:17,159
been all kinds of things along the way

2069
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:18,420
that I was like this is going to be a

2070
01:16:17,158 --> 01:16:21,000
great idea this is going to work great

2071
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:23,579
we do it those biological numbers go

2072
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,420
down or in some other ways sideways it's

2073
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:26,519
out

2074
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:28,260
and and it doesn't matter what it is if

2075
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:31,080
it's popular Trend we put it to the test

2076
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:32,820
numbers go up numbers go down if it goes

2077
01:16:31,079 --> 01:16:34,439
down it's out I don't care how popular

2078
01:16:32,819 --> 01:16:36,299
it is and that's

2079
01:16:34,439 --> 01:16:38,579
and that's why I think the microscope

2080
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:39,840
stuff gets so much resistance because

2081
01:16:38,579 --> 01:16:41,640
there's a lot of people trying to push

2082
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:44,699
stuff that's not that helpful

2083
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:46,079
and within 40 minutes of a microscope

2084
01:16:44,698 --> 01:16:49,799
assessment you could see if that was

2085
01:16:46,079 --> 01:16:51,238
good or bad or you know no no yeah so

2086
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:53,219
that that's basically what we're doing

2087
01:16:51,238 --> 01:16:55,619
with the microscope assessment and you

2088
01:16:53,219 --> 01:16:57,600
can see everything like my favorite

2089
01:16:55,619 --> 01:17:00,059
example is the very first facility that

2090
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:03,539
ever brought us in Colorado's early 2016

2091
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:05,100
they had five benches in a greenhouse

2092
01:17:03,539 --> 01:17:07,560
and they had four greenhouses

2093
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:09,239
identically mirrored they'd bring plants

2094
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:10,920
in on a conveyor belt going from right

2095
01:17:09,238 --> 01:17:14,819
to left each week they'd bring in new

2096
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:16,920
plants and all four greenhouses the two

2097
01:17:14,819 --> 01:17:19,198
outer sides were producing significantly

2098
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:20,520
more than the three inner rows and they

2099
01:17:19,198 --> 01:17:21,960
were banging their head against the wall

2100
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:23,760
they're not even from the same

2101
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:25,859
populations they're you know just

2102
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:28,079
whatever it was and so each of these

2103
01:17:25,859 --> 01:17:31,079
four greenhouses measurable yield

2104
01:17:28,079 --> 01:17:32,579
increase on outside two rows and it got

2105
01:17:31,079 --> 01:17:33,979
less as they got towards the center and

2106
01:17:32,579 --> 01:17:36,539
the middle row had the least production

2107
01:17:33,979 --> 01:17:40,079
regardless of what week it came in or

2108
01:17:36,539 --> 01:17:41,880
what Greenhouse it was in it was wild so

2109
01:17:40,079 --> 01:17:44,039
my wife and I went in there did about 30

2110
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:46,819
microscope assessments of the farm diced

2111
01:17:44,039 --> 01:17:49,500
It Up This Way dice it up this way

2112
01:17:46,819 --> 01:17:51,238
remarkable variation in biological

2113
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:53,279
populations from corner to corner from

2114
01:17:51,238 --> 01:17:54,899
group to group that were identical in

2115
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:57,359
each greenhouse and basically what was

2116
01:17:54,899 --> 01:17:58,920
happening was they would have a batch

2117
01:17:57,359 --> 01:18:01,079
tank in the center of each Greenhouse

2118
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:02,940
with a big hose reel and once a week

2119
01:18:01,079 --> 01:18:04,920
they would get their predatory nematodes

2120
01:18:02,939 --> 01:18:07,919
which are actually bacterial feeding

2121
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:11,100
nematodes which produce growth and they

2122
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:14,279
cycle nitrogen and phosphorus so the HB

2123
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:16,679
nematodes heterabdidus nematodes that we

2124
01:18:14,279 --> 01:18:20,519
use for thrips and whatever they're

2125
01:18:16,679 --> 01:18:23,699
commonly used there's SF SC and HB the

2126
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:25,620
hb1 actually eats bacteria long story

2127
01:18:23,698 --> 01:18:26,939
short increases growth even though you

2128
01:18:25,619 --> 01:18:29,399
think you're doing it to control mass

2129
01:18:26,939 --> 01:18:30,899
and so they would dump those nematodes

2130
01:18:29,399 --> 01:18:32,819
into the tank in the center of the

2131
01:18:30,899 --> 01:18:34,859
greenhouse nematodes are heavier than

2132
01:18:32,819 --> 01:18:36,899
water they go straight to the bottom the

2133
01:18:34,859 --> 01:18:39,000
pump is drying from the bottom so the

2134
01:18:36,899 --> 01:18:41,339
heaviest thing goes to the first place

2135
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:43,198
they water so us canvas people like to

2136
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:44,579
do everything the same so they would

2137
01:18:43,198 --> 01:18:47,219
walk into Greenhouse one they would

2138
01:18:44,579 --> 01:18:49,140
stretch out the hose go up in water in

2139
01:18:47,219 --> 01:18:50,939
the far left since the hose is

2140
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:52,679
completely stretched out they go to the

2141
01:18:50,939 --> 01:18:54,719
far right over here and water that one

2142
01:18:52,679 --> 01:18:57,060
they wheel up the hose a little bit hit

2143
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:58,198
this lane hit this Lane wheel it up a

2144
01:18:57,060 --> 01:19:00,120
little bit more hit the center and they

2145
01:18:58,198 --> 01:19:01,919
did that every time what ends up

2146
01:19:00,119 --> 01:19:04,380
happening is you end up with a billion

2147
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:06,779
nematodes over here a billion nematodes

2148
01:19:04,380 --> 01:19:09,779
over here you know a third of a billion

2149
01:19:06,779 --> 01:19:12,059
here and none in the center and with

2150
01:19:09,779 --> 01:19:13,559
track and Trace data as much as people

2151
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:16,020
want to grown and moan and complain

2152
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:18,239
about it that is extremely efficient

2153
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:20,159
data if you can apply it and for the

2154
01:19:18,238 --> 01:19:23,279
first time ever Growers were forced to

2155
01:19:20,158 --> 01:19:25,500
get a per plant yield is undeniable it's

2156
01:19:23,279 --> 01:19:28,679
not just a mashing of an average light

2157
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:31,140
yield it's this corner is producing more

2158
01:19:28,679 --> 01:19:33,960
than this corner right and so one of the

2159
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:35,460
things that we did was use that data and

2160
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:36,899
if you're a commercial cultivator you

2161
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:39,239
should take that track and Trace data

2162
01:19:36,899 --> 01:19:41,339
make an overlay of your facility and

2163
01:19:39,238 --> 01:19:43,379
place the plant data and the yield and

2164
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:45,719
color code it where it's located in your

2165
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:47,039
building and it will bring up a heat mat

2166
01:19:45,719 --> 01:19:48,658
of dysfunction in your facility really

2167
01:19:47,039 --> 01:19:51,000
tell you exactly where the problems are

2168
01:19:48,658 --> 01:19:52,439
wow and so yeah it's great that's my

2169
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:55,619
favorite thing

2170
01:19:52,439 --> 01:19:57,238
um when I because I didn't get asked for

2171
01:19:55,619 --> 01:19:58,619
too much stuff until a certain point of

2172
01:19:57,238 --> 01:20:00,419
success and then finally someone goes

2173
01:19:58,619 --> 01:20:03,359
what do you think we should do and I

2174
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:04,920
said I give my right arm for some

2175
01:20:03,359 --> 01:20:06,359
organization of this track and Trace

2176
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:08,579
data that's everybody's complaining

2177
01:20:06,359 --> 01:20:09,719
about and they had a computer guy and

2178
01:20:08,579 --> 01:20:11,279
he's like well what would you like to

2179
01:20:09,719 --> 01:20:14,399
see and I was like put it where it

2180
01:20:11,279 --> 01:20:15,899
belongs and color code it and um he was

2181
01:20:14,399 --> 01:20:19,319
like all right about a week or so later

2182
01:20:15,899 --> 01:20:23,158
he produced two maps one had per four by

2183
01:20:19,319 --> 01:20:25,738
four one had per plant and colored it

2184
01:20:23,158 --> 01:20:28,198
red yellow and green and green was

2185
01:20:25,738 --> 01:20:29,879
basically what it shook down of what

2186
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:31,678
they needed for yield to be profitable

2187
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:33,900
was roughly 60 pounds per thousand

2188
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:35,219
square feet break that down into however

2189
01:20:33,899 --> 01:20:37,679
many four by fours you got and then

2190
01:20:35,219 --> 01:20:39,420
color code it there's remarkable

2191
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:41,819
patterns that reveal themselves and

2192
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:43,859
that's what we start to investigate so

2193
01:20:41,819 --> 01:20:45,779
in this particular facility we hadn't

2194
01:20:43,859 --> 01:20:48,059
done that analytics yet but we did the

2195
01:20:45,779 --> 01:20:51,238
microscope assessment and every single

2196
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:53,640
Greenhouse had the same pattern

2197
01:20:51,238 --> 01:20:55,919
um and so what we did was change their

2198
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:57,600
method for delivering those beneficial

2199
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:59,219
nematodes into a smaller container

2200
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:01,079
little squirt bottle and put them

2201
01:20:59,219 --> 01:21:03,779
directly into the beds and then all

2202
01:21:01,079 --> 01:21:05,579
yields leveled out so that one single

2203
01:21:03,779 --> 01:21:08,219
change which was basically nothing we

2204
01:21:05,579 --> 01:21:09,779
didn't change anything except for the

2205
01:21:08,219 --> 01:21:12,600
way they're Distributing the nematodes

2206
01:21:09,779 --> 01:21:15,000
leads to a 30 increase in yield because

2207
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:17,400
now everything's performing the same wow

2208
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:19,079
so most cultivators are like man they

2209
01:21:17,399 --> 01:21:20,879
all say the same stuff doesn't matter if

2210
01:21:19,079 --> 01:21:23,158
you're Hydro or living soil big or small

2211
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:25,140
if I could just get another 20 if I

2212
01:21:23,158 --> 01:21:26,579
could just get another 30 sometimes if I

2213
01:21:25,140 --> 01:21:29,460
get another 40 percent

2214
01:21:26,579 --> 01:21:31,198
that that percentage increase that the

2215
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:34,859
cultivator is Desiring

2216
01:21:31,198 --> 01:21:37,259
is always in variation so if everything

2217
01:21:34,859 --> 01:21:38,579
performed as your good performers you

2218
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:41,340
would find that 20 to 40 percent

2219
01:21:38,579 --> 01:21:43,800
increase but cultivators don't know how

2220
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:46,319
to look for that variation right and so

2221
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:48,600
basically what we do is teach you how to

2222
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:50,759
identify that variation and in living

2223
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:53,520
soil it's through microscope assessment

2224
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:56,159
in Hydroponics it's water delivery rates

2225
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:58,440
so what we do in Hydroponics is you get

2226
01:21:56,158 --> 01:22:00,658
some one liter pitchers or something and

2227
01:21:58,439 --> 01:22:02,158
you go diagonally across your bet your

2228
01:22:00,658 --> 01:22:04,379
you know one in this corner one in the

2229
01:22:02,158 --> 01:22:06,119
middle one in this corner do that on a

2230
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:08,940
tray do that on the room

2231
01:22:06,119 --> 01:22:11,158
and Trigger your irrigation

2232
01:22:08,939 --> 01:22:13,559
um I've been in one single facility that

2233
01:22:11,158 --> 01:22:16,198
had equal distribution of liquid from

2234
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:17,520
corner to corner one single facility

2235
01:22:16,198 --> 01:22:19,678
um that was in some guys from the San

2236
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:21,659
Fernando Valley affiliated with rappers

2237
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:23,279
doing big things

2238
01:22:21,658 --> 01:22:25,019
um and they just one of the dudes from

2239
01:22:23,279 --> 01:22:27,119
the valley was good at plumbing and he

2240
01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:28,800
built a badass system and when he got to

2241
01:22:27,119 --> 01:22:30,960
the bigger scale continued building

2242
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:33,060
badass systems most of us cannabis

2243
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:35,698
Growers build atrocious irrigation

2244
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:39,480
systems at scale and so if you're

2245
01:22:35,698 --> 01:22:42,000
dumping sometimes 200 300 400 500

2246
01:22:39,479 --> 01:22:44,519
percent variation in fertilization to

2247
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:48,060
different plants that variation is where

2248
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:49,800
the bugs start right 100 so the over

2249
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:51,600
watered ones sometimes they get the bugs

2250
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:53,699
the underwater ones sometimes they get

2251
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:56,460
the bugs the ones that are Goldilocks

2252
01:22:53,698 --> 01:22:58,198
are fine okay well you need to trim your

2253
01:22:56,460 --> 01:23:00,539
irrigation system to get at least

2254
01:22:58,198 --> 01:23:02,759
reasonably consistent distribution

2255
01:23:00,539 --> 01:23:05,340
that one change will get you that 30

2256
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:07,140
yield because now everything's doing the

2257
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:08,400
same right you got to come by check out

2258
01:23:07,140 --> 01:23:11,460
our facility and see what we're doing

2259
01:23:08,399 --> 01:23:15,059
because I feel you yeah let's see I feel

2260
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:16,619
like as I said one of three extremely

2261
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:18,539
data driven people I've met in my

2262
01:23:16,619 --> 01:23:21,179
journey I'm sure your [ __ ] style you

2263
01:23:18,539 --> 01:23:22,738
know so yeah I would love to it's been a

2264
01:23:21,179 --> 01:23:24,300
little while here we got we got hit by a

2265
01:23:22,738 --> 01:23:25,738
semi truck in February that really shook

2266
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:27,840
our world up and we're still kind of

2267
01:23:25,738 --> 01:23:29,759
recovering yeah dude so not really up

2268
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:31,860

2300

in a hostel in Spain or some [ __ ] if it

2302

um yeah dude eternally grateful and I

2306
01:24:45,359 --> 01:24:48,539
just I just have a lot of respect for

2307
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:51,179
the way you conduct yourself in this

2308
01:24:48,539 --> 01:24:53,399
industry and you know the guys that I

2309
01:24:51,179 --> 01:24:54,840
came up with behaved a certain way I'm

2310
01:24:53,399 --> 01:24:56,399
not saying they were perfect but there

2311
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:58,739
were certain things that they did that

2312
01:24:56,399 --> 01:25:00,359
were non-negotiable and you're one of

2313
01:24:58,738 --> 01:25:02,339
like three dudes I've met my journey

2314
01:25:00,359 --> 01:25:05,460
Journey that maintains that same ethos

2315
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:07,619
Creed and code and I mean anything I can

2316
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:09,000
do to help your journey you let me know

2317
01:25:07,619 --> 01:25:11,279
I don't know if they're even there's

2318
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:13,979
anything I can do but anything I can do

2319
01:25:11,279 --> 01:25:15,960
reciprocate you saving me from getting

2320
01:25:13,979 --> 01:25:18,299
stuck in Spain you're in a world shut

2321
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:20,100
down I got your back you know and I just

2322
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:22,440
I just have a lot of respect for how you

2323
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:23,820
move through the industry and you know

2324
01:25:22,439 --> 01:25:25,859
there's a lot of people especially in

2325
01:25:23,819 --> 01:25:28,799
the breeding world to do some kooky

2326
01:25:25,859 --> 01:25:30,899
stuff and you know they're not real and

2327
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:32,579
transparent and if I ever have anybody

2328
01:25:30,899 --> 01:25:34,979
that needs a bunch of seeds there's one

2329
01:25:32,579 --> 01:25:37,260
name I call is James that's it I don't

2330
01:25:34,979 --> 01:25:39,119
think there's nobody else you know and

2331
01:25:37,260 --> 01:25:40,679
you the few people I've sent your way

2332
01:25:39,119 --> 01:25:43,500
have had nothing but good things to say

2333
01:25:40,679 --> 01:25:45,658
and I just I appreciate that because my

2334
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:47,640
results a lot of times are dictated by

2335
01:25:45,658 --> 01:25:49,979
the genetics if I got bad genetics I can

2336
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:52,199
only do so much with it and if I got a

2337
01:25:49,979 --> 01:25:54,419
hemp grower that gets a bunch of hot

2338
01:25:52,198 --> 01:25:57,119
Hermie BS that's a problem you know what

2339
01:25:54,420 --> 01:25:59,219
I mean and you know I can trust that

2340
01:25:57,119 --> 01:26:01,500
your autoflowers are gonna work they're

2341
01:25:59,219 --> 01:26:03,899
not going to be some 1992 nonsense like

2342
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:05,760
they're real you know and thank you

2343
01:26:03,899 --> 01:26:08,099
people can count on what you're doing

2344
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:09,659
and I'm still I'm still trying to help

2345
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:11,280
the push that auto flowers are real I

2346
01:26:09,658 --> 01:26:13,619
got some crazy faces from people when I

2347
01:26:11,279 --> 01:26:15,000
recommend autoflowers but I believe it

2348
01:26:13,619 --> 01:26:17,698
and I believe that you've put in the

2349
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:19,859
work and I I hope that other people are

2350
01:26:17,698 --> 01:26:21,059
able to identify it and recognize that

2351
01:26:19,859 --> 01:26:23,339
and I'm sure you're going to be

2352
01:26:21,060 --> 01:26:24,840
successful just because the way you move

2353
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:27,360
and there's a reason you're still around

2354
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:29,639
you know so well I feel the same way

2355
01:26:27,359 --> 01:26:32,399
about you you you and Sarah do amazing

2356
01:26:29,639 --> 01:26:35,159
stuff and you know I think even with

2357
01:26:32,399 --> 01:26:36,960
people trying to put down living soil

2358
01:26:35,158 --> 01:26:38,579
and saying it doesn't yield you know

2359
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:40,020
there's no way to do it at scale you

2360
01:26:38,579 --> 01:26:42,059
guys have always been like no this is

2361
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:44,880
how you do it this is this is what you

2362
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:47,400
everybody should be doing so yeah if

2363
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:48,719
it's for you for sure if not but if not

2364
01:26:47,399 --> 01:26:52,379
