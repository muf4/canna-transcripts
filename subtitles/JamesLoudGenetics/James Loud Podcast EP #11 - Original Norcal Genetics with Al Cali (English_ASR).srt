needed to that was well that was the

56
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:15,299

well so I'm in the at that point I'm in

61
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,580
the process of like teaching them how to

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,598

care of all these animals in a righteous

87
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,120
way and then after the fire burn down

88
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,580
all my infrastructure now life's much

89
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,140
harder I don't have a working will I

90

92
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,760
mean there's so much I gotta run

93
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,378
generators I gotta pour gas in the

94
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:36,419
generator three times a day I gotta

95
00:03:34,378 --> 00:03:37,919
every gallon of water that comes out of

96
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:39,899
my sink or my bathroom how to move a big

97
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,458
travel trailer up and everything you

98
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,519
know everything I have to put in there

99
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:47,340
you know I have to you know the dogs uh

100
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,739
and and all the cats as well like it

101
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:53,000
just became too much you know with with

102
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:55,560
everything that I was doing I couldn't

103
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,400
uh I couldn't righteously look at myself

104
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:01,860
and and say okay well you have time to

105
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,500
maintain all of these fret ships and

106
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:07,440
networks and you have time to get taken

107
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,759
up by like nonsense on YouTube or you

108
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,878
know what I mean stuff like that and

109
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:14,280
like I needed I I can't do it part-time

110
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:17,399
I gotta cut it cold turkey right like

111
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,978
just super focus and so that's what I

112
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:22,739
did and uh

113
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:26,339
it was good it helped me progress

114
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:30,300
farther and faster uh it was lonely it

115
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:33,599
was sad uh definitely but uh I was able

116
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:35,720
to kind of crawl out of that and uh

117
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,520
about

118
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:41,280
six weeks ago now and it's two months

119
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:42,839
ago maybe I turned it back on I haven't

120
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:44,519
made any announcements or anything yet

121
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:46,560
but I've just turned it back on and then

122
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:48,120
reached out to all the individuals I

123
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,439
wanted to reconnect with and slowly and

124
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,240
kind of let them know what was going on

125
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,040
and you know what I mean sorry I haven't

126
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,418
been able to connect and whatnot but

127
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,879
like hopefully that's not the case

128
00:04:54,418 --> 00:04:59,339
anymore right it's all good man and and

129
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,918
so when I talked to you for the first

130
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:04,198
time in four four years four and a half

131
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:05,819
years you're in Thailand yeah so you've

132
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:07,620
done you know you've been planning all

133
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:12,000
these things and been very strategic

134
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:14,280
about what you've done yes yeah um

135
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,800
for the last four years also while doing

136
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:19,500
that I've been trying to find the right

137
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,000
situation you know what I mean and as we

138
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,660
all know those of us that have been in

139
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,459
this in a long time in the pre

140
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:28,800
pre-medical medical like all of that you

141
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:30,478
know and I mean the the knowledges that

142
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,919
we have from doing something for 20

143
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,439
years the skill sets that we have

144
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:36,478
they're a wanted skill set right you

145
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:38,459
know but necessarily whether you're not

146
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:40,500
you have the right funding or investment

147
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:42,719
strategies or whatever to get the right

148
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,279
Licensing in whatever state a lot of

149
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,259
it's luck of the draw a lot of it's just

150
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:48,239
big money you know so maybe you have

151
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:49,379
enough money but not enough money you

152
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,759
know I mean you think you should be able

153
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:53,100
to open up a business but because the

154
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,860
regulations cost blah blah blah or in my

155
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,479
case here in California like my County's

156
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,699
locked out they hate it they don't want

157
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:01,139
to ever let anything in ever ever and

158
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:02,759
they'll continue to try to be like that

159
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:04,259
so then I have to look outside my county

160
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:06,720
and then when you have places where

161
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:08,460
they'll have like moratoriums or you

162
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,479
have to buy the property

163
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:16,198
first and then make an application right

164
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:18,719
that's non-refundable and can say no and

165
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:20,400
then I'm in on this property for how

166
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,660
much money now land is expensive here in

167
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:23,339
California you know what I mean so

168
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,919
before you even get to even start

169
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:27,119
talking about real licensing and setting

170
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:29,698
up the infrastructure of a business

171
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,319
you're already in half a million well

172
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:32,579
you've been a self-sufficient guy your

173
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:34,560
whole we've been friends for over 10

174
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:36,899
years yes right longer than that but

175
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,300
more than that yeah and you've been a

176
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:41,279
self-sufficient guy from the beginning

177
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,780
you know you've been into genetics for a

178
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:45,538
long time we partied all over the world

179
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:48,059
together yeah you know so so it's great

180
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:49,860
so yeah there's a huge barrier for entry

181
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,019
in California it doesn't matter how much

182
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,000
you care about quality and

183
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:56,698
you know there's definitely a financial

184
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,620
barrier for entry yeah and then so

185
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:00,960
Thailand tell us about Thailand well

186
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,819
before I even get to Thailand I want to

187
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,739
tell you so I really looked I really

188
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:07,080
looked and but the problems are is that

189
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,300
like guys like me and then the guys that

190

weaving my way through it trying to find

215
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,319

00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:19,620
eye after the four months but I was

224
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,479
commuting up there it's ridiculous every

225
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,459

and uh

231
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:36,778
starting to get a little bitter you know

232
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:38,458
what I mean starting to get a little sad

233
00:08:36,778 --> 00:08:40,740
starting to like

234
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:43,259

235
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,360

these friends that are like at the top

237
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:51,959
level at the top of the game and

238
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:53,939
I can't seem to make that work you know

239
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:55,919
it it starts to get disheartening after

240

a little while I I you know I really

241

let me move some things around it's hard

269
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:53,819
for me to get out if I'm gonna go out

270
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:57,120
I'm gonna go out for a month the first

271
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:59,220
time straight I'm not going out to talk

272
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,440
to anybody that I know or I didn't even

273
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,300
think about reaching out to anybody I

274
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,560
know I did like the thought didn't even

275
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:06,899
cross my mind I went out there

276
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:09,299
completely with a blank slate my goal

277
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:11,339
was I'm gonna do the entire country I'm

278
00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:14,219
gonna go to every corner of the country

279
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:16,140
all the major cities I'm gonna see what

280
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,540
the legalities are like in those places

281
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:20,338
what what is it what is actually on the

282
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:21,778
ground happening you know I've done that

283
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:23,640
to every country that's legalized so far

284
00:10:21,778 --> 00:10:25,139
except Uruguay I've been to every single

285
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:27,240
country that's legalized or done

286
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:29,100
medicinal and because I do what I call

287
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,720
like a boots on the ground like Portugal

288
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,879
was first I went out to Portugal like

289
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,500
okay you decriminalize what is that what

290
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,000
does that mean right you know what I

291
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,278
mean like what's the real face of that

292
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,778
so that was the the mission to go out to

293
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:42,838
Thailand is to to

294
00:10:39,778 --> 00:10:45,480
to basically do three things to see what

295
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:48,779
the legalities are actually like to see

296
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:51,240
if as a foreigner I could come in and

297
00:10:48,778 --> 00:10:52,860
legitimately work within the framework

298
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,180
of how they're setting up the laws and

299
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,459
everything whether it's lawyers

300
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:59,399
licensing all that kind of stuff and

301
00:10:56,458 --> 00:11:01,259
then to find the best place to set up

302
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:04,440
the first shop and to find the best

303
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:05,759
place to put a farm in and then with all

304
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,540
of that knowledge

305
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:12,179
to come up with some kind of package

306
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:13,620
some kind of [ __ ] thing and come back

307
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:16,259
and find some of my boys and get

308
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:19,259
together and say let's go do this right

309
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:21,659
and uh so I did and I went out there and

310
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:23,759
I did all of that I went to 700 shops in

311
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:25,379
the first month that I was out there I

312
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:27,480
did another 200 shops this happened to

313
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:29,820
900 shops I haven't even scratched the

314
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,379
surface but it was a good to see like

315
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,240
okay what's the quality what do you

316
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:35,278
actually have on the Shelf you know what

317
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,100
I mean what is the quality

318
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:40,500
[ __ ] yeah I mean like you have to look

319
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,839
for for like really good top shelf you

320
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,339
really have to look I mean top top shelf

321
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:47,160
probably pretty much non-existent yeah

322
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:50,459
so they have how about compared to

323
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:52,919
Amsterdam not comparable just different

324
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:53,819
too it's completely different so first

325
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:55,740
of all

326
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,420
I know you smoked some Thai strains

327
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:00,240
before sure they have a different

328
00:11:57,419 --> 00:12:03,240
flavors I call it a spice to it they

329
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:06,120
have a a all of the genetics any

330
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:09,240
genetics if it's coming from Thailand is

331
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,959
it has like this uh this this almost

332
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:14,940
Savory spicy kind of uh

333
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:16,078
incensey kind of incense yeah yeah I

334
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,180
know exactly what you mean with the

335
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:20,039
incency with the Thai strains so you

336
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:21,419
know they're all right they're good you

337
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:23,039
know what I mean but are they what

338
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:24,299
necessarily everybody wants to buy or

339
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:26,879
the tourist or what's going to sell or

340
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:28,979
whatever okay not are they compared to

341
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:31,139
California to Amsterdam no not so much

342
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:33,060
so when you go out there I could

343
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:35,578
automatically see I can tell by smelling

344
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:39,479
the weed from the nutrients okay

345
00:12:35,578 --> 00:12:42,239
let's say 50 of the total stock in every

346
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:45,000
store out there is imported wow yeah

347
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,399
yeah and let's say of that 50 that's

348
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,720
imported

349
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:53,820
40 10 35 15 California Amsterdam oh wow

350
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,399
yeah yeah and the Amsterdam [ __ ] smell

351
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:58,079
are stands out ridiculously right

352
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,360
because it has their own look you know

353
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:01,739
they have their own yeah yeah they

354
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,360
elongate a little bit and they they all

355
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:05,278
use Mills out there you know what I mean

356
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,519
yeah it has the same smells and [ __ ]

357
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:10,379
yeah yeah how about the effect

358
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:12,600
um it's nice if you like something

359
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:14,100
mellow if you're not a proper Stoner if

360
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,200
you're like an old hippie that wants to

361
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,519
have a cup of tea and smoke a joint and

362
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,220
do some [ __ ] you know what I mean it's

363
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:23,639
nice like that right right right but uh

364
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:25,019
the problem is just like in Jamaica or

365
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:28,139
any of the other places with high

366
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:31,078
humidity it's high humidity right and uh

367
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:34,200
they allow it to ruin all of their flour

368
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:38,179
wow like

369
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:41,519
out of all those shops I went to uh

370
00:13:38,179 --> 00:13:43,799
maybe three or four of all of those

371
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,620
shops right like actually kept their

372
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:47,759
weed appropriately or kept like or had

373
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,560
high grade cash and kept that

374
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:51,600
appropriately yeah I saw one

375
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:53,879
refrigerator with hash in it wow okay

376
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,259
yeah with good passion and like wow yeah

377
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:57,659
yeah and then like so all of their

378
00:13:55,259 --> 00:14:00,179
flowers so they'll grow and I've met

379
00:13:57,659 --> 00:14:02,278
some amazing growers in Thailand

380
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:04,739
um I'm I'm gonna I have a good friend

381
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:08,220
out there and he is

382
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:10,019
I would call him my equal in Thailand

383
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:12,180
what I can do here with outdoor and with

384
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:14,519
Greenhouse in California he's the

385
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:18,778
equivalent of in Thailand yeah and

386
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:21,240
amazing [ __ ] grower and uh but the

387
00:14:18,778 --> 00:14:24,419
the problem is is after the Cure and

388
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:27,120
curing they don't do any kind of

389
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:28,259
mitigation or any kind of like hardcore

390
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,500
because you need to do hardcore

391
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:34,379
procedures with in maintaining that

392
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:36,240
proper cure right it sucks up weed or

393
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:37,620
sucks up water out of the air and then

394
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,299
they're putting it in jars and whatever

395
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,860
and it's [ __ ] getting anaerobic

396
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:42,719
bacteria in there and it's cat pissing

397
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,579
out and just oh wow it smells it smells

398
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,278
like straight ammonia it's dark it's not

399
00:14:44,578 --> 00:14:51,120
the ammonia yeah and that loses his

400
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:53,159
color 85 90 of any weed that you saw get

401
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,740
sold anywhere whether it's on a street

402
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:57,000
on the table you know what this I I

403
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,159
don't know if you've been gone on the

404
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,740
scene for a little bit but this is the

405
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:03,240
Grove terplock bag right here okay

406
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:05,579
this is what you want to cure your stuff

407
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,259
in I I'm a firm believer at first I was

408
00:15:05,578 --> 00:15:10,078
like but then we did side by side

409
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:11,519
compared to jars even and this stuff as

410
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:13,859
far as curing and they make these in

411
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,600
different they have tote sizes gram size

412
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,039
I'm a bucket guy you want to carry them

413
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,778
they have bucket sizes yeah I usually

414
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:21,778
buckets so literally I have a whole

415
00:15:18,778 --> 00:15:23,278
recipe this this controls the humidity

416
00:15:21,778 --> 00:15:26,360
right so you just have to control your

417
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:29,338
temperature down to like 60 degrees

418
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,959
it's essentially technology oh there's

419
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:33,240
technology in the bag for sure because

420
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:34,679
it's not just a mylar bag but uh it's

421
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,539
not just a [ __ ] Ziploc bag it's not

422
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:38,278
just a small proof bag it is not just a

423
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:39,659
smell pretty although it is molecular

424
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:41,759
technology there is some technology that

425
00:15:39,659 --> 00:15:43,740
goes into it yeah it's pretty impressive

426
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,480
I pretty much switched over from jars

427
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,459
because we've been using jars forever

428
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,019
because that's what there was before we

429
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:50,338
there was you know do you know when it

430
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:53,578
got ridiculous it was just back in the

431
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:56,040
day when when prices were you know 3 800

432
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:58,319
a pound for outdoor okay jars were fine

433
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:59,819
and and Walmarts around Northern

434
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,220
California would always be out of

435
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,540
[ __ ] jars out out you had absolutely

436
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,639
you had to buy them in like February

437
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:07,019
March you know what I mean stock up

438
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:08,399
because if you try to buy them at the

439
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:10,500
end of the summer it was never in the

440
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,600
fall it wasn't going to happen and uh it

441
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,100
got ridiculous is when one time I went

442
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,740
to a boy's house

443
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:20,399
and I think it's Cur maybe it's ball

444
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:22,680
yeah they make a like a [ __ ] three or

445
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,839
five gallon jar right with like a

446
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:26,819
latching top totally my boy was putting

447
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:28,500
packs in there and [ __ ] I was just like

448
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,720
okay bro this is getting expensive and

449
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,820
ridiculous but for sure 3 800 a pound

450
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,680
you can afford to spend absolutely

451
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:37,199
dollars on a jar or whatever the [ __ ] it

452
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:39,179
was you know like now it's like we got

453
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:41,399
two dollars to spend on it you got a

454
00:16:39,179 --> 00:16:44,819
Home Depot bucket or sure back in the

455
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:47,578
day I was Hardcore I used to use uh food

456
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:49,259
grade black buckets don't let no light

457
00:16:47,578 --> 00:16:50,698
in I remember the blue ones I don't

458
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:52,259
remember the black ones as much as the

459
00:16:50,698 --> 00:16:54,000
blue ones where you you know you hit the

460
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:56,278
lid on the paint I think there are paint

461
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,778
ones and they're the plastic paint ones

462
00:16:56,278 --> 00:16:59,039
and everybody up in Humboldt that I used

463
00:16:57,778 --> 00:17:00,600
to work you had to use the special

464
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:02,278
plastic wrench to get off and it had

465
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,078
that Rubber seal on the inside and [ __ ]

466
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:05,400
like that yeah yeah those were smell

467
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:07,139
proof and you could stack them in

468
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,120
storage units or whatever absolutely

469
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:11,100
they were all over the place those

470
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,678
things yeah those are great and I

471
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:16,678
developed a pretty decent curing system

472
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,540
with with buckets I do hang I do

473
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:20,100
depending on what it is and you know

474
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:22,438
what I'm doing or whatever there's

475
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:24,298
certain parts of the process that I'll

476
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:26,100
add or subtract and then I'll do a hang

477
00:17:24,298 --> 00:17:27,959
for a while and then I'll do a breakdown

478
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:29,639
and then I'll do a bucket cure yeah and

479
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:31,740
then I do the bucket cure with tossing

480
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,020
all that so that way my trimmers are

481
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,640
working on all cured you know either I'm

482
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:37,019
going to wet trim and if I can figure

483
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,299
out all that [ __ ] and I'm gonna hang in

484
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:40,859
bags and Nets and [ __ ] yeah or if I do

485
00:17:39,298 --> 00:17:42,240
my bucket trimming the thing that I

486
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:44,219
liked about the bucket trimming is if

487
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,359
you're not a poor man then at back in

488
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,600
the day you didn't have to sit around

489
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:50,038
and wait uh for everybody to bicker and

490
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:51,719
let the prices go down and all the

491
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:53,519
craziness to happen in October you know

492
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:57,720
what I mean you could you could cure

493
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:59,160
your whole crop and then slowly just let

494
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,900
you know the trimmers come through you

495
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,160
can you can control your trim group if

496
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,720
you want to have 30 [ __ ] hippies

497
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,400
there on a bus going [ __ ] mad and

498
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,679
having drama you could do that yeah and

499
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,419
if you want to have like six solid

500
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,980
people or ten solid people if whatever

501
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:12,360
you could do that and you would strip

502
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,640
the fan leaves off and let the Sugar

503
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:16,439
Leaf protect the flower yeah yeah yeah

504
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,360
so it depends so like for for

505
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,580
competition [ __ ] I would hang hole

506
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:22,079
anything competition or like super high

507
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:24,240
grade that I was trying to like keep I

508
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:27,720
let hang hole to protect

509
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:30,058
when it became a thing of like I need to

510
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,640
manage time and I need to manage space

511
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:34,200
right then it becomes okay I'm gonna put

512
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,580
together instead of having a two-man

513
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,019
Harvest team that's just basically

514
00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:39,119
hanging cutting and hanging cutting and

515
00:18:37,019 --> 00:18:41,819
hanging yeah you bring together a

516
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:43,798
four-person team you have a cutter a

517
00:18:41,819 --> 00:18:46,678
walker you have somebody like you get

518
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:48,298
like a I love trim Pro and they have

519
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:51,059
these nice little table fans that can

520
00:18:48,298 --> 00:18:52,259
clip onto anything little I think

521
00:18:51,058 --> 00:18:54,058
they're half horsepower or one

522
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:56,519
horsepower [ __ ] motor oh they're

523
00:18:54,058 --> 00:18:57,599
beautiful and then you can just cut down

524
00:18:56,519 --> 00:19:00,058
like

525
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:02,519
you know branches and then just kind of

526
00:19:00,058 --> 00:19:04,678
run them over kind of lightly and just

527
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:06,779
to take the families off in seconds yeah

528
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:08,460
and then you know back in the day when

529
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:10,798
prices were higher and people can afford

530
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:12,558
to spend money on stupid [ __ ] right then

531
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:14,460
you could have hippies out in the garden

532
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:17,220
lollipopping and Defan leaf and

533

535
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,100
we used to like to do it because it

536
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:25,019
would stress the plant out and [ __ ]

537
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:27,659
get more get a little bit more love on

it'll never ever happen again it was

559
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:22,380
because of all of the circumstances

560
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:27,120
around the world you had illegality

561
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:31,580
right all around the world and for a man

562
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:34,079
mostly 99.9 a man to take

563
00:20:31,579 --> 00:20:38,220
certain responsibilities and actions in

564
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:40,019
this illegal realm that existed uh it

565
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:42,120
took a certain type personality type

566
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:44,220
mindset would have some balls regardless

567
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:45,359
of culture regardless of culture right

568
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,400
regardless of how you're raised

569
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:50,399
regardless of religion regardless of

570
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:52,019
race uh regardless of age yeah it took

571
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,320
it took there's there was commonalities

572
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:58,740
in these mindsets and here this shining

573
00:20:55,319 --> 00:21:01,558
thing was once a year for an entire week

574
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:04,380
10 days there was a [ __ ] Cannabis Cup

575
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:05,579
this this celebrated cup that everybody

576
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,480
around the world thinks you're gonna get

577
00:21:05,579 --> 00:21:07,980
there it's going to be like the Super

578
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,120
Bowl but when the reality is you get

579
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,860
there it's some [ __ ] background

580
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:12,599
Warehouse [ __ ] you know what I mean

581

cannabis coffee shop crawls but uh

583

584
00:21:18,298 --> 00:21:22,740
only game in town in the world yeah and

585
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:25,679
people would show up and it was the most

586
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:29,640
beautiful thing to see a room of bosses

587
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:31,320
of [ __ ] bosses that run [ __ ] in their

and we get to see it now a little bit

594
00:21:42,058 --> 00:21:45,899

come out and like you know I remember

636
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:13,019
the first time I met DJ Short he told me

637
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:14,940
you need to put the seed under your

638
00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:17,220
tongue and let it acclimate to your

639
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:18,779
genetics your DNA okay so that it'll

640
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,880
respond better to you I love it you know

641
00:23:18,779 --> 00:23:22,918
and there's some crazy stuff he said but

642
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,059
he was the first person that said that I

643
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:25,620
didn't need to do tissue clay it was

644

Graham and all that stuff back in the

647
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:32,820

648
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,579
tissue culture you need to put your

649
00:23:32,819 --> 00:23:37,439
plant in the ground let it veg out and

650
00:23:35,579 --> 00:23:40,199
then take clippings off that veg plant

651
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,298
and the thing is is like

652
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,580
there is truth to what he's saying about

653
00:23:42,298 --> 00:23:46,740
like regenerating the health of a plant

654
00:23:44,579 --> 00:23:49,139
you know and that's very

655
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:51,058
old school but yeah we we had a whole

656
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:52,679
bunch of friends and then the science

657
00:23:51,058 --> 00:23:54,000
you know there was Bro Science back in

658
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:55,980
the day too and

659
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,919
all kinds of stuff

660
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:00,058
yeah

661
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:02,059
there's Bro Science and there was

662
00:24:00,058 --> 00:24:05,960
politics

663
00:24:02,058 --> 00:24:08,399
yeah yeah so this is number 18.

664
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:10,019
with uh there's three of the different

665
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,600
Fino hunts

666
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:14,038
uh three of the different cultivars that

667
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:17,038
we've selected

668
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:19,619
in there and it's pretty candy that is

669
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:22,259
delicious smooth

670
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:25,319
yeah so we're going through some stuff

671
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:27,779
right now I'm working with SF Canna on a

672
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:30,480
72 seed Fino hunt and really kind of

673
00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:32,579
diving into each each one this is the

674
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,679
second some of them it's the third time

675
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:37,319
we've they've that they've grown it out

676
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:39,360
and you you see the difference in the

677
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:40,980
sexual maturity of the plant and how

678
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:42,418
it's stabilizing and you're getting the

679
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:45,360
expressions

680
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:48,240
uh you really need to grow stuff out at

681
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:49,678
least three times yeah for sure

682
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,359
absolutely and they definitely change

683
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,220
even if you're an in guy just to your

684
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:55,798
situation and how you do things you know

685
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:57,000
what I mean because you're you're your

686
00:24:55,798 --> 00:24:59,279
own God you're creating your own

687
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,900
environment you know totally everybody's

688
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,819
a little bit different

689
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,380
so as far as genetics what's your

690
00:25:02,819 --> 00:25:06,058
favorite what do you like working with

691
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:07,200
what do you like breeding with I mean

692
00:25:06,058 --> 00:25:08,700
you've done a lot of breeding over the

693
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,120
years you've done a lot of growing yeah

694
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:16,080
uh I like kushes and citrus yeah yeah

695
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:18,359
and the the like uh like citrusy ogs or

696
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:21,058
like citrusy like tangies like citrus

697
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:22,859
cogs I love Tangy yeah I absolutely love

698
00:25:21,058 --> 00:25:24,960
Tangy I wish it was stronger I wish you

699
00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:25,879
got me hot I wish it was Stronger Yeah I

700
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,840
like the flavor

701
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,220
how do you knock on something that

702
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:31,859
tastes like fresh squeezed orange juice

703
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:34,759
like out with that seed pack or what bro

704
00:25:31,859 --> 00:25:37,558
oh which one the purple see the Purple

705
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:40,319
OG Steve right that's OG Steve's purple

706
00:25:37,558 --> 00:25:41,819
Tangy he got orange juice yeah he held

707
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:42,960
on to that [ __ ] right so I go

708
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:44,879
over the spot talk to him and [ __ ] all

709
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,798
the time you know our dogs uh we had our

710
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,419
dogs breeding [ __ ] he has one of my yeah

711
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:49,859
pups and [ __ ] like that we have like a

712
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:52,860
line of Shepherds that are [ __ ]

713
00:25:49,859 --> 00:25:54,599
amazing [ __ ] you know royalty

714
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:56,099
cannabis royalty Shepherds and [ __ ] I

715
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:58,558
was thinking about doing some [ __ ] for a

716
00:25:56,099 --> 00:26:01,219
while but anyway uh I go over there and

717
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:01,220
he don't give that up

718
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:10,259
who I think gave it to somebody but yeah

719
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,240
they did they got [ __ ] in Oklahoma

720
00:26:10,259 --> 00:26:14,158
right so there was a deal I mean he's

721
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,200
he's had a string of bad luck he's he's

722
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,520
a real good person and the problem is is

723
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,500
people take advantage of good people

724
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:21,179
well you know and I've learned that over

725
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,980
the years too you know I feel like I've

726
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:24,419
I've been on the line of where I've been

727
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,558
too good of a person you have to cut

728
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:27,299
back you have to pull it back in a

729
00:26:25,558 --> 00:26:28,740
little bit well you can always be yeah

730
00:26:27,298 --> 00:26:30,119
you have to be extremely careful you

731
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,259
know what I mean you gotta you gotta you

732
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:33,239
gotta always make sure there's insurance

733
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:35,099
policies and your [ __ ] shit's covered

734
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:37,380
in a real way when you start committing

735
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:38,579
like that you know poor Steve he held on

736
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,960
to that cut for must have been three

737
00:26:38,579 --> 00:26:42,839
years before he found the right

738
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:46,500
situation yeah and uh there was a a

739
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:48,298
farmer who had land and had commercial

740
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:51,419
greenhouses massive commercial

741
00:26:48,298 --> 00:26:55,319
greenhouses several of them yeah and uh

742
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:57,480
he applied for the permit got the permit

743
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:58,918
and uh but didn't know [ __ ] about

744
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,019
growing weed and didn't have the right

745
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:04,559
genetics yes somehow him and Steve got

746
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:06,538
put together and uh Steve says look I

747
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:08,220
will bring in my genetics I will bring

748
00:27:06,538 --> 00:27:10,500
in my workers to take care of the whole

749
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:12,360
thing blah blah blah blah right he did

750
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,339
the whole [ __ ] thing and he's one of

751
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:16,379
the guys that had that happened to were

752
00:27:14,339 --> 00:27:18,119
two weeks out they show up in the

753
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,440
[ __ ] Gates locked to the farm and

754
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:20,819
they would get through these are the

755
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,140
worst stories and there's armed guards

756
00:27:20,819 --> 00:27:23,879
and [ __ ] and like you're not getting in

757
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,020
like you're not [ __ ] like you know

758
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,960
it's happened to a bunch of our friends

759
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:30,839
too over the years and so basically cut

760
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,860
him out of 50 or whatever the deal was

761
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:34,439
or you know what I mean who knows

762
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:36,058
whatever the deal was but uh and that

763
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,038
was his big foreign I watched that

764
00:27:36,058 --> 00:27:40,259
happen he was the third guy I saw happen

765
00:27:38,038 --> 00:27:43,679

Savvy businessmen that was in this

768
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:50,460
[ __ ] game he was [ __ ] sharp and he

769
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:52,379
was a hustler and he's a hustler hustler

770
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:54,600
for sure he's a [ __ ] Hustler for sure

[ __ ] love that guy

772
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:59,339
um

773
00:27:55,339 --> 00:28:01,259
he ran into a situation uh with like

774
00:27:59,339 --> 00:28:03,658
reservation and you know what I mean

775
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:04,679
with the natives and uh where they had a

776
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:06,419
thing where they were going to be like

777
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:07,259
you know we only have to do by fed law

778
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:08,880
and we're going to do whatever the [ __ ]

779
00:28:07,259 --> 00:28:10,019
we want so [ __ ] it yeah we don't know

780
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,880
what we're doing can you come and do

781
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:13,980
that same type of similar situation

782
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,659
right and they locked him out and

783
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:17,099
instead of [ __ ] like proper security

784
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:18,299
around garage they showed up a couple

785
00:28:17,099 --> 00:28:20,339

yeah and uh okay yeah thanks for the six

800
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,919
months of work and the [ __ ] 10

801
00:28:48,058 --> 00:28:51,418
employees and the totally and the

802
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,460
genetics and the you know what I mean

803
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:56,900
and the genetics I mean people have lost

804
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,900
their genetics and the knowledge bro

805
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,360
yeah our knowledge and our skill sets

806
00:29:01,859 --> 00:29:05,278
you see it you see it in everything and

807
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:07,979
that's what science is right science is

808
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:09,900
developing techniques okay how do you

809
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:11,579
get microspheres or whatever a certain

810
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,720
size or whatever yeah you gotta do these

811
00:29:11,579 --> 00:29:14,158
set and set techniques and then it

812
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,600
happens well the same thing is in the

813
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,860
weed world the hash world you know what

814
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:18,119
I mean if you know the techniques then

815
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:19,079
you can make things happen if you don't

816
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:21,178
know the techniques you ain't going to

817
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:23,519
get it to that point yeah so this this

818
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:25,019
knowledge is important and so I've been

819
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:26,940
uh trying to figure out a way to make

820
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:28,019
the knowledge work you know and not get

821
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,919
it stolen because that's what

822
00:29:28,019 --> 00:29:30,720
everybody's happening they're getting

823
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:31,919
their genetics and their knowledge once

824
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,720
you've got my knowledge what the [ __ ]

825
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,460
use am I to you right you know what I

826
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,960
mean so I need to make sure yeah once

827
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,640
I've built your [ __ ] Kingdom for you

828
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,220
you better make sure you have good

829
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,440
contracts nowadays contracts do mean

830
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:45,659
something you know I mean

831
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,880
I still will only you know I try to work

832
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:49,799
with people I'd do a handshake deal with

833
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,059
yeah I think that's the best like if you

834
00:29:49,798 --> 00:29:52,558
wouldn't do a handshake deal with them

835
00:29:51,058 --> 00:29:55,500
why would you do a contract deal if you

836
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:57,178
don't trust them enough but uh let's

837
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,440
jump back into Thailand let's stop

838
00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:00,419

839
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,558

847
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:24,439
things happen over the most

848
00:30:20,659 --> 00:30:27,720
ridiculous innate object I've had

849
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:30,360
meetings in Amsterdam where I've shared

850
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,679
a Choco Mill with somebody and it ended

851
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:33,479
up being

852
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,919
you know the neck of the most lucrative

853
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:38,240
thing I'm doing for the next couple of

854
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:38,240
years or whatever right totally

855
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:46,079
in Thailand on my last week and a half

856
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:48,000
I'm sitting at a street food cart yeah

857
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:49,259
getting waiting for my fried shrimp to

858
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,179
be cooked up

859
00:30:49,259 --> 00:30:52,980

00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:56,038
orders some shrimp they're just standing

861
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:58,019

865
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:04,278
small talk

866
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:08,038
taking their time with the shrimp have a

867
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,538
little time to have a conversation

868
00:31:08,038 --> 00:31:11,879

00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:37,439
both look at each other and then they

883
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:38,759
just start laughing and I was like oh

884
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,798
it's in my red eyes like something

885
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:42,240
something's going on in a negative way I

886
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:43,740

00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:08,820
like I got to John got to there was like

973
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,380
four or five of us and uh I was like all

974
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:11,820
right [ __ ] that let's all pick the

975
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:13,619
different you know good [ __ ] different

976
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:15,059
[ __ ] we'll go out there because we had

977
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:16,380
to go out there anyway like a week early

978
00:35:15,059 --> 00:35:18,299
let's go out there 10 days early we're

979
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:20,760
gonna rent an RV and just [ __ ] around in

980
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:23,760
Colorado drive around and eat and smoke

981
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:25,140
and drink weed all the [ __ ] time and

982
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,980
do our little judge kits and the whole

983
00:35:25,139 --> 00:35:31,440
thing and so uh I uh very meticulously

984
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:33,900
chose every time that I've been a judge

985
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,880
like a secret judge yeah like I picked

986
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:37,920
specifically for the location extract

987
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:40,200
that year no no no no no no no no

988
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,000
because we're in Cali so our game was

989
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:43,618
stronger than their game absolutely as

990
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,639
as good you know what I mean there was a

991
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:45,720
period for about two years where they

992
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:46,920
got a little bit better than us but not

993
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:49,379
on the whole we've been [ __ ] smashing

994
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:51,599
ask sorry sorry Colorado as far as

995
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:54,119
extracted yeah flower as far as extracts

996
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:56,280
I mean even the nicotiza there he's from

997
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:58,200
here so you know I mean I feel like he's

998
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,820
doing so amazing if you're a transplant

999
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:02,098
from Cali then yeah I'm gonna take that

1000
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:03,780
credit I'm sorry absolutely

1001
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:05,880
but yeah that was so that was the year I

1002
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:07,560
entered holy water right so we had I was

1003
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,480
working with holy water with Noel and

1004
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:11,820
Mike back when everybody was together as

1005
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:13,139
holy water yep and the judges didn't

1006
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:15,300
know how to judge it remember we were

1007
00:36:13,139 --> 00:36:18,059
pouring dude we we went through ounces

1008
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:19,980
of holy water pouring pouring it out of

1009
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:21,779
you know Tony and [ __ ] yeah right yeah I

1010
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:24,960
think so yeah yeah

1011
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:26,220
um dude I so like when I did Amsterdam

1012
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,720
when I was a secret judge in Amsterdam

1013
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:29,399
when I finally got that coveted spot I

1014
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:31,019
had to win a cup to get it yeah but like

1015
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,160
I was that's what I wanted to do I

1016
00:36:31,019 --> 00:36:34,019
didn't give a [ __ ] about winning a cup

1017
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:35,338
that was nice that's to be like okay go

1018
00:36:34,019 --> 00:36:37,139
going on the [ __ ] down stage yes

1019
00:36:35,338 --> 00:36:38,940
people right party like a [ __ ] rock

1020
00:36:37,139 --> 00:36:41,219
star for the night yeah that's great uh

1021
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:43,500
Emmy speeds but I wanted I wanted the

1022
00:36:41,219 --> 00:36:45,239
ability to be a secret judge that's what

1023
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:47,099
I really wanted because essentially

1024
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:49,500
you're tasting the world's best [ __ ]

1025
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:51,300
[ __ ] for a week sure yeah you get a box

1026
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:53,039
given to you a [ __ ] absolutely like

1027
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:55,140
not what the normal judges for those of

1028
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:57,480
you that think you've been a judge at

1029
00:36:55,139 --> 00:37:00,239
high times before that's not that it's

1030
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:02,099
when you come in like a week early to in

1031
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:04,739
the high time special

1032
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:06,900
crew puts together boxes and [ __ ] you

1033
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:09,179
got to go to a safe house and you pick

1034
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:11,119
up your [ __ ] box of drugs it was all

1035
00:37:09,179 --> 00:37:13,440
about safe houses back in the day

1036
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:14,940
literally Amsterdam was the safe house

1037
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,619
drop off it was you know they had that

1038
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,659
they had the house and

1039
00:37:16,619 --> 00:37:20,700
yeah I mean those those were old school

1040
00:37:18,659 --> 00:37:22,259
you know where it wasn't like it was

1041
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:24,598
still illegal yeah it was still

1042
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:27,119
dangerous to a degree

1043
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:28,440
I took for that one I was like okay what

1044
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,940
does Amsterdam do the best what does

1045
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,800
Amsterdam offer I'm gonna let me ask you

1046
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:35,338
before I tell you what does Amsterdam

1047
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:37,680
offer there that as a as a selection

1048
00:37:35,338 --> 00:37:40,619
that you really can't get anywhere else

1049
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:42,838
including here in California lounges yes

1050
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:45,240
but as far as like a product as far as

1051
00:37:42,838 --> 00:37:47,940
like as far as a product like one of the

1052
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:49,919
competitions so I would say dude that's

1053
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:52,200
a tough idea either because but I think

1054
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,820
there is better weed and better hash

1055
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:55,019
than there was back in the day let me

1056
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:57,800
let me throw this out to you yeah

1057
00:37:55,019 --> 00:37:57,800
sativas

1058
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:05,460
that's it that's all there's still a

1059
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:07,019
handful of people doing sativas here but

1060
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,940
it's really unless you know somebody you

1061
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:10,920
cannot get a sativa right so like you go

1062
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:12,780
there yeah you can get proper sativas

1063
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,858
all day long do you know why why is it

1064
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:16,079
because they have a pricing structure

1065
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:19,679
that [ __ ] that that represents that

1066
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:21,960
right so you can get a 12 or 15 eurogram

1067
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:23,219
of Indica there yeah but if you want a

1068
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,099
pure sativa there you got to pay 20

1069
00:38:23,219 --> 00:38:27,419
grams or 20 euros yeah yeah so like now

1070
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:30,200
I think something like that maybe it's a

1071
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:33,119
little bit more now yeah but uh yeah you

1072
00:38:30,199 --> 00:38:35,699
our economy was based on illegal economy

1073
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:37,740
you know what I mean so it how as a

1074
00:38:35,699 --> 00:38:41,159
grower are you gonna [ __ ] keep your

1075
00:38:37,739 --> 00:38:43,559
lights on in a room and your risk up for

1076
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:45,299
an extra you know 30 days or whatever

1077
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:47,219
sure when you don't need to and you're

1078
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:49,440
not going to get more or the markets so

1079
00:38:47,219 --> 00:38:51,000
saturated out here that you're you're

1080
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,500
you typically aren't ever going to get

1081
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,420
more versatile than you are for an

1082
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,920
Indica no because they can't sell for

1083
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:58,079
more although I don't know the pith

1084
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,420
stuff

1085
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:03,000
power diesel Sour Diesel is not a city

1086
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:04,740
it's a hybrid I love Sour Diesel too

1087
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,639
[ __ ] my favorite strain it's

1088
00:39:04,739 --> 00:39:07,199
definitely

1089
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:09,719
it's interesting because the structure

1090
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:12,539
is very sativa leaning and the effect is

1091
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:14,759
some hybrid-ish [ __ ] amazing couch

1092
00:39:12,539 --> 00:39:18,659
back in the day was couch lock weed at

1093
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:20,400
14 depends it also depends on what Sour

1094
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:23,279
Diesel you had whether it was East Coast

1095
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,260
Sour Diesel which I didn't consider Sour

1096
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,240
Diesel like even what Amsterdam

1097
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:30,060
considers Sour Diesel I don't consider

1098
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:31,618
Saturday so like us here in Northern

1099
00:39:30,059 --> 00:39:34,858
California had

1100
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:38,099
maybe six or seven strains double bubble

1101
00:39:34,858 --> 00:39:40,259
all these uh seven times they're all

1102
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:42,780
these different little uh sour strains

1103
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:44,760
and they were all Sour Diesel they were

1104
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,859
all slightly different but like some of

1105
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,540
them had better yields than others some

1106
00:39:46,858 --> 00:39:49,799
of them are ridiculous I remember I had

1107
00:39:48,539 --> 00:39:54,300
one that I grew for about five years

1108
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:57,060
that you act do the the resin glands on

1109
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:59,420
there after if so I hang dry yeah and so

1110
00:39:57,059 --> 00:40:02,519
I would put down a panda plastic

1111
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:04,680
underneath and then when I'm moving them

1112
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:06,000
and starting to go just the tips would

1113
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:09,000
be a little bit crispy when I'm trying

1114
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,739
to bucket them up yeah and so like hash

1115
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,539
would fall off you know the resin glands

1116
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:13,679
will fall off and normally it's like

1117
00:40:12,539 --> 00:40:15,838
whatever it's just going to be part of

1118
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:17,460
the [ __ ] dirt on the floor with this

1119
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:20,820
particular should I scrape it up because

1120
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:22,500
the resin glands were full melt out of

1121
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:25,500
the [ __ ] gate like I would barely

1122
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:27,539
have to put it through a a shitty silk

1123
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:29,219
screen kefir yeah from old school before

1124
00:40:27,539 --> 00:40:30,179
they had oh you got to use Micron you

1125
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:32,159
know what I mean before all that right

1126
00:40:30,179 --> 00:40:33,779
and dude it would just you just touch a

1127
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:36,539
lighter to it and it would just pool up

1128
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:39,720
yeah you know yeah so the best Sour

1129
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:41,820
Diesel was it where I saw was that you

1130
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:44,699
know Sonoma was like the northernmost

1131
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:47,338
part of Sonoma which is uh cazadero Josh

1132
00:40:44,699 --> 00:40:48,899
Freeman he grew the best Sour Diesel

1133
00:40:47,338 --> 00:40:50,039
back in the day that was outdoor but I

1134
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:52,019
think it was the East Coast we just call

1135
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:54,179
it Sour Diesel but I think it was ecsd

1136
00:40:52,019 --> 00:40:56,280
but everybody has a different opinion on

1137
00:40:54,179 --> 00:40:58,019
what sour was what cut and you know it's

1138
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:00,119
like there's crazy stories about all of

1139
00:40:58,019 --> 00:41:02,338
them but the real Sour Diesel was the

1140
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:03,900
real Sour Diesel there was only one real

1141
00:41:02,338 --> 00:41:05,820
[ __ ] super fire one and then there

1142
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:07,800
was like a lemony they called AJ's is

1143
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:10,380
what we got it but apparently that's not

1144
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:13,980
a true story that AJ didn't have his own

1145
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:16,079
cut but it was just ecsd or sour d but

1146
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:18,179
that's a whole nother podcast yeah

1147
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,160
that's a whole nother podcast yeah if

1148
00:41:18,179 --> 00:41:22,679
you listen to if you listen to someone

1149
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:23,759
tell the story no but so much it's

1150
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:26,879
already so different and that's right

1151
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:29,099
his is his yeah that's that's not really

1152
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,980
so yeah that's New York City Diesel or

1153
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:33,240
yeah yeah but then the seeds that came

1154
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:35,159
from some of those packs that Don and

1155
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:37,379
Aaron got right that turned into some of

1156
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:40,199
the more citrusy type of apparently

1157
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:42,480
that's the literally the lion the Soma I

1158
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:44,219
think said from from that would be like

1159
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,480
Tangy and [ __ ] like that and all the

1160
00:41:44,219 --> 00:41:47,459
yeah lemony she almost was straight

1161
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:49,559
grapefruit so his was a grapefruit

1162
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:51,179
[ __ ] massive yielder but nothing like

1163
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:53,460
the East Coast Sour Diesel and they were

1164
00:41:51,179 --> 00:41:56,219
both New York's the New York Diesel and

1165
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:58,019
then the sour diesel were so far off

1166
00:41:56,219 --> 00:41:59,459
from what I knew was Sour Diesel I like

1167
00:41:58,019 --> 00:42:01,858
the New York City Diesel too it's cool

1168
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:04,199
it's got a nice [ __ ] grapefruit like

1169
00:42:01,858 --> 00:42:06,179
that Ruby Red Grapefruit I love smoking

1170
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:08,098
that too it's great but I like the high

1171
00:42:06,179 --> 00:42:12,000
from the sour diesel and it used to [ __ ]

1172
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:14,220
you up the outdoor that was 14 15 that

1173
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,679
[ __ ] used to wreck you more this stuff

1174
00:42:14,219 --> 00:42:20,098
is 30 today oh yeah that [ __ ] was

1175
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:22,259
delicious I ours was uh we had in our

1176
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:24,119
area a sour bubble was like the biggest

1177
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:26,460
the best one there's like four five good

1178
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:28,920
really really good ones you could take

1179
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:31,559
that it had when it cured out it had

1180
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:33,659
peach colored Fair like very light

1181
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:34,920
orange peach colored hairs yeah it

1182
00:42:33,659 --> 00:42:36,358
wasn't like you know like the New York

1183
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,579
would be like a darker color hair like

1184
00:42:36,358 --> 00:42:41,159
almost like a red hair yeah nothing like

1185
00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:43,560
that and uh you could just throw it in

1186
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:45,420
the dirt and piss on it and get five

1187
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:48,239
pounds off it you know what I mean like

1188
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:49,880
let alone when you those are blue that

1189
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:51,959
was our blue jeans

1190
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:52,980
you know you start to think like oh you

1191
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,240
get comfortable with these things oh

1192
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:56,579
I've been working with this thing for so

1193
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:58,318
long it's so prevalent in the area I'll

1194
00:42:56,579 --> 00:43:00,000
be able if I if I let it go this year

1195
00:42:58,318 --> 00:43:01,559
you know what I mean because we all have

1196
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,818
size restrictions on our mother rooms

1197
00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:04,858
you know what I mean some things make

1198
00:43:02,818 --> 00:43:06,960
the cut some things don't and then when

1199
00:43:04,858 --> 00:43:09,000
things don't start to perform on the

1200
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,740
other end you're like oh maybe I gotta

1201
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,719
Cut You Down a little better yeah the

1202
00:43:10,739 --> 00:43:14,219
chem sour stuff yields it yields fat

1203
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:15,059
like sourdies there's pictures of me

1204
00:43:14,219 --> 00:43:18,118
from

1205
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:19,380
15 years ago behind 12 foot Sour Diesel

1206
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:20,880
plastic you know what else you know it

1207
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:22,200
was a [ __ ] massive one one of the

1208
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,079
biggest planets I've ever seen was a

1209
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:27,000
afghoo yeah Afghan was fired it just got

1210
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:28,440
[ __ ] mad I don't even think people a

1211
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,318
lot of people don't even know the real

1212
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:33,358
napkins you know because that after that

1213
00:43:31,318 --> 00:43:35,759
sweet after that was like

1214
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:37,139
Frosty as Frosty could be it was as

1215
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,619
white as white could get yeah it was

1216
00:43:37,139 --> 00:43:39,618
just like

1217
00:43:45,059 --> 00:43:48,358
today if you had that people wouldn't

1218
00:43:46,739 --> 00:43:49,679
care they would pay indoor prices for

1219
00:43:48,358 --> 00:43:51,179
that [ __ ] if you agree right you know I

1220
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:54,179
mean because it was also spongy because

1221
00:43:51,179 --> 00:43:57,480
it was oily and yeah yeah but it was

1222
00:43:54,179 --> 00:43:59,578
yeah I mean we we weren't even [ __ ] I

1223
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:02,338
saw 15 Pounders on the regular with that

1224
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:03,900
and I saw an 18 pounder not that I did

1225
00:44:02,338 --> 00:44:06,059
personally but [ __ ] one of my boys

1226
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:08,639
did yeah a [ __ ] goddamn orange tree

1227
00:44:06,059 --> 00:44:10,078
but they grew they did a technique where

1228
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:13,078
like they pushed them down with water

1229
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:15,839
yeah every day and they grew more like a

1230
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:18,060
hedge style so instead of being like a

1231
00:44:15,838 --> 00:44:20,818
big tall orange tree style yeah they

1232
00:44:18,059 --> 00:44:23,480
grew like a massive [ __ ] hedge yeah

1233
00:44:20,818 --> 00:44:26,880
and where they find it out and then then

1234
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:29,159
yeah it's pretty cool yeah that was to

1235
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,980
[ __ ] bro I was like what I was like

1236
00:44:29,159 --> 00:44:34,019
this from in law enforcement whatever

1237
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:36,199
from Camp you'd run them on the ground

1238
00:44:34,019 --> 00:44:38,460
and then [ __ ] they'd grow up

1239
00:44:36,199 --> 00:44:40,019
you got to protect for wind and [ __ ] too

1240
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:41,940
you know what I mean you [ __ ] around and

1241
00:44:40,019 --> 00:44:43,440

1242
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:45,300
fall so you could take care of some [ __ ]

baby at work at work at work it work it

1244
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:48,599
