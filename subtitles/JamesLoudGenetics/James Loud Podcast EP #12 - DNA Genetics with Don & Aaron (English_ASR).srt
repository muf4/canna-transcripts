00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,120
with all the kind of trenches bro we

17
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:41,578
were in the trenches together doing it

18
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:43,199
before it was cool to do for sure well

19
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,759
you guys were kind of the first you guys

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,980
were the inspiration more or less for

21
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:48,899
most of the Americans to come over to

22
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:50,578
Amsterdam and like

23
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,920
potentially start a seed company I know

24
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:55,140
you guys were one of the reasons that we

25
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,120
went over as loud seeds was because you

26
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,920
guys you guys kind of put the footwork

27
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,839
down you guys kind of showed everybody

28
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,698
how it's done and you know really

29
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,739
impressive so I want to hear your story

30
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:06,840
today from the beginning of how you guys

31
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,460
got into cannabis how you got over to

32
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,700
Amsterdam all that good stuff so let's

33
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:14,339
start with uh Dawn and how you got

34
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,340
involved with cannabis and you know how

35
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,880
it evolved uh yeah I mean I've started

36
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:24,000
smoking weed when I was young and uh for

37
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:26,519
me it was mostly my mom was was smoked a

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,759
lot of weed and she used it medically

39
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:31,560
before there was medical and so growing

40
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,438
up I was always around it was always

41
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,820
just you know she was always smoking in

42
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:38,339
the living room and didn't really hide

43
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:39,899
it or anything and then later as it

44
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,799
progressed into the medical world and

45
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,118
whatever she was totally uh not just an

46
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,259
advocate but a patient you know what I

47
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,780
mean and that was the thing that helped

48
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:51,180
I watched how much it helped her and uh

49
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,159
this is like late 80s early 90s or yep

50
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,740
early 90s

51
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,180
um and and basically

52
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:58,978
um you know it helped her through a lot

53
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,118
of stuff and there was no way to

54
00:01:58,978 --> 00:02:02,159
convince me that there was something

55
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:04,078
negative connected to it regardless of

56
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,060
the laws based on the personal

57
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:09,840
experience was she smoking good weed

58
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,640
back then I mean she was back then she

59
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,680
was smoking whatever she can get but you

60
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:16,619
know in this California and California

61
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,140
in yeah Riverside yeah Riverside yeah

62
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,759
you know she was smoking whatever my dad

63
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:23,818
was getting at the time but then as we

64
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:25,799
got older and started you know doing

65
00:02:23,818 --> 00:02:28,259
things ourselves I supported her for

66
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,520
years she passed away obviously or not

67
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:31,199
obviously but she's passed away since

68
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,319
then and it always helped her even till

69
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:37,679
until she passed so for me that part of

70
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:40,318
it was I had this instant connection

71
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,080
um but how I got involved with with

72
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:45,780
Aaron was I moved to LA from Riverside

73
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,599
and I didn't know anyone right right and

74
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:51,060
so literally I was dating this girl I

75
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:53,459
was like you have a girlfriend that's

76
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,780
from La see if she knows anybody who can

77
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:56,039
score a bag of weed I don't want to

78
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,620
drive an hour and a half to Riverside

79
00:02:56,039 --> 00:03:00,659
right now and I got no hookups right and

80
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,580
literally that's what happened and the

81
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:05,699
person that came over to the house to

82
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:08,459
hook it up was Aaron oh wow and he

83
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:11,939
showed up I had a dirty ass bong he was

84
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:14,819
like talking [ __ ] the dirtiest it was

85
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:17,459
like have you ever seen like

86
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:20,098
if you try to blow a bubble into oil and

87
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:23,219
watch it pop yeah and so it'll bubble up

88
00:03:20,098 --> 00:03:24,899
it will go slow that's how it was it was

89
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:28,080
like La Brea tars pits filled with just

90
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,580
ash and and [ __ ] crud in the [ __ ]

91
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,379
it was nasty bro I didn't have a reason

92
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,080
to clean it let's just let's just say

93
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:35,459
the weed wasn't good enough

94
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,440
and I was in this transitional phase

95
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:40,140
where it wasn't like I had all my [ __ ]

96
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,579
together right so you know I think the

97
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:44,699
second time I came over I brought a

98
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:46,500
bottle for formula for 20. well so this

99
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:50,518
had to be almost got it almost good so

100
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:52,799
this was like late 90s yeah in the late

101
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,980
90s yeah nice and then yeah that it was

102
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,080
like 97.98 because the only reason why I

103
00:03:55,979 --> 00:04:00,479
know it was around that time is because

104
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,760
uh I judged the Cannabis Cup in

105
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,560
Amsterdam in 98. oh wow and that was the

106
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:08,459
first time I'd ever gone to Amsterdam

107
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,799
and my whole thing was you know that was

108
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:12,598
that was legit that was the everything

109
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,280
that everybody was doing anywhere else

110
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:16,259
was whatever you know it was in high

111
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,079
times it was whatever but Amsterdam was

112
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:20,759
where people were like Pro right that's

113
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:22,620
where it was at in the beginning it was

114
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:24,120
[ __ ] happening there well that's what

115
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,379
you that's what you're beginning that's

116
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,699
what you think because you know you're

117
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:29,040
reading High Times magazine you're

118
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:31,220
seeing all the answers and stuff and

119
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,800
Ariana with long hair and High Times

120
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:37,380
right and I'm like oh we could crush it

121
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,000
over here yeah you know and that but

122
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:40,620
like well the flower was on a different

123
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,120
level right so what you were in

124
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,519
California is on a different level bro

125
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,139
still is still is

126
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:47,399
you know you have the Spanish weed

127
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:49,319
coming into Amsterdam calling it

128
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:50,819
California right it's selling for good

129
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:54,000
but like all right so keep going on I

130
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:56,699
don't know 98 I judged the cup uh came

131
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,918
back from from Amsterdam was like this

132
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:00,660
is the [ __ ] best [ __ ] ever did you

133
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:03,839
guys go there together yeah SOLO I went

134
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,340
I went solo I went and and judged it

135
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:08,399
just to judge I bought a I didn't I

136
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:10,619
wasn't some kind of Judges kit for 200

137
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,719
bucks yeah and I went and I went down

138
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,180
the coffee shop crawl and I met all the

139
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,860
people but I wasn't like Dawn from in

140
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,019
the industry or anything at all just

141
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,879
some fan I just went to experience it

142
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:22,680
like just a fan of weed that's right

143
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:26,038
Tony from Sagar moth I remember talking

144
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:28,379
to him for for a while and like they

145
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:29,699
picking his brain and like met Soma I

146
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:32,100
met you know just you know the people

147
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:34,199
that you you ended up linking up with

148
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,000
later but we ended up renting Tony's

149
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:39,060
from soccer Master's shop from him years

150
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,740
later but yeah uh in Full Circle but so

151
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:44,038
when I came back from Amsterdam it was

152
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:46,139
like they have a lot of haze and a lot

153
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:48,000
of really bomb hash all these exotic

154
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:51,780
breakfasts I'd never been able to smoke

155
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,220
before but to be honest like we had them

156
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:54,779
with the weed you know what I'm saying

157
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,580
like the Cali weed was just super

158
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:58,799
Superior it was just on another level it

159
00:05:56,579 --> 00:06:00,659
always was and and still is like you

160
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,400
said and so when I came back from

161
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,620
Amsterdam it was like

162
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,359
bro you know we we could crush it we

163
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,180
could crush it and it took a few years I

164
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,879

198
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:36,500

200
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:42,478
and I ended up working for my buddy

201
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:45,538
right because I wasn't bringing in weed

202
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:47,038

205
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:56,280
I was staying at his house also and I

206
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:57,659
was helping him right with his work too

207
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:59,159
because obviously you know I was in

208
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,680
hiding yeah

209
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,419
you're in hiding and so so let's dive it

210
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,160
back back a couple of years before that

211
00:08:03,418 --> 00:08:09,959
you started smoking in late 80s early

212
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:12,599
90s too yeah crushing and good L.A weed

213
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:13,859
yeah it was good L.A weed and then there

214
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:16,680
was a period of time where it was like

215
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,780
swaggy weed yeah and then it was good

216
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,639
weed and back when there was real

217
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:21,959
droughts where there was times where it

218
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,460
would be really hard you know it was

219
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,779
just a certain period of life like you

220
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:28,198
know like

221
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:31,258
the junior high high school right in

222
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:33,839
that area was like you to find good weed

223
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:36,538
it was it was hard to find you know for

224
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,560
some people right and we come across it

225
00:08:36,538 --> 00:08:39,538
and

226
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:42,000
you know otherwise it'd be Street weed

227
00:08:39,538 --> 00:08:44,098
and with seeds and oh yeah the Bama we

228
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,080

230
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,240
now 400 bucks a pound which people we

231
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,459
used to I think it was 400 a pound in

232
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,620
the 90s when I were as far as the stuff

233
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:57,239
that I saw and you know there was

234
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,459
outdoor in California that was going for

235
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,440
less than 400 last year really oh yeah

236
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:04,679
and then and it's not seated and it's

237
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,880
not brick I know it's like might not be

238
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:08,039
that good it might be sprayed with

239
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:09,419
pesticides but it's who knows about what

240
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:11,519
the stuff they put in you know back in

241
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:14,819
the day oh yeah I used to get Max in

242
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,860
Riverside before I moved to L.A yeah and

243
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,660
I would get it for like 250 a pound and

244
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,778
I'd flip it from oh wow for four yeah

245
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:23,278
and that was so then because I had I had

246
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:24,600
the hookups with these other group of

247
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:27,299
people that were bringing it in and so

248
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,339
then it was on the family right family

249
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:30,838
price so that 400 price was the price

250
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:32,700
that was the normal price yeah that was

251
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:34,740
the hookup I still had seeds it still

252
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,820

00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:47,460
time when we came out into the market it

570
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:49,880

00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:53,940
the first Americans no there was

572

it was American and he brought like the

576
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:05,099
the bubble gum I think he brought the

577
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:08,719
bubble gum or Northern Lights or

578
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:08,719
something that's a whole nother podcast

579
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,600
we got to meet all these dudes and then

580
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,460
we did the seed crop and then after that

581
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:18,538
sea crab we're growing wheat again yeah

582
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,579
and

583
00:21:18,538 --> 00:21:23,038
you know then we started making our

584
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:25,918
seeds you know like and started mixing

585
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:26,940
Cali with Amsterdam and Cali that was

586
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,100
your thing is bringing the American

587
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:31,860
style genetics over there yeah exactly

588
00:21:29,099 --> 00:21:34,199
because nobody had like in Europe nobody

589
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:37,500
knew what OG Kush was so like we come

590
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:39,600
over with this whole like OG OG yeah

591
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,038
then you don't get an OG it's all Haze

592
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:43,759
you walked into the damn cream and

593
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:46,319
they're selling OJ Kush

594
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:48,298
bro you spelled it wrong I think so so

595
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:50,399
my belief on what happened over in

596
00:21:48,298 --> 00:21:52,619
Amsterdam with OG cushes

597
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,419
people brought Cuts over people brought

598
00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:55,859
some seeds over whatever but what

599
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:58,320
happened was in the selection process

600
00:21:55,859 --> 00:22:00,418
when they did crosses they selected for

601
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:01,939
Vigor and they just you know yield and

602
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:04,860
vigor

603
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:08,460
yeah they went away from the OG and Adam

604
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:11,119
you know Adam thc's head OG right they

605
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:14,759
had OG why we had OG OG yeah

606
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:17,879
but Daryl G was MK Ultra it was OG

607
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:19,500
crossed G13 or something yeah his MK

608
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,240
Ultra was legit that was a good one it

609
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,700
was legit but it wasn't like the OG

610
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,919
wheel no it wasn't like the time yeah it

611
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:28,200
was it wasn't like it was fire it was

612
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,940
gasifier but there wasn't gassy stuff

613
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,500
for a while you know even during the OG

614
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,600
phases over here there wasn't a lot of

615
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,759
good OG even we we just was there in

616
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:37,500
2012 yeah we had to bring Cali right and

617
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:40,980
then we wanted people to be able to buy

618
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:42,960
seeds and then get first smoke the weed

619
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:45,960
and then get the Cali experience because

620
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,279
like bro all those years I told you that

621
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,319
I was going to Amsterdam I'd come back

622
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:51,000
with seeds yeah and you'd grow the seeds

623
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:53,399
and it wasn't this what was was on the

624
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,079
package right it wasn't you would never

625
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,280
one time did you get anything that was

626
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:57,720
better than what you were smoking at

627
00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:00,240
home right and so it was like wait a

628
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:02,100
minute that sucks I took a risk we did

629
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,839
all this [ __ ] involved in this and then

630
00:23:02,099 --> 00:23:05,879
in the end you don't have anything that

631
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:08,220

some of this weed that they call

651
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:47,579
chocolate but we're like oh that's the

652
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,679
d-line yeah that's always one of my

653
00:23:47,579 --> 00:23:51,480
questions was how'd the d-line turned

654
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,940
into chocolate I think gray area

655
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,380
couldn't sell it as d-line you'd put it

656
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,940
on the minions d-line and nobody would

657
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,380
[ __ ] with it wow as soon as he called

658
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,940
the chocolope everybody wanted to [ __ ]

659
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:02,100
with it everyone wants chocolate yeah

660
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:04,080
yeah speaking of which I crossed the

661
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:06,298
chocolope to the banana Skittles and I

662
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:09,859
did a couple other crosses but I want to

663
00:24:06,298 --> 00:24:09,859
give you guys some seeds uh

664
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:18,240
but yeah I know I think uh you know do a

665
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,679
co-release on that or whatever I think

666
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,839
that would be cool I I like the

667
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,700
chocolope I like the Terps super cool

668
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:27,058
it's different than all the dirty stuff

669
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:30,000
now I think it's different all that

670
00:24:27,058 --> 00:24:31,319
stuff that we were smoking 12 years ago

671
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,279
yeah

672
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:38,579
is gonna start coming back

673
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:41,220
I think this fruity purpley stage that

674
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:43,798
we're in yeah dessert where they want to

675
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:45,839
say exotic there's nothing deserves

676
00:24:43,798 --> 00:24:48,839
there's nothing exotic about it they're

677
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:51,418
exotic it's got some like some Haze some

678
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:54,119
[ __ ] South Africans some Thai there's

679
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:55,860
where is exotic right like you didn't go

680
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:59,339
to some exotic place to create the

681
00:24:55,859 --> 00:25:01,619
strain so I would say it's just a name

682
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:03,480
you know there's a lot of hype behind a

683
00:25:01,619 --> 00:25:04,918
lot of it and some of it's good I mean

684
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,140
but I think it's all about having

685
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:08,700
variety right so we have a little bit of

686
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:10,679
everything because everybody you know

687
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:13,380
food food just like food it's so

688
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:14,960
subjective what you like to drink what

689
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:17,700
you like to eat what you like to smoke

690
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,440
uh you know any super silver haze I just

691
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:23,179
smoked was more exotic than some of

692
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,179
those like rents those words

693
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:27,900
exotic because I don't definitely exotic

694
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:29,819
compared to the fruity ones yeah but

695
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:32,400
just like food everyone can make

696
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:34,558
spaghetti bro yeah absolutely you know

697
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,919
what I mean spaghetti it comes in a can

698
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:36,918
yeah

699
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:42,000
we're gonna sell you if you don't know

700
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:43,619
how to make some spaghetti we're gonna

701
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,419
sell you the ingredients in this bottle

702
00:25:43,619 --> 00:25:48,839
all you gotta do is spray it a few times

703
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:50,038
okay it's just not everywhere maker

704
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:51,599
right just because they can make

705
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:53,339
spaghetti you know what I mean and so

706
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:55,558
that's kind of the difference and I mean

707
00:25:53,339 --> 00:25:58,259
we watch the bloom we watch Spain yeah

708
00:25:55,558 --> 00:26:00,899

00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:05,159
Medical

711
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:07,440
cards just so we could bring our own

712
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:09,778
weed to Spain right right when we were

713
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,820

715
00:26:11,819 --> 00:26:15,538
most part you didn't want to touch

716
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:19,259
anybody who was trying to hand you a nug

717
00:26:15,538 --> 00:26:21,480
except for like a few there's like

718
00:26:19,259 --> 00:26:25,200
a very few people

719
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:28,220
in Spain like five people how was Soma's

720
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:31,019
weed back in the day like it you know

721
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,640
the grapefruit and some of those dude

722
00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:35,158
like there was the Soma a plus which was

723
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,320
the rock Bud that was one that we saw in

724
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:39,059
the states I never saw it in Europe but

725
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:40,678
in the states that was some fire yeah it

726
00:26:39,058 --> 00:26:43,319
was the seed that he put out I never saw

727
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:46,740
it I remember Buddha's sister in Europe

728
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:50,759
and and uh diesel the diesel was the big

729
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:53,159
one but to be honest like uh I remember

730
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:55,558
a lot of weed that Soma grew that's just

731
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:58,140
that's like right just the stuff on his

732
00:26:55,558 --> 00:27:00,058
on his balcony on the summer stuff but

733
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:02,340
like yeah I smoked a lot of stuff that

734
00:27:00,058 --> 00:27:03,599
he oversaw maybe or like guided to

735
00:27:02,339 --> 00:27:05,399
people or whatever you know what I'm

736
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:07,918
saying yeah or that he had or unless he

737
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:10,620
requires anything negative but I think

738
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:12,299
it's more acquired sure well he had his

739
00:27:10,619 --> 00:27:14,278
he he know the good Growers that could

740
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:16,679
grow his strains good and right you know

741
00:27:14,278 --> 00:27:18,659
like he knows I wish he was I wish he

832
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:33,058
street is a thorough way between like a

833
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:35,339
really big shopping street and the

834
00:30:33,058 --> 00:30:37,500
police station so like they're always

835
00:30:35,339 --> 00:30:39,298
walking down our street like and they

836
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:41,398
literally get to our our window and just

837
00:30:39,298 --> 00:30:43,319
like look dude like dude like because we

838
00:30:41,398 --> 00:30:45,479
were Chief in life that's all we did

839
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:47,099
right we're in our shop like if we're

840
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:50,579
not in the grow room we're in the shop

841
00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:52,259
right or even if we one of us is in the

842
00:30:50,579 --> 00:30:54,599
grow room one of us is in the shop right

843
00:30:52,259 --> 00:30:56,099
yeah and that was cool back in the day

844
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:57,599
right as you go to the coffee shop and

845
00:30:56,099 --> 00:30:59,639
smoke the weed you'd ask them where you

846
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:01,678
can get the seeds they tell you where

847
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:03,419
and if it was let's say chocolate or La

848
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:06,059
they'd come to our shop and then we'd

849
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:08,880
show them a catalog and most the time we

850
00:31:06,058 --> 00:31:11,639
had the weed of what we were selling the

851
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,620
seeds of so then right the idea would be

852
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:16,020
smoke it first yeah see if you like it

853
00:31:13,619 --> 00:31:18,298
here's a bong load and that was so cool

854
00:31:16,019 --> 00:31:20,398
to have a store as an American in Europe

855
00:31:18,298 --> 00:31:23,278
and then you see other tourists coming

856
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:26,278
in from wherever they're from and giving

857
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:27,659
them bong loads right there and then it

858
00:31:26,278 --> 00:31:29,099
was just it was a different time you

859
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:31,140

as far as seed companies in the United

954
00:35:02,579 --> 00:35:05,699

955
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,098
most more than anybody so you guys have

956

00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,400
weather in Amsterdam yeah Arctic

989
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:23,578
weathering yeah that January that cold

990
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,980
December and January makes you walk fast

991
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:28,560
though makes you ride your bike fast for

992
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:30,900

993
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:32,099
down with it cool I'm sure Don down yeah

994
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,800

995
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:36,059
[Music]

996
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,859
all about the new [ __ ] right so it's

997
00:36:36,059 --> 00:36:39,480
like constantly finding new flavors that

998
00:36:37,858 --> 00:36:41,338
fit I think the market will stabilize

999
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,800
and then there won't be the need for all

1000
00:36:41,338 --> 00:36:45,659
these new crazy genetics as much

1001
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,820
you know I don't know we'll see I think

1002
00:36:45,659 --> 00:36:50,039
I think people see an easy and easy Lane

1003
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:52,380
and they try to just jump in it whether

1004
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:55,079
it be like everybody became a DJ in the

1005
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:57,539
90s or everybody you know is is now on

1006
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:58,920
this thing now everybody's thinking they

1007
00:36:57,539 --> 00:37:01,320
can make quick money being a seed

1008
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:03,720
company it's legal cool that's almost

1009
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:05,700
better for companies like ours it kind

1010
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:07,500
of lets the the fat rise to the top

1011
00:37:05,699 --> 00:37:10,319
without making a fat joke right because

1012
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:11,699
at the end it it does it makes you stand

1013
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,940
out what's your history what have you

1014
00:37:11,699 --> 00:37:16,439
done what what quality yeah pollen Chuck

1015
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,000
in are you just making seeds of a bunch

1016
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,440
of other people's gears or did you

1017
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,780
actually like I don't see you on Google

1018
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,659
yeah have you done something you know

1019
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:26,880
and and if you and even if you haven't

1020
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:28,618
and you just make good that's also good

1021
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,599
there's right young breeders that are

1022
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:32,460
doing great quality is everything yeah

1023
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:34,680
guys that are up in the hills that have

1024
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:36,240
been doing it longer than we have that

1025
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:39,179
don't put their names out there you know

1026
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:42,779
that have created some some legendary

1027
00:37:39,179 --> 00:37:45,059
[ __ ] you know and like yeah like it's

1028
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:47,339
not you could be

1029
00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:48,900
it's you could do a quick it's the quick

1030
00:37:47,338 --> 00:37:50,820
business right because now it's the cool

1031
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:54,180
thing they just were classified seeds as

1032
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:55,500
seeds you know there's no TNT on them so

1033
00:37:54,179 --> 00:37:56,578
that you can considered hemp you can

1034
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,559
send them anywhere from anywhere

1035
00:37:56,579 --> 00:38:00,720
technically yeah I mean some places

1036
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:02,699
might stop it and but yeah I mean

1037
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:04,618
there's phytosanitary issues all that

1038
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:07,139
but that that's all changing too like I

1039
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:08,820
mean yeah you know you can send you can

1040
00:38:07,139 --> 00:38:10,559
send hemp seeds anywhere we're living

1041
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:13,019
with phyto sanitary certificates we had

1042
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:15,960
to feed a fetal sanitary certificate and

1043
00:38:13,019 --> 00:38:19,139
sent seeds legally from Holland to

1044
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:21,000
Canada for the canopy deal yeah

1045
00:38:19,139 --> 00:38:23,338
before it was a thing like before you

1046
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,139
could even do it like that's a good one

1047
00:38:23,338 --> 00:38:28,259
yeah is we were trying to get our feet

1048
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:30,239
are sanitary in Amsterdam and there was

1049
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:32,820
like two we couldn't we we couldn't get

1050
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:34,259
it and and it all came down to we had a

1051
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:36,119
guy working for us that we ran

1052
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:38,760
everything for years who's who was like

1053
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:40,440
our brother who who was really linear

1054
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:42,839
really did things by the book and really

1055
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,858
was just like what me and Aaron needed

1056
00:38:42,838 --> 00:38:47,099
you know what I'm saying we needed

1057
00:38:43,858 --> 00:38:48,960
someone to keep us kind of on on the

1058
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:50,160
track right well it got he got to the

1059
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,199
point where the feet of sanitary

1060
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:55,500
certificate in order to get it you had

1061
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:57,779
to provide a country of origin for the

1062
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:59,338
seeds right right okay can't do that in

1063
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:01,560
Amsterdam with the Netherlands right

1064
00:38:59,338 --> 00:39:04,019
yeah because you can't at the time you

1065
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:06,599
could there was no legal place on the

1066
00:39:04,019 --> 00:39:09,300
planet to buy seeds right to obtain

1067
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:11,940
seeds so the person at the office of the

1068
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:15,539
fetal sanitary in the Netherlands uh

1069
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:17,099
kept telling him in a nice way like just

1070
00:39:15,539 --> 00:39:18,480
[ __ ] fill it out you know what I mean

1071
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:20,460
just whatever it doesn't matter it

1072
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,139
doesn't matter so linear about it and

1073
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:24,300
he's so just by the book and he said he

1074
00:39:22,139 --> 00:39:25,980
didn't get it to the point where dude

1075
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:28,800
goes listen if you want to because

1076
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:30,000
because our guy was like yeah I'll come

1077
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,740
to your office because I don't

1078
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,838
understand why this isn't possible right

1079
00:39:31,739 --> 00:39:36,179
and he goes okay meet me here at this

1080
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:39,059
time at Baba he shows up and it's a

1081
00:39:36,179 --> 00:39:41,219
McDonald's parking lot why and and

1082
00:39:39,059 --> 00:39:43,320
Pedro's like what you know what do I do

1083
00:39:41,219 --> 00:39:45,480
I go did you bring money

1084
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:47,579
and he's like yeah I go okay well it's

1085
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:49,139
just it's a it's a classic payoff bro do

1086
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:50,760
you just want you to [ __ ] pay him off

1087
00:39:49,139 --> 00:39:52,319
you know something again like whatever

1088
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,820
it's like just be ready for anything you

1089
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,160
know what I'm saying

1090
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:57,599
and that's what it was minus the payoff

1091
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:59,039
dude didn't want any money he just

1092
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,619
wanted to meet him to tell him look bro

1093
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:03,539
you don't have to be all like Wiley

1094
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:05,338
about it just fill it out yeah and I'm

1095
00:40:03,539 --> 00:40:06,960
the one to stamp it right so it's all

1096
00:40:05,338 --> 00:40:08,639
good because he knows also there was no

1097
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,559
way for him to like there's totally it

1098
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:12,358
was like a catch-22 in the rules to

1099
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:14,279
where like you had to show a comfy of

1100
00:40:12,358 --> 00:40:16,019
origin but you either dry snitched on

1101
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,640
yourself which you can't do because you

1102
00:40:16,019 --> 00:40:19,079
can't make the seed yourself right and

1103
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:20,338
there was no legal function to buy them

1104
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:22,440
but now you can buy them from all these

1105
00:40:20,338 --> 00:40:24,539
different places so at the time we

1106
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:26,639
needed this paperwork to be able to do

1107
00:40:24,539 --> 00:40:28,880
the deal with canopy and so we got it in

1108
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:32,159
the parking lot in in McDonald's wow

1109
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:34,320
crazy anyways so let's talk about Tangy

1110
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:36,719
because Tangy had its rain I feel like

1111
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:39,900
tenji was on top for a good

1112
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:41,459
three four years where it was like you

1113
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:43,260
know it actually oh gee we'll take it

1114
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:45,838
even further back let's talk about OG 18

1115
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:50,060
because that was kind of pre-tangy yeah

1116
00:40:45,838 --> 00:40:54,480
you know it was like salary OG like Hemi

1117
00:40:50,059 --> 00:40:57,059
variety yeah right and I mean I guess it

1118
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,740
was a hit with Growers yeah you know all

1119
00:40:57,059 --> 00:41:02,219
across the world

1120
00:40:58,739 --> 00:41:04,439
and then you then that was like the OG

1121
00:41:02,219 --> 00:41:07,858
era well that was big in Amsterdam too

1122
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:09,119
you get OG OG 18 flower right like there

1123
00:41:07,858 --> 00:41:10,679
was a period where you could go if you

1124
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,180
wanted OG more than likely you were

1125
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:14,519
getting OG 18 even if it was called

1126
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:16,980
something else you know a lot of times

1127
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:19,679
Sour Diesel was you know like yeah over

1128
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:21,420
on Amsterdam I saw that totally so I you

1129
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:25,739
know like and then

1130
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:29,000
uh we had Mick Crockett Dave in in right

1131

like a 16 week or something like that

1161
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:45,180
was a long flowering yeah we had Helios

1162
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:48,420
that were short flowering that you

1163
00:42:45,179 --> 00:42:50,460
squeeze them you smell Tangy but then it

1164
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:52,800
goes to like old nasty and like

1165
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:54,659
nothingness you know the real calios

1166
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,039

1167
00:42:54,659 --> 00:42:57,659
was like that full like the one that we

1168
00:42:56,039 --> 00:42:59,159
got in the bay the flavor it was the

1169
00:42:57,659 --> 00:43:00,779
flavor all the way and it was like yeah

1170
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:02,699
this guy Sean Alberts used to grow the

1171
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:04,380
[ __ ] most of he used to either grow

1172
00:43:02,699 --> 00:43:07,078
it or get it but it was just you know

1173
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:09,000
that next level Calio so like

1174
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:10,500
when he gave it to us I was like dude

1175

I'm gonna blow this [ __ ] out of the

1176
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:14,639
water right and then we started growing

1177
00:43:12,539 --> 00:43:16,800
it and then we started extracting it I

1178
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:18,539

some of it was going extraction and like

1182
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:26,700

the flower right I mean it's still a

1189
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:42,240
little bit about the flower but it was

1190
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,359
more about

1191

taking over everybody who was crushing

1200
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:10,920
everything dude and like to the point

1201
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:14,880
where we like

1202
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:17,639
we branded it you know as Crockett's cut

1203

you know Tangy Crockett's cut and

1204
00:44:17,639 --> 00:44:23,039
created

1205
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:25,139
a brand yeah around it yeah around it

1206
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:27,539
which turned out to be Crockett Family

1207
00:44:25,139 --> 00:44:29,578
Farms right and that's was

1208
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:31,139
that's how David won everything for a

1209
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:32,818
couple they want everything to the

1210
00:44:31,139 --> 00:44:34,980
industry well and it it was there was

1211
00:44:32,818 --> 00:44:37,500
like the popularity of it aspects where

1212
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:39,119
people judging there's no it stands out

1213
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,960
yeah you can't touch I mean it stands

1214
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,940
out because it stands out against

1215
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:43,500
everything else they know that so like

1216
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:45,900
there's not only the fact that it's good

1217
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:49,980
weed grown properly but it's like oh

1218
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:51,300
yeah so unique Martian one yeah it's

1219
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:53,039
going against all these other things

1220
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:55,920
that are almost the same yeah yeah and

1221
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:56,818
if you like you said Martian martial

1222
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,619
mean green

1223
00:44:56,818 --> 00:45:00,719
that's another one that we should bring

1224
00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:04,619
back and go go hunting through the seeds

1225
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:06,899
the original seeds but like

1226
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:09,300
the wow factor right there's like you

1227

00:47:32,338 --> 00:47:36,719
you know it's not

1291
00:47:34,199 --> 00:47:37,858
it's not what it was right you know and

1292
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:39,598
a lot it's definitely evolved but

1293
00:47:37,858 --> 00:47:42,299
everything evolves disco evolves into

1294
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:43,920
what disco evolved in we're like ogs of

1295
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:46,140
the industry we're not fly by nights

1296
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,760
yeah we're still around and it's tough

1297
00:47:46,139 --> 00:47:49,500
to even be I mean it's tough enough just

1298
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,060
to be around but a lot of OG's aren't

1299
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:52,619
around anymore that's true you know

1300
00:47:51,059 --> 00:47:54,420
there's a lot of people

1301
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:57,000
you know you look at all the people that

1302
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:58,500
started and also Partners you look at

1303
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,900
Partners you guys are not the only

1304
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:03,239
Partners left but some of the out of all

1305
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:05,519
the partner groups you look at thcs you

1306
00:48:03,239 --> 00:48:07,979
look at me you look at you know a lot of

1307
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:09,420
other guys yeah and you know Doug and

1308
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:10,858
Adam are still on good terms or whatever

1309
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:12,659
but a lot of guys just kind of went

1310
00:48:10,858 --> 00:48:14,159
their own ways it's hard to work with

1311
00:48:12,659 --> 00:48:16,318
people it's hard to work with people

1312
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:19,920
yeah I mean I think some of those were

1313
00:48:16,318 --> 00:48:22,619
forced evacuations for sure you know for

1314
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:25,200
sure not necessarily like just leave the

1315
00:48:22,619 --> 00:48:28,260
debt behind kind of things which kind of

1316
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:30,118
sucks you know like but right

1317
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:32,760
we've suck out we've had our ups and

1318
00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:33,838
downs you know and like yeah well you

1319
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:36,119
guys are good balance for each other

1320
00:48:33,838 --> 00:48:38,578
this is the end of the day it all boils

1321
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:41,280
down to coming back to the seeds yeah

1322
00:48:38,579 --> 00:48:43,079
you know the root of the fruit the root

1323
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:46,440
of the fruit and about the quality yeah

1324
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:48,599
and and doing it you know and

1325
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:50,579
and we're still here doing it almost 50

1326
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:52,559
years old still doing it still doing

1327
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:54,660
what we love still getting older still

1328
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:57,119
smoking good with homies bro we're gonna

1329
00:48:54,659 --> 00:48:59,639
smoke the thousand dollar in an ounce uh

1330
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:01,519
NorCal Nemo all right so how much is

1331
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:05,039
this joint is it

1332
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:07,679
ishold joints so this is probably like a

1333
00:49:05,039 --> 00:49:09,000
three grammar so you figure it's a it's

1334
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:12,559
you know it's I think a hundred dollar

1335
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,559
joint yeah ish

1336
00:49:14,099 --> 00:49:17,280
so [ __ ] who would have thought prices

1337
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,838
going up like this I mean there was

1338
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,280
expensive [ __ ] back in the day for sure

1339
00:49:18,838 --> 00:49:22,078
in L.A especially yeah bro they'd

1340
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:24,599
pre-pay five thousand bucks a pound yeah

1341
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:28,079
we paid I know the dude who sold clones

1342
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:30,539
of OG for 10 racks right had by a tray

1343
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:32,099
of clones for 10 racks

1344
00:49:30,539 --> 00:49:34,460
that's the way to do it I guess well

1345
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:36,780
that was you know how it got one time

1346
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:38,818
that's how it got spread around right

1347
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:40,920
sure that's how she got out because

1348
00:49:38,818 --> 00:49:43,559
someone else was like I'm gonna sell

1349
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:45,240
two trays for five thousand

1350
00:49:43,559 --> 00:49:47,578
it's a race to the bottom at a certain

1351
00:49:45,239 --> 00:49:49,259
point it is but at the same time quality

1352
00:49:47,579 --> 00:49:51,060
is going to dictate a lot

1353
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:52,920
if you maintain quality you're gonna

1354
00:49:51,059 --> 00:49:54,900
have longevity I mean there's if you're

1355
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,940
in that it used to be one percent and

1356
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:58,980
now I think it's like point one percent

1357
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:00,000
but if you maintain that level of

1358
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:01,380
quality

1359
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,838
you're always going to be successful no

1360
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:06,180
matter what it is no the the super fire

1361
00:50:03,838 --> 00:50:07,858
always sells no matter what I don't know

1362
00:50:06,179 --> 00:50:10,618
about a thousand dollar an ounce [ __ ]

1363
00:50:07,858 --> 00:50:12,119
but I mean there's a price point for

1364
00:50:10,619 --> 00:50:14,579
everything for everybody you know so I

1365
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:17,039
would love to get that but we just want

1366
00:50:14,579 --> 00:50:21,019
everybody to grow their own this is the

1367
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:21,019
guava gas the guava gas

1368
00:50:24,179 --> 00:50:28,019
did you roll that or was it I rolled

1369
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:29,639
that you know I rolled it with the last

1370
00:50:28,019 --> 00:50:31,739
bit of flour

1371
00:50:29,639 --> 00:50:33,598
my friends hooked me up so do you smoke

1372
00:50:31,739 --> 00:50:35,939
your joints all the way to the thing or

1373
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:38,280
do you like you I took them like almost

1374
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:40,800
halfway right around halfway on it yeah

1375
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:43,140
I'd throw it into the ashtray yeah so

1376
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,818
I'm it depending on what it is so like

1377
00:50:43,139 --> 00:50:46,318
if it's candy and it tastes good all the

1378
00:50:44,818 --> 00:50:47,579
way to the roach I might fire back up

1379
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:49,019
the next day if I know it's going to

1380
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:51,059
like this Global gas I'll probably smoke

1381
00:50:49,019 --> 00:50:52,380
it down to the roach yeah but it just

1382
00:50:51,059 --> 00:50:54,240
depends I mean like when I'm going

1383
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:56,760
through Fino hunts I want to make sure I

1384
00:50:54,239 --> 00:50:58,379
get down past like the first half inch

1385
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:00,180
do inch even if it's not that great

1386
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:02,338
because sometimes stuff gets better the

1387
00:51:00,179 --> 00:51:03,960
more you smoke it right

1388
00:51:02,338 --> 00:51:06,539
um I mean like I can't tell you how many

1389
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:08,400
times like at cannabis cups I've gotten

1390
00:51:06,539 --> 00:51:11,759
some great [ __ ]

1391
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:14,460
great weed great looking weed yep

1392
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:16,079
but then you take the first hit off of

1393
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:18,059
it and you're like

1394
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:20,099
yeah damn I just want to throw this

1395
00:51:18,059 --> 00:51:22,380
[ __ ] joint out on the five totally

1396
00:51:20,099 --> 00:51:23,760
you know just because it looks good and

1397
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:25,740
it looks good on Instagram doesn't mean

1398
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,839
it's good [ __ ] no and we were talking

1399
00:51:25,739 --> 00:51:29,459
about that

1400
00:51:26,838 --> 00:51:32,099
people holding on holding all right so

1401
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:33,179
look breeding let's just I mean like I'm

1402
00:51:32,099 --> 00:51:36,240
glad we're having this little round

1403
00:51:33,179 --> 00:51:39,358
table conversation you know for sure

1404
00:51:36,239 --> 00:51:42,719
people who hold on to multiple cuts

1405
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:43,799
like a fiend of multiple phenos of the

1406
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:45,239
same

1407
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:47,519
strain

1408
00:51:45,239 --> 00:51:49,739
right and they call it the same thing

1409
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:52,139
but they have like one two three four

1410
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:54,598
five right

1411
00:51:52,139 --> 00:51:57,420
how do you feel about that like because

1412
00:51:54,599 --> 00:52:00,180
I know it in Amsterdam

1413
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:02,220
they used we would only have one Fino

1414
00:52:00,179 --> 00:52:03,598
right that was our selectofino that was

1415
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:06,539
your selection right we killed

1416
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:08,220
everything off and then we but like we

1417
00:52:06,539 --> 00:52:12,739
would have we would it wasn't like ever

1418
00:52:08,219 --> 00:52:15,358
like oh you got Fino a and yeah

1419
00:52:12,739 --> 00:52:17,039
I mean we used to not give the best one

1420
00:52:15,358 --> 00:52:18,900
out we'd keep the best one for ourselves

1421
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:20,358
and then give the second best one or the

1422
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:23,338
third best

1423
00:52:20,358 --> 00:52:24,779
one we would only keep the one yeah we

1424
00:52:23,338 --> 00:52:25,858
wouldn't keep multiples well and it's

1425
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:28,859
like so we were talking about wedding

1426
00:52:25,858 --> 00:52:31,259
cake as an example where there was like

1427
00:52:28,858 --> 00:52:32,639
the jbz selection that was the [ __ ]

1428
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:34,500
the best wedding cake that was real

1429
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:36,900
bready and gassy and checked all the

1430
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:38,880
boxes right you know yielded fairly well

1431
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:40,858
and it was super photogenic and smoking

1432
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,960
but then he sold seeds of it and so the

1433
00:52:40,858 --> 00:52:44,699
seeds got spread out everywhere and so

1434
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,139
there's 30 different phenos of what

1435
00:52:44,699 --> 00:52:47,818
people think is called the same thing

1436
00:52:46,139 --> 00:52:50,338
yeah they think that's what it is and

1437
00:52:47,818 --> 00:52:51,239
really what in my mind is the best one

1438
00:52:50,338 --> 00:52:52,799
you know

1439
00:52:51,239 --> 00:52:55,019
yeah so

1440
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:57,180
we like to find the Fino that we like

1441
00:52:55,019 --> 00:52:59,900
and then we like to self that Vino most

1442
00:52:57,179 --> 00:53:02,779
the time right right unless it hurts

1443
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:05,400
yeah

1444
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:07,859
part of it yeah I mean calling out that

1445
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:10,139
stuff but I think like nowadays I I

1446
00:53:07,858 --> 00:53:11,578
agree I have to look now you got to look

1447
00:53:10,139 --> 00:53:13,078
through everything I mean the thing is

1448
00:53:11,579 --> 00:53:15,180
is like you get some really exciting

1449
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:17,220
stuff that harms though there's some

1450
00:53:15,179 --> 00:53:18,719
exciting genetics if you want to work

1451
00:53:17,219 --> 00:53:21,659
with it but you can breathe that out two

1452
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:23,338
to a degree it's just I I used to be

1453
00:53:21,659 --> 00:53:24,838
exactly like someone at her so the funny

1454
00:53:23,338 --> 00:53:26,279
thing is when I started out in the

1455
00:53:24,838 --> 00:53:27,719
industry with the whole seed thing I was

1456
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,760
against feminized seeds and I was like

1457
00:53:27,719 --> 00:53:33,980
that's the devil feminine seeds are bad

1458
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:36,140
it's ruining the genetic [ __ ] lines

1459
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:38,760
get knowledge

1460
00:53:36,139 --> 00:53:40,259
yeah and I do that with feminized and

1461
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:42,240
then I did with Autoflower and like

1462
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:43,619
Autoflower sucks I'd never grow

1463
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:44,879
Autoflower I don't stand behind that

1464
00:53:43,619 --> 00:53:47,280
stuff but then once you get into Auto

1465
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:50,640
Farm you see it's like [ __ ] dude it

1466
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:51,660
serves a purpose it has value and it you

1467
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:53,279
know if they're good genetics they're

1468
00:53:51,659 --> 00:53:55,379
good genetics where would James loud be

1469
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:58,079
right now yeah

1470
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:59,640
if you didn't do feminized seeds and he

1471
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:01,200
just made Regular seeds we wouldn't have

1472
00:53:59,639 --> 00:54:03,358
this spot here we wouldn't be doing this

1473
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:06,719
podcast you know and I mean but that's

1474
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:09,239
how it was right there when when Ariane

1475
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:11,399
and because Aria Aryan was the first one

1476
00:54:09,239 --> 00:54:13,318
I think with the feminized seeds right

1477
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:16,160
because I remember Adam was like Dutch

1478
00:54:13,318 --> 00:54:16,159
Passion yeah

1479
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:20,400
Hank was definitely so right in there at

1480
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,260
the same time right but all around the

1481
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,358
same time yeah everyone kind of figured

1482
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:26,280
in regular seeds and

1483
00:54:24,358 --> 00:54:28,920
like we would be like they're like come

1484
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:31,740
on mate make [ __ ] feminized seeds and

1485
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:32,818
we're like nah bro you know that's just

1486
00:54:31,739 --> 00:54:35,939
you know

1487
00:54:32,818 --> 00:54:38,699
but then we did it and then that's

1488
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:41,159
all you really sell yeah right over

1489
00:54:38,699 --> 00:54:42,960
since since we started similar femini

1490
00:54:41,159 --> 00:54:44,399
seeds that's all you know and then the

1491
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,720
thing like with autofire obviously they

1492
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,880
need to be Femme because for the most

1493
00:54:45,719 --> 00:54:49,500
part when I'm doing them besides retail

1494
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,700
the majority of the bread and butter is

1495
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:53,338
actually going to Farms where they grow

1496
00:54:50,699 --> 00:54:56,659
an acre two acres three acres you can't

1497
00:54:53,338 --> 00:54:56,659
do that with reg seeds no

1498
00:54:57,079 --> 00:55:01,980
no you can't do it with regular seeds

1499
00:54:59,639 --> 00:55:03,960
you can no you know but I've sold rag

1500
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:07,219
seeds and I gotta order from someone in

1501
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:11,280
Mexico that wanted me to make uh [ __ ]

1502
00:55:07,219 --> 00:55:13,379
20 dudes 20 pounds of red seeds for them

1503
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:15,720
to get started and then they were just

1504
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:17,460
gonna have Labor pull out all the males

1505
00:55:15,719 --> 00:55:19,618
and it's like dude that's just

1506
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:21,559
it's such a short window and you'll miss

1507
00:55:19,619 --> 00:55:24,000
a lot of stuff

1508
00:55:21,559 --> 00:55:25,859
even if you have cheap labor it's not

1509
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,079
reality right it's still run through the

1510
00:55:25,858 --> 00:55:30,779
field and mark the winners yeah and

1511
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:35,099
still get pollinated and just

1512
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:37,740
keep some Hermits so yeah what's your

1513
00:55:35,099 --> 00:55:40,140
ideal final hunt size speaking of oh I

1514
00:55:37,739 --> 00:55:42,000
mean marking stuff it's varied bro yeah

1515
00:55:40,139 --> 00:55:43,558
you know what I'm saying like

1516
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
whims if you don't have a lot of the

1517
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:47,280
seeds that are left

1518
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,139
sure the ones that you know you gave

1519
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,880
away for free and they said hey bro

1520
00:55:49,139 --> 00:55:53,400
those things are [ __ ] amazing those

1521
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,599
freebies I know you're amazing but it

1522
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,980
comes down to this selection either way

1523
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:57,900
you know it doesn't matter if you have a

1524
00:55:55,980 --> 00:56:01,079
thousand plants or you have ten ten

1525
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:03,000
plants if your selection it's like music

1526
00:56:01,079 --> 00:56:04,318
you can write you can play music all you

1527
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,519
want you can make songs all you want but

1528
00:56:04,318 --> 00:56:07,019
if you don't have a song that resonates

1529
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:09,239
with other people doesn't [ __ ] mean

1530
00:56:07,019 --> 00:56:11,659
[ __ ] it's just you in there playing a

1531
00:56:09,239 --> 00:56:11,659
[ __ ] song

1532
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:16,739
though but but that's what I'm getting

1533
00:56:14,519 --> 00:56:17,880
back to the selection part is like if

1534
00:56:16,739 --> 00:56:19,679
you know what you're doing with

1535
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:22,680
selection you're gonna find something

1536
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:24,239
great you don't need a thousand to find

1537
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:26,759
if the seed stock that you're going

1538
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:28,318
through is is you know is good right if

1539
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:30,059
you only have a few seeds of something

1540
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:32,279
because it's that's all the seeds there

1541
00:56:30,059 --> 00:56:35,339
are then you select with what you have

1542
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:38,040
but we did Selections in Arizona on you

1543
00:56:35,338 --> 00:56:39,900
know a thousand uh uh seeds of each

1544
00:56:38,039 --> 00:56:41,818
string yeah right and we did a selection

1545
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:43,740
and we ended up with 11. Copper State

1546
00:56:41,818 --> 00:56:44,940
Copper State yeah yeah we did another

1547
00:56:43,739 --> 00:56:46,979
selection in Colombia that we just

1548
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:49,260
finished last year that was a selection

1549
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:52,139
on eighteen thousand seats right and we

1550
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:53,940
ended up with I think 10 or 12 plants so

1551
00:56:52,139 --> 00:56:55,500
in the end it's good to do those but

1552
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:58,200
most of those selections like in

1553
00:56:55,500 --> 00:57:00,780
Colombia they weren't about oh what is

1554
00:56:58,199 --> 00:57:02,399
the fire outliers you're looking for

1555
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:04,200
things that can deal with the conditions

1556
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,880
for the mold so they're going to die off

1557
00:57:04,199 --> 00:57:08,000
anything that doesn't yeah is going to

1558
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:10,800
die

1559
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,719
then that's what you're pulling from as

1560
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:14,519
far as your selection right so it's a

1561
00:57:12,719 --> 00:57:15,779
different kind of selection whereas in

1562
00:57:14,519 --> 00:57:16,800
Canada when we did the selection with

1563
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:19,200
canopy

1564
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:21,599
that when they were just Tweed they were

1565
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:22,980
trying to bind they wanted chocolope

1566
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:24,240
they wanted kosher they wanted the

1567
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:26,039
strains that we're already selling so

1568
00:57:24,239 --> 00:57:27,779
they wanted you to find them find

1569
00:57:26,039 --> 00:57:30,119
something we already found yeah so now

1570
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:31,619
you're doing on the original seeds but

1571
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:33,780
now you're going okay Aaron all right

1572
00:57:31,619 --> 00:57:35,640
bro we're going for chocolate pizza all

1573
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:36,720
right Don we're going for kosher so you

1574
00:57:35,639 --> 00:57:38,039
might find something better than

1575
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:39,659
chocolate but that's not what you're

1576
00:57:38,039 --> 00:57:41,099
looking for you're not looking for

1577
00:57:39,659 --> 00:57:43,318
something that's that's more this way or

1578
00:57:41,099 --> 00:57:45,000
that you're looking for chocolates and

1579
00:57:43,318 --> 00:57:46,739
that's actually not it's so much more

1580
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,539
difficult than people understand bro

1581
00:57:46,739 --> 00:57:50,759
it's it's I mean getting it's like

1582
00:57:48,539 --> 00:57:51,980
getting a twin I roll off one of your

1583
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:54,960
children

1584
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:57,838
I'm like that's selection yeah

1585
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:59,519
when I see the coffee it's we ran we did

1586
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:02,039
a whole film over there and it was all

1587
00:57:59,519 --> 00:58:05,838
about selection right and like between

1588
00:58:02,039 --> 00:58:08,699
every plant you're smelling coffee

1589
00:58:05,838 --> 00:58:10,259
but the funny thing about like you could

1590
00:58:08,699 --> 00:58:11,519
find one that looks right but then you

1591
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:12,900
got to dry it and smoke it and then it's

1592
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:14,880
like [ __ ] that's totally different

1593
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:16,858
because yeah yeah but you guys have done

1594
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:18,420
a lot of breeding with actual s ones

1595
00:58:16,858 --> 00:58:20,039
like if you say it's an S1 typically

1596
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:22,139
it's an S1 it's a nice one you got a

1597
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:24,058
Tangy and it says this one like but the

1598
00:58:22,139 --> 00:58:25,440
old Amsterdam model was I got train

1599
00:58:24,059 --> 00:58:28,500
wreck but I crushed it with White Widow

1600
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:30,358
to make the train or critical yeah oh I

1601
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:32,639
know we don't play that no and you guys

1602
00:58:30,358 --> 00:58:34,139
never did still the model we don't play

1603
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:36,719
that [ __ ] that's still today because

1604
00:58:34,139 --> 00:58:38,578
White Widow is like not it's it's just

1605
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:40,259
it's so it's stable it produces a lot of

1606
00:58:38,579 --> 00:58:41,760
a [ __ ] ton of pollen right right in the

1607
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:43,980
window the pollen window is really long

1608
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:46,500
with white it's not so terpy it doesn't

1609
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:48,260
really take away from whatever you right

1610
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:50,760
it's very vanilla yeah

1611
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:52,319
everything it totally if anything's like

1612
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:54,000
here and you cross with White Widow the

1613
00:58:52,318 --> 00:58:56,460
Terps are going to be half right but

1614
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,858
it'll still have similar but like OG

1615
00:58:56,460 --> 00:59:01,019
Kush with White Widow was the most trash

1616
00:58:58,858 --> 00:59:02,219
seed that I ever [ __ ] grew and I

1617
00:59:01,019 --> 00:59:04,199
bought them from couple different people

1618
00:59:02,219 --> 00:59:06,058
because I was like oh gee cush seeds you

1619
00:59:04,199 --> 00:59:07,980
know I've read I've made OG Kush seeds

1620
00:59:06,059 --> 00:59:10,680
in the past using actual OG Kush on

1621
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:12,539
different ogs and there's a lot of

1622
00:59:10,679 --> 00:59:14,460
recessive problems with recessive things

1623
00:59:12,539 --> 00:59:15,779
coming out yeah and that watered it down

1624
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:17,338
completely to it was something

1625
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:19,200
unrecognizable to most people coming

1626
00:59:17,338 --> 00:59:22,920
from California that got good weed yeah

1627
00:59:19,199 --> 00:59:24,539
right yeah so yeah don't touch those I

1628
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:27,119
mean like yeah we like what we've seen

1629
00:59:24,539 --> 00:59:29,880
the White Widow cross to

1630
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:30,900
everything I mean like we even have a

1631
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:33,358
white widow we have white widow

1632
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:35,940
chocolate and it's just a [ __ ] chunky

1633
00:59:33,358 --> 00:59:37,318
ass good white chocolate I like so there

1634
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:39,480
was a white widow that I did like though

1635
00:59:37,318 --> 00:59:41,519
we had one in in Cali that was like

1636
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:43,318
musky and it was

1637
00:59:41,519 --> 00:59:44,880
super strong called the sweat and it

1638
00:59:43,318 --> 00:59:47,279
would make you sweat and that was like

1639
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:49,680
97 we had Super Silver Haze and we had

1640
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:51,480
the sweat around like the nine late 90s

1641
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:53,338
the sweat they called it the sweat but

1642
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:55,260
it was White Widow it was a you know of

1643
00:59:53,338 --> 00:59:56,940
the northern California thing yeah I

1644
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:58,559
think so okay I think so yeah I was

1645
00:59:56,940 --> 01:00:00,119
growing I think in Richmond Richmond

1646
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:01,798
California they were growing at pumping

1647
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:03,358
out packs and it was what did you smoke

1648
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:04,920
it it didn't have a ceiling you smoke

1649
01:00:03,358 --> 01:00:06,838
more you get more High you just keep

1650
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:09,659
getting more High just super silver haze

1651
01:00:06,838 --> 01:00:11,460
right so they the stronger flowering or

1652
01:00:09,659 --> 01:00:14,699
the stronger [ __ ] smoking varieties

1653
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:16,798
yeah I mean sometimes I don't mind if I

1654
01:00:14,699 --> 01:00:17,899
can we find some haze just recently

1655
01:00:16,798 --> 01:00:21,298
somewhere

1656
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:23,818
where was A5 Haze is fire obviously

1657
01:00:21,298 --> 01:00:25,679

like I just had some Haze what's your

1659
01:00:25,679 --> 01:00:30,239
opinion on this uh NorCal Nemo

01:00:28,019 --> 01:00:33,000
it's good it's strong it's strong

1661
01:00:30,239 --> 01:00:35,759
definitely stronger is like the Skittles

1662
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:38,159

1663

01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:13,619
things because I feel like it's good for

1678
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,780
the whole industry with the industry

1679
01:01:13,619 --> 01:01:17,400
that the prices dropped so much then you

1680
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:19,859
hit these things where it's like okay

1681
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:22,260
well so prices should come back a little

1682

bit for Artisan Style things right like

1683
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:26,400

1800 an ounce no but that was the

1696
01:01:56,219 --> 01:02:01,980
Skittles like and that I think we had

1697
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:04,380
our old grow in L.A like we grew

1698
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:06,900
Skittles would come into the rotation

1699
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:09,059
wouldn't be tall enough right to make it

1700
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:11,579
into the rotation so you'd Miss

1701
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:14,640
like two crops before I can make it into

1702
01:02:11,579 --> 01:02:18,298
the rotation you missed two chances

1703
01:02:14,639 --> 01:02:20,699
silicon veg right but great weed

1704
01:02:18,298 --> 01:02:22,619

1705
01:02:20,699 --> 01:02:23,879
pain he has to grow

1706
01:02:22,619 --> 01:02:26,099
yeah

1707
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:29,460
is that why would it it's expensive I

1708
01:02:26,099 --> 01:02:31,980
mean sure I think that's also right I

1709
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:33,480
mean although my other buddy did the

1710
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:36,298
guys from SF Canada they make it yield

1711
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:37,818
like three pounds per light so but I

1712
01:02:36,298 --> 01:02:41,219
think there's different femos of it too

1713
01:02:37,818 --> 01:02:42,659
late our Indica was only worth four

1714
01:02:41,219 --> 01:02:45,480
dollars a gram because it flowered in

1715
01:02:42,659 --> 01:02:47,460
eight weeks yeah I mean but over in

1716
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:49,199

1792
01:05:37,798 --> 01:05:43,338
strains on the menu at the same exact

1793
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:47,719
time cookies now

1794
01:05:43,338 --> 01:05:47,719

renamed it would get renamed yeah yeah

1808

week I was with Danny yeah

1833
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:25,019
remember the time there was like a few

1834
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:27,538
year time period and we could say this

1835
01:07:25,019 --> 01:07:30,000
now because it's over where there was a

1836
01:07:27,539 --> 01:07:32,520
lot of because Pata had their store on

1837
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,900

1838
01:07:32,519 --> 01:07:35,519
store was here you had to walk through

1839
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:37,798
here our store was there and Danny

Shoppers in the red light right here so

1841
01:07:37,798 --> 01:07:41,880

1842
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:45,660
I'm like how many clones do you think we

1843
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:47,160

and so what are you guys doing today you

1862
01:08:22,859 --> 01:08:27,660
guys seeds bro entire ass genetics and

1863
01:08:25,198 --> 01:08:29,639
nice [ __ ] and we went for like four

1864
01:08:27,659 --> 01:08:31,198
years without making anything new the

1865
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:33,779
industry was in these weird things

1866
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:35,698
everything was strange and DNA wasn't

1867
01:08:33,779 --> 01:08:38,279
the same as it was before and now and

1868

us Europe too big yeah you guys scale

1870
01:08:41,819 --> 01:08:45,660

1879
01:09:07,319 --> 01:09:11,880

1880
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:14,279
plus new shoes sour garlic the sour

1881
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:16,020
Gilroy yeah yeah which is the 24K I like

1882
01:09:14,279 --> 01:09:18,540
better than Tangy and tangy was cool

1883
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:22,040
it's it tasted amazing but like the 24K

1884
01:09:18,539 --> 01:09:22,039
actually hit was more around yeah yeah

1885
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:28,020
some different flavors yeah totally do

1886
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:30,120
you like you know and we're

1887
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:31,440
we're able to crack some seeds you know

1888
01:09:30,119 --> 01:09:33,539
we're not going through a lot of seeds

1889
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:35,519
because right we're keeping it small and

1890
01:09:33,539 --> 01:09:37,920
and fresh but we're like

1891
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:39,179
we're going through seeds yeah you know

1892
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:41,880
and

1893
01:09:39,179 --> 01:09:44,338
we're trying to trying to find new new

1894
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:46,980
old things like we've yeah we've created

1895
01:09:44,338 --> 01:09:48,659
so many we feel like

1896
01:09:46,979 --> 01:09:49,979
the whole time in Amsterdam when you're

1897
01:09:48,659 --> 01:09:52,559
buying seeds from our shop we were

1898
01:09:49,979 --> 01:09:54,298
giving you freebies right right and some

1899
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:57,120
of those freebies were hits within

1900
01:09:54,298 --> 01:09:59,460
people but we never recreated those

1901
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:00,840
seeds yeah we'll go through some of

1902
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:02,480
those seeds we can go through some

1903
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:05,100
because we have stock of all that stuff

1904
01:10:02,479 --> 01:10:07,259
we saved we saved it all and then

1905
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:09,480
there's just germination rates right and

1906
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:12,539
like I'm thinking like oh we can do

1907
01:10:09,479 --> 01:10:13,919
embryo rescue the now Justin does it

1908
01:10:12,539 --> 01:10:16,019
yeah that's what I'm talking about it's

1909
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:17,880
just in case we need to we do embryo

1910
01:10:16,020 --> 01:10:21,300
rescue we soak the seeds we do embryo

1911
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:23,940
rescue and and hopefully the seed cracks

1912
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:26,340
in you know in vitro yeah right you know

1913
01:10:23,939 --> 01:10:28,259
and there's a lot of genetics that we

1914
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:30,840
haven't tried hash Rosen with we haven't

1915
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:32,640
you know it's old it wasn't being tested

1916
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:35,819
for that at the time and we have so much

1917
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:38,460
stock of like like we were gonna do a a

1918
01:10:35,819 --> 01:10:40,500
line of of seeds of countries that don't

1919
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:42,539
exist anymore yeah that we have in our

1920
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:43,560
stock of in our vault of just wow all

1921
01:10:42,539 --> 01:10:45,179
these different countries that aren't

1922
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:47,580
even countries anymore but they're like

1923
01:10:45,179 --> 01:10:49,500
seeds from those countries yeah they're

1924
01:10:47,579 --> 01:10:51,539
just parts of the world it's not always

1925
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:54,658
interesting growing those land race

1926
01:10:51,539 --> 01:10:57,719
varieties right I don't always I got to

1927
01:10:54,658 --> 01:10:59,460
be honest like I grew like for six seven

1928
01:10:57,719 --> 01:11:03,239
years I grew land race varieties every

1929
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:05,100
summer yeah outside and

1930
01:11:03,238 --> 01:11:06,779
I have seeds of some of those crossed

1931
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:08,820
with stuff but like for the majority

1932
01:11:06,779 --> 01:11:12,599
none of them really really like

1933
01:11:08,819 --> 01:11:15,119
wow right this is special like why I'm

1934
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:16,679
like why did I waste my time right more

1935
01:11:15,119 --> 01:11:19,198
I was more like why'd I waste my time

1936
01:11:16,679 --> 01:11:21,539
growing this because it's not so there's

1937
01:11:19,198 --> 01:11:24,479
no real wow factor no you gotta do the

1938
01:11:21,539 --> 01:11:26,939
Simon AK-47 route where you breed a true

1939
01:11:24,479 --> 01:11:29,279
F1 with getting land race and [ __ ]

1940
01:11:26,939 --> 01:11:31,319
putting the work in like that and then

1941
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:33,119
that's how I think you're hoping you

1942
01:11:31,319 --> 01:11:35,519
find me more rewarding hoping you find

1943
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:37,979
breathing like that then yeah I mean you

1944
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:40,020
want some product F1 to like stabilizing

1945
01:11:37,979 --> 01:11:42,299
you want to crack some Ghana gold across

1946
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:43,800
Tangy seeds I think I have some like I

1947
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:47,039
didn't I didn't really enjoy the Ghana

1948
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:48,600
gold but no yeah you know like I I have

1949
01:11:47,039 --> 01:11:51,000
the scenes like

1950
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:52,679
you know well there are value in those

1951
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:55,260
seeds right like yeah there's no

1952
01:11:52,679 --> 01:11:56,399
potential reading potential you don't

1953
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:58,380
ever know what you're gonna find I

1954
01:11:56,399 --> 01:11:59,519
haven't cracked them I made them yeah I

1955
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:00,779
haven't cracked them I don't know what

1956
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:02,699
I'm gonna find I didn't really dig the

1957
01:12:00,779 --> 01:12:06,119
Ghana but I kept it alive yeah and put

1958
01:12:02,698 --> 01:12:08,399
Tangy pollen on it right so I mean look

1959
01:12:06,119 --> 01:12:10,019
we love the game just as much to you

1960
01:12:08,399 --> 01:12:11,759
just as much as you do brother you know

1961
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:15,600
I'm saying we rolling the same boat yeah

1962
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:18,300
you know the plant is is what

1963
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:20,400
what God is probably everything yeah

1964
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:22,619
the reason we're here today is because

1965
01:12:20,399 --> 01:12:24,779
you know and that's it crosses so many

1966
01:12:22,619 --> 01:12:27,359
yeah exactly it brought us all together

1967
01:12:24,779 --> 01:12:29,219
right it's like it brought me to him we

1968
01:12:27,359 --> 01:12:30,899
were in Amsterdam around a big trim

1969
01:12:29,219 --> 01:12:32,640
table I'm complaining that we have too

1970
01:12:30,899 --> 01:12:34,379
much weed to trim one of the trimmers

1971
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:35,880
says I could bring my roommate I've been

1972
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:38,039
married to her for 17 years we have

1973
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:40,440
three kids amazing right if I didn't

1974
01:12:38,039 --> 01:12:43,380
have too much weed to trim I wouldn't

1975
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:45,359
know my wife right like it's it's you

1976
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:46,679
can't just it's not coincidence there's

1977
01:12:45,359 --> 01:12:48,839
none of these [ __ ] it's literally

1978
01:12:46,679 --> 01:12:50,819
just a part of our life it's every

1979
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:52,500
single thing good and I've been to jail

1980
01:12:50,819 --> 01:12:53,698
a few times because of it too a lot of

1981
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:56,460
bad things happen because of it too I

1982
01:12:53,698 --> 01:12:58,799
mean look it's an it's it's a a a cut

1983
01:12:56,460 --> 01:13:00,420
that cuts both ways right it's not it's

1984
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:03,179
good and bad but at the end of the day

1985
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:05,520
we're still here yeah and everything

1986
01:13:03,179 --> 01:13:07,199
great has come from it yeah I wonder how

1987
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:11,040
many how many Growers have married

1988
01:13:07,198 --> 01:13:13,279
trimmers a lot like there's for a

1989
01:13:11,039 --> 01:13:15,840
percentage there's definitely an actual

1990
01:13:13,279 --> 01:13:18,920
percentage all right let's let's just

1991
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:18,920
let's just put it this way

1992
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:24,719
the most people watching this podcast

1993
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:27,239
right now right have a a an idea of what

1994
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:29,698
a typical trimmer is right right that's

1995
01:13:27,238 --> 01:13:31,979
some work from the [ __ ] mountains and

1996
01:13:29,698 --> 01:13:34,079
sure okay that's not the Amsterdam

1997
01:13:31,979 --> 01:13:36,319
trimmer and what you're thinking of is

1998
01:13:34,079 --> 01:13:40,079
totally different all right

1999
01:13:36,319 --> 01:13:42,059
that's bad or anybody but his wife's

2000
01:13:40,079 --> 01:13:44,179
beautiful he met his wife it's not like

2001
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:46,739
he met his wife

2002
01:13:44,179 --> 01:13:50,039
immigrant like as she wasn't a true

2003
01:13:46,738 --> 01:13:51,779
immigrant and and that's bad yeah not

2004
01:13:50,039 --> 01:13:54,179
that it's bad but it wasn't like I was

2005
01:13:51,779 --> 01:13:56,719
like praying on my trimmers or something

2006
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:56,719
like that

2007
01:13:57,119 --> 01:14:00,059
like

2008
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:02,100
