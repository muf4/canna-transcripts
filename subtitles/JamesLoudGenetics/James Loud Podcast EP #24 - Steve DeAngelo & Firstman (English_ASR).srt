we have a space uh that is interfacing

43
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,599
with our African concerns as well that

44
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,600

better way of life you know amongst the

48

52
00:02:13,878 --> 00:02:19,439
my family you know and to see what we

53
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,239

54
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:24,120
restoration you know for our

58
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:34,000
brethren

59
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:37,400
um Steve you know um Steve and I are uh

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,878
doing this project in Jamaica um also

61
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,280
where it was hard it was hard to find

62
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:46,318
someone

63
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:49,800
who really would assist us to focus on

64
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:52,359
our African retention and to you know we

65
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,439
needed some assistance after after coid

66
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:57,959
and um we find a way out to assist each

67
00:02:54,439 --> 00:03:00,280
other by um implementing a project down

68
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:03,920
there um on R ofar and indigenous

69
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:07,360
Village this space has existed 15 years

70
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:09,479
however um after co co was frightening

71
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,120
you know Co we didn't know what that was

72
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:13,798
and we still don't know what it what

73
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,879
what the hell it was however our

74
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:19,519
standard way of functioning was to bring

75
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:22,280
in visitors and educate them in an

76
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:26,439
experiential way about our community

77
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:29,759
when Co that could you could see 50 80

78
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:31,400
people in our space after Co we decided

79
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,239
that there's no way we're going to do

80
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,480
that again and then when we looked into

81
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:38,400
it we decided that the best way we could

82
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:42,119
have smaller groups you know and um we

83
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:46,840
had some cabins and they required um you

84
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:49,560
know upgrading and so on and I spoke to

85
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,719
the great man here and we worked out

86
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,438
what we considered to be alternative

87
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:57,239
economics which is what I think where

88
00:03:54,438 --> 00:04:00,639
Steve and myself connect is that there

89
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:03,519
is the system you you know has still

90
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:05,438
govern the people who are looking to

91
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,519
make the change you know and that's what

92
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:10,318
ganja was about how can we

93
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:13,120
change how can we be different from

94
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:16,439
these systems you know rest of I call

95
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,560
them [Â __Â ] Sims you know and this is what

96
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:22,160
our journey is for us now to start

97
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:25,000
looking at alternative ways how to share

98
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:28,400
resources how to function how to speak

99
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
to each other how do we evolve our own

100
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:33,679
Community you you know without the

101
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,639
lawyers or without the this or without

102
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,918
everything else that that seems to guide

103
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,600
our relationship how can we move out

104
00:04:38,918 --> 00:04:43,758
outside of the box so that's what has

105
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,639
connected Steve and myself we move out

106
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,720
of the box with this particular project

107
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:51,079
you know and um and yeah it it has

108
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,639
brought us here it's it's still a it's

109
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:56,319
still a pilot project it's still a you

110
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:59,160
know a kind of a experiment but with

111
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:01,918
some clarity that what we're trying to

112
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,680
do is to make a change

113
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:08,279
amazing amazing so where is it located

114
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:10,800
so we are in Montego Bay um uh mon

115
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:13,119
Montega Bay we're just outside of montea

116
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,439
bay the property is called rastafara

117
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,079
indigenous Village so you know it's it's

118
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:21,800
popular in in that area if you Google it

119
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:25,478
ww. rasav village.com you'll find it and

120
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:27,079
um yeah it's it's it's kind of the last

121
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:30,199
piece of

122
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:32,800
green you know that that that is a

123
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:36,639
ecosystem where people live there and

124
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:39,120
insects and animals and rivers and so

125
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,639
everything is there as cu the the this

126
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,280
city is expanding you know human beings

127
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,560
are actually creating our own hell on

128
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:49,519
the planet we're just removing trees and

129
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:52,280
putting buildings and the place is just

130
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:55,318
getting hot hot hot and we're fulfilling

131
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:57,879
our own Bible Mission you know religion

132
00:05:55,319 --> 00:06:00,120
is still leading us straight over the

133
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:02,478
the the precipice you know so

134
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,280
yeah so that space is a preservation

135
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:05,279
space you know for a culture that has

136
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:09,959
been

137
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:12,399
so so attacked and marginalized only

138
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:14,038
because we wanted to mitigate the lies

139
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:16,359
that were told about us about the

140
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:17,879
continent of Africa so there is a

141
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,560
preservation space where all the

142
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:24,038
traditions of Rastafari that are being

143
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,560
lost you know because of systemic um uh

144
00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:29,918
discrimination over the years it has

145
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,000
really made our children not always

146
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:34,318
connecting to our community so we are

147
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,759
preserving the tradition of our food

148
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,039
tradition of our herbal knowledge with

149
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:42,000
plants the tradition of how we make

150
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:44,519
drums you know everything that requires

151
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,800
for our spirituality and our way of life

152
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:48,799
to be preserved you know that that's

153
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,360
what that space is sort of looking at

154
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,720
yeah so many things are going away

155
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,879
because of convenience exactly exactly

156
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,960
it's it's really unfortunate I mean even

157
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:00,120
if you look at some you know me having a

158
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:01,758
background as a chef you know even

159
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,639
vegetables yeah you know there's the

160
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,720
disconnect between the farmer and we we

161
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:07,400
lost that many years ago but I think

162
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,599
with Farmers Market some of the stuff is

163
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:12,120
coming back so this is one of the you

164
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:14,079
know amazing things about Rastafari

165
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:17,720
indigenous Village is that it's a it's a

166
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:21,439
place that preserves and lives by the

167
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:23,440
lessons the sacred plants teach us so uh

168
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:26,478
I encountered the village and met first

169
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:28,918
mon in 2019 when I was on a global tour

170
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:31,318
going around the world trying to see

171
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:34,198
whether changes we had made uh around

172
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:35,919
the world were worth the sacrifices that

173
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:40,000
we made in California to get those

174
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:42,198
changes and um I ended up in in Jamaica

175
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,839
and came to the village and the village

176
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:47,478
is this amazing 4 acre Oasis just 20

177
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,038
minutes away from the Montego Bay

178
00:07:47,478 --> 00:07:52,439
airport and since the village was

179
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:55,719
founded in 2007 Montego Bay has kind of

180
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:59,319
grown up around it but the village

181
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:01,680
property is this beautiful natural spot

182
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:03,479
so there's a medicinal herb garden where

183
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,560
there's more than a hundred medicinal

184
00:08:03,478 --> 00:08:08,839
herbs that are being grown and part of

185
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:11,079
the experience that visitors uh can have

186
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:14,638
is to go into that garden with Queen ey

187
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:17,198
or ner or one of our other healers who

188
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,840
understand those plants and can help

189
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,120
folks select the plants that that are

190
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:24,560
most beneficial for whatever issues they

191
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,280
may be facing and everybody's got some

192
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,478
kind of issue a little bit of tuneup

193
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:31,279
that they need for sure and then Queen

194
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:34,080

learn how to with very simple techniques

196
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,080
turn those herbs that they can go home

197
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:41,918
and grow in their own garden into

198
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:44,839
tinctures into balms into shampoos into

199

201
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:51,759
everything that's being grown is being

202
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:54,639
grown in relationships with one another

203
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:58,519
insects to plants plant to plant plant

204

Generation all the way from Africa uh a

209
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:17,278
beautiful river that runs through and

210
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:19,159
one of the things that that's just an

211
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:21,679
amazing experience is you can wake up in

212
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:23,919
the morning you can walk down to the

213
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:27,799
river and on the way to the river you

214
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:31,719
pass by these Cathedral like trees 100

215
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:36,479
feet tall 50 ft tall bamboo trees but

216
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:40,320
also mango trees Aki trees avocado trees

bread fruit trees Jun plam trees and

218
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,760
just in what you collect from those

219
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,720
trees and your walk down to the river

220
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:49,720
and back is enough to feed everybody in

221
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,000
the village amazing and uh and then

222
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,839
folks can sit down and learn traditional

223
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,839
rosari itol ways of cooking that food on

224
00:09:54,839 --> 00:10:00,200
an open fire so all about reconnection

225
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:04,279
to this natural way of life that the

226
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:07,519
sacred plants lead us to pretty amazing

227
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:10,519
pretty amazing I mean it's it's just

228
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:13,440
it's just what we have to do what we

229
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:16,120
have always been doing you know um in a

230
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,240
way we are living in a different world

231
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:21,480
you know where the world can can you

232
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:24,320
know you we're so far before a time this

233
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,600
movement R when we started to speak

234
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,680
about one love it was so

235
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,959
misconceptualized to think that it was a

236
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:33,719
one love of human beings because it came

237
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:35,399
out of our great poet Bob Marley you

238
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,160
know but it was really one love of the

239
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:41,600
planet what we're doing to the planet

240
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:44,159
and how how you know our behaviors and

241
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,920
attitudes are affecting the resources of

242
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:48,559
the of the earth and the connections

243
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:52,000
between every living thing exactly so

244
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:55,278
all of all of that was there but now the

245
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,360
world is kind of waking up to you know

246
00:10:55,278 --> 00:11:00,000
climate change you know we are seeing

247
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,680
that we have been messing up a lot of

248
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,559
things you know and it has opened up a

249
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:07,239
different kind of conversation may not

250
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:08,919
be with governments but with ordinary

251
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,919
people you know people are getting much

252
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:14,319
sicker by the fact that they're not

253
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:16,958
eating real things no more you know a

254
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,360
lot of traditions are being lost people

255
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:21,638
are recognizing that the impositions of

256
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,440
system today you know some of them have

257
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:26,720
been living in the time when it was not

258
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,680
like that and people now want to revisit

259
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,959
what their yesterday was now that they

260
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:33,638
have experience tomorrow you know so um

261
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:35,759
so there's a lot of there's a lot of

262
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:39,039
movements and and it has created this

263
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:41,039
timing for a different a more sobering

264
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:43,360
conversation instead of a conversation

265
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:46,000
of ridicule right that would normally

266
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,200
come you know the first time when Rari I

267
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,440
remember not eating meat and we decided

268
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,839
that we were italist CU we didn't know

269
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:57,680
anything about vegan you know and your

270
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,680
parents out of concern they just thought

271
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:02,599
you're going to die

272
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:04,159
right they literally just think that all

273
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,120
that is going to happen to you is that

274
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:09,159
you'll be maln and you will die pretty

275
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,679
soon you know and now the entire world

276
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:12,919
is big and big and bigon everywhere you

277
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:15,439
know so

278
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:18,198
right yeah it's amazing and I think the

279
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:21,240
big problem that often time gets gets

280
00:12:18,198 --> 00:12:24,359
overlooked is processed foods and

281
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:26,600
getting away from processed foods vegan

282
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,440
people that eat you know whatever you

283
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,278
eat meat you whatever type of diet

284
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,880
you're on I think you're better off

285
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:35,320
eating whole ingredients and you know

286
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:37,679
for for many many thousands of years we

287
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,720
ate whole ingredients it's only you know

288
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:41,278
recently that we had these processed

289
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,240
foods with all these preservatives and

290
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:44,480
these things and I mean there's

291
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,440
definitely something wrong so and I

292
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,000
think we're the time where we can

293
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,160
identify and we can all agree that

294
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
there's something wrong the world is so

295
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:55,519
educated yeah you know um it's very

296
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,879
educated now all information is at the

297
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,639
tip of your finger yeah it's almost

298
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:03,480
sensory overload yeah well whole grains

299
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:05,919
are part of it right whole anything is

300
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:09,199
part of it eating food as close to its

301
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:11,879
natural form is part of it right but one

302
00:13:09,198 --> 00:13:14,399
of the reasons that I dedicated myself

303
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:16,639
to a plant-based diet is because I've

304
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:20,240
gone all around the world advocating for

305
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:22,480
a hemp based economy and I knew that one

306
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:26,000
day somebody was going to ask me from

307
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:28,480
the crowd well Steve if you are

308
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,039
advocating for a hemp based economy can

309
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:34,320
you tell me exactly how many acres of

310
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:36,480
land it's going to take to convert our

311
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,600
current economy to a hemp-based economy

312
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,680
so I sat down and started thinking about

313
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:44,959
that and doing the calculations and what

314
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:49,679
I learned was very sober in right there

315
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:52,518
is just barely enough agricultural land

316
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:55,719
on this planet to convert ourselves to a

317
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:58,440
plantbased hemp based economy and and to

318
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,839
head off the climate catastrophe just

319
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,959
bar

320
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,160
but it's not possible to do today

321
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:07,039
because

322
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:09,639
80% 80% of the agricultural land on this

323
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:13,159
planet is being used for animal-based

324
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:14,360
agriculture wow so if you believe in a

325
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:16,439
hemp-based

326
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:20,440
plant-based economy if you really want

327
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:22,120
to get rid of fossil fuels then adopting

328
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,880
the plant-based diet is a necessary

329
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:27,278
corollary to having a hemp based economy

330
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:29,919
so that's what pushed me over the edge

331
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:33,919
I'm Italian man I love my parmesan

332
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:37,559
cheese I still miss it um but um we're

333
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:40,399
living in a time now where it's very

334
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:43,119
difficult for human beings to take

335
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:46,120
individual actions that have a real

336
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,879
impact on preserving the planet uh where

337
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,278
we don't have to go to the government we

338
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:50,879
don't have to go to an investment

339
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:53,759
committee we don't have to make an

340
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:55,759
investment all we have to do is make a

341
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:57,480
decision that we're going to eat a

342
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:59,000
little bit differently and if all of us

343
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,199
did that if all of us who who have

344
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,000
relationships with plants decided to do

345
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:07,198
that we would remove a massive amount of

346
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,399
atmospheric carbon from the air so we

347
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:11,359
have the potential to do these really

348
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:13,559
amazing things now that we've been

349
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:17,800
United by the Consciousness that these

350
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:21,000
plants spread it's amazing has to start

351
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:22,758
somewhere as far as uh legalization in

352
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,480
Jamaica you guys have had legalization

353
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:27,879
for cannabis for a while how is that

354
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:30,959
chaliz decriminalized how how do that

355
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:34,600
change the lands Cape man I tell you you

356
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:39,278
know we got the same thing um we saw

357
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:41,440
different uh type of subconscious or

358
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:43,799
implicit bias type of

359
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:47,199
colonization coming from the investors

360
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:50,078
of overseas you know mainly darting in

361
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:52,758
from Canada yeah yeah yeah yeah you call

362
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:55,399
the name yes yeah mainly coming in from

363
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:58,639
Canada and so on um as I said I don't

364
00:15:55,399 --> 00:16:01,720
I'm I'm not going to say to you that the

365
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:04,039
the move was let's go and and and

366
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:07,399
colonize you know it's just how it feels

367
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:09,439
to us you know I have no no thoughts

368
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:11,519
that there were bad intentions at the

369
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:15,800
beginning or anything like that it just

370
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:18,879
works out to be that when when when I'm

371
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:22,879
when I'm speaking about this

372
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:25,399
community I'm not expecting to see the

373
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:28,278
suits I'm really expecting to see The

374
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:31,360
Roots You know right Andrew gave me that

375
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:34,000
yes today and um I think that's what

376
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:37,000
happened too much suit you know the

377
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,278
plant does not reason like that doesn't

378
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,159
have the conversations in this type of a

379
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:47,799
way and you know we can I I have spent a

380
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:51,480
lot of time blaming governments but then

381
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:54,039
not in this industry in this industry

382
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,079
it's it's the people yeah you know we

383
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:57,159
are

384
00:16:55,078 --> 00:16:59,399
misrepresenting the behaviors and

385
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:01,799
attitude of this plan

386
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:04,279
and we can't put that on government you

387
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:07,879
know we have to put that on when we got

388
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:09,599
that opportunity to move what did we do

389
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:13,160
so when they got the opportunity to come

390
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:15,240
into Jamaica you know um everybody

391
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,600
started to behave as if they were ganja

392
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:20,199
smokers they forgot about the Legacy

393
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:23,480
Community they were not patient enough

394
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:25,558
to allow what Jamaica had contributed to

395
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:29,000
the world to be something that is

396
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:31,798
properly um packaged and structured not

397
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,519
not not just in a flurry of

398
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:39,160
advertisement but in real hardcore steps

399
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:41,720
you know to just Ure that um Jamaica and

400
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:44,360
its tradition was represented in know

401
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,038
Rastafari and what what we did you know

402
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:48,279
I

403
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:51,599
mean we were releasing so much valves in

404
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:54,759
the 70s and the and and the 60s you know

405
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:57,279
when that's all all ganja was coming

406
00:17:54,759 --> 00:18:00,759
from Jamaica and giving a lot of New

407
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:03,038
Yorkers Miami the entire us you know an

408
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:05,599
opportunity to breed from all the

409
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:08,359
systemic pressures that were coming down

410
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:10,798
on them and we know this you know and

411
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:13,798
this is why every time I speak about

412
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:17,079
these things I'm saying that we as human

413
00:18:13,798 --> 00:18:19,359
being should not hide behind government

414
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:22,678
when we get the opportunity to move are

415
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:24,959
we recognizing Legacy are we looking at

416
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:28,159
the restoration and the reparation

417
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,120
within our own Community you know and

418
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:32,720
and and and that has been to me the

419
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:35,199
issue in Jamaica so it move off too fast

420
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,240
there was no Legacy conversation the

421
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,038
people who suffered for it was not

422
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:43,279
recognized and then it just

423
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:45,798
went up to Nowhere it was just in the

424
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:48,759
mind that it was going up I don't think

425
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:51,079
of ever reflected in sales it never

426
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:54,759
reflected in nothing that it was

427
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:58,000
profitable just this idea that Jamaica

428
00:18:54,759 --> 00:19:00,119
has a branding and Taurus is going to

429
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,558
come and they're going to buy but

430
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:04,479
everyone was sold the dream everyone you

431
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:07,119
got it right man everyone was sold a

432
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,400
dream you know so that's how the that's

433
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:11,639
how decriminalization work you know at

434
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,080
the moment I think all dispensers are

435
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,520
quite

436
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:19,240
possibly um suffering because they were

437
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:21,400
trying to build an industry instead of a

438
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,200
relationship yeah with each other you

439
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,798
know we have to really find the way how

440
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,080
this PL that forces us to think you know

441
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:30,319
unless everybody is going to collapse

442
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:34,000
yeah you know everybody's going to

443
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:38,678
collapse so rastafar also got some kind

444
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:42,119
of a um preferential treatment it's not

445
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:45,480
a it's not connected with the philosophy

446
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:49,319
yeah rastafar philosophy is one legalize

447
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:52,880
the plan for every human being yeah you

448
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:54,639
know that's our like mango pop Choy and

449
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,000
it needs to be fully

450
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,000
decriminalized yeah we're having this uh

451
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,919
discussion about re scheduling and it

452
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,599
needs to be descheduled I think it's

453
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:06,280
it's just common sense yeah exactly

454
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:08,558
exactly you know so they gave us this

455
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:10,359
kind of a preferential treatment which

456
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:13,240
is now allowing us to sit with

457
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:15,399
governments and Lobby and where our

458
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:18,599
rights are and so on and so forth but

459
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:20,559
then again as I say sometimes you find

460
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:23,639
you start looking at the government and

461
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:25,960
wondering if they were not there how

462
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:28,799
would we as the community deal with each

463
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:31,159
other are we able to self

464
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:32,879
ulate I think that's a big question to

465
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:35,080
the Cannabis Community can we

466
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,640
self-regulate can we properly

467
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:40,678
appropriate you know ourselves to each

468
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:43,320
other right do we recognize

469
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:45,679
Legacy we need to so it's passed in

470
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:47,720
Jamaica in 2015 there was medical quote

471
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,400
unquote medical cannabis legislation

472
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:52,159
that was passed and as part of that

473
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:54,360
legislation Rastafari communities were

474
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:58,200
supposed to be given certain sacramental

475
00:20:54,359 --> 00:21:01,959
rights around cannabis and it was really

476
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,880
a um another example of cannabis being

477
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,558
regulated by people who do not

478
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:08,559
understand the plant and do not respect

479
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:11,038
the plant and and thereby misregulate it

480
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:13,119
I'll give you one glaring example when

481
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:15,319
you go into any of the dispensaries in

482
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:18,038
Jamaica which are by law medical

483
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:19,759
cannabis dispensaries first of all the

484
00:21:18,038 --> 00:21:21,400
only people who can afford to go in them

485
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:23,278
are tourists because the price of the

486
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,519
Cannabis is the same as the price of

487
00:21:23,278 --> 00:21:29,079
cannabis in most legal American states

488
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:31,079
in legal tax dispensaries so quite High

489
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:33,759
far higher than any Jamaicans or most

490
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:36,879
Jamaicans would be able to afford the

491
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:39,000
second is that the only form of cannabis

492
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,520
that you can get at the quote unquote

493
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,599
medical cannabis dispensaries is inhaled

494
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:47,918
cannabis hash or Bud something you have

495
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:51,319
to smoke oh man no tinctures no capsules

496
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:53,278
no cakes nothing yeah and the reason for

497
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:56,240
that is because there's a history in

498
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:59,880
Jamaica of tourists coming to the island

499
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:02,079
eating space cakes in a tea shop eating

500
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,240
too many of them ending up in the

501
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:05,519
emergency room um and then the

502
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,960
government having to deal with the

503
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:12,079
Fallout from those kinds of incidents so

504
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:15,960
in a completely ridiculous move um the

505
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:18,839
most effective format edible AR tinure

506
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,720
format for medical cannabis patients was

507
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:23,399
made illegal and the most dangerous

508
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,960
format inhaled cannabis was made the

509
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,960
only one that was available so that

510
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,600
that's one sector that was given birth

511
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,240
to by the 2015

512
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:34,719
legislation that sector is not doing

513
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,120
very well there was a second sector

514
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,880
which was an export sector and the idea

515
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:43,519
behind this sector was to take advantage

516
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:46,080
of the sunshine the low labor costs uh

517
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:49,440
of Jamaica and set up basically a

518
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:52,079
neocolonial extractive model where the

519
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,200
plants would be grown in Jamaica maybe

520
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:56,960
you would do a basic extraction in

521
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:59,400
Jamaica but then that basic extract

522
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:02,159
would be sent to Europe Europe mostly uh

523
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:05,720
for further refinement further pro pro

524
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:08,080
processing further value added right and

525
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:10,679
then be sold into the pharmaceutical

526
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:13,918
supply chain as an API An approved

527
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:15,759
pharmaceutical input that sector seems

528
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,960
to be doing a little bit better some of

529
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:19,679
the companies there that had wellth

530
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:23,000
thought out business plans and had some

531
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:25,080
financing seem to be doing some sales

532
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,359
and Thrive and maybe not thriving but at

533
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:30,240
least surviving yeah other companies in

534
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:32,038
that sector are in crisis because the

535
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,278
international market that they were

536
00:23:32,038 --> 00:23:38,079
relying on has developed much much more

537
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:40,440
slowly than was originally an

538
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:42,439
anticipated right I've seen it and then

539
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,320
there's the third part of the market

540
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,038
which which is the most interesting part

541
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:48,000
of the market because it's the only part

542
00:23:46,038 --> 00:23:51,200
of the market that's really connected to

543
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,319
this incredibly Rich ganja culture that

544
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,960
Jamaica gave birth to and it's such an

545
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:57,918
amazing gift to the world right and

546
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:01,640
that's the culture that that grew out of

547
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:04,159
rosta fari as expressed by reggae and

548
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:07,120
now adopted in one form or another by

549
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:10,840
hundreds of millions of Reggae fans uh

550
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:15,319
all around the world so that version of

551
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:17,240
cannabis in Jamaica is now found in

552
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:20,158
Rastafari community so there's

553
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:24,038
discussion that's going on um about

554
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:26,278
formally authorizing communities um and

555
00:24:24,038 --> 00:24:30,038
once that discussion is is fully

556
00:24:26,278 --> 00:24:31,398
potentiated right then the hopefully

557
00:24:30,038 --> 00:24:33,960
where we end up where we would like to

558
00:24:31,398 --> 00:24:37,319
see it end up is a situation where

559
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:40,200
visitors to the island can go and have

560
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:42,119
access to the real genuine Jamaican

561
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,319
ganja experience where you can learn

562
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:47,839
about the Rastafari history you know

563
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:51,038
rosar were vaporizing cannabis 50 years

564
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:53,879
ago wow 50 years ago and almost nobody

565
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:57,558
in the world of cannabis knows that

566
00:24:53,880 --> 00:25:00,080
right um and uh and then just the all of

567
00:24:57,558 --> 00:25:03,558
the all of the stories uh all of the

568
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:06,079
songs that that go along with all of

569
00:25:03,558 --> 00:25:08,119
that culture the way that cannabis has

570
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:12,000
influenced uh the thinking and the way

571
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:13,879
of life of of Rastafari and it's just a

572
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,038
an incredibly Rich experience for

573
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:18,559
anybody who really loves cannabis and

574
00:25:16,038 --> 00:25:21,278
it's one that so far has been you know

575
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:24,119
pretty difficult to seek out and find so

576
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:27,119
hopefully uh with uh this conversation

577
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:29,719
going on Rastafari communities will be

578
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:31,959
fully EMP powered to represent not just

579
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:34,200
the plant right because it's not just

580
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:36,079
the plant that's important it's the

581
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,519
lessons that the plant teaches us and

582
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:40,158
what we do with those totally yeah it's

583
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:41,960
really interesting some of the genetics

584
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:45,600
that have come out of Jamaica Orange

585
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:47,720
Hill so when I was in Jama I got I I

586
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:49,439
basically gave $20 to a bunch of

587
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:52,240
different people and never got anything

588
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:55,399
good when I was staying at a resort and

589
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,278
uh finally I I brought some flow from

590
00:25:55,398 --> 00:25:59,759
the States from from Hult it was some

591
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:01,759
really good good OG and I gave it to the

592
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:04,558
guy and I told him to take it to whoever

593
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:07,038
he gets stuff from and he comes back the

594
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:09,158
next day with big joints from Orange

595
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:10,599
Hill I didn't know what to expect

596
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:12,919
because I had gotten some really bad but

597
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:14,558
this it was so strong that I think it

598
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:16,960
was 10: in the morning and I woke up at

599
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:18,678
5: with my wife we woke up at 5: in the

600
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,038
bed going what the heck was that and

601
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:23,000
then we look over in the joint still

602
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:25,440
about that big so yeah I mean there's

603
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,519
some legendary Lamb's bread Lamb's

604
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,120
breath I think all you know it's a big

605
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:32,720
conversation you know you have to

606
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:36,879
remember that as rest of far we don't

607
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:39,960
see Jamaica as our home right Jamaica is

608
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:45,039
not necess it's a colonized space that

609
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:46,759
we have now to sort of by dwelling there

610
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:49,440
this is where we have to recreate

611
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:52,200
ourselves from to go home to Africa

612
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,480
that's our ultimate Mission you know and

613
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:57,399
as a result of that you know being in

614
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:00,839
spaces like those you have to you have

615
00:26:57,398 --> 00:27:03,359
to to be strong and and and powerful and

616
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:06,079
everything you do has to be potent you

617
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:09,240
know because you want to do it natural

618
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:12,000
natural natural is our potency is not

619
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:15,200
necessarily about how much percent is

620
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:19,159
here or how much it's how is how natural

621
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:21,759
you you really have have engaged with

622
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:23,440
your process you know yeah and and and

623
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:25,679
and that's one of the what that's one of

624
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,759
the things you know in in doing that

625
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,960
those messages come from the process you

626
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:34,599
know what I mean it's a different it's

627
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:37,798
cultural science you know and and you

628
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:39,719
know what prohibition did it it damaged

629
00:27:37,798 --> 00:27:41,918
that it damaged that spiritual

630
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:44,519
relationship of the cultural science you

631
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:48,159
know you you have to start storing your

632
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:50,440
Herb in some weird places you know um

633
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:53,240
you have to start putting fertilizer on

634
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:55,399
them because you need them to grow fast

635
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:58,000
you know and then you sort of bring in

636
00:27:55,398 --> 00:28:00,558
all the Hybrids because you want weeks

637
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,038
instead of 6 month you want 12 weeks

638
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:07,639
instead of 6 months so you know the

639
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:11,679
entire culture started to go through a

640
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:14,480
process of adaptation and all kind of

641
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:17,919
mixup you know kind of attitudes you

642
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:21,798
know amongst ourself so it is good that

643
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:24,960
this time is here for us to revisit you

644
00:28:21,798 --> 00:28:28,558
know um the way how we would want it and

645
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,399
want to be however the conversation is

646
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:32,398
not just so much about that the

647
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:34,959
conversation is really about the lessons

648
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:37,558
that the plan has taught us and how do

649
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,480
we incorporate those lessons not in

650
00:28:37,558 --> 00:28:43,200
terms of just material gain but in terms

651
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:46,000
of preservation and protection of

652
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:49,319
ourselves as the Human family how do we

653
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,440
do this you know and um and and I think

654
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:54,960
that's that's the main conversation we

655
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:58,080
want we want Lamb's bread and we want to

656
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:01,960
play the role that we saw to play but we

657
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:03,960
also want to evolve we want to see every

658
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:06,759
aspect of this because it's only

659
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:09,319
restriction that stopped us you know

660
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:13,158
from from exploring all our cultural SS

661
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:15,480
you know so yeah pretty amazing yes I

662
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:18,240
think so too yeah it's really

663
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:20,159
interesting with all these

664
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,919
International uh countries that are

665
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:25,399
going legal and how we can all work

666
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:28,480
together um you know it's like and and

667
00:29:25,398 --> 00:29:29,918
then as Steve was saying earlier

668
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,919
with these countries like Germany for

669
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:35,559
example that they've gone so slow but I

670
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:39,080
feel like there is potential and I mean

671
00:29:35,558 --> 00:29:41,480
I think working with Jamaica's like

672
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:43,839
Lambs bread or Orange Hill I mean Orange

673
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,038
Hill is a a region more than a yes you

674
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:48,519
know I think that would be more like a

675
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:50,158
VI cultural area yeah yes so but but

676
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:52,120
being able to work with those and being

677
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:55,278
able to import into the United States I

678
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:57,879
think there's huge benefit for us to

679
00:29:55,278 --> 00:30:00,359
have access to Jamaican flow and vice

680
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:04,480
versa you know I think on a world scale

681
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:06,278
I think it'd be amazing honor each other

682
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,360
that's the conversation that I'm really

683
00:30:06,278 --> 00:30:11,599
sort of trying to get at is how do we

684
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:14,278
honor each other yeah there's so much

685
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:18,158
except when you know I I can't remember

686
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:20,798
where I went to and saw a a man changing

687
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:23,278
out all the things that he has he's now

688
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:25,359
getting in new equipment and now he's

689
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:27,558
getting rid of old ones and that

690
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:31,038
technology has not even reached Jamaica

691
00:30:27,558 --> 00:30:32,599
yet yeah he has nothing really to do

692
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:34,079
with it you know what I mean but you

693
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:36,079
know he just has to get rid of them

694
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:39,319
because now there's a new technology

695
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:42,119
either it be in lights and in trays in

696
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:44,599
methods and whatever be the case that

697
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:46,319
that hasn't even reached Jamaica yet you

698
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:49,839
know and then you're having Jamaicans

699
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:51,720
coming over here planting and growing in

700
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:53,639
California here as well and they come

701
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,960
and they see the systems they try to

702
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,799
come back and Implement some of what

703
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:01,558
they think they saw and how that could

704
00:30:57,798 --> 00:31:04,240
work but there's nothing unique to that

705
00:31:01,558 --> 00:31:06,319
local space more than what was there

706
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:09,240
from orangel where those people have

707
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:11,918
crafted their own relationship with the

708
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,399
plant and has delivered from that you

709
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,159
know and when you speak to them about

710
00:31:13,398 --> 00:31:19,119
this relationship it because most of it

711
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:21,039
like most cannabis people is is really

712
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:24,638
the time they spend with the flowers you

713
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:27,278
know everybody call it their girls or

714
00:31:24,638 --> 00:31:29,119
whatever they it's it's this very

715
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:31,038
intimate intimate relationship

716
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:34,119
relationship and and I think this goes

717
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:36,359
for probably all kind of people who

718
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:38,158
touch the plant you know they all have

719
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:40,519
that type of a Vibe you know we all have

720
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,120
these unique intimate relationships and

721
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:43,558
they're all different and and that's the

722
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:44,918
beauty of it you know Steve has a

723
00:31:43,558 --> 00:31:48,398
different relationship with the plant

724
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:50,240
than I do you know as an advocate is as

725
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:51,839
somebody who got us to this point to a

726
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,720
degree you know I mean I think you paved

727
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:57,278
the way for a lot of people you were a

728
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:58,839
boundary Pusher you know when there was

729
00:31:57,278 --> 00:32:01,720
other people that were scared to come

730
00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:03,158
out and say F you I'm gonna do this and

731
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,558
I don't care if you guys want to stop me

732
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:07,600
let's go to court you you were there to

733
00:32:05,558 --> 00:32:09,839
do that and and I think we have all

734
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:11,678
these different people that love

735
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:13,839
cannabis and it's growing it's

736
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:16,399
exponentially growing yeah and it's so

737
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:18,278
amazing you know we get people in other

738
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:20,439
countries I think Thailand is a great

739
00:32:18,278 --> 00:32:22,759
example where they they did have

740
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,440
cannabis but the culture the people

741
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:25,960
there are excited about the stuff that's

742
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,320
going on the west coast too but it's

743
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,639
like we have this International

744
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:31,319
communication now that because of

745
00:32:29,638 --> 00:32:34,278
Technology you know it's a blessing and

746
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:37,398
a curse well you know what folks in in

747
00:32:34,278 --> 00:32:41,200
in California I I hope can get a a

748
00:32:37,398 --> 00:32:43,558
greater appreciation of Y is the degree

749
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,120
to which the change that we made in

750
00:32:43,558 --> 00:32:49,678
California including the passage of prop

751
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:52,879
64 has sparked other changes all around

752
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:55,200
the world right so the king of Thailand

753
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,679
would not have done what he did and

754
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,919
allowed to happen what happened in

755
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:01,320
Thailand land if we hadn't legalized

756
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:02,919
cannabis here in California right the

757
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:05,119
legislature of New York and the

758
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:07,840
legislature of Illinois would not have

759
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:09,638
moved forward to to pass cannabis

760
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:13,158
legalization which is what they did

761
00:33:09,638 --> 00:33:15,759
following the passage of legalization in

762
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:17,559
California um there's been this massive

763
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:20,519
change and it's it's going to take a

764
00:33:17,558 --> 00:33:22,519
long time for that change to spread all

765
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:25,558
around the world but we're seeing it

766
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:28,599
happen now in places like Germany uh and

767
00:33:25,558 --> 00:33:30,960
it it undoubtedly will spread all around

768
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:33,558
the world so we're moving towards the

769
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,720
day and and g i I hope I could say I

770
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:38,319
thought it was going to happen in my

771
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:41,759
lifetime but I'm not sure but the day

772
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:45,200
will come when we have a globalized and

773
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:47,679
normalized Canabis economy and when that

774
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,240
happens different strains of cannabis

775
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:53,480
are going to be grown in different micro

776
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:55,399
microclimates that are most well adapted

777
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,759
to those particular strains of cannabis

778
00:33:55,398 --> 00:33:59,278
so one of the things that's missing in

779
00:33:56,759 --> 00:34:02,200
the North American market right now is

780
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:05,240
long maturing exotic cea strains like

781
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:07,240
the ha right and if you can find a real

782
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:09,519
Haze you're going to pay through the

783
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:11,559
nose for it because it takes you know

784
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:13,960
forever to mature right so it's going to

785
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:16,279
cost the grower twice as much to produce

786
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:18,679
per gram maybe three times as much to

787
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:20,919
produce per gram when you're paying for

788
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:22,599
lights you're paying for stuff like that

789
00:34:20,918 --> 00:34:25,719
it's not really possible to do but in

790
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:29,519
Jamaica it's 122

791
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:31,598
365 okay okay so the sweet spot for

792
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:33,800
Jamaica and they have these beautiful

793
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,039
beautiful super tall mountains the Blue

794
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:38,000
Mountains where some of the most

795
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:40,679
expensive coffee in the world is grown

796
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,480
so my prediction is that Jamaica one day

797
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:45,559
if the government of Jamaica seese the

798
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:48,398
value in doing things like creating and

799
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:50,199
granting appalachi and and supporting

800
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:53,078
Jamaicans and developing their own

801
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:55,799
consumer facing Brands is that Jamaica

802
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:57,599
becomes the world's leading source for

803
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:00,560
the most EXO

804
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:02,800
most expensive most hard to finded long

805
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:05,279
growing mature SAS and that's a really

806
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,440
nice position to be in yeah that's a

807
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,960
beautiful thing I would love to see all

808
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,240
the other islands in the Caribbean get

809
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,920
on board I know St Vincent yeah and

810
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:15,078
Trinidad you know I think they have

811
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:17,680
Ambitions they're all it's the same

812
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:21,839
thing if decriminalization never took

813
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:23,559
place in Jamaica you know these these

814
00:35:21,838 --> 00:35:25,719
other countries wouldn't sort of be

815
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:28,239
opening up their doors as well you know

816
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:30,838
and um for sure they're they're really

817
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:32,759
having um the conversation they're

818
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:35,880
they're honestly having the conversation

819
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:38,040
and um some of the people feel good you

820
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,800
know about what is happening but it you

821
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:42,039
know it's all about regulations

822
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:44,440
everything is regulations you know with

823
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:46,838
with the Cannabis Community with the r

824
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:48,960
ofari Community you know our position

825
00:35:46,838 --> 00:35:50,679
that we have taken as rest ofari in

826
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,318
Jamaica is a

827
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:54,318
self-regulate you know it's a

828
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:57,159
self-regulate and all of this is just

829
00:35:54,318 --> 00:36:00,599
coming from the fact that we see our as

830
00:35:57,159 --> 00:36:02,519
a nation and which is why another reason

831
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:05,160
why I connected to Steve because what he

832
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:08,440
was telling me was that he saw you know

833
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:12,078
a plan tribe you know around the world

834
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:15,280
and um and and that this tribe is huge

835
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:17,240
and that this tribe um in itself could

836
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,400
actually start to live by the teachings

837
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:22,358
of the plant and create the changes that

838
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:25,240
we would um want to see on the planet

839
00:36:22,358 --> 00:36:28,039
for ourselves we have the money you know

840
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:30,279
it's possible and I think if we bring

841
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:32,400
the plant into the conversation you know

842
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:36,760
in reverence you know cuz there's a lot

843
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:39,920
of there's a lot of I'm not sure you

844
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:42,280
know in every way how these things are

845
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:45,519
happening how the plant and human beings

846
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:47,720
are evolving if there's always reverence

847
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:50,318
in that you know um sometimes it seems

848
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:53,959
it's just the end of the dollar you know

849
00:36:50,318 --> 00:36:57,279
and and I I I I have seen azasa fari

850
00:36:53,960 --> 00:37:01,079
where the relationship between money

851
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:04,000
and spirituality during the times of a

852
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:06,079
you know selling ganja to the world

853
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,679
there was synchronicity in community

854
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:11,318
development in spirituality I think

855
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:14,039
there's a template of the way how if we

856
00:37:11,318 --> 00:37:18,119
give into our spirit we will receive a

857
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:21,400
lot more you know probably not in huge

858
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:23,760
houses and in excess but more in

859
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,200
community in Community Development

860
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,240
because that's what these plants are

861
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:29,159
here for they are here for Community

862
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:30,959
Development right they bring us all

863
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:33,799
together they bring us all together you

864
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,880
know just the nature of it you light it

865
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:38,880
you sit around a table and you're ready

866
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:41,119
to talk just as much as food I feel like

867
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,760
on that same level it brings so many of

868
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:46,000
us together that normally we may never

869
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:48,720
cross paths yeah but because of this

870
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,358
plant it's a special connection that we

871
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:54,879
all share yes yes yes so this is this is

872
00:37:52,358 --> 00:37:57,799
where this Vision you know sort of came

873
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:59,440
to me in 2019 as I was traveling around

874
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:02,000
the world which I called the the One

875
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:04,240
Tribe or plant tribe Vision yeah and I

876
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,480
had this opportunity to go to four

877
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:09,118
different continents about 14 different

878
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:12,039
countries uh hanging out with people who

879
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:15,480
consumed cannabis and loved cannabis of

880
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:19,039
all different races religions economic

881
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:22,400
classes educational levels just about

882
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:24,199
every thing that you could imagine every

883
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,358
difference in the Human family that you

884
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:31,199
could imagine yeah and I came off of

885
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:33,838
that tour um really missing people like

886
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:36,199
who I just met but like my heart really

887
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:37,639
hurt you know and so I started thinking

888
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:40,519
about what had happened there and how

889
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:42,598
did I become so close in such a short

890
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:45,400
period of time and what I realized is

891
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:48,160
that no matter where we come from our

892
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,559
race our religion the language we speak

893
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:52,239
how much or how little we've been

894
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:52,960
educated or where we've been educated

895
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:56,039
the

896
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,358
plants have spoken to us in the same

897
00:38:56,039 --> 00:39:00,358
language

898
00:38:57,358 --> 00:39:02,838
we've learned the same lessons and out

899
00:39:00,358 --> 00:39:04,880
of those lessons we've built a common

900
00:39:02,838 --> 00:39:07,679
value system so wherever you go around

901
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:09,160
the world today you find people who have

902
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:12,318
had the plant

903
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:15,239
conversations valuing creativity over

904
00:39:12,318 --> 00:39:17,759
Conformity valuing individual Freedom

905
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:20,639
over state or corporate Authority

906
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:24,560
valuing nature over industry valuing

907
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:27,358
peace over War valuing love over hate

908
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:30,480
radically including everybody and being

909
00:39:27,358 --> 00:39:33,799
intolerant only of intolerance right and

910
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:35,800
that's who we are no matter where we are

911
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:38,280
in the world or what our background is

912
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:41,000
and you know the UN claims that there's

913
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,720
300 million regular cannabis consumers

914
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,800
in the world I think they got it wrong

915
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:47,480
by an order of about three um me you

916
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,440
know you talk to the US government they

917
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:51,119
say there's 30 million Americans who

918
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,639
have found their way to psychedelic

919
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,358
experiences I'm not talking about the

920
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:57,598
Retreats and everything just regular

921
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:59,920
folks sure some public opinion poll say

922
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:02,440
20% of Americans have had psychedelic

923
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:06,240
experiences extrapolate these numbers

924
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:10,000
out to the whole planet and collectively

925
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:12,799
we are as large or larger than all but

926
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,960
the largest nations on this planet and

927
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:18,000
everything that usually divides a group

928
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:20,760
of human beings we can

929
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,400
transcend and so the question that comes

930
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:25,760
to my mind now is okay we've all been

931
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:28,039
called I think we can all feel that

932
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:30,800
these discuss are calling us to a

933
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:32,960
purpose what is that purpose and what

934
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,960
are we going to do with it right and I

935
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,920
don't think any of us can figure that

936
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,039
out on on our own I think there needs to

937
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:41,559
be a convening there needs to be a

938
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:44,079
conversation we need to figure this out

939
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:45,838
because the future of the planet

940
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:48,280
probably depends on us getting this

941
00:40:45,838 --> 00:40:50,400
right right yeah it's a collective

942
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:52,040
energy makes you have a lot of respect

943
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,920
for people who call themselves

944
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:56,880
government you know when you decide to

945
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:59,000
self-govern yeah you realize that [Â __Â ]

946
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:02,079
these people you know have a very

947
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,480
serious job to do you know and um you

948
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:06,760
know self-governance is not easy but is

949
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:10,358
the ultimate task it's a reason why we

950
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:13,880
are being led by by by by who is leading

951
00:41:10,358 --> 00:41:16,559
us know um because we refuse right to

952
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:18,280
regulate and govern ourselves know and

953
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:20,519
you know in places like

954
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:22,680
Jamaica that those are the impact of

955
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:25,358
colonialism you know we're we're working

956
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:26,879
on a decolonized um program and every

957
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:28,719
time you say it you know

958
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:32,880
white people think they're not involved

959
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:36,358
you know what I mean only just but the

960
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:38,960
privilege is is a mental disorder it's

961
00:41:36,358 --> 00:41:42,679
not real you know what I mean and it's

962
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:45,119
been used as a tool yeah for the broader

963
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:49,039
liberation of the Human family you know

964
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:51,920
and in places like Jamaica um when

965
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:55,119
abolition of slavery was really uh a

966
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,960
strategy for neocolonialism it was set

967
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:59,800
up that way perfectly

968
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,519
thought out and put together and so on

969
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:05,599
one of the main things that came out of

970
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:09,358
the abolition of slavery was how much if

971
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:11,680
you different disenfranchise people and

972
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:13,920
discriminate against them and then you

973
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:17,960
tell them to govern themsel they will

974
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,960
choose slavery over

975
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:24,359
Freedom that was a reality you know they

976
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:26,639
did that in Jamaica in Jamaica wages was

977
00:42:24,358 --> 00:42:29,078
what they used to keep the Africans down

978
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:30,719
you know so if you go to Jamaica right

979
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:33,960
now like you take a guess what do you

980
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:33,959
think is minimum wage in

981
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:40,679
Jamaica $3 an hour so it's about

982
00:42:38,318 --> 00:42:43,880
$258 okay so I'm not too far you're not

983
00:42:40,679 --> 00:42:46,199
too far off you're not too far and then

984
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:48,760
and it that just increased probably like

985
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:51,558
about three or four months ago it was

986
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:56,200
less than that yeah and this is coming

987
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:58,440
from that strategy of slavery where what

988
00:42:56,199 --> 00:43:00,358
happen is that you paid the people solo

989
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:03,400
they own no land you know this is the

990
00:43:00,358 --> 00:43:05,440
African people the classism was set up

991
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:07,519
because the Indians got land the Chinese

992
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,838
got land so everybody was being used as

993
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:12,318
a tool of differentiation and divide and

994
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:15,599
Rule you know and it's a responsibility

995
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:18,920
that we have to recognize this we have

996
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:20,838
been used to play a game against each

997
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:23,039
other and we have to decide to have that

998
00:43:20,838 --> 00:43:24,679
conversation amongst ourselves so you

999
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:26,719
know when people decide that they want

1000
00:43:24,679 --> 00:43:29,318
to and this is why spoke about the

1001
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:31,358
implicit bias and the subconscious

1002
00:43:29,318 --> 00:43:33,679
colonization

1003
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:35,400
because a friend of mine that I know

1004
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:37,960
this is a good person man I love him

1005
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:40,160
he's a good man you know um we have had

1006
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:42,240
interactions and he's real coming from a

1007
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:44,239
real place but he was having a

1008
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:46,719
conversation with another person and he

1009
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:49,318
was telling them you know you know why

1010
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:52,279
you should come to Jamaica electricity

1011
00:43:49,318 --> 00:43:56,558
is high all the services are high but

1012
00:43:52,280 --> 00:44:00,839
labor is cheap and man that cut every

1013
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:04,240
part of my system you know cuz I I I

1014
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:07,679
know that he did not he didn't even have

1015
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:10,318
a clue he's just a businessman looking

1016
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:12,440
at the real reason why you should do

1017
00:44:10,318 --> 00:44:15,558
business here you know and he needs to

1018
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:19,318
save his business but this is a ageold

1019
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:20,680
18th century issue well I think in life

1020
00:44:19,318 --> 00:44:22,719
so many things are

1021
00:44:20,679 --> 00:44:25,719
counterintuitive you think it's one way

1022
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:28,480
but until you have experience to see it

1023
00:44:25,719 --> 00:44:30,959
the way you know it's it's hard to gauge

1024
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,639
stuff sometimes and I think you know

1025
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,639
it's just like struggle you you want

1026
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:37,480
your kids to you know live a comfortable

1027
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:39,960
life but I think struggle is important

1028
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:43,079
to Define your character and to figure

1029
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:46,519
out who you are very much so very very

1030
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:48,680
much so and but but you know you said

1031
00:44:46,519 --> 00:44:51,920
till you encounter what is real I think

1032
00:44:48,679 --> 00:44:54,960
we have a problem yes with defining what

1033
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:57,318
real is and until we work out what that

1034
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,519
formula is and it's a very it's a very

1035
00:44:57,318 --> 00:45:02,838
simple formula it's you have to do your

1036
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:05,639
impact study right what has been the

1037
00:45:02,838 --> 00:45:07,440
impact of your behavior you know and how

1038
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:10,159
does it affect others and affect

1039
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,838
yourself you know and I think that's

1040
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:14,639
that's the that's the that's the that's

1041
00:45:11,838 --> 00:45:17,480
the realest real that you could come to

1042
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:19,400
you know that's the realest real you

1043
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:21,880
know

1044
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:25,079
yeah yeah it's interesting you know I'm

1045
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:26,240
in my 40s and I'm a completely I

1046
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:27,920
wouldn't say I'm a complet completely

1047
00:45:26,239 --> 00:45:30,598
different person but I think we change

1048
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:33,358
so much and as we get more experience we

1049
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:35,680
understand how fragile life can be all

1050
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:37,759
these other things and how important

1051
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:40,358
knowledge is I think that's one of the

1052
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:42,440
biggest things for me and and to really

1053
00:45:40,358 --> 00:45:44,159
understand things thoroughly you know

1054
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:46,358
whether it's cannabis or psychedelics or

1055
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:49,558
whatever it is you know to get a real

1056
00:45:46,358 --> 00:45:51,199
firm understanding of it and you you you

1057
00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:54,559
understand things through experience I

1058
00:45:51,199 --> 00:45:57,358
think that's another thing so with your

1059
00:45:54,559 --> 00:46:00,119
retreat uh H how does that work so

1060

know uh we do have them weekly we may be

1068
00:46:24,679 --> 00:46:29,039
making some adjustments to sort of give

1069
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:30,838
them a set date right so we can have

1070
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:33,039
more people connecting to them at a

1071
00:46:30,838 --> 00:46:36,119
different time you have individuals and

1072
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:38,759
groups yeah um but not deliberately we

1073
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:42,000
rather to because our container is

1074
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:43,800
community we rather groups you know um

1075
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,318
our philosophy is that there's no

1076
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:48,640
problem that is yours all problem

1077
00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:51,318
belongs to the environment you know be

1078
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:53,879
cancer this that it is something that is

1079
00:46:51,318 --> 00:46:56,440
happening in our environment as human

1080
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:59,680
beings so it's it's a one love bringing

1081
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:04,079
everything into one yeah and yeah so

1082
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:06,639
once you book um uh a email will will

1083
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:09,440
then be sent to you you'll be contacted

1084
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:11,440
and we'll have a one-on-one conversation

1085
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:14,440
to find out a little bit about who you

1086
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:17,400
are and clear up any questions you would

1087
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:19,318
have about yourself you know and um we

1088
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:21,838
tell you the container that we have

1089
00:47:19,318 --> 00:47:24,000
created you know for the

1090
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:26,440
experience um that you should have and

1091
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:30,719
that container is mainly

1092
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:34,880
uh our Approach at the moment uh is not

1093
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:37,759
to create people who cannot integrate

1094
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:41,039
properly and not to create people that

1095
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:43,559
will give us too much dramatic

1096
00:47:41,039 --> 00:47:46,480
experiences so we have learned a little

1097
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:49,079
bit about how the plant Works how it

1098
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:51,838
interacts and most of the time people

1099
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:54,280
come there they're having human issues

1100
00:47:51,838 --> 00:47:55,759
they're not having a issue of life and

1101
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:59,000
the relationship with life they're

1102
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:01,680
having issues between themselves the job

1103
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:04,239
the stifling of their ego and their

1104
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:06,558
gifts the non-c creativity because

1105
00:48:04,239 --> 00:48:08,078
they're conformed you know so those are

1106
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:11,319
the things that they are facing and we

1107
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:14,000
have faced those things too so we create

1108
00:48:11,318 --> 00:48:16,318
this container of stories and so on that

1109
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,480
can evolve a human experience and

1110
00:48:16,318 --> 00:48:23,000
conversation that can invoke memory you

1111
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:25,480
know um and that can almost try to

1112
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,920
release and loosen some of what people

1113
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:31,000
are calling trauma you know but there

1114
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:34,400
are really in fact we see the traumatic

1115
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:36,239
people as more teachers you know people

1116
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:39,519
who have had an experience that can

1117
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:41,679
share to allow us to evolve and them

1118
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:43,440
themselves to evolve you know so it's

1119
00:48:41,679 --> 00:48:45,598
not people you know you're not going to

1120
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:49,559
be there to cry you're going to be there

1121
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:53,000
to woman man up you know and to speak

1122
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:54,839
about your experiences as someone who

1123
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,599
has learned something about this

1124
00:48:54,838 --> 00:48:59,440
environment of the planet how you have

1125
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:02,838
been going through it and how we can

1126
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:05,318
evolve it and once we you know scratch

1127
00:49:02,838 --> 00:49:08,318
that surface and rake it up and allow it

1128
00:49:05,318 --> 00:49:10,759
to come out then you know we sort of

1129
00:49:08,318 --> 00:49:12,838
introduce you to the plant and then

1130
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:14,559
normally when you go into those

1131
00:49:12,838 --> 00:49:16,318
conversations with the plant you won't

1132
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:18,798
be having conversations that you have

1133
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:21,000
never even touched on before I'm not

1134
00:49:18,798 --> 00:49:23,960
saying that you will you know the plant

1135
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,400
is amazing it can bring up anything

1136
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:29,079
however because of our journey with it

1137
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:31,240
already we kind of have a path we ask

1138
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:33,079
for that direction and then people will

1139
00:49:31,239 --> 00:49:35,639
just have an experience that is more

1140
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:38,039
evolving than the experience of human

1141
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:40,358
pain and human issues they can have a

1142
00:49:38,039 --> 00:49:42,159
more connected experience with the

1143
00:49:40,358 --> 00:49:44,759
Journey of these neighbors you know

1144
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:46,879
these entities that we don't know it's

1145
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:49,240
like going on a first date that's how we

1146
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:51,318
sort of put it you go on this first date

1147
00:49:49,239 --> 00:49:53,558
do you really go on a date and bring all

1148
00:49:51,318 --> 00:49:55,679
the baggage of yesterday and all the

1149
00:49:53,559 --> 00:49:57,880
relationships that never work you sit to

1150
00:49:55,679 --> 00:49:59,759
know the person so the idea is that you

1151
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:01,160
are going to sit with this plant you're

1152
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:03,480
going to listen you're going to have

1153
00:50:01,159 --> 00:50:06,279
conversations and that's that's a kind

1154
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:08,240
of preparation that we do and then we

1155
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:10,680
because it's a space of drumming and

1156
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:13,318
it's a space of food and it's a space of

1157
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:15,279
nature because the river runs through

1158
00:50:13,318 --> 00:50:17,519
the property we're we're having some

1159
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,798
problems now though you know especially

1160
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:21,759
with the river

1161
00:50:18,798 --> 00:50:23,960
because development is disguise or

1162
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:25,520
destruction is disguise as development

1163
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:27,760
and people are doing a lot of Bill

1164
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:30,039
building so there's a lot of so but we

1165
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:32,680
still want our family to come together

1166
00:50:30,039 --> 00:50:36,239
so we can pray for these Rivers because

1167
00:50:32,679 --> 00:50:38,960
we know that any imbalance anywhere on

1168
00:50:36,239 --> 00:50:41,479
the planet is an imbalance to everywhere

1169
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:43,960
on the planet so it's really a call to

1170
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:47,679
duty that our Retreat is about about how

1171
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:49,639
we can collectively heal you know and um

1172
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:51,118
but integration is the biggest part of

1173
00:50:49,639 --> 00:50:54,558
it

1174
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:56,318
so we we really we really know that for

1175
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:58,400
a lot of people you know they come to

1176
00:50:56,318 --> 00:51:00,239
these Retreat and they are opened up

1177
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,639
many gates are open up of the

1178
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:04,598
possibility of life then you come back

1179
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:06,798
into a office building you come back

1180
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:09,720
waiting two tables you know it's kind of

1181
00:51:06,798 --> 00:51:12,519
hard to integrate in that kind of a way

1182
00:51:09,719 --> 00:51:15,039
so our journey is about creating a

1183
00:51:12,519 --> 00:51:18,280
community you know a community that is

1184
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:21,199
looking to evolve even some of these job

1185
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:22,880
types you know that actually you know a

1186
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:25,439
lot of these industries they are built

1187
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:27,119
to kill customers you know right to see

1188
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:30,079
if we can recreate you know like the

1189
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:32,318
cannabis plant this is why I like uh

1190
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:34,960
these these exchanges within plant

1191
00:51:32,318 --> 00:51:37,880
medicines in a particular way that can

1192
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:39,838
be um spiritual economics because it

1193
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:41,640
saves people you know it doesn't kill

1194
00:51:39,838 --> 00:51:43,599
people you know what I mean like like

1195
00:51:41,639 --> 00:51:45,078
like a lot of the Fast Food Industries

1196
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:46,920
and so on yeah it makes the world a

1197
00:51:45,079 --> 00:51:49,519
better place makes the world a much much

1198
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:52,720
better place so you know it's open fire

1199
00:51:49,519 --> 00:51:56,639
in the night you know that that um we

1200
00:51:52,719 --> 00:51:59,679
keep our interpretations of ser but the

1201
00:51:56,639 --> 00:52:02,039
the the main thing about our Retreat is

1202
00:51:59,679 --> 00:52:04,598
we call it life is a ceremony which

1203
00:52:02,039 --> 00:52:06,880
simply means that it is every single

1204
00:52:04,599 --> 00:52:08,720
moment that you're integrating every

1205
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,880
single moment you're holding

1206
00:52:08,719 --> 00:52:13,279
Consciousness to the thought that you're

1207
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,798
having and the implementation of that

1208
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,559
thought yeah you know that you're

1209
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:18,159
putting out and that's what we try to

1210
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:19,760
open up you know so people have come to

1211
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:23,719
a retreat and didn't take the medicine

1212
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:25,799
and still feel in a way that they have

1213
00:52:23,719 --> 00:52:27,598
you know opened up a lot of

1214
00:52:25,798 --> 00:52:31,280
just so many people need to live in the

1215
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:33,480
moment yeah yeah yeah exactly exactly so

1216
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:36,359
it's a very different experience right

1217
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:39,199
um because a lot of the retreats in

1218
00:52:36,358 --> 00:52:42,400
Jamaica are at the kind of resorts that

1219
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:45,480
most folks go to a lot of the staff and

1220
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:47,000
facilitators are flown in from overseas

1221
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:50,760
there's often not a whole lot of

1222
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:52,960
connection to Jamaica um a Rastafari

1223
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:55,599
indigenous Village is a real Rastafari

1224
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:58,480
village with Elders with children um

1225
00:52:55,599 --> 00:53:00,359
with life and um so it's not like

1226
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:03,838
perfect and manicured like a resort

1227
00:53:00,358 --> 00:53:07,519
would be but it's always real um and

1228
00:53:03,838 --> 00:53:10,078
guests can go to rosta village.com to

1229
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:12,159

1230
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:16,318

schedule of of Retreats um uh so that we

1232
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:21,719
will group folks together and if you if

1233
00:53:19,318 --> 00:53:23,719
you uh don't see a date that works for

1234
00:53:21,719 --> 00:53:25,558
us works for you then you know drop us

1235
00:53:23,719 --> 00:53:27,039
an email we'll talk to you we see what

1236
00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:29,720
we can work out that works best for

1237
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:32,318
everybody we're also open to retreat

1238
00:53:29,719 --> 00:53:34,439
organizers uh so folks who are

1239
00:53:32,318 --> 00:53:38,000
organizing Retreats and are looking for

1240
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:40,039
a place that uh is friendly may want to

1241
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,559
check out rosta Village and see if it

1242
00:53:40,039 --> 00:53:46,039
we're a good fit for for for their needs

1243
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:48,640
so the one of the really distinctive

1244
00:53:46,039 --> 00:53:51,079
features of the village is that um we

1245
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:53,239
keep things small and really intimate

1246
00:53:51,079 --> 00:53:55,200
because you can't really get to know

1247
00:53:53,239 --> 00:53:57,358
each other and have a real cultural exch

1248
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:59,358
change if there's more visitors than

1249
00:53:57,358 --> 00:54:01,159
there are Folks at the village and

1250
00:53:59,358 --> 00:54:03,440
there's about 20 folks who live at the

1251
00:54:01,159 --> 00:54:06,199
village and so generally we don't have

1252
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:08,838
more than about 12 visitors uh at the

1253
00:54:06,199 --> 00:54:12,118
Village awesome uh which means that a

1254
00:54:08,838 --> 00:54:14,078
family or a company or an advocacy

1255
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:16,280
organization that would like to have

1256
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:19,200
this very very special experience

1257
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:22,160
together can come down and have the

1258
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:25,519
whole village to themselves with as few

1259
00:54:22,159 --> 00:54:29,358
as as six people so wow um it's a it's a

1260
00:54:25,519 --> 00:54:31,798
very very special uh place for smaller

1261
00:54:29,358 --> 00:54:32,639
groups to consider coming and visiting

1262
00:54:31,798 --> 00:54:35,119
really

1263
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:36,480
cool well you have to definitely be

1264
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:41,440
ready

1265
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:43,119
for um real yeah authentic yeah it's not

1266
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:46,079
a it's not a space where the

1267
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:48,440
conversations are going to be created

1268
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:51,798
before you come conversation is going to

1269
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:54,639
be with you when you come and what you

1270
00:54:51,798 --> 00:54:57,719
bring to the table so you know there are

1271
00:54:54,639 --> 00:54:59,879
set of agendas you know of of things

1272
00:54:57,719 --> 00:55:03,358
healing practices and so on that we will

1273
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:06,519
definitely offer but for each group for

1274
00:55:03,358 --> 00:55:08,920
each set of people you know it's it's

1275
00:55:06,519 --> 00:55:11,599
it's us together that is really kind of

1276
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:13,680
doing the work very individual yeah yeah

1277
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:15,240
yeah very very individual you know even

1278
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:17,318
though we are seeing a lot of

1279
00:55:15,239 --> 00:55:18,879
commonalities you know people are coming

1280
00:55:17,318 --> 00:55:22,440
with the same thing we're also seeing a

1281
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:25,119
lot of difference yeah you know and um

1282
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:27,280
and people are continuing their own

1283
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:29,559
relationship after they leave you know

1284
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:32,079
with each other and so on which is a

1285
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:34,599
very typical sound that is happening in

1286
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:36,280
the Psychedelic space too as well and

1287
00:55:34,599 --> 00:55:37,798
you know people are really being

1288
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:39,880
connected you know even the people who

1289
00:55:37,798 --> 00:55:43,199
go into the resorts and so on all of

1290
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:46,079
them are having the plant is opening up

1291
00:55:43,199 --> 00:55:47,679
a lot of conversation I think I was just

1292
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:50,318
talking to Steve and I was saying to him

1293
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:54,199
that the big the

1294
00:55:50,318 --> 00:55:55,798
change narrative now is integration

1295
00:55:54,199 --> 00:55:59,038
that's the that's the that's the big

1296
00:55:55,798 --> 00:56:02,280
thing you know because when it is um not

1297
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:05,520
legalized or they call it criminalized

1298
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:07,000
or whatever normalized yeah they've like

1299
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:08,719
taken that away and now we're getting

1300
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,599
back to the

1301
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:13,358
normalization where we can have a

1302
00:56:10,599 --> 00:56:15,440
conversation with about it and you can

1303
00:56:13,358 --> 00:56:17,000
really sit down with someone and say to

1304
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:19,559
them you know I've engaged with these

1305
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,798
plants and it shows me this you don't

1306
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:24,400
have to feel bad about it and so on and

1307
00:56:21,798 --> 00:56:27,599
I think that's going to normalize it and

1308
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:31,200
create a space now where the plants and

1309
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:33,960
human beings can coexist without the

1310
00:56:31,199 --> 00:56:35,679
corruption right of it you know um cuz

1311
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:38,880
that's what we do we really corrupt

1312
00:56:35,679 --> 00:56:41,519
spirituality corrupt anything that is

1313
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:45,440
intangible you know we find a way how to

1314
00:56:41,519 --> 00:56:47,639
impose our perceptions on it and just

1315
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:49,358
make it what we want you know and that's

1316
00:56:47,639 --> 00:56:50,719
that's normally a very corrupted way to

1317
00:56:49,358 --> 00:56:52,679
deal with it perception is such a

1318
00:56:50,719 --> 00:56:55,318
powerful thing it's the only thing it's

1319
00:56:52,679 --> 00:56:59,879
my favorite thing you know um it's it's

1320
00:56:55,318 --> 00:57:02,000
it's what um I personally um urge people

1321
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:04,519
our our Retreats are really about

1322
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:08,000
perception yeah are really about how do

1323
00:57:04,519 --> 00:57:09,960
you view um your interpretation of

1324
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,358
struggle you know as you say how

1325
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:14,639
necessary has these struggle been you

1326
00:57:12,358 --> 00:57:16,558
know for you so many times you're

1327
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:18,679
panicking in the moment about something

1328
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:21,200
that is happening and then a few years

1329
00:57:18,679 --> 00:57:23,798
later you sit down and say man if that

1330
00:57:21,199 --> 00:57:25,798
thing never happened I wouldn't be here

1331

today this today you know last night I

1332

1341
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:55,400
death a death of her family member you

1342
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:57,480

00:58:08,199 --> 00:58:14,078
that are bad or good and we really don't

1349
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:16,480
know the effect of until much later yes

1350
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:17,960
you know and so we can be upset about

1351

stuff and but we don't know if that's

1352
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:21,079
really a bad thing or or maybe a good

1353

1392

1415

1417
01:00:57,719 --> 01:01:02,679
character has amazing stories but last

1418
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:05,000
prisoner project that was one of the

1419
01:01:02,679 --> 01:01:07,960
things that you started yeah you know

1420
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:10,159
for me um the the inspiration for last

1421
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:13,880
prisoner project came in

1422
01:01:10,159 --> 01:01:16,358
2017 this was after uh prop uh 64 had

1423
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:17,720
been passed in 2016 but before it was

1424
01:01:16,358 --> 01:01:21,239
implemented in

1425
01:01:17,719 --> 01:01:22,679
2018 and um and all of my competitors

1426
01:01:21,239 --> 01:01:24,519
were running out and getting tens of

1427
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:27,279
millions of dollars so I felt like I had

1428
01:01:24,519 --> 01:01:29,519
to do the same thing I found myself uh

1429
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:32,079
in Toronto which was at that point the

1430
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:34,639
capital of cannabis capital and I was in

1431
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:38,359
the financial district at the top of a

1432
01:01:34,639 --> 01:01:40,879
fancy uh office uh Tower uh sitting at a

1433
01:01:38,358 --> 01:01:42,598
very long conference table uh and there

1434
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:45,358
were a bunch of spreadsheets on that

1435
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:47,798
table and they envisioned like literally

1436
01:01:45,358 --> 01:01:50,358
hundreds of tons of weed being produced

1437
01:01:47,798 --> 01:01:52,559
and more money than you could possibly

1438
01:01:50,358 --> 01:01:54,598
imagine and everybody sitting around

1439
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:56,440
that table is feeling really good

1440
01:01:54,599 --> 01:01:58,519
because they think that this Market is

1441
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:01,480
going to be opening up nobody sees the

1442
01:01:58,519 --> 01:02:03,559
disaster that's coming yet nobody there

1443
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:06,000
has the slightest fear of getting

1444
01:02:03,559 --> 01:02:08,278
arrested at all it's not even on the

1445
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,559
agenda so in the middle of this meeting

1446
01:02:08,278 --> 01:02:13,199
my phone starts buzzing and it's my

1447
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:15,798
buddy Chuck Chuck's calling me from a

1448
01:02:13,199 --> 01:02:20,318
prison in Pennsylvania where he's doing

1449
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:22,599
four years four years for bringing 14

1450
01:02:20,318 --> 01:02:24,679
pounds of weed from California to

1451
01:02:22,599 --> 01:02:26,838
Pennsylvania he didn't even bring it was

1452
01:02:24,679 --> 01:02:32,679
just accused of having helped to arrange

1453
01:02:26,838 --> 01:02:34,400
the the transport wow uh and so I you

1454
01:02:32,679 --> 01:02:36,440
know I I don't normally interrupt

1455
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:38,559
meetings like that but it was my friend

1456
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:40,159
calling from prison so I did and I went

1457
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:43,000
out into the hall and I talked to him

1458
01:02:40,159 --> 01:02:46,199
and it was Grim because it's Grim to

1459
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:48,119
talk to your friends in prison yep and

1460
01:02:46,199 --> 01:02:50,919
when I walked back into the conference

1461
01:02:48,119 --> 01:02:53,960
room that grimness was still clinging to

1462
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:56,599
me and I looked around the room and I

1463
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:59,920
saw everybody there still very happy

1464
01:02:56,599 --> 01:03:02,318
with absolutely no fear and I realized

1465
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:05,000
then that if I was going to be a part of

1466
01:03:02,318 --> 01:03:08,079
moving this thing forward from that day

1467
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:11,039
forward um and and creating this new

1468
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:12,920
legal industry that we had to make sure

1469
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:14,720
that everybody that was in prison my

1470
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:17,159
friend Chuck and everybody else who was

1471
01:03:14,719 --> 01:03:20,078
in prison on cannabis charges was

1472
01:03:17,159 --> 01:03:22,000
released and given a decent opportunity

1473
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:25,240
to rebuild the lives that were stolen

1474
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:29,239
from them so that was the inspiration

1475
01:03:25,239 --> 01:03:31,038
uh for last prisoner project um it's

1476
01:03:29,239 --> 01:03:34,759
been one of the great pleasures of my

1477
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:38,160
life to be able to welcome friends of

1478
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:41,039
mine like Richard delisi home again I

1479
01:03:38,159 --> 01:03:43,399
remember when Richard got busted um I

1480
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:46,119
remember his story well uh I remember

1481
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:49,880
the horror at hearings a sentence that

1482
01:03:46,119 --> 01:03:51,680
he got um and and I remember then you

1483
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:54,798
know it wasn't an explicit commitment

1484
01:03:51,679 --> 01:03:57,519
that I made to myself but uh a regarding

1485
01:03:54,798 --> 01:04:00,119
prisoners I was like okay [Â __Â ]

1486
01:03:57,519 --> 01:04:02,920
if it's on then it's on because our

1487
01:04:00,119 --> 01:04:05,838
side's not giving up either and so it's

1488
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:09,039
really satisfying after all those 30

1489
