thank you so much for coming on the show

16
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,239
yeah I remember when I saw you in Alam

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,080
and you were I think building or getting

18
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:09,679
this place into action or oh yeah

19
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:11,478
something like that it's funny how long

20
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,479
it takes to get there CU that was like

21
00:01:11,478 --> 00:01:15,200
three years ago I think that we were

22
00:01:13,478 --> 00:01:16,640
together in Al it had to be over three

23
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,240
years ago but yeah we've known each

24
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,118
other for a long time we actually were

25
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:22,319
part of the same circle of friends and

26
00:01:20,118 --> 00:01:24,959
didn't hang out but kind of knew of each

27
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:27,279
other you know for for the last 15 20

28
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,359
years yeah uh all the same mutual

29
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,960
friends and then we hung out in

30
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:31,640
Amsterdam I don't know 5 years ago

31
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:34,000
something like that that was that was

32
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,719
Amsterdam and I saw you also in Spain at

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,200
spannabis the past two years totally

34
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:41,798
yeah just been chilling dude just trying

35
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:44,079
to take it easy relax not really like um

36
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:47,159
overwork myself which you know we've all

37
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:49,158
been used to but now it's like you might

38
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,680
not be successful unless you overwork

39
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:53,439
yourself so I think working hard is part

40
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,520
of the process you know if you believe

41
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:58,000
in yourself and you believe in your

42
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:59,158
product uh you know I think that goes a

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,718
long ways and then it gives you

44
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,719
something to strive for every day when

45
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:05,078
you can be devoted to something yeah I

46
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:07,319
think that's part of like part of what

47
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:09,439
we do is we we become devotional and

48
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:11,519
when when you can be devoted to your

49
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:14,439
craft that's when it can really take off

50
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,560
and almost have a mind of its own yeah

51
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:18,840
100% I mean it's also your heart's got

52
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,280
to be there now yeah you know it has to

53
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,479
be there because the amount of effort

54
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,800
that you're putting to get to where

55
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:24,238
you're trying to go it's like if your

56
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,760
heart's not there it's going to be a

57
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,920
struggle for sure yeah I mean you really

58
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:31,719
have to love what you do to a degree and

59
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,839
believe in yourself uh because there's a

60
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:36,120
lot of these days people don't believe

61
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,640
anything yeah you know and it's hard to

62
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,959
believe stuff when PE you know I think

63
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,559
when people are struggling so much it's

64
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,598
hard for them to believe anything

65
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,800
believe in anything too you know it's

66
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:48,318
like the industry has had its ups and

67
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,719
downs and this is just it's a roller

68
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:51,238
coaster right so there's going to be bad

69
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:52,639
times and good times it's going to be

70
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:54,239
good and it's going to be bad and then

71
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,039
it's going to be good again and then

72
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,400
it's probably going to be little bad

73
00:02:56,039 --> 00:03:01,079
again but like I feel like I'm on this

74
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,599
upward trajectory and I'm excited about

75
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,799
the stuff that you're doing I mean the

76
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:07,798

98
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,799
when people were just first starting to

99
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:57,680
talk about it they were talking about

100
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,040
taking it to that next level yeah and

101
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,438
he's yeah I'm a big fan it's like we

102
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:03,719
we're lucky we have so many friends that

103
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:06,039
are really interesting that really are

104
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:09,639
outside the box thinkers that kind of

105
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:11,400
are innovators yeah uh and then when

106
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:13,759
Paulie was telling me about your your

107
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,599
Vape cart that you're coming out with I

108
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,238
was like man I don't really have Vape

109
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:19,759
cart guys on the show but you're doing

110
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:21,198
something super Innovative and I feel

111
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,960
like we have so many other great stories

112
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,000
to talk about yeah that it would make

113
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:27,680
for a great podcast I just I love

114
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,360
Innovation whether it's with genetics or

115
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,038
whatever it is in this space Innovation

116
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,879
is so necessary so why don't you tell

117
00:04:33,038 --> 00:04:39,599
everybody about your device well so it

118
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:42,159
date back to like I think it was 2016

119
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,800
2017 we were growing up in

120
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,840
lonville we brought all the the flower

121
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,680
down and we dried it and froze it and we

122
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:53,119
processed it into sauce and diamonds uh

123
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,199
at the lab in Oakland and and when you

124
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,160
really got in front of HTE and saw what

125
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,840
you could do with the full turp spectrum

126
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,720
it's kind of like holy [ __ ] because you

127
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:03,599
know most of the Vape cards back then on

128
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:07,199
the market were all hot dog water with

129
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,160
Botanical turps and there's a monetary

130
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,240
play there and not a not something

131
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,360
that's like grade A for the consumer

132
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:16,600
it's like you know when you're looking

133
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:18,360
at the elite cultivators the elite

134
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,759
manufacturers these guys are trying to

135
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,520
keep a top tier product at a a market

136
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:25,319
competitive cost because you know price

137
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,240
and it's quality right but like there

138
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:29,720
was that Heyday of just like okay all

139
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,519
these trash 510 threads are all going

140
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,680
you know to wherever and people who

141
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:36,240
knows what they're ingesting and right A

142
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,160
lot of times you get a market

143
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,879
segment that doesn't they're not

144
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,039
educated in it because nobody's taken

145
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:43,959
the time to educate them like okay so

146
00:05:42,038 --> 00:05:45,759
this is how they make that like I

147
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:49,318
remember walking into warehouses that

148
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:52,600
only sold d8 yeah I'm kind of like

149
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:54,759
nobody knows what they have to do to get

150
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,319
this you know and I'm not going to tell

151
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:59,720
them but I'm just going to kind of

152
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:01,120
listen and leave yeah so that that year

153
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,039
on that hill we came down we did all

154
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:07,160
that and I just sparked in my head I'm

155
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:09,240
like why isn't there a cartridge for

156
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:12,520
specifically the the diamonds and the

157
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:16,439
sauce and then you fast forward you know

158
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:18,079
now six years later people are decarbing

159
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:20,719
the diamonds they're putting you know

160
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:22,879
the HT back in they're separating it

161
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,199
reformulating it or they're taking live

162
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:27,159
resin and decarbing that yeah there's

163
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,038
there's definitely a higher level of

164
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,400
quality coming out from an extraction

165
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:32,839
formulation

166
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:35,079
standpoint but if you really break it

167
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:38,159
down into the active

168
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:40,719
compounds your thca or your THC is going

169
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,439
to need a certain level of temperature

170
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,680
to vaporize and if you bring the

171
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:48,000
flavonoid and the turpine in there with

172
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,840
it you're cooking it because that

173
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,399
doesn't need those

174
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:55,318
temperatures you can get into the the

175
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:58,279
deeper science about the volatiles and

176
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:59,960
like the heating curve to actually

177
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:02,918
vaporize the volatiles instead of

178
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:04,839
evaporate them etc etc so what we what I

179
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:07,878
did six years ago is I started down a

180
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:10,478
path of creating what essentially is a

181
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:14,199
dual chamber cartridge yeah with a

182
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:16,439
battery that is uh

183
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:17,800
rechargeable and you know I was thinking

184
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:20,680
to myself you

185
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:23,160
know how do we make this even more

186
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,079
preferable besides splitting the active

187
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,800
compounds because it's

188
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:30,120
like supposing you wake up tomorrow and

189
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,478
you don't want to

190
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,918
to smoke the certain strain of that Vape

191
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:36,079
cart that you have so what do you do you

192
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:38,159
buy 13 Vape carts so when you wake up

193
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:40,519
you can appease yourself and it's like H

194
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,319
yes and my engineer like unfortunately

195
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:45,478
yeah right my engineer's like listen I

196
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,680
can make that turp tank swappable and

197
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:51,079
I'm like really and then it kind of went

198
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,000
from here to here in my mind and I'm

199
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:56,680
like Okay cool so it's like with our

200
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:00,439
with our pod based system you'd go to a

201
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:03,800
um a dispensary and you would get the

202
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:06,918
thca pod which contains the diamonds non

203
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:09,079
decarbed they sit in crystalline form

204
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:11,359
yeah you can't essentially fool a

205
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:13,478
customer and say it's liquid diamonds

206
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,960
but it's really just hot dog water which

207
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:16,598
you know that's that's a lot of the does

208
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:18,399
the industry standard almost

209
00:08:16,598 --> 00:08:19,639
unfortunately you know distillate

210
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:21,198
distillate it got a lot of people

211
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:22,960
through some hard times but at the end

212
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,840
of the day is it like is it full

213
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:26,318
spectrum off of the plant and everything

214
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:27,918
now because you're cooking everything

215
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,039
off in the Roto and then now you've got

216
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:32,038
to bring the flavonoid back in and I I

217
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:35,598
met with some other companies which I

218
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:38,759
won't name but and this was back in 2017

219
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,680
but everybody wanted to use HT they

220
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:43,360
wanted to use the the tarpine that was

221
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:45,879
native to the plant but cost

222
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:49,480
Effectiveness and then amount that you

223
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:52,240
need to formulate with times that price

224
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,680
per gram to get the same pungency the

225
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,360
same taste that you were getting by

226
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:58,120
adding the Botanicals at whatever 7%

227
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,120
yeah right those Botanicals go a long

228
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,919
way

229
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,078
they it just wasn't took them out of a

230
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:07,958
market of compet Market competitive

231
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:09,639
price point so now you can be Market

232
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:12,239
competitive with it because obviously

233
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:14,958
the industry you know what I mean so we

234
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:18,600
started working on the UI for the

235
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:21,399
battery and uh we have a chip

236
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,920
inside that essentially it's an oem chip

237
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:25,360
that we had designed specifically for

238
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:27,919
our device in which you're throwing a

239
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,959
certain temperature at the the diamonds

240
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:31,759
and a certain temperature at the saw

241
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:35,958
and we're able to create a he a heat

242
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:38,159
curve for the sauce which will ramp it

243
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:39,838
up so you actually vaporize the

244
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,439
volatiles that are left there especially

245
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,560
if you're using fresh frozen sauce which

246
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,800
is what we have in here right you the

247
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:47,879
point of the Frozen is the the stuff you

248
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:50,639
that goes missing during the drying and

249
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:53,078
curing process and right those volatile

250
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:54,958
compounds that just

251
00:09:53,078 --> 00:09:57,399
disappear if you're going to if you're

252
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:59,759
going to harvest in that manner and

253
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:01,078
process in that manner you might well

254
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:03,439
want to taste it you know you don't just

255
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:05,838
want to cook them like you could throw

256
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,279
fresh frozen in distill it in a single

257
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,760
chamber and well you want to taste as

258
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:12,320
much as possible exactly exactly and you

259
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:14,480
want it to taste different right that's

260
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,160
that's the thing that that it was like

261
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,839
in my head I'm like okay this is going

262
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:21,519
to get you high yeah now the thca is

263
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:24,600
very potent it's isolated but the thing

264
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:28,799
is the the turps everybody chases the

265
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,839
turps like people chase turpion in life

266
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:33,679
oh I love this sushi spot it tastes

267
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,560
great or this this Mexican moonshine is

268
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:36,838
amazing you know what I mean like so

269
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:38,719
people chase turps and don't even

270
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:41,000
realize it and with cannabis it's like

271
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,399
oh what's the new Candy strain yeah

272
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,879
what's this what you're chasing the

273
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:49,039
turps it could have 100% you know THC

274
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:51,958
potency to it yeah that doesn't change

275
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:53,838
anything in terms of a quality

276
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:56,039
standpoint as a nostalgic standpoint you

277
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,200
don't crack a turkey and just look to

278
00:10:56,039 --> 00:11:00,319
see how icy it is you crack a turkey and

279
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,920
and you're trying to get the the smell

280
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,560
trying to okay this this smells like

281
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:06,039
cotton candy Skittles you know and

282
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:08,638
that's what they say it is oh wow this

283
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:11,759
is new so I'm like how do we bring that

284
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:13,240
to the consumer yeah cuz all my friends

285
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:14,559
on the East Coast everybody that has

286
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,079
shops and everybody that's kind of like

287
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:19,000
in that you know upand cominging Market

288
00:11:17,078 --> 00:11:20,399
it's kind of like you get the same

289
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,879
response for people that go from like

290
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,480
flower to Vapes and stuff where it's

291
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:27,399
kind of like yeah it tastes good but

292
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:29,480
it's like not like I couldn't it says uh

293
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:30,958
Skittles on it but I can't really

294
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,600
pinpoint it you know you can't taste the

295
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:35,239
Skittles bad trim turps you know again

296
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,000
you know it's just kind of like instead

297
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:41,200
of going the the quick and fast and easy

298
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,278
route like how do you make this like top

299
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,480
tier but still keep it Market

300
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:49,639
competitive from a price point you know

301
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:53,480
so we're able to introduce the ability

302
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:55,879
for the user on the screen to highlight

303
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,720
either the diamond or the sauce icon and

304
00:11:55,879 --> 00:12:00,278
change the intensity of either side to

305
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,759
your desired preference you know if you

306
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:05,439
want it to be more intense on your THC

307
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:08,039
you can up that if you want it to be

308
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,800
more flavorful and less intense you can

309
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:14,039
balance it to to your preference and

310
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:16,000
again with a simple turn and a pull you

311
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:18,879
can just drop in whatever TP tank you

312
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,639
want for that day so it's very

313
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:25,439
userfriendly it's very uh advantageous

314
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,480
to somebody who you know I when I see

315
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,040
this sometimes I think of

316
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,440
like uh like a

317
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:34,919
of three kids that can't just like step

318
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,959
out and roll a joint and like sit there

319
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:39,240
and come back in and it's kind of like

320
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:41,518
okay this is something she and she's

321
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,919
done you know she's high and nobody's

322
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,959
like you wreak like weed Mom that's the

323
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:49,919
biggest advantage of carts you don't

324
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:52,919
smell like flour like burnt flour in my

325
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:56,278
opinion you know with with the market

326
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:58,639
maturing Across America and you know to

327
00:12:56,278 --> 00:13:02,078
some degree you know Europe and other

328
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:04,440
places the world you're going to get

329
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:05,599
this type of necessity you know you're

330
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,360
going to have people that are going to

331
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,720
look at this and be like okay that's

332
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:13,278
awesome because I work in some company

333
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,600
and I have to go to the bathroom and I

334
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:16,278
want to take a [ __ ] head of this

335
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,959
while I'm sitting on the bathroom toilet

336
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:20,078
and I go back to work you know you can't

337
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:22,278
really go out front of the building and

338
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:23,799
pull out of Backwoods and start rolling

339
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:25,958
up and then go back and your boss is

340
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:28,639
like what are you doing so and this is

341
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:33,119
just the the truth of life like people

342
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:37,560
look for things to escape or make their

343
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:39,560
real world easier sure and they don't

344
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:41,759
necessarily want to risk what they have

345
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:45,958
by doing it you know I'm a flower guy

346
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:47,319
like for sure I love flower but you had

347
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,838
to bring if you're going to come to

348
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,278
Market in my mind with

349
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:53,399
something why not it be something novel

350
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:54,679
something that pushes the envelope a

351
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,679
little bit something that takes the

352
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:59,919
science of the plant and actually uses

353
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:02,159
that science to benefit the customer and

354
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:03,759
the overall experience on it there's

355
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:06,120
just not much these days like I showed

356
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,639
it to a few guys few operators that are

357
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:10,039
like within the extract space and The

358
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:12,399
Vape space and they were like finally

359
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:15,958
something that's different yeah

360
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:18,039
something that makes a change in in the

361
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:21,599
experience and then it was everything

362
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:23,360
besides that it was you know making sure

363
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,680
we're with the right manufacturers in

364
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:29,600
China yeah making sure that coming to

365
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:30,879
Market we have full quality control of

366
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,000
what's going out in the field from a

367
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:33,879
strain

368
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,600
standpoint making sure that the

369
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:36,879
extraction lab and it's the same guys

370
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,879
that I you know and I mean was working

371
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:41,360
with back in the day so we have a very

372
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:43,320
good relationship the guys at A1 you met

373
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,879
Jordan and Mike before yeah yeah good

374
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,879
good guys you know so it's like I'm

375
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:49,958
comfortable with who's in the supply

376
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:51,919
chain from that end right at that point

377
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:53,799
you know it's just money and and and and

378
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:55,000
heart like we said like if your heart's

379
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:57,000
behind it and you think that this is a

380
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,320
better product you know go for it and

381
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,399
you got some sort of work ethic yeah you

382
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,519
got to have a little something you got

383
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,679
to have a little something little

384
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,360
something so let's talk about turpins

385
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,638
for a minute because I feel like we can

386
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,839
educate everybody on Turpin because not

387
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:12,799
all tpin are created equal you have

388
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:16,680
native tpin which are basically native

389
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:18,278
to that distillate or to those diamonds

390
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:20,838
right if we're talking about Native and

391
00:15:18,278 --> 00:15:24,799
then there's cannabis derived tpes right

392
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:28,319
which are cannabis as opposed to

393
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:31,159
Botanical or plant derived tpin and then

394
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:33,120
there's the the artificial tpin yeah

395
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:35,679
right which are made in a lab so we have

396
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:39,560
these three or four categories of

397
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:41,838
tpin uh that people are using and

398
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:44,638
they're definitely not all created equal

399
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,959
the Cannabis derived or native tpin

400
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,198
depending on what you're doing are

401
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:50,318
typically a lot more expensive they're

402
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:53,559
harder to extract typically they're

403
00:15:50,318 --> 00:15:56,838
separated with cold extraction yep how

404
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:59,119
do they do it from a hydrocarbon stance

405
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:02,560
you are pushing solvent through the

406
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:06,078
material very cold and then you're

407
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:08,518
crashing at a low temp to purge the

408
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:10,599
solvent and create the crystalline

409
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:13,639
formulations and then you're fractioning

410
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:16,920
them separating them and then you're

411
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:19,440
again fining finalizing the purge and

412
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:22,120
then you're you're filling and supplying

413
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,600
I've been

414
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,919
obviously looking at the solventless

415
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,639
methods yeah with the right genetics

416
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:31,278
obviously because rosin and the solvent

417
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,399
list thing is is super genetic based for

418
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:35,799
being profitable or not right I think

419
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:37,720
with the right genetics and the right

420
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:40,318
mechanical separations which I've seen

421
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:42,680
them do you know like the the roll oh

422
00:16:40,318 --> 00:16:45,958
yeah wands of the the a that come from

423
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:49,359
rosin I kind of think I have a method

424
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:52,198
that you can do your initial squeeze

425
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,519
your 24-hour your whip and your cure

426
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:56,719
yeah and then I think that there's a way

427
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:59,560
mechanically with head pressure and

428
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,720
vacuum through a filtration C

429
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:05,399
yeah that you could separate the

430
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:07,439
two and then from there you have your a

431
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:11,798
maybe you got a cent fuge it just to get

432
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:13,919
any remaining leftover turp off and then

433
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:16,918
you can reformulate that into micro

434
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,919
diamonds with silicone molds and low

435
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:20,839
temps in back ovens right so now

436
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:22,520
essentially here's your solventless

437
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:24,918
diamond and here's your solventless

438
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:26,679
sauce I know the guy for that actually

439
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:28,520
okay his name is Kenny from triome

440
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:30,519
Technologies if there's anybody that can

441
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:32,359
figure it's him or he's probably already

442
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:34,000
figured it out to be honest yeah I I sit

443
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:35,918
around and I I think about that because

444
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,759
there's a a bigger Market segment

445
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:41,759
there's a bigger vantage point of people

446
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:43,879
and you know the way that information

447
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:46,400
transfers Across America like there was

448
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:48,760
a time where the other coast had no clue

449
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,960
right they didn't know what passers were

450
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:52,960
now they know what passers are now they

451
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,640
know what rosin is now you start to see

452
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,240
the education roll downhill to them yeah

453
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,280
and then it's like you know I don't want

454
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:04,079
to be that company that didn't do their

455
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:06,839
due diligence to be able to supply this

456
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:08,798
to them in a solventless fashion right

457
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:11,000
if that's what the buyer wants you make

458
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:13,480
the customer we spent all this time and

459
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,200
energy and effort to make something to

460
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:18,120
make the customer happy right you got to

461
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,080
do that you got to see that all the way

462
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:22,158
through well it's a fully customizable

463
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:24,158
experience so you can take it in any

464
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:27,039
direction you want you want higher tpin

465
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:29,360
and what kind of tpin and you know I

466
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:31,400
think that the Poss possibilities are

467
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:33,240
pretty much endless with which direction

468
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,519
you can go as a consumer which is nice

469
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,319
because as a company you can offer all

470
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:40,558
these great packages and great Concepts

471
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:42,839
yeah for people yeah I mean going in

472
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:44,440
going into a dispensary you know you buy

473
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:46,439
the diamonds and then you get an array

474
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,120
of turp Tanks to choose from and you

475
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,279
know it's like okay I'll take these

476
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:51,678
three and then well technically TPS can

477
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:52,879
be shipped in the mail so you could even

478
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,919
have them on your

479
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,360
website do a little farm bill action for

480
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:02,960
sure but the thing is what's nice about

481
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:06,479
TPS too and having you know jars of them

482
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,919
sitting yeah is that you can it's like

483
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,279
there's it's like a cheat code to

484
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,520
breeding to a degree because it's like

485
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:13,759
let's say we're like okay let's just

486
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:16,839
play around and make some cocktails 10%

487
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:18,839
of this 10% of this 80% of this

488
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:20,519
essentially you know you you obviously

489
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:23,038
know like when you're doing your your

490
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:25,359
breeding like you're looking for the the

491
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:27,000
turs of this is check salad joints you

492
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:28,519
know to get an idea it doesn't always

493
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,640
work out like that a lot of you know

494
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:31,119
that's the funny thing with breeding

495
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,559
though you pencil it out and it doesn't

496
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:34,279
look the same on paper as it does in

497
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:36,960
reality a lot of times I think the

498
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:38,119
future of rosin is blending just like

499
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,919
they blend

500
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:42,719
wine uh you know and I think also

501
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:44,679
blending turps together in the future

502
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,400
why not yeah right I think you can get

503
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:47,960
some really cool stuff I do a lot of you

504
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,038
know I think hash holes is a great

505
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,919
example people are trying to combine a

506
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:53,319
certain type of rosin with a certain

507
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,440
type of flower to get a certain type of

508
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:58,759
flavor and effect yeah and so it's the

509
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,400
same thing with the pen I think

510
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:02,640
that uh it's great we're exploring these

511
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,600
areas because I feel like we got to

512
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,960
leave no stone left unturned to a degree

513
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:08,359
especially in this space and there's so

514
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,519
many different directions you can go

515
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:11,879
right when you think you've got it all

516
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:13,879
figured out something new emerges yeah

517
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,159
right that's with like V Vape cartridges

518
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,440
and you know I got

519
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:20,200
my ays from Focus V and this is my dab

520
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,960
rig that I carry around in my pocket and

521
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,679
I love this but I'm all about Innovation

522
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,640
and I'm all about switching stuff up and

523
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:29,320
I think there's so many different

524
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,640
possibilities and I love it all because

525
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:33,158
I'm all about the experience too and

526
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,640
it's like and the experiences we can

527
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:36,240
have in life and all these different

528
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,000
experiences and where we can go with a

529
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,038
pen where I don't want to get super

530
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,200
baked but I definitely feel like smoking

531
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:44,200
having some turps in my mouth yeah you

532
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,720
know I mean that's great to be able to

533
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,880
choose you know in the morning you're

534
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,159
going to the gym you don't want to get

535
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,600
that ripped but you want to get just

536
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:52,039
right you want to get comfortable you

537
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:54,519
want to get comfortable and that's the

538
00:20:52,038 --> 00:20:59,038
thing is like the industry is is still

539
00:20:54,519 --> 00:21:02,759
full of our Our Generation and age right

540
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:05,440
so it's like if we gave up if we threw

541
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:07,960
the towel in like you know we're burnt

542
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,000
we've been at this a long time someone

543
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,200
else is going to figure it out I don't

544
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,400
know about this younger generation

545
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,519
though I have my doubts and fears you

546
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,120
know but I still see people emerging

547
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:19,798
that are creative and Innovative so much

548
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:22,959
the younger guys it's it's more the

549
00:21:19,798 --> 00:21:25,918
corporations and the guys that you know

550
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,640
money solves problems you know so to a

551
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,000
degree you see science scientists now

552
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,038
come on and the guy may have never

553
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,400
smoked weed before but he might be like

554
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:36,240
well why are we doing it like this cuz

555
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,640
the boiling points here are lower than

556
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:42,159
here so there's you need that too you

557
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:45,600
need that too but for it to push the

558
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:47,760
ball forward yeah if it comes from us

559
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:51,158

a very well respected long-term in this

567
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,038
industry guy people come here because

568
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,558
you are you like I'm talking to James

569
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:17,839
you know I'm not talking to John from

570
00:22:15,558 --> 00:22:20,639
Super scien tech.com that just got their

571
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:22,240
permit two years ago and you know they

572
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,559
still think Gorilla Glue is the best

573
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,079
thing in the world and I love Gorilla

574
00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:26,720
Glue but you understand what I'm saying

575
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:29,038
you get the dated I got a love hate

576
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,400
relationship with that Gorilla Glue

577
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:33,798
feel when red grew it in Orville like I

578
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,519
just remember being like what the [ __ ]

579
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:37,759
is this I remember when he just replaced

580
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:39,079
s diesel almost completely overnight you

581
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:40,519
know I think there there was like the

582
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:41,960
sour craze and all my friends that were

583
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:43,639
growing sour all our friends that were

584
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,120
growing sour and all of a sudden

585
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,640
everybody's growing Gorilla Glue and the

586
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:48,678
Gorilla Glue was amazing don't get me

587
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,120
wrong but I feel like it kind of just

588
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:53,400
stepped on sour right at the end there

589
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:56,239
finished faster it was gassy it checks

590
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,960
the basically it checks the boxes for

591
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,159
the the same boxes that Sour Diesel

592
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,038
checks

593
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:02,200
and so a lot of people were like well

594
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:03,158
I'm just going to grow this it finishes

595
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,519
faster I don't have to worry about the

596
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:07,760
rain at the end of the year uh the the

597
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:08,879
yields are good the buds dense the bag

598
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:12,079
appeal was

599
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,960
amazing had better structure than sour

600
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:17,119
definitely and it wasn't such a pain in

601
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:18,840
the ass to grow like s it sour and you'd

602
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:21,158
have you'd look at sour wrong and all of

603
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:23,278
a sudden it fingers out completely and

604
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:25,039
you got Fox tailes those were good times

605
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:26,919
though but I mean sour kind of built our

606
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:29,038
group of friends dud like sour and our

607
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:33,480
relationship with sour and

608
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:35,278
dog and you know Menino Sonoma humble

609
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:37,480
yeah like within our circle of friends

610
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:40,119
that kind of built our group and then

611
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,960
Gorilla Glue comes in and freaking

612
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:44,879
basically Gorilla Glue kind of took over

613
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:47,038
for a little bit absolutely it did and

614
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,480
it was kind of like it would it had that

615
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:50,759
trajectory that dream had you know cuz

616
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,720
it was like people like this [ __ ]

617
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:54,079
thing yields it's got a wonderful turp

618
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,679
content you know what I mean it's like

619
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:57,158
let's dream was good too at one point

620
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,720
some people don't remember it but dream

621
00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:02,000
was the one like literally blue dream

622
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,919
when it peaked it it peaked people were

623
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,200
like tripping on how good it was too and

624
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:08,400
it was sticky and it had the bag appeal

625
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,880
there were so many good things about it

626
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,120
the effect maybe wasn't there for

627
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,679
everybody but as far as bag appeal yeah

628
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:15,239
it was was where it was at you know it

629
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,519
was some of the best it was definitely

630
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,359
wonderful um you know just back to like

631
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:21,918
the importance of the tpine and like you

632
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:23,839
know if you think about it from an

633
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,759
industry standard where they're like oh

634
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:27,519
sprayed packs the sprayed packs I what

635
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:30,640
the [ __ ] are they spraying it with tpin

636
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:32,798
whether they're native or not or

637
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:36,000
artificial or whatever I'm not

638
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:38,440
justifying the actions no I'm not saying

639
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,398
that this is right but I'm just saying

640
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,558
this is what they're doing from a

641
00:24:40,398 --> 00:24:46,479
mechanical level like they are trying to

642
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:49,240
increase yeah the tpine content so it

643
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,798
pops it jumps because when you're

644
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:54,558
rolling yeah and it's

645
00:24:51,798 --> 00:24:55,879
loud this is going to get me lit like

646
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:58,639
this it's just the whole thing you're

647
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:00,960
smoking it through a a backwoods it

648
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,840
still tastes all turpy yeah you know I

649
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,038
think that's part of the appeal of the

650
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:07,558
tped Ted flour yeah U and you know what

651
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:09,278
I don't I'm not judging I don't care if

652
00:25:07,558 --> 00:25:11,599
you like it you like it and if you don't

653
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:14,798
you don't I'm it's not my thing really

654
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:17,038
but I also understand its value for

655
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:18,440
certain demographics you know if you

656
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:20,158
look at it from that perspective and

657
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,558
yeah it is people chase flavor right at

658
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:24,760
the end of there's flavor Chasers all

659
00:25:21,558 --> 00:25:26,398
over with everything in life 100% 100%

660
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:28,359
And with ours it's like I've met with a

661
00:25:26,398 --> 00:25:30,479
few people that kind of like they didn't

662
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:32,479
nudge me but they kind of like laid out

663
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,759
a portfolio of companies that they could

664
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,360
feed the hardware to just solely the

665
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:39,759
hardware yeah and the problem in my mind

666
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:42,759
with just giving this out as Hardware or

667
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:44,158
doing that sort of thing is like you

668
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:48,720
lose

669
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:51,320
control over the QC yeah of what inputs

670
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,960
end up in there yeah do I want to come

671
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:56,918
out to market with the brand right now

672
00:25:53,960 --> 00:26:00,200
is it is it uh you know a heavy load to

673
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:01,960
bear on like like just life like you

674
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:04,600
know like we talk about a lot of work

675
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:06,759
right yeah but if I were to just go that

676
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:08,519
route and just like okay we'll sell

677
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:11,759
Hardware to a thousand different

678
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:14,398
companies a thousand times over and

679
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:18,599
they're putting bgrade [ __ ] tpps in

680
00:26:14,398 --> 00:26:23,158
and it's just not like this Tech cannot

681
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:25,639
be an experience that a single chamber

682
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:27,399
trimmed Ted hot dog water cart would

683
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:30,399
give you because it doesn't make sense

684
00:26:27,398 --> 00:26:32,239
why all the this and this right why are

685
00:26:30,398 --> 00:26:35,719
you going to jump through these

686
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:39,440
hoops if at the end of the day the

687
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:42,839
experience is the same right so our

688
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,919
thing is like get the couple acres grab

689
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:47,959
these

690
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:50,080
Frozen or dry cured immediately Frozen

691
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,278
MH that's another thing we'll talk about

692
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:55,319
next

693
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:56,839
but bring the quality of the technology

694
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:59,798
and match it to the quality of the

695
00:26:56,839 --> 00:27:01,759
experience yeah so it's like then you

696
00:26:59,798 --> 00:27:05,679
take it from our standpoint where it's

697
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:07,480
like guys love Frozen yeah because of

698
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:10,480
those volatiles and it's like you know

699
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:14,120
we know what wet sour smells like yeah

700
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:18,519
but if you have a 100,000 cartridges on

701
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:20,359
wreck to Consumers that have never

702
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:21,639
walked through a field an indoor or

703
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:25,439
anything before in their life never

704
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:27,520
grown a Canabis plant yeah that wet may

705
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,798
not be that nostalgic reminder of that

706
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:32,839
strain

707
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:36,918
so if you were to dry the flow freeze it

708
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:40,639
process it those TPS are going to be eye

709
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:43,600
to eye with the dried flow

710
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,640
cryocure yeah or or any I mean just

711
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:47,439
cryotechnology

712
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,399
I've heard about that where they're like

713
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,759
where they're changing that but in my

714
00:27:49,398 --> 00:27:54,038
opinion it's like and I had this

715
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:56,640
discussion with somebody today like is

716
00:27:54,038 --> 00:27:59,158
it smarter to appeal to the to the guys

717
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,679
like us or is it harder to appeal for

718
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:03,360
the common person that may have

719
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,759
experienced these same strains and

720
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:08,479
flower so that when they hit it they

721
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:10,759
realize that oh my God that tastes like

722
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,079
I stuck my face in a bag of Blue Dream

723
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:13,319
you know like you're you're you're

724
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:16,199
smoking the

725
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:18,798
SM smell so you know at the end of the

726
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,519
day it's like that's you have to

727
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:23,000
sometimes not think about you or your

728
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:26,159
peers or or the industry and you have to

729
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,079
just solely base your trajectory and

730
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:32,200
your road map and how you're formulating

731
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:34,480
your inputs on the buyer on the consumer

732
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:37,319
on the person that's going to leave that

733
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,919
Yelp review you know like well yeah I

734
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:42,000
mean I think there's that Ultimate

735
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,559
Experience too that you can provide that

736
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,798
that's unique and that's what'll set you

737
00:28:43,558 --> 00:28:46,240
apart from everybody else if you can

738
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:51,000
provide an experience that's different

739
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:52,319
that's better that sticks with people if

740
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,159
you can get people's head and they're

741
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:56,278
like wow that's the best thing I've ever

742
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,880
tasted yeah then you're on to something

743
00:28:56,278 --> 00:28:59,440
it's just that's what it's all about

744
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,000
with whether you're a breeder whether

745
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,919
you're making extract whether you're

746
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,679
making extract equipment it's all about

747
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,080
chasing flavor and giving people and

748
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,919
chasing experiences right yeah so yeah

749
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,798
if you can give this I mean same thing

750
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:14,080
with breeding if you can create a new

751
00:29:11,798 --> 00:29:15,798
variety that's different from everything

752
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:17,240
else everybody has that's not just a

753
00:29:15,798 --> 00:29:20,440
derivative of all this other stuff but

754
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:22,640
that's actual a new thing then you win

755
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,200
then you're on to something special and

756
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,880
you think of it from an environmental

757
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:29,120
standpoint like you know you see these

758
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,960
States California cracking down on how

759
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:32,239
you're disposing of the lithium and then

760
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,200
you see them cracking down on the

761
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,880
flavors people are using like yeah you

762
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,558
can't really use all this artificial

763
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,080
[ __ ] here anymore like it's not good for

764
00:29:37,558 --> 00:29:41,599
people none of this has been clinically

765
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:43,879
Tri yeah you can't see what's happening

766
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:46,918
to somebody more menthol cigarettes guys

767
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:48,840
yeah but I mean shout out all shout out

768
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:51,399
all my Newport smokers but you know what

769
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:53,558
I mean like at the end of the day it's

770
00:29:51,398 --> 00:29:56,759
you know if you can buy a

771
00:29:53,558 --> 00:30:00,319
battery yeah and recharge the battery

772
00:29:56,759 --> 00:30:02,960
and not be you know a waste on the

773
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:06,558
environment for lithium like why not if

774
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,240
the tech is there why not just use it

775
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:10,798
because at the end of the day waste is

776
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:13,440
waste and you know lithium's a you can't

777
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:16,278
just like throw it in the landfill and

778
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,240
things can happen in in Mass right so

779
00:30:16,278 --> 00:30:19,960
the T and the same thing with the tpin

780
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,759
it's like at least you and I know we've

781
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:23,840
been smoking flour forever and all this

782
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:27,038
comes from that same flower smoking so

783
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:29,639
we don't have to be like just is this

784
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:30,599
mysterious to my body or not like this

785
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:34,080
is

786
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:35,599
what this is what cannabis is like

787
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:37,678
you're legalizing everybody's pushing

788
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:39,480
for the the motion of the legalization

789
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:43,038
of cannabis right everybody's looking at

790
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:46,120
it from a Countrywide scale now you know

791
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:47,839
it's like businesses or companies are

792
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:50,000
putting their

793
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:52,639
projections in front of them like if

794
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,200
this were to happen this is where we

795
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:58,038
would be so why would you need to do

796
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,319
anything else there's so many people

797
00:30:58,038 --> 00:31:02,558
that haven't even just experienced the

798
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:06,278
plant right why do you need to

799
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:09,278
substitute that with weirdo [ __ ] just

800
00:31:06,278 --> 00:31:10,679
because it lowers your bottom line like

801
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:12,880
and that's the thing it's like you know

802
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:14,639
some people are super [ __ ] greedy

803
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,200
some people don't care about whether or

804
00:31:14,638 --> 00:31:19,158
not they're doing this or that to the to

805
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,319
their consumer because it meets their

806
00:31:19,159 --> 00:31:23,639
bottom line they meet their p&amp;l sheet

807
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:27,240
looks good their performer my this my

808
00:31:23,638 --> 00:31:28,759
that sure you and I both know like the

809
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:31,519
essence of this

810
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:34,359
starting off sure there's money to be

811
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:36,399
made there was always money to be made

812
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:40,359
but there was a Brotherhood yeah there

813
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:41,678
was a I'm selling this and doing this

814
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:43,240
well our friends are kind of different

815
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,159
because we were all about quality we

816
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,120
wanted the best [ __ ] possible and we

817
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:49,039
didn't give a [ __ ] about price it was

818
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:50,918
always about having the very best of the

819
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:54,119
very best I feel like we always fought

820
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:55,880
for that it was always that strive to

821
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:58,038
for greatness you know I mean with

822
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:00,039
everything that we've always done with

823
00:31:58,038 --> 00:32:04,200
happiness it brought normal people that

824
00:32:00,038 --> 00:32:06,000
like had access in 2002 to a bag of good

825
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,120
weed and it's like yeah they had a

826
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,759
stressful day at work yeah they want to

827
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:13,599
go home and smoke a bowl here's an eth

828
00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:15,200

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:21,240
mean like totally some top shelf some

831
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:24,960
top shelf and it's like that

832
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:27,200
happiness was a motivator yeah and you

833
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,558
almost can't put an a price on an

834
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,159
experience you I mean you can but you

835
00:32:29,558 --> 00:32:33,319
almost can't put a price on an

836
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:35,080
experience it's like cuz those are like

837
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:37,240
especially some of this stuff it's like

838
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:39,798
batch to batch craft flow that we had

839
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:41,359
back in the day yeah that was just like

840
00:32:39,798 --> 00:32:43,359
some of the stuff coming out was so

841
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:45,278
amazing some of the stuff where people

842
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:46,599
were like oh Durban Poison for instance

843
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:48,038
people like oh Durban Poison no the

844
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:49,759
Durban Poison that was going around back

845
00:32:48,038 --> 00:32:51,240
in the day completely different

846
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:53,398
completely different than it is today

847
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:59,038
completely it wasn't it wasn't very hazy

848
00:32:53,398 --> 00:33:00,518
it was super funky uh in sensey ha Haze

849
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:05,038
was maybe there was a little bit of haze

850
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:07,399
but it was more so the the Cherry anise

851
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:09,200
and Funk and also the structure of it

852
00:33:07,398 --> 00:33:12,239
back then it was like appeeling from a

853
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,960
structural like a color structure to me

854
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,679
it was bright orange hairs you know what

855
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,840
I mean and like some people don't like

856
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,399
the hairs because they cover up the

857
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:20,079
tricomes but it's like that stuff it

858
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:21,518
didn't matter like I love good Durban

859
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:23,558
some of those African land race

860
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:25,960
varieties that we got that were closer

861
00:33:23,558 --> 00:33:27,519
to the land race of what it really was

862
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,960
than these watered down versions I see a

863
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:32,720
lot of times today MH uh you know the

864
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,319
red congales the Malo and the Durban

865
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,240
those were the three special things that

866
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:37,519
we kind of saw in the Bay Area I love

867
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,519
all them for different reasons the

868
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:44,159
Durban was super strong 100% dick in the

869
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:46,519
dirt but like having having that impact

870
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:49,840
on someone's life to

871
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:51,519
like let them reset for the next day or

872
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:54,158
let them help them get through their day

873
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:56,679
or that was a motivating factor for me

874
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:58,559
because like if you ran the gamut back

875
00:33:56,679 --> 00:34:00,759
then the money was

876
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:03,038
guaranteed yeah you know it's like

877
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:04,798
theory of doing art or music is like you

878
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:07,240
do it for the passion you do what you

879
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:09,838
love yeah and the money will come you

880
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:11,199
know money's not the first yeah it's a

881
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:13,320
devotional thing and we talk about on

882
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,638
the show about devotional arts and

883
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,480
cannabis now it's turned into a

884
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,878
devotional thing too like art where you

885
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,398
basically do the best you can you put it

886
00:34:18,878 --> 00:34:23,239
out in the world and if the world loves

887
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:26,118
it you know you win but either way you

888
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:27,479
loved creating it right exctly it's it's

889
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:28,879
a different world now with cannabis

890
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,358
before before it was like pretty much

891
00:34:28,878 --> 00:34:32,159
you could grow mids and you could be

892
00:34:30,358 --> 00:34:34,719
successful now you cannot do that you

893
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,919
cannot grow middle-grade cannabis as a

894
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:39,000
small producer and expect to be

895
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:41,158
successful you will fail very difficult

896
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,639
you'll fail extremely hard you know

897
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:44,280
coming online you think cannabis is

898
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:47,119
going to be easy money it's not it's

899
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:49,560
devotional and it's like it takes eating

900
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:52,119
sleeping and breathing what you're doing

901
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:53,398
to be successful these days and it's

902
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:55,358
it's the Beauty and the curse of it

903
00:34:53,398 --> 00:34:57,199
because it's beautiful in some ways some

904
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:59,000
of these people and and how they're

905
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:01,358
devoted and some of our friends and how

906
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,599
they're devoted to what they do you know

907
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:04,519
even Paulie for instance when he was

908
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:07,359
growing flower in California his flower

909
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:09,880
was amazing his his Greenhouse flower

910
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:12,880
that he was doing was as good as a lot

911
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:14,320
of indoor it was topshelf greenhouse and

912
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,599
it was the genetics it was the way he

913
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:19,320
grew it the way he harvested it trimmed

914
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:21,400
it dried it cured it and stored it it's

915
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:24,079
all those components adding up to this

916
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:26,160
amazing beautiful product you know and

917
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:28,280
it's it's great when we have people like

918
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:30,000
that and it's more motivating for me

919
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:33,880
being around people that are like that

920
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,960
yeah 100% And you know now it is what it

921
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:38,358
is and it it has its goods and its bads

922
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,199
and you know we could sit here and

923
00:35:38,358 --> 00:35:42,519
probably complain more now than we could

924
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:44,039
Applause but you know we're still going

925
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:46,679
to stay here and we're still going to

926
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:48,440
push the ball forward and you know at

927
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:50,318
the end of the day this is this is what

928
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:52,280
we came here to do so you just got to

929
00:35:50,318 --> 00:35:55,519
see it through yeah you know you just

930
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:58,519
have to see it through but unfortunately

931
00:35:55,519 --> 00:36:01,039
like life's getting strangely expensive

932
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:02,759
everywhere and well I don't think it's

933
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:04,599
actually more expensive I just think the

934
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,800
dollar is worth less than it used to be

935
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:09,559
yeah either way it goes deeper in your

936
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,280
pocket way price of flour has definitely

937
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:14,358
gone down and the value of it has gone

938
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,319
down compared to where wood was back in

939
00:36:14,358 --> 00:36:18,159
the day because if you look at the

940
00:36:15,318 --> 00:36:20,159
$4,000 pound for 20 years ago yeah that

941
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:22,799
would actually you you go 10x on that

942
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:24,559
that's $40,000 for that same pound yep

943
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,000
maybe not 10x maybe it's five but

944
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:29,358
$20,000 a pound let's keep it at 10x

945
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,318
let's just crazy right when we when we

946
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:33,239
start talking like that where they got

947
00:36:31,318 --> 00:36:35,480
$4,000 a pound not only do they get

948
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:38,239
$4,000 a pound but the dollar was so

949
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:43,318
much stronger yeah that now that $4,000

950
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:44,439
a pound is 10 20 30 40 whatever you want

951
00:36:43,318 --> 00:36:46,400
number you want to put it doesn't really

952
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,800
matter it's not even hypothetical we

953
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,559
could probably do the math and come up

954
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,920
with some real factual numbers where

955
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:55,759
it's like [ __ ] that's crazy because now

956
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:58,039
that pound that's $300 for that outdoor

957
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:01,640
if you look at it from years ago that's

958
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:04,719
only worth like $50 yep yeah $50 from

959
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:06,480
the '90s or early 2000s right no one was

960
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:08,639
no one would take $50 for a pound there

961
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,960
was no one selling $50 pounds back in

962
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:13,960
the day no I mean we live in Wild times

963
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:16,599
three and a half grams was 50 bucks you

964
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:18,679
know like they but even for the Mexican

965
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:20,519
it was like you might get an ounce for

966
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:22,559
50 bucks if you were lucky it was

967
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:25,440
typically 100 an ounce for Mexican weed

968
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:27,719
back 100% cuz the pounds would be like

969
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,880
anywhere from 5 to 8 depending where you

970
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:31,358
were at on the supply chain so it's like

971
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:34,440
if you're paying that or maybe it was

972
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:36,920
cheaper in bulk and SoCal yeah but like

973
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:39,880
I wasn't trapping when I was 14 sending

974
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:42,838
Mexican around so I just remember seeing

975
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:45,800
it on the east coast and in high school

976
00:37:42,838 --> 00:37:49,759
like 160 bucks an ounce you know yeah so

977
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:52,079
it was like it's never been this low if

978
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,599
you chop it down into numbers price per

979
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:56,920
gram never been price per gram at

980
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:58,720
inflation what's so funny though is when

981
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:01,200
you're deal dealing with real estate

982
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:02,838
agents and these corporate Jack offs

983
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:05,519
like out east and you're trying to let's

984
00:38:02,838 --> 00:38:08,199
say secure a facility to build a grow

985
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:10,559
because for example I got the social

986
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:12,239
Equity permits in Washington DC I got

987
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:13,838
the whole vertical integration permits

988
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:16,318
from the FED case that I went through

989
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:18,519
right and they're like yeah if you had a

990
00:38:16,318 --> 00:38:22,119
can of charge and you live in DC you

991
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:24,400
know you can apply so was in town

992
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:26,400
ironically [ __ ] it let me do it I had a

993
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,599
buddy that had some real estate signed

994
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,240
my name and yeah change the driver's

995
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:32,640
license filled out the apps next thing

996
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:35,559
you know I have these permits I'm like

997
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:37,239
okay let's knock on some doors and see

998
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:40,078
from a real estate perspective what's

999
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:43,799
out there and then it'll be like oh yeah

1000
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:46,000
online it says 1750 a square foot what

1001
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:48,000
are you doing in there and I'm like you

1002
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,960
we have a cultivation license so we'd

1003
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:55,519
like to build a medical cannabis grow

1004
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:59,599
oh that's fine but the price per square

1005
00:38:55,519 --> 00:39:00,960
foot is now 2750 so it's like yeah all

1006
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:03,880
these

1007
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:06,519
people from a corporate standpoint that

1008
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:10,599
are detached from the industry they hear

1009
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:13,159
it and they automatically think that

1010
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:14,920
these guys are printing money you know

1011
00:39:13,159 --> 00:39:18,118
we can squeeze them well it's the

1012
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:21,599
Cannabis tax and it's you get taxed on

1013
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:23,318
every level from everybody all over with

1014
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:26,240
you know cannabis hemp whatever all of

1015
00:39:23,318 --> 00:39:28,239
it there's always that cannabis plus tax

1016
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:31,439
where it's ridiculous dude it's

1017
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:34,479
ridiculous and it it's lack of knowledge

1018
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,720
and again like nobody has released a

1019
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,960
documentary or something that at least

1020
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:42,199
shows the world where it started up here

1021
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:46,358
yeah and where it's you know ended at in

1022
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:48,159
today's you know footprint like I think

1023
00:39:46,358 --> 00:39:51,000
that there needs to be some sort of

1024
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:52,598
mainstream whether Netflix or whatever

1025
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,039
yeah there needs to be something that

1026
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:58,400
shows the truth from Camp all the way

1027
00:39:56,039 --> 00:40:00,159
down to now you know

1028
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,599
McDonald's documentary what was it not

1029
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:04,960
super high me but the what super me

1030
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:07,599
super siiz me super high me was the good

1031
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:10,039
one though yeah super siiz me yeah

1032
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:12,680
that's funny there's got to be some sort

1033
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:15,519
of of documentation that's shown because

1034
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:17,078
like you can't just let them tell it you

1035
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:19,239
you let them tell it they're never going

1036
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:21,480
to show the guys that really became

1037
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:23,519
Martyrs or or well no but this is the

1038
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:25,480
beauty of podcast we have the

1039
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:26,599
opportunity to hear from so many

1040
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,240
different people and get so many

1041
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:30,079
perspectives it's not like it used to be

1042
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:32,239
where one person is telling the history

1043
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:34,039
of the world right or or not even one

1044
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:36,799
person but let's say 20 people have

1045
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:39,559
history books now we have a 100,000

1046
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,519
podcasts of different experience right

1047
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:43,039
and

1048
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:45,119
so history is changing in the sense that

1049
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:46,880
we have more history told by more people

1050
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:50,280
so we're getting more perspective on

1051
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:52,519
reality the opportunity is there now to

1052
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:54,440
have all these different stories that

1053
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:57,079
are told from the mouths of people not

1054
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,800
second or third or fourth hand stories

1055
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:59,680
yeah

1056
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,800
and so that's the beauty of technology I

1057
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:03,559
mean there's a lot of the curse side of

1058
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,720
it but I think that's the beauty side of

1059
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:07,039
it and the beauty side of History moving

1060
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:09,439
forward is now we have all the

1061
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:12,480
opportunity to tell our own story in our

1062
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:14,119
own and our own version of the story

1063
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,519
yeah and I think that's a beautiful part

1064
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:17,200
before it gets weird and skewed by

1065
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:19,679
somebody else yeah and I mean it's going

1066
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:21,719
to get weird in anyway history's

1067
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:24,879
becoming weird with technology and all

1068
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:26,519
these things and yeah you know I never

1069
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,559
thought in my life that I wouldn't be

1070
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:30,119
able to relate to the younger

1071
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:32,880
Generations like the you know the

1072
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:34,160
teenagers because I was I always felt as

1073
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,559
I've gotten older that I could relate

1074
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:37,000
and then in the last couple years it's

1075
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:38,920
been interesting because I feel like I

1076
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,239
don't relate to the younger kids quite

1077
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,920
as much I don't understand you know I

1078
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:44,399
think my parents same thing was like

1079
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,838
they didn't understand the work ethic of

1080
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,800
Our Generation and my grandparents

1081
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:50,519
didn't understand that because I come

1082
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:52,240
from hardworking people yeah my parents

1083
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:55,239
my grandparents everybody they're

1084
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:56,759
hardworking people and so I heard them

1085
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:58,279
talking about the work ethic well I see

1086
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,800
the younger got kids and it's like their

1087
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:03,640
work ethic is much different uh their

1088
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,480
focus on stuff is much different yeah I

1089
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:07,759
try not to judge too much you know I try

1090
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:09,358
to just focus on myself but I'm also

1091
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:12,400
observant of what's going on in the

1092
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:15,318
world yeah and I agree you know it's

1093
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:17,880
like they might be able to code you a

1094
00:42:15,318 --> 00:42:19,639
whole scenario for an idea that you have

1095
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:22,240
but they couldn't change at Tire to save

1096
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:23,519
the death of them so and not everybody's

1097
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:25,399
like that I mean we're kind of putting

1098
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:27,159
them all in a box but coding is going to

1099
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,358
be a thing in the past anyway with AI

1100
00:42:27,159 --> 00:42:29,960
you don't have to learn how to code

1101
00:42:28,358 --> 00:42:32,519
you'll be able to use AI to code

1102
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:34,920
anything that you want yeah which is

1103
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:38,318
another scary step in the future that

1104
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:40,358
you know it's a little weary like the

1105
00:42:38,318 --> 00:42:42,358
thought of removing the human element

1106
00:42:40,358 --> 00:42:43,960
from things yeah you know like there's

1107
00:42:42,358 --> 00:42:46,759
AI music

1108
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:50,440
like I've seen some sort of inputs and

1109
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:52,520
prompts lead to some sort of output yeah

1110
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:55,760
but it's like dude you're taking away

1111
00:42:52,519 --> 00:42:58,119
the idea of the musician like some of

1112
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:01,160
the most artistic influence IAL people

1113
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:04,280
that will be in your life that we grew

1114
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:07,159
up like oh I love the boom you know like

1115
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:10,400
now you be able to make better music

1116
00:43:07,159 --> 00:43:13,279
than human music I don't think so but I

1117
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:16,680
don't know but I think that we all have

1118
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:19,519
influence and for AI to have influence

1119
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:21,000
from our influences I mean that there's

1120
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:23,159
a natural progression there it's a

1121
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,960
really strange thing there's no AI hris

1122
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:29,598
you know there's no AI Le Zeppelin

1123
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:32,039
there's no a you know but but yet yet

1124
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:35,240
but the brain will get smarter yeah you

1125
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:40,558
know but there's easily

1126
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:42,679
AI dance music AI hip-hop beats AI that

1127
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:45,480
from the way that artistic side of the

1128
00:43:42,679 --> 00:43:47,919
world is going it's very easy to be

1129
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:49,800
like okay now go in there and rap on

1130
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:52,240
that and well then where does cannabis

1131
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,760
go with AI you know it's like because so

1132
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:55,799
I I can tell you I can tell you with

1133
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,319
breeding where it goes where AI does

1134
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,318
predictive modeling and so we're to be

1135
00:43:57,318 --> 00:44:00,880
able to use predictive modeling from AI

1136
00:43:59,318 --> 00:44:03,039
to actually speed up the process of

1137
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,079
breeding when we're trying to reach

1138
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:06,719
specific goals and the more data we have

1139
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:08,680
to give it the easier it's going to be

1140
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:10,239
to tell us a path and give us a

1141
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:11,759
successful path for going in the

1142
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:16,000
directions we want to go because what it

1143
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:19,359
can analyze DNA at such a data at such a

1144
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,679
fast rate way faster than we could and

1145
00:44:19,358 --> 00:44:21,759
you know it's like it can take the

1146
00:44:20,679 --> 00:44:23,960
things that we're doing and it

1147
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,520
accelerated a lot faster I mean like I

1148
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:27,440
said there's probably good things and

1149
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:28,920
bad things with it in general at point

1150
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,720
in my life I hang with my dogs that

1151
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:32,639
don't turn on the TV and I try not to

1152
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:34,519
look at my [ __ ] phone too much so

1153
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:37,078
it's like you know I don't need the

1154
00:44:34,519 --> 00:44:39,119
anxiety you know for so many years

1155
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:41,960
living and

1156
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:43,640
working anxiety as the US and in Europe

1157
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:44,800
too right so you've been on it off you

1158
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:47,199
and your wife live out there a little

1159
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:50,240
bit yeah I I met my wife in California

1160
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:51,199
and it was I'd gotten home from the feds

1161
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:54,118
in

1162
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:58,598
2010 and then was back on the hill in

1163
00:44:54,119 --> 00:45:00,200
2014 after probation was done and um you

1164
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:03,039
know thanks to Red he brought me right

1165
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:06,039
back on the hill and was like I met my

1166
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:09,599
wife that year and then ended up still

1167
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:12,279
staying in California working until 2018

1168
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:14,800
yeah and at the end of 2018 after that

1169
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:17,040
Harvest I was like all right let's just

1170
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:20,318
go like I'm burnt out

1171
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:23,079
again same [ __ ] different year so I was

1172
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:25,880
just like I I need a break I need like a

1173
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:27,920
a Moment of clarity in my life where

1174
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:32,280
like I can just focus on the things I

1175
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:35,880
love and not you know lose a toe trying

1176
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:38,240
so I did that and in in the back I'm

1177
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:41,119
working on Portugal I'm working on the

1178
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:43,439
cartridge you know still doing some work

1179
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:46,119
out here but popping in popping out you

1180
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,960
know and and sleeping standing up on

1181
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:49,440
flights and it was a little gnarly the

1182
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:51,480
first two years to Ping ponging because

1183
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,400
it you got to still have it and you

1184
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:55,400
don't want to live like that and it's

1185
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:57,000
rough that yeah it was easy for me to

1186
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,880
get visas in Europe cuz it's like

1187
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,159
reunification of family and my wife is

1188
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:03,358
there so it wasn't like it's not very

1189
00:46:01,159 --> 00:46:05,039
difficult for me to V I had a Visa in

1190
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:07,920
Austria I lived in Austria the

1191
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:10,800
Netherlands Berlin and now I'm outside

1192
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:13,440
of Barcelona nice so now that all this

1193
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:15,480
is coming back and this is done excuse

1194
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,838
all this is getting done and I might be

1195
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,280
coming back you know and now I'm kind of

1196
00:46:17,838 --> 00:46:20,599
driving around here like do I really

1197
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:23,240
want to come back here because like

1198
00:46:20,599 --> 00:46:25,160
Spain is so peaceful it's so peaceful

1199
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:27,519
beautiful yeah I love Barcelona

1200
00:46:25,159 --> 00:46:29,480
especially the outskirts of Barcelona

1201
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:31,480
it's just so mellow it's it's like a

1202
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:33,519
slower pace of life right even in

1203
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:35,838
Barcelona even though there is like the

1204
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:38,519
faster paced Barcelona life the party

1205
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:40,960
life you know staying out late hanging

1206
00:46:38,519 --> 00:46:43,559
out eating good food food's wonderful

1207
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:45,199
yeah I mean but it is a slower pace of

1208
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:46,760
life like the machine doesn't move like

1209
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:49,399
that out there you know so if you're

1210
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:51,040
expecting turnover times of next day

1211
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,760
it's not if you want to get [ __ ] done it

1212
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:55,199
just it doesn't move at the same speed

1213
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:57,359
so going there as an American or a

1214
00:46:55,199 --> 00:46:59,719
Californian from the bay are and then

1215
00:46:57,358 --> 00:47:01,519
going expecting people to do stuff on

1216
00:46:59,719 --> 00:47:02,879
your schedule it just doesn't happen no

1217
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:04,358
it's not happening you want to set up a

1218
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,838
business it takes a long time to set up

1219
00:47:04,358 --> 00:47:08,960
a business in Barcelona it's not easy

1220
00:47:06,838 --> 00:47:11,199
and the difference is is if you have

1221
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:14,039
money you can move the needle a lot

1222
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:16,519
faster right so that's one advantage of

1223
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:18,558
going to places like Spain where I feel

1224
00:47:16,519 --> 00:47:20,920
like you go in there and you just want

1225
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:22,680
to do stuff like everybody else and but

1226
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:24,480
no if you want to pay a good lawyer that

1227
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:26,239
knows how to maneuver through the system

1228
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,880
it's more it's way more expensive but

1229
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:29,519
you can set up business in 6 weeks

1230
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:32,480
whereas it might take you 6 months to a

1231
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:34,000
year or longer if you're just trying to

1232
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:36,280
go through the regular channels and do

1233
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,719
stuff like everybody else 100% so

1234
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:39,760
sometimes you know your money is your

1235
00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:41,519
shovel as they say they dig your tunnel

1236
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:44,079
you know so in certain places and it's

1237
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:45,800
not like American like leave $100,000 on

1238
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:47,480
my back doorstep it's kind of like a

1239
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:49,440
little bit of money goes a long way

1240
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:52,280
because right if you look at the the

1241
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:55,720
average income and how people live there

1242
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:58,559
and you compare it to here and the

1243
00:47:55,719 --> 00:48:00,838
ability to make money yeah it's it's a

1244
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:04,160
completely different animal than America

1245
00:48:00,838 --> 00:48:07,838
and you know I'm hearing a lot of talk

1246
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:10,318
about Americans that's the promised land

1247
00:48:07,838 --> 00:48:12,279
yeah we're done here well the side

1248
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:14,239
hustle was invented in Spain I feel like

1249
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:15,839
everybody I know from Spain has a side

1250
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:19,039
hustle of some form you know what I mean

1251
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:21,920
everybody does some alternative form of

1252
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:23,679
work to to make money and yeah you know

1253
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,159
so they they do know how to work they

1254
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:27,039
just work at a different pace and a

1255
00:48:25,159 --> 00:48:29,480
different speed and they're way more

1256
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:32,000
relaxed they also value different things

1257
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:34,440
in life more than we value so and I'm

1258
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,239
not saying like us personally me and you

1259
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:38,200
but it's it's like you know there's the

1260
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:40,479
money is your god and then there's the

1261
00:48:38,199 --> 00:48:42,000
money is cool but life is cooler yeah

1262
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,559
there's that whole social life that

1263
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,159
everybody has out there that I think is

1264
00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:47,480
missing from a lot of people and I think

1265
00:48:45,159 --> 00:48:50,039
that's something that we probably

1266
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:51,480
absorbed from our friends that spent

1267
00:48:50,039 --> 00:48:53,039
time in Europe originally and then

1268
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:56,838
spending time in Europe ourselves we

1269
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:58,719
really kind of fell uh you know we felt

1270
00:48:56,838 --> 00:49:00,639
aligned to that kind of Lifestyle yeah

1271
00:48:58,719 --> 00:49:03,199
and I mean I still am a workaholic I

1272
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:05,719
still work my ass off but I also have

1273
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:07,798
that need need for a social life need

1274
00:49:05,719 --> 00:49:09,239
for friends I still go hang out at

1275
00:49:07,798 --> 00:49:10,880
friends on the weekends and we cook and

1276
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:12,919
we do fun stuff you know keep a life

1277
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,358
Balanced Life you know it is a there I

1278
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:17,200
mean I I wouldn't say I have a balanced

1279
00:49:14,358 --> 00:49:19,239
life even close but I still treasure

1280
00:49:17,199 --> 00:49:21,399
those experiences with my friends where

1281
00:49:19,239 --> 00:49:23,039
we can do stuff I mean I I would say

1282
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:26,318
that there is no work life balance for

1283
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:28,000
me but I still enjoy I have great

1284
00:49:26,318 --> 00:49:29,639
friends and my friends have we have

1285
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,679
great experiences we still eat great

1286
00:49:29,639 --> 00:49:34,960
food we don't drink nearly as much as we

1287
00:49:31,679 --> 00:49:36,399
used to so we remember stuff more yeah

1288
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,240
we don't do as much stupid [ __ ] as we

1289
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:42,880
used to I feel like that's always good

1290
00:49:39,239 --> 00:49:46,118
but all that stupid drinking [ __ ] crazy

1291
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:48,440
left right up down yeah all that's what

1292
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:49,680
creates the memories that you know well

1293
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:51,318
it was great when we were younger to do

1294
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:52,960
that kind of stuff and you know it's

1295
00:49:51,318 --> 00:49:54,558
like I think you're right that it does

1296
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:57,400
create the memories we had some really

1297
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:59,440
good times you know 100% now it's just

1298
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:01,240
you know it's I talked to to Paulie

1299
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:05,559
about it and and a couple other guys

1300
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:07,879
about like how just that that October

1301
00:50:05,559 --> 00:50:10,920
November uh I guess what did the kids

1302
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:13,559
say now the vibe that was in the air in

1303
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:16,200
California back in the day it was like

1304
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:17,559
just that energy yeah it was it was

1305
00:50:16,199 --> 00:50:19,838
something that you looked forward to

1306
00:50:17,559 --> 00:50:21,559
every year it's like it was great and

1307
00:50:19,838 --> 00:50:24,039
then now it's kind of like October

1308
00:50:21,559 --> 00:50:26,000
November's here but that energy is not

1309
00:50:24,039 --> 00:50:27,239
the same we're also not the same as we

1310
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,119
were when we were younger we don't have

1311
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:31,919
the energy you know we got gray hair now

1312
00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:34,240
my gray hair I don't grow a beard out

1313
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:36,240
because I talk me in at 10 p.m. dude you

1314
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:37,719
know what I mean like I'm tired so I

1315
00:50:36,239 --> 00:50:39,318
like my sleep now and I used to think it

1316
00:50:37,719 --> 00:50:41,519
was great to not get sleep I thought you

1317
00:50:39,318 --> 00:50:43,798
know I was tough for for being able to

1318
00:50:41,519 --> 00:50:45,559
suck it up and get a five hour night of

1319
00:50:43,798 --> 00:50:47,719
sleep and then back at it in the morning

1320
00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:49,920
yeah back at it and just work through

1321
00:50:47,719 --> 00:50:51,558
you know power through the day and you

1322
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,680
know and there is some value to that

1323
00:50:51,559 --> 00:50:55,319
when the time is right and you need to

1324
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:58,000
do that but I think we need a value

1325
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:59,358
sleep and rest and exercise and those

1326
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,679
things are super important there's

1327
00:50:59,358 --> 00:51:03,880
they're just as important as making

1328
00:51:01,679 --> 00:51:05,759
money and success I feel like it is

1329
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:09,519
health is wealth so I feel like there is

1330
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:11,760
that level of success where you can be

1331
00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:13,960
uh exercising you can afford to eat

1332
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:17,799
right and all those things I mean that's

1333
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:19,798
success in my opinion too yeah and um

1334
00:51:17,798 --> 00:51:23,280
just back to uh this thing for a second

1335
00:51:19,798 --> 00:51:26,000
so what we were thinking about doing to

1336
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:30,240
kind of bring this to Market not

1337
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:33,159
necessarily is just our brand yeah so it

1338
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:36,199
makes a collaboration we thinking about

1339
00:51:33,159 --> 00:51:38,519
a lot of collaborations genetics guys

1340
00:51:36,199 --> 00:51:41,838
right guys that specifically focus on

1341
00:51:38,519 --> 00:51:43,679
genetics okay cool throw this out throw

1343
00:51:43,679 --> 00:51:50,480
you simple right then you've got other

1344
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:52,240
extractors yeah if they're using our sop

1345
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,639
Etc you partner with that you partner

1346
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:58,039
with guys that are like-minded

1347
00:51:54,639 --> 00:52:00,719
individuals that look at this as a value

1348
00:51:58,039 --> 00:52:02,798
ad to their

1349
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:05,239
portfolio and you bring it to Market I

1350
00:52:02,798 --> 00:52:07,519
remember meeting uh I was in I was in

1351
00:52:05,239 --> 00:52:12,399
Barcelona and you know one guy that I

1352
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:16,280
think uh is like definitely a Bay Area

1353
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:18,599
uh Oldtimer like us is p and Shan Pell

1354
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:20,359
transplant yeah yeah but for sure P's

1355
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:22,480
like San Francisco now but he was

1356
00:52:20,358 --> 00:52:24,519
originally San Francisco he's done

1357
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:26,159
Europe he's done Mexico yeah he's the

1358
00:52:24,519 --> 00:52:28,159
man so it's like me and him started

1359
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:29,759
talking and and I had never spoken to

1360
00:52:28,159 --> 00:52:31,798
him before but it was comfortable

1361
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:34,200
talking to a guy that had lived that

1362
00:52:31,798 --> 00:52:37,199
same eras that we lived and he he'd been

1363
00:52:34,199 --> 00:52:40,519
out here so it's like you know the The

1364
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:43,759
Nostalgia was the same and I brought it

1365
00:52:40,519 --> 00:52:45,599
to him and once it was done and I was

1366
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,119
you know a little skeptical about what

1367
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:49,318
he was going to say because I know that

1368
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:51,079
he's he's got a pretty high filter yeah

1369
00:52:49,318 --> 00:52:54,039
and he tried it out and was just like

1370
00:52:51,079 --> 00:52:55,680
whoa so let me try it out speaking of

1371
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:57,920
which huh you want to try it out fire it

1372
00:52:55,679 --> 00:53:01,879
out let's go load tpine first or no high

1373
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:05,079
turpine first low thca okay and then

1374
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:06,400
we'll we'll slowly uh get it stronger I

1375
00:53:05,079 --> 00:53:09,680
want to taste the turps though I want to

1376
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:12,639
see what straight turps basically or low

1377
00:53:09,679 --> 00:53:13,960
uh low canabo high turps taste like that

1378
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:15,358
was the holy water back in the day that

1379
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:18,639
we used to get

1380
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:20,798
was uh super super high

1381
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:23,759
turps I've been smelling it a little bit

1382
00:53:20,798 --> 00:53:26,519
too and I'm like smells good all right

1383
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:29,319
so part of the tech that we have the

1384
00:53:26,519 --> 00:53:31,719
brain cools the coil down yeah and

1385
00:53:29,318 --> 00:53:35,558
forces the user to wait and locks them

1386
00:53:31,719 --> 00:53:38,239
out so you're not overcooking everything

1387
00:53:35,559 --> 00:53:40,640
and now you just hold this button down

1388
00:53:38,239 --> 00:53:43,159
yeah hold on so you're not destroying

1389
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:43,159
volatile

1390
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:53,118
compound and

1391
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:55,159
so what are we smoking what flavor is

1392
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:56,440
that blue dream that's a blue dream

1393
00:53:55,159 --> 00:53:58,399
tastes like blue dream yeah it's frozen

1394
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:00,679
Frozen Turf Blue Dream Live resin or

1395
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:03,400
live excuse me Blue Dream fresh

1396
00:54:00,679 --> 00:54:05,279
frozen too hot so I just got to wait you

1397
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:08,200
just wait and then as that diamond fills

1398
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:10,240
up the coils cool down to a to a

1399
00:54:08,199 --> 00:54:11,798
temperature where and so what

1400
00:54:10,239 --> 00:54:14,479
concentration are we smoking right now

1401
00:54:11,798 --> 00:54:14,480
is this like about

1402
00:54:18,318 --> 00:54:25,000
50/50 EMP for you guys that's really

1403
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:28,358
good yeah that's really good I feel like

1404
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,358
uh the flavor is there

1405
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:32,838
good job on the Blue Dream you really

1406
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,960
captured the the essence of Blue Dream I

1407
00:54:32,838 --> 00:54:38,000
feel

1408
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:40,480
like I was looking at my frozan options

1409
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,838
um from one of my buddy's farms and I

1410
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,798
was like you know

1411
00:54:41,838 --> 00:54:47,119
what I'm going to go with trusty dream

1412
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:52,880
nice and like back to that whole T

1413
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:55,280
mixing thing there's a scenario in which

1414
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:57,039
you might do extractions where you're

1415
00:54:55,280 --> 00:55:00,240
getting the candy you're getting the

1416
00:54:57,039 --> 00:55:03,279
fruits you're getting you're getting the

1417
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:05,558
the orange the lemon the Cherry the

1418
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:07,798
grape but you want to you know you want

1419
00:55:05,559 --> 00:55:13,798
it to have a little bit of gas okay you

1420
00:55:07,798 --> 00:55:15,838
blow 10% of OG in there or sour or glue

1421
00:55:13,798 --> 00:55:16,759
yeah and now you have a gasier version

1422
00:55:15,838 --> 00:55:21,318
of that

1423
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:24,400
turp nice so that's that's the beauty in

1424
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:26,000
that cocktail turp sort of thing yeah I

1425
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,960
mean I like the wine maker model where

1426
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,400
you can add a little bit of gas to it

1427
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:31,440
you could add a little bit of candy to

1428
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:32,960
it you can change it and if you like

1429
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,639
then you can get real creative like the

1430
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,480
wine maker would for their brand you

1431
00:55:34,639 --> 00:55:38,598
know it's like I see that happening with

1432
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:40,920
rosin a little bit and I think that it's

1433
00:55:38,599 --> 00:55:43,760
only going to get bigger and bigger the

1434
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:46,280
the cocktail the blending of the stuff

1435
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:48,599
uh but also blending of cannabinoids and

1436
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:51,519
you could totally blend isolates too

1437
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:56,798
yeah 100% And like you could in theory

1438
00:55:51,519 --> 00:55:58,599
throw CBD CBG diamonds in there and CB

1439
00:55:56,798 --> 00:56:00,679
question mark diamonds in there whatever

1440
00:55:58,599 --> 00:56:03,079
you wanted to to do from an isolation

1441
00:56:00,679 --> 00:56:05,519
standpoint right and can Turin so you

1442
00:56:03,079 --> 00:56:07,079
see like what was that one company they

1443
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:09,000
used to do a lot of those formul Papas

1444
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:10,760
and Barkley or something like that so

1445
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:14,079
it's like you can kind of do that same

1446
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:17,599
formulation with this if you wanted to

1447
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:21,160
have a CBD to THC sort of because the

1448
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:25,240
the tpine always is roughly around 45 to

1449
00:56:21,159 --> 00:56:28,279
50% thca in it because once you

1450
00:56:25,239 --> 00:56:30,358
start moving more of that thca and

1451
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:32,920
getting higher concentration of Tarpin

1452
00:56:30,358 --> 00:56:35,798
it's a little too floral it's a little

1453
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:36,760
too much can you do that with the pen

1454
00:56:35,798 --> 00:56:40,719
what do you mean like so let's say I

1455
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:43,520
want to do 10% thca and 100%

1456
00:56:40,719 --> 00:56:45,598
tpin or 90% tpin because I guess it

1457
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:48,119
would be a blend right so we're looking

1458
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:49,400
at that ratio if I wanted to do super

1459
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:51,920
low to where it doesn't get you high but

1460
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:54,680
I wanted that floral crazy Co covers

1461
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:57,680
your mouth with turps or does it not t

1462
00:56:54,679 --> 00:57:00,159
it doesn't hit right if you add

1463
00:56:57,679 --> 00:57:02,558
10% that's a little low I don't think

1464
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:05,199
you're going to make it to a to a a

1465
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:06,920
ratio of that even at its lowest but

1466
00:57:05,199 --> 00:57:10,480
you're just smoking turps or you you

1467
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:12,838
won't even hit at 10% I don't know how

1468
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:15,119
to override the system to even get that

1469
00:57:12,838 --> 00:57:17,480
low I don't I don't there's not like a

1470
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:19,480
the UI is the UI so it's like you can't

1471
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:21,280
lower it past the point of a failure

1472
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:23,920
point oh okay so basically there's a

1473
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:27,160
window of of Watts you're throwing at

1474
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:28,519
each side and that's the difference in

1475
00:57:27,159 --> 00:57:29,960
the intensity you're not changing

1476
00:57:28,519 --> 00:57:31,838
temperatures right you're not you're

1477
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:34,400
only changing power so can you smoke

1478
00:57:31,838 --> 00:57:36,639
just pure thca out of that with no

1479
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,720
turps or is that like let's say you

1480
00:57:36,639 --> 00:57:38,598
didn't want to smell you're going to

1481
00:57:37,719 --> 00:57:40,358
work you don't want to smell like

1482
00:57:38,599 --> 00:57:42,240
anything you definitely don't if you're

1483
00:57:40,358 --> 00:57:44,318
smoking pure thca you're a [ __ ]

1484
00:57:42,239 --> 00:57:45,959
Soldier cuz that ain't going to T this

1485
00:57:44,318 --> 00:57:48,159
is going to be rough dude it should be

1486
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:50,318
really harsh going be rough dude like

1487
00:57:48,159 --> 00:57:52,639
you know you you drink your [ __ ]

1488
00:57:50,318 --> 00:57:54,400
whiskey warm and in a [ __ ] porta

1489
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:56,199
potty you know I mean like you're a

1490
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:58,200
tough dude sign this guy up but

1491
00:57:56,199 --> 00:58:00,519
unfiltered cigarettes

1492
00:57:58,199 --> 00:58:02,639
yeah remember the camel ones the no

1493
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:05,679
filter camel like those guys those guys

1494
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:07,639
were the Renegades yeah but yeah I mean

1495
00:58:05,679 --> 00:58:09,118
we'll see how it goes you know maybe the

1496
00:58:07,639 --> 00:58:11,920
hopefully the industry will accept it

1497
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:13,920
and adapt to it and I mean I think it's

1498
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,639
a great direction to go in if nothing

1499
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:17,159
else it's a great Direction and it's

1500
00:58:15,639 --> 00:58:19,279
it's Innovative I think that the

1501
00:58:17,159 --> 00:58:20,639
potential is cool and you know so you

1502
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:23,000
said something that kind of resonated

1503
00:58:20,639 --> 00:58:26,159
with me a little bit was like so do you

1504
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:27,559
want to have 13 pens just sitting in

1505
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:30,078
home and it's like yeah if you look in

1506
00:58:27,559 --> 00:58:32,640
my I have a pen holder for my pens I

1507
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:34,280
probably have 13 or 14 pens in there

1508
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:36,078
with all different flavors and I don't

1509
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:38,640
smoke them all and a lot of them are

1510
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:41,079
Rosen carts so Rosen carts have a shelf

1511
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:44,239
life I'm probably not smoking them all

1512
00:58:41,079 --> 00:58:46,798
before they aren't at their peak level

1513
00:58:44,239 --> 00:58:49,838
yeah and so this would be an interesting

1514
00:58:46,798 --> 00:58:52,280
thing uh I mean I see it as something

1515
00:58:49,838 --> 00:58:57,119
that has a lot of value potentially and

1516
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:58,680
I love Innovation my man so yeah so uh

1517
00:58:57,119 --> 00:58:59,838
as far as Portugal let's talk a little

1518
00:58:58,679 --> 00:59:01,279
bit about Portugal we've kind of been

1519
00:58:59,838 --> 00:59:03,519
talking about Portugal ever since you

1520
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:06,079
were first starting to get your license

1521
00:59:03,519 --> 00:59:08,920
over there how is the scene over in

1522
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:13,359
Portugal Portugal is pretty quiet you

1523
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:15,760
know it it's just desirable because of

1524
00:59:13,358 --> 00:59:19,119
where it's at on the a map yeah and the

1525
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:22,359
cost to operate very cheap there in

1526
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:25,160
comparison to here was good soil good

1527
00:59:22,358 --> 00:59:27,038
water good summers in the South Long

1528
00:59:25,159 --> 00:59:31,639
Summers in the south South yeah good

1529
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:34,839
surfing good surfing um you can kind of

1530
00:59:31,639 --> 00:59:37,879
grow 11 weers there comfortably in the

1531
00:59:34,838 --> 00:59:40,279
South yeah they'll finish out wow that's

1532
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:42,240
awesome yeah I mean with climate change

1533
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:44,798
or whatever the [ __ ] is happening in

1534
00:59:42,239 --> 00:59:46,239
this world like that's starting to to

1535
00:59:44,798 --> 00:59:48,280
maybe change a little bit like some

1536
00:59:46,239 --> 00:59:50,199
years there it didn't rain at all so was

1537
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:53,200
like come November it's normally like

1538
00:59:50,199 --> 00:59:55,759
end of November it should be fairly

1539
00:59:53,199 --> 00:59:57,798
rainy yeah it wasn't raining and this

1540
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:59,480
year rained a little bit earlier than

1541
00:59:57,798 --> 01:00:01,119
you'd expect so I'm watching I'm like

1542
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:03,679
what the [ __ ] they allow for the

1543
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:05,640
medicinal cultivation for the EU right

1544
01:00:03,679 --> 01:00:07,919
and so they're a big Hub too for other

1545
01:00:05,639 --> 01:00:10,598
countries importing I've heard yeah I

1546
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:13,720
mean Germany does a lot of damage if you

1547
01:00:10,599 --> 01:00:15,440
look at you know the numbers Germany

1548
01:00:13,719 --> 01:00:18,639
does a lot of medicinal importing and

1549
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:21,119
then now with the social club scenario

1550
01:00:18,639 --> 01:00:24,239
and the the barrier to entry in Europe

1551
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:26,240
being GMP facilities and all the rules

1552
01:00:24,239 --> 01:00:29,879
that go on with flower and stability

1553
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:32,439
testing and yeah it's set up from a

1554
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:36,000
pharmaceutical standpoint as a

1555
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:38,880
filtration point to keep a specific

1556
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:41,318
Financial class out of it yeah and if

1557
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:42,680
you look at it a lot of it seems asinine

1558
01:00:41,318 --> 01:00:45,719
and like why would you [ __ ] need to

1559
01:00:42,679 --> 01:00:48,279
do this and it's like why are they doing

1560
01:00:45,719 --> 01:00:51,719
this because this 100 lighter is going

1561
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:53,319
to cost you $4 million yeah you know so

1562
01:00:51,719 --> 01:00:55,719
let's make this a little bit more

1563
01:00:53,318 --> 01:00:58,279
difficult of a club to get into and they

1564
01:00:55,719 --> 01:01:00,719
did it but now seeing Germany go the way

1565
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:05,319
it's going I mean we both know where

1566
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:07,558
Spain's at you know yeah I get sometimes

1567
01:01:05,318 --> 01:01:10,159
when like people see what's going on in

1568
01:01:07,559 --> 01:01:12,200
some of the wck weed States and they're

1569
01:01:10,159 --> 01:01:13,759
like what every block here smells like

1570
01:01:12,199 --> 01:01:16,199
weed now everyone's just [ __ ]

1571
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:19,440
flooding the city smoking yeah and I

1572
01:01:16,199 --> 01:01:21,000
could see like that in Europe would

1573
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:23,639
probably get push back the Europe

1574
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,599
government well look at Spain in 2014 it

1575
01:01:23,639 --> 01:01:27,480
was kind of wide open you rolling joints

1576
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:29,640
in front [ __ ] restaurants and now you

1577
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:30,960
do not do that stuff in Barcelona you

1578
01:01:29,639 --> 01:01:32,838
know and it's it's changed so much

1579
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:34,599
because I remember rolling my joint up

1580
01:01:32,838 --> 01:01:37,440
that I was going to smoke after dinner

1581
01:01:34,599 --> 01:01:38,838
at the dinner table at a restaurant and

1582
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:40,599
you know I think people got kind of sick

1583
01:01:38,838 --> 01:01:42,159
of it to a degree and the government

1584
01:01:40,599 --> 01:01:44,000
definitely pushed back and was like no

1585
01:01:42,159 --> 01:01:46,239
this ain't gonna happen here guys yeah

1586
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:49,280
especially you Americans 100% I think

1587
01:01:46,239 --> 01:01:51,639
Europe has legs yeah I think Europe is

1588
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:56,119
definitely a place where the industry

1589
01:01:51,639 --> 01:01:58,920
will will eventually expand to um from a

1590
01:01:56,119 --> 01:02:02,278
Rec standpoint yeah not necessarily the

1591
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:04,200
gray area social club stuff yeah but

1592
01:02:02,278 --> 01:02:09,278
again it's

1593
01:02:04,199 --> 01:02:11,759
like everybody is looking for the new

1594
01:02:09,278 --> 01:02:14,039
America and I think after living there

1595
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:16,119
for so long and you and I both know it's

1596
01:02:14,039 --> 01:02:17,599
like they just don't consume cannabis

1597
01:02:16,119 --> 01:02:21,278
the way Americans

1598
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:23,559
do no they consume hash Bingo but it's

1599
01:02:21,278 --> 01:02:24,880
from a concentrated form right right and

1600
01:02:23,559 --> 01:02:26,480
they still want American genetics they

1601
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:28,960
still want a lot of the

1602
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:30,639
American principles when it comes to

1603
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:32,679
weed they want the West Coast genetics

1604
01:02:30,639 --> 01:02:34,358
and the West Coast what the Cali weed

1605
01:02:32,679 --> 01:02:37,558
right or whatever the Cali weed the Cali

1606
01:02:34,358 --> 01:02:39,159
genetics all that stuff but they smoke a

1607
01:02:37,559 --> 01:02:41,240
lot more hash than anything there's

1608
01:02:39,159 --> 01:02:42,118
thaton of super market for sure all

1609
01:02:41,239 --> 01:02:43,879
around the world there's this

1610
01:02:42,119 --> 01:02:45,000
connoisseur Market that wants that West

1611
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:48,358
Coast

1612
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:51,599
style product but a lot of Europeans

1613
01:02:48,358 --> 01:02:53,358
still smoke hash 100% And just I think

1614
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:58,318
from a volume play if you're just

1615
01:02:53,358 --> 01:03:01,278
looking at just gross volume in flour to

1616
01:02:58,318 --> 01:03:03,960
consumption levels per person spread

1617
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:07,199
across the EU and you compared it to

1618
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:09,000
America it'd be a scary number because

1619
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:12,679
there's guys out there that smoke five

1620
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:15,719
four gram blunts a day you know

1621
01:03:12,679 --> 01:03:19,318
and it's do I think it's overc

1622
01:03:15,719 --> 01:03:22,318
consumed um when you see the popular

1623
01:03:19,318 --> 01:03:25,079
aspect being the the cannaboid content

1624
01:03:22,318 --> 01:03:28,639
the potency yeah as being as what makes

1625
01:03:25,079 --> 01:03:31,119
all these people hype this shit's 34% T

1626
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:33,159
yeah we're going to get [ __ ] high

1627
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:35,640
most New Yorkers I

1628
01:03:33,159 --> 01:03:38,159
know they don't want it if it doesn't

1629
01:03:35,639 --> 01:03:40,920
get them [ __ ] Stone stoned that's why

1630
01:03:38,159 --> 01:03:42,759
Sour Diesel was popular that's why the

1631
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:44,400
first time my friend from New York had

1632
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:47,359
glue he called me and he was like this

1633
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:49,119
is it this is it and when I smoke glue I

1634
01:03:47,358 --> 01:03:51,838
was like this shit's too Stony like I

1635
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:54,240
can't operate my day under this [ __ ]

1636
01:03:51,838 --> 01:03:58,199
strain it ain't going to happen but he's

1637
01:03:54,239 --> 01:04:00,679
like n this is the one he man we're this

1638
01:03:58,199 --> 01:04:03,078
is what they want so I was surprised the

1639
01:04:00,679 --> 01:04:05,000
piff got so popular out there be because

1640
01:04:03,079 --> 01:04:07,640
it's not as strong as some of the other

1641
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:10,358
things piff is cool though I like piff I

1642
01:04:07,639 --> 01:04:13,000
love piff yeah I love piff and I I like

1643
01:04:10,358 --> 01:04:15,278
I like the hazes because they're rare

1644
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,880
now and there's some guys trying to you

1645
01:04:15,278 --> 01:04:19,199
know bring them back and I I've seen

1646
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:22,119
some stuff but it's like you know

1647
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:24,358
everything's been thrown to the Wolves

1648
01:04:22,119 --> 01:04:26,400
it's hard to get some of the old strains

1649
01:04:24,358 --> 01:04:28,679
that that we grew up on and stuff that

1650
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:30,240
really moved the needle for us like

1651
01:04:28,679 --> 01:04:31,558
let's talk about those for a minute I'm

1652
01:04:30,239 --> 01:04:33,239
sure people are excited to hear about

1653
01:04:31,559 --> 01:04:35,278
the old genetics that we used to have

1654
01:04:33,239 --> 01:04:37,838
around uh and some of them didn't even

1655
01:04:35,278 --> 01:04:39,559
have names I mean you go far back enough

1656
01:04:37,838 --> 01:04:42,119
it wasn't all

1657
01:04:39,559 --> 01:04:43,880
about the specific genetics it was all

1658
01:04:42,119 --> 01:04:45,119
about you know it was green butter it

1659
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:47,119
was you know especially if you're were

1660
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:50,358
buying stuff it was like oh you want

1661
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:52,358
this [ __ ] it it was top shelf or

1662
01:04:50,358 --> 01:04:54,719
brown butt a lot of times and it was

1663
01:04:52,358 --> 01:04:58,038
never called top shelf really it was it

1664
01:04:54,719 --> 01:05:01,078
was uh we had all kinds of names [ __ ] y

1665
01:04:58,039 --> 01:05:02,559
[ __ ] oh God the [ __ ] yeah the crippler

1666
01:05:01,079 --> 01:05:04,680
we had the [ __ ] the crippler there was

1667
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:06,680
always funny names for stuff but also I

1668
01:05:04,679 --> 01:05:08,159
mean there was some strain names but

1669
01:05:06,679 --> 01:05:08,838
like it wasn't always associated with

1670
01:05:08,159 --> 01:05:11,679
the

1671
01:05:08,838 --> 01:05:13,400
genetics first time I saw [ __ ] my buddy

1672
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:15,038
came back from Florida and he was

1673
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:16,760
visiting his sister and she was in

1674
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:20,520
college there and he came back with 2

1675
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:23,240
ounces yeah we were taking the nugs and

1676
01:05:20,519 --> 01:05:26,880
we threw it at the wall and it just

1677
01:05:23,239 --> 01:05:29,399
stuck so sticky and we were like oh God

1678
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:32,240
and then my first introduction into

1679
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:34,639
California you know the I never ever

1680
01:05:32,239 --> 01:05:36,719
ended up with anything from Canada at

1681
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:39,440
that though during those years yeah that

1682
01:05:36,719 --> 01:05:40,318
like I even have a a memory of right so

1683
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:42,920
it's

1684
01:05:40,318 --> 01:05:47,199
like my graduation to Northern

1685
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:51,798
California in 2000ish like I have a

1686
01:05:47,199 --> 01:05:56,038
broad memory mhm of coming here and

1687
01:05:51,798 --> 01:05:59,719
like whoa yeah the Honeydew hay the

1688
01:05:56,039 --> 01:06:03,599
Madusa Mist lavender pers granddaddy

1689
01:05:59,719 --> 01:06:07,598
yeah the real Cali Mist I real

1690
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:09,960
C I really missed that one yeah you know

1691
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:11,318
it was bright it was like a cute it made

1692
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:12,798
me it feel like drinking one of these

1693
01:06:11,318 --> 01:06:14,679
[ __ ] cucumber drinks in the

1694
01:06:12,798 --> 01:06:16,119
summertime on a boat was like smoking

1695
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:18,919
the Mist

1696
01:06:16,119 --> 01:06:20,838
nice it's all gone now so I I'm just

1697
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:22,358
glad still there we just don't see it as

1698
01:06:20,838 --> 01:06:25,798
often and I think there's no one growing

1699
01:06:22,358 --> 01:06:27,798
it in bulk that I know of I know seeds

1700
01:06:25,798 --> 01:06:30,798
are still available Simon still sells C

1701
01:06:27,798 --> 01:06:32,318
Miss seeds okay and so I know it's still

1702
01:06:30,798 --> 01:06:34,920
available I don't see a lot of people

1703
01:06:32,318 --> 01:06:36,599
growing it and maybe the appeal isn't

1704
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:38,318
maybe people don't understand the appeal

1705
01:06:36,599 --> 01:06:40,359
until they try it and maybe it needs to

1706
01:06:38,318 --> 01:06:42,639
make its rounds again you know you know

1707
01:06:40,358 --> 01:06:45,400
the original cat piss that was weird

1708
01:06:42,639 --> 01:06:47,118
that was the one that was the one there

1709
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:49,200
was nothing better than cat piss in its

1710
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:51,400
day it's like whatever you think the

1711
01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:54,318
best thing is now cat piss was that and

1712
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:55,920
then some yeah and it was just so much

1713
01:06:54,318 --> 01:06:59,199
different than everything else that was

1714
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:01,480
around and one little small piece would

1715
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:03,960
make your whole car your

1716
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:06,358
clothes your whole room would smell like

1717
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:07,519
it and the smoke was distinct catpiss

1718
01:07:06,358 --> 01:07:09,159
smell you could smell it you be like

1719
01:07:07,519 --> 01:07:11,880
[ __ ] they're smoking cat

1720
01:07:09,159 --> 01:07:13,558
piss um yeah that was that was the best

1721
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:15,559
I mean that was really the Exotic of its

1722
01:07:13,559 --> 01:07:17,839
day and it was 60 bucks an a straight up

1723
01:07:15,559 --> 01:07:20,798
didn't matter how many you bought it was

1724
01:07:17,838 --> 01:07:23,838
top top top yeah price

1725
01:07:20,798 --> 01:07:26,079
and AF was good yeah you know super

1726
01:07:23,838 --> 01:07:29,358
silver goo we had the afo

1727
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:33,640
yeah AF guy that was a good one uh the

1728
01:07:29,358 --> 01:07:36,159
aota was all of the above that aota

1729
01:07:33,639 --> 01:07:39,318
coming down was aota had hella red hair

1730
01:07:36,159 --> 01:07:42,399
right I think the aota that I smoke

1731
01:07:39,318 --> 01:07:45,318
didn't have it was it was bright and

1732
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:48,838
green and and super it was pretty Frosty

1733
01:07:45,318 --> 01:07:52,278
not as Frosty as like the AFU I remember

1734
01:07:48,838 --> 01:07:56,480
seeing a jar of aota that was just

1735
01:07:52,278 --> 01:07:59,880
like insane red hair nice again that was

1736
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:02,278
a that was a drunken night in Humble

1737
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:05,240
those years were like semi a blur you

1738
01:08:02,278 --> 01:08:07,358
know but yeah there was the Hassan that

1739
01:08:05,239 --> 01:08:09,239
was like uh yeah there was the Hassan

1740
01:08:07,358 --> 01:08:11,639
that was a good one from my boy Josh

1741
01:08:09,239 --> 01:08:13,199
Freeman pink cream Jasmine soda was

1742
01:08:11,639 --> 01:08:15,759
another one I if you remember that not a

1743
01:08:13,199 --> 01:08:17,639
lot of people do I got that cut from

1744
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:19,640
Josh and that was like the it was the

1745
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:21,719
early finisher of its day it never got

1746
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:24,719
to be big tall plants but it finished

1747
01:08:21,719 --> 01:08:26,719
early and in the Bay Area you wanted

1748
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:29,520
something Lally along with all the other

1749
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:31,560
stuff you grew because of all the damage

1750
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:33,279
that you would get from caterpillars

1751
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:34,600
yeah and it never got caterpillars on it

1752
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:36,520
it was one of those was like resistant

1753
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:38,279
to caterpillars I wonder if the turps

1754
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:39,839
just kept them off of it I think it

1755
01:08:38,279 --> 01:08:42,199
finished so early the caterpillars just

1756
01:08:39,838 --> 01:08:46,278
didn't have time to do any damage ah

1757
01:08:42,198 --> 01:08:48,719
gotcha the season yeah yeah you know

1758
01:08:46,279 --> 01:08:51,719
those are the days when you know

1759
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:53,880
hopefully the stuff that's coming up for

1760
01:08:51,719 --> 01:08:55,880
the future is as

1761
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:58,279
remarkable it has the potential there's

1762
01:08:55,880 --> 01:09:00,679
still dude humble is filled with

1763
01:08:58,279 --> 01:09:02,400
passionate people still yeah that will

1764
01:09:00,679 --> 01:09:04,960
just grow weed for themselves if nothing

1765
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:07,119
else still right that they don't care I

1766
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:09,359
mean obviously care about money but they

1767
01:09:07,119 --> 01:09:10,838
care more about the flour and the weed

1768
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:12,279
and yeah there's companies doing it too

1769
01:09:10,838 --> 01:09:14,318
I feel like there's some good companies

1770
01:09:12,279 --> 01:09:16,400
doing it up there that are pushing the

1771
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:18,000
limits you know it's like we got

1772
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:20,639
Ridgeline Farms we got Johnny from

1773
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:23,319
Huckleberry Hill yeah uh you know Jason

1774
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:24,480
and Johnny those guys are a pair they

1775
01:09:23,319 --> 01:09:25,839
but they do some good stuff some of

1776
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:28,119
their breeding stuff is good that white

1777
01:09:25,838 --> 01:09:30,238
Thorn Rose Johnny kind of got on the map

1778
01:09:28,119 --> 01:09:31,599
for that but I feel like that's just

1779
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:32,798
that's just the beginning of all the

1780
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:36,039
stuff that he can really bring to the

1781
01:09:32,798 --> 01:09:37,600
table yeah yeah and then Ridgeline has

1782
01:09:36,039 --> 01:09:40,439
the Lance or something like that the

1783
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:42,400
Lance yeah that's a good one Ridgeline

1784
01:09:40,439 --> 01:09:43,960
runs Jason's doing some good stuff and

1785
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:46,559
he's just a good person I they were on

1786
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:49,600
the show yeah they're they're good guys

1787
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:51,359
and you know it's like uh they're

1788
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:52,920
devoted to the plant too we talk about

1789
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:55,760
devotion those guys are devoted to the

1790
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:58,039
plant there's a Dave from budalo he's up

1791
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:00,199
in Menin up in Yukaya he's the sour

1792
01:09:58,039 --> 01:10:02,319
diesel guy now I found the new Sour

1793
01:10:00,198 --> 01:10:05,439
Diesel guy he is the sour diesel guy but

1794
01:10:02,319 --> 01:10:08,119
he's also the long flowering variety guy

1795
01:10:05,439 --> 01:10:10,799
so he does those long flowering ones

1796
01:10:08,119 --> 01:10:12,599
that just have amazing effect right he

1797
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:15,520
breeds specifically for effect they're

1798
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:16,880
growing specifically for effect uh and

1799
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:18,880
there's so many other guys that I'm not

1800
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,880
even naming right now but there's guys

1801
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:23,560
that are still just so passionate and

1802
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:25,119
still trying to move the needle trying

1803
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:27,120
to bring back genetics trying to create

1804
01:10:25,119 --> 01:10:28,880
new new genetics you know and we need

1805
01:10:27,119 --> 01:10:31,640
all that the industry needs all that we

1806
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:33,840
need all that passion infused into the

1807
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:35,320
genetics uh and you know I think the

1808
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:36,880
future is bright in a lot of ways I

1809
01:10:35,319 --> 01:10:38,319
think a lot of people look down on the

1810
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:40,119
future they're worried about the future

1811
01:10:38,319 --> 01:10:41,679
but I think in a lot of ways the

1812
01:10:40,119 --> 01:10:43,640
future's still bright we still have a

1813
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:46,199
lot of potential there's still plenty to

1814
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:49,600
be uh innovated you know there's a lot

1815
01:10:46,198 --> 01:10:51,198
of innovation still uh that can can be

1816
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:53,480
had in this industry whether it's lights

1817
01:10:51,198 --> 01:10:56,198
whether it's extract whether it's you

1818
01:10:53,479 --> 01:10:57,718
know genetics substrate it doesn't

1819
01:10:56,198 --> 01:11:00,399
matter there's so many things that still

1820
01:10:57,719 --> 01:11:02,039
need to be explored and I'm just excited

1821
01:11:00,399 --> 01:11:04,319
for the future you know constantly being

1822
01:11:02,039 --> 01:11:06,119
exciting constantly being Amazed by the

1823
01:11:04,319 --> 01:11:08,279
stuff people around me are doing it's

1824
01:11:06,119 --> 01:11:09,960
happy to be here yeah I mean and I'm

1825
01:11:08,279 --> 01:11:11,719
just exactly I'm just H I'm along for

1826
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:12,920
the ride in some ways I'm super happy

1827
01:11:11,719 --> 01:11:15,399
it's

1828
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:17,199
like with the breeding book it was like

1829
01:11:15,399 --> 01:11:18,759
this big Challenge and once I've

1830
01:11:17,198 --> 01:11:20,000
finished it it's like okay what's next

1831
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:22,440
for me what are we going to do next with

1832
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,800
the book so every couple years every you

1833
01:11:22,439 --> 01:11:24,919
know probably every few years we're

1834
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:27,440
going to do a new release on the

1835
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:29,039
breeding book and update the information

1836
01:11:27,439 --> 01:11:31,000
and the beauty of Technology we can put

1837
01:11:29,039 --> 01:11:33,880
the supplemental stuff in there uh

1838
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:36,119
online and then as we create this stuff

1839
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:38,800
online we can Infuse it into a new book

1840
01:11:36,119 --> 01:11:41,479
that's cool that's cool so just kind of

1841
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:43,400
keeping a Tim stamp and moving it

1842
01:11:41,479 --> 01:11:44,919
forward you know yeah and and constantly

1843
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:47,238
trying to move the needle forward with

1844
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:49,199
everything that we do so I mean this

1845
01:11:47,238 --> 01:11:52,039
facility we're we're trying to do the

1846
01:11:49,198 --> 01:11:54,759
best we can do and uh make a difference

1847
01:11:52,039 --> 01:11:57,319
and I'm out there working in St Vincent

1848
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:59,280
the gred with some farmers and with the

1849
01:11:57,319 --> 01:12:01,960
government the MCA out there the medical

1850
01:11:59,279 --> 01:12:03,599
cannabis Authority uh so I'm excited

1851
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:05,158
about the future I'm excited about other

1852
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:08,840
people's podcast too there's a lot of

1853
01:12:05,158 --> 01:12:11,198
good podcasts out there yeah um but yeah

1854
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:14,400
so if you had one piece of advice for

1855
01:12:11,198 --> 01:12:16,079
your younger self or how about we're

1856
01:12:14,399 --> 01:12:19,198
gonna switch this up today all right you

1857
01:12:16,079 --> 01:12:21,880
had one piece of advice for our group of

1858
01:12:19,198 --> 01:12:24,960
friends and their younger selves what

1859
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:27,159
would that one piece of advice be the

1860
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,158
big

1861
01:12:27,319 --> 01:12:33,158
fault I've seen from a lot of successful

1862
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:35,760
guys from our era they never save their

1863
01:12:33,158 --> 01:12:40,519
money because they felt that this would

1864
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:42,320
never go away yeah and it's painful the

1865
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:45,560
war stories when you get the phone calls

1866
01:12:42,319 --> 01:12:49,799
and stuff like it sucks because again

1867
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:51,840
their hearts in it but you saw

1868
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:57,400
in call

1869
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:59,279
it 10 years things from 14 to now yeah

1870
01:12:57,399 --> 01:13:00,638
when I was back on that Hill from that

1871
01:12:59,279 --> 01:13:04,920
Harvest to

1872
01:13:00,639 --> 01:13:06,960
now if you calculate the cost drop like

1873
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:10,039
you're saying like that's substantial

1874
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:12,760
it's almost not sustainable for a farmer

1875
01:13:10,039 --> 01:13:14,279
right so okay you're Frugal farmer

1876
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:17,000
you've been saving your

1877
01:13:14,279 --> 01:13:18,679
money you understood that there was you

1878
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,639
know a possibility of this happening

1879
01:13:18,679 --> 01:13:23,800
happening because of Agriculture you

1880
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:25,719
it's walking a path that has been walked

1881
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:27,600
before yeah

1882
01:13:25,719 --> 01:13:29,960
you can pivot you can do something else

1883
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:32,079
people build families and people have

1884
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:36,840
children yeah you know there there's

1885
01:13:32,079 --> 01:13:39,039
real human beings behind this so the

1886
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:40,600
stories are are painful to hear because

1887
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:42,119
they've been doing this for so long and

1888
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:44,679
we respect them and then now it's kind

1889
01:13:42,119 --> 01:13:47,800
of like I don't know what to do yeah and

1890
01:13:44,679 --> 01:13:49,719
my thing is like not going to change the

1891
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:52,199
devotion that people have because that's

1892
01:13:49,719 --> 01:13:55,880
always been there yeah but if you could

1893
01:13:52,198 --> 01:13:59,119
change the essentially the Financial

1894
01:13:55,880 --> 01:14:01,560
structure of how they spent and what

1895
01:13:59,119 --> 01:14:04,279
they save for because like if you knew

1896
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:07,400
if a little bird flew down and told you

1897
01:14:04,279 --> 01:14:09,359
hey 2024 this is going to be the ticket

1898
01:14:07,399 --> 01:14:11,479
for a

1899
01:14:09,359 --> 01:14:13,679
unit you approach it a little bit

1900
01:14:11,479 --> 01:14:15,959
differently but sometimes people just

1901
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:20,359
have Blind Faith in things and I get it

1902
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:22,520
like yeah it's a it's a trait know but

1903
01:14:20,359 --> 01:14:24,479
that would be it because you know I I

1904
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:27,080
still think the industry is in decent

1905
01:14:24,479 --> 01:14:28,359
hands you know I still think for sure

1906
01:14:27,079 --> 01:14:30,359
still think the industry is in decent

1907
01:14:28,359 --> 01:14:33,439
hands but it's like it would be in

1908
01:14:30,359 --> 01:14:37,839
more decent hands

1909
01:14:33,439 --> 01:14:39,399
if the finances were different yeah

1910
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:41,719
that's just my take on it because I

1911
01:14:39,399 --> 01:14:45,439
don't think that there was a whole lot

1912
01:14:41,719 --> 01:14:47,520
of fuckups in the you know where we're

1913
01:14:45,439 --> 01:14:50,359
at in flower now where we're at in Tech

1914
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:52,320
now and where we're at in the [ __ ]

1915
01:14:50,359 --> 01:14:54,000
pushed the plant forward if anything and

1916
01:14:52,319 --> 01:14:55,719
pushed us forward you know it's like I

1917
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:58,679
think we all [ __ ] up to a degree we

1918
01:14:55,719 --> 01:15:00,399
all had our fuckups and you know it's

1919
01:14:58,679 --> 01:15:02,480
like a lot of them were good learning

1920
01:15:00,399 --> 01:15:05,799
experiences for all of us you know it's

1921
01:15:02,479 --> 01:15:09,879
like we didn't lose too many

1922
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:11,719
friends from violence luckily yeah you

1923
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:13,400
know I think we we may have lost some

1924
01:15:11,719 --> 01:15:15,319
friends getting locked up and we may

1925
01:15:13,399 --> 01:15:16,719
have caught cases and stuff like that

1926
01:15:15,319 --> 01:15:18,920
but a lot of those were good learning

1927
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:21,840
experiences on what not to [ __ ] do

1928
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:24,399
yeah so yeah I think you know we're

1929
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:25,960
we're probably pretty blessed to have

1930
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:29,198
the friends we have and to have the

1931
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:30,639
experiences that we were blessed to have

1932
01:15:29,198 --> 01:15:33,839
um you know and that's made us who we

1933
01:15:30,639 --> 01:15:35,520
are I wouldn't take any of those

1934
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:37,119
experiences back the good ones the bad

1935
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:38,440
ones I mean unfortunately you know I

1936
01:15:37,119 --> 01:15:41,719
think they're all good learning

1937
01:15:38,439 --> 01:15:43,719
experiences if nothing else 100% wild

1938
01:15:41,719 --> 01:15:47,000
wild stories you know stories that I

1939
01:15:43,719 --> 01:15:48,679
can't even talk about on yeah camera but

1940
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:50,800
it's like they've made me who I am today

1941
01:15:48,679 --> 01:15:54,000
and made me appreciate what we have

1942
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:55,480
which is pretty special yeah 100% and

1943
01:15:54,000 --> 01:16:00,760
and

1944
01:15:55,479 --> 01:16:04,158
you know we kept doing it before yeah we

1945
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:07,560
got locked up and then we came back and

1946
01:16:04,158 --> 01:16:09,759
just did it legally yeah when we got out

1947
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:12,440
whether it was the medical the 215 days

1948
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:14,880
up until now so it's like when we were

1949
01:16:12,439 --> 01:16:16,519
back in this and it was like okay well

1950
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:19,119
we can be above ground

1951
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:23,199
now we don't really got to worry too

1952
01:16:19,119 --> 01:16:24,920
much about them so we we had friends

1953
01:16:23,198 --> 01:16:28,879
that got kicked out of the country for

1954
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:30,119
for uh yeah for for cases that you know

1955
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:32,079

1969
01:17:03,439 --> 01:17:07,799
kind of

1970
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:11,079
crazy but I think we're also starting to

1971
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:12,920
recognize to a degree that that cannabis

1972
01:17:11,079 --> 01:17:15,639
especially isn't bad cannabis isn't the

1973
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:18,399
enemy it makes the world a better place

1974
01:17:15,639 --> 01:17:21,560

1975
01:17:18,399 --> 01:17:25,279

1979
01:17:30,439 --> 01:17:36,519

1980
01:17:32,079 --> 01:17:41,158
www.ts T pz. comom

1981

1982
01:17:41,158 --> 01:17:44,839
turps

1983
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:46,639
tpz and I don't think we have a Twitter

1984
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:48,480
set up yet we're just like really at the

1985
01:17:46,639 --> 01:17:50,920
point of like we've got all these story

1986
01:17:48,479 --> 01:17:53,238
boards from an animator that I work with

1987
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:56,719
and it kind of explains all the aspects

1988
01:17:53,238 --> 01:17:58,799
of the cart there's a tutorial for it

1989
01:17:56,719 --> 01:18:01,600
you know when you um when you purchase

1990
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:04,840
it you'll scan a QR code and that will

1991
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:07,679
lead you to how to use it yeah so

1992
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:10,960
everything's kind of getting finalized

1993
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:12,679
and brought to life now taking meetings

1994
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:15,198
just figuring out distribution making

1995
01:18:12,679 --> 01:18:18,000
sure that you know the stakes are high

1996
01:18:15,198 --> 01:18:21,039
these days like yeah it costs a lot of

1997
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:23,079
money to come bring your your little toy

1998
01:18:21,039 --> 01:18:25,479
into the market you know so it's like

1999
01:18:23,079 --> 01:18:28,719
you got to you got to you got to do this

2000
01:18:25,479 --> 01:18:30,759
more calculated and less Cavalier nice

2001
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:33,000
so everything's getting buttoned up to a

2002
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:34,760
point that we're going to push forward

2003
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:38,279
correctly and make sure that there's no

2004
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:40,960
like loose ends or or open knots when we

2005
01:18:38,279 --> 01:18:42,479
do come to Market I would think could I

2006
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:46,198
push to come to Market within like the

2007
01:18:42,479 --> 01:18:47,879
next 90 to 120 days yeah and that could

2008
01:18:46,198 --> 01:18:50,399
still happen because obviously there's a

2009
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:52,039
lot of Frozen coming down now yeah

2010
01:18:50,399 --> 01:18:57,119
there's going to be a lot of Frozen and

2011
01:18:52,039 --> 01:19:00,119
freezers but I think our big hello how

2012
01:18:57,119 --> 01:19:01,479

2013
