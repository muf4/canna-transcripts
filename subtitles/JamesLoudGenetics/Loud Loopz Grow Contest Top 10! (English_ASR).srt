[Music]

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,639
how's it going everybody my name is

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,920
James loud and we are going to review

5
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:18,960
some of the entries that were turned in

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,060
for the contest these are the top 10.

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,778
we've eliminated eight out of the

8
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:26,640
entries and we have 10 to go on for the

9
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:29,219
next week I'm actually going to spend

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,800
time going with each one individually

11
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:33,659
smoking tasting comparing what I think

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,480
is the best against the other ones some

13
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:38,578
people entered five phenotypes some

14
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:40,679
people entered one phenotype and they

15
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,500
they hand selected and you know I'm

16
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:45,738
happy trying all of them I think there's

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,539
a good amount of phenotypical variation

18
00:00:45,738 --> 00:00:49,199
between all these entries

19
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:51,179
um

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,739
it's really interesting because we have

21
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:54,859
different densities so some of this

22
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:57,359
stuff is denser some of this stuff is

23
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:59,039
obviously uh Tighter and some of the

24
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:02,399
stuff is bigger we have some real chunky

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,439
nugs here uh like this one and I mean

26
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,379
some amazing Terps across the board we

27
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:10,140
got really really really good Terps uh

28
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:12,000
but yeah I mean just color if you if you

29
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,040
look at the color there's a wide amount

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,500
of color and I think that has a lot to

31
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,180
do with nutrition and environment as

32
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,579
well and some of this stuff is a little

33
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,380
premature uh at least the other entries

34
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:25,438
that were eliminated

35
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:28,679
a lot of them were on the premature side

36
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:31,618
uh but some of these are totally done

37
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,439
done and amazing I'm not disqualifying

38
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:36,599
people for seeds uh

39
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:38,339
so if the butt is seated as long as it

40
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:39,899
smokes and smells good I'm okay with it

41
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,978
at the end of the day the most important

42
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:47,759
thing for me is not structure is not

43
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:49,799
yield is not THC content but is flavor

44
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,680
and effect so we'll be doing a lot of

45
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,939
blind tasting with these entries and

46
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,140
we're going to go against each other I'm

47
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:57,359
going to be doing this I'm going to have

48
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,180
some friends I'm making some judges kits

49
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,319
that are going out so yeah these in in

50
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,360
no order

51
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:05,339
uh I can I can talk a little bit about

52
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:08,399
these so this was a little premature

53
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,800
actually this number one but I kept it

54
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,959
because of the Terps even though it has

55
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,300
a little hay smell to it the structure

56
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,780
is amazing and I'm sure it's gonna smoke

57
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:21,300
it it has a real underlying candy smell

58
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:24,120
to it which I really like some of these

59
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,400
came across real creamy

60
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:30,300
uh like this one right here

61
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,280
it has Heavy Gas and heavy cream we get

62
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:35,879
a lot of big buds like this in there

63
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:38,060
which is amazing uh medium density we

64
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:41,699
got a good amount of color

65
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:44,939
uh and we're talking about zerios times

66
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:48,899
zbx zerios is Shield milk times zerbert

67
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:51,120
and zbx is a skittles back cross and

68
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,860
like this right here this is nice and

69
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,259
dense

70
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,940
this is everything that everybody wants

71
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:59,039
it checks the boxes

72
00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:00,959
we'll smoke it and make sure it checks

73
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:04,199
those boxes as well but as far as from a

74
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,900
visual aspect I mean the the size of

75
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:09,780
these nugs these are fat the trimming

76
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,459
it's great I mean the Sugar Leaf

77
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,219
dude there's some leaves that are just

78
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:16,979
coated and caked now we got some of the

79
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:18,959
people that entered smaller buds

80
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:19,799
I don't mind smaller buds smaller buds

81
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,840
are okay

82
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,120
especially when they're frosted like

83
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,860
this stuff I mean this is like super

84
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,319
Frosty

85
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:31,379
and this has a freaking awesome candy

86
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:34,679
terp to it like I mean it's kind of

87
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:37,018
skiddly it's kind of lemon lime it kind

88
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,939
of you know goes in and kind of burns

89
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:41,158
your nostrils a little bit too

90
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:43,859
now this was one of the

91
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:45,658
softer buds on this number five right

92
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,299
here I really like this number five in

93
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:51,000
the it's frosty

94
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:53,219
but this leans towards the cereal milk a

95
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,580
lot of a lot more than some of the other

96
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:57,539
Expressions uh really nice though as far

97
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,299
as

98
00:03:57,539 --> 00:04:02,579
you get candy on the back end

99
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:04,860
it reminds me of Twizzlers

100
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:07,260
uh it definitely has a Twizzlers smell

101
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:09,120
to it you could tell it was soil grown I

102
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:12,359
would say this is living soil I don't

103
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,099
know firsthand who is what I'm doing all

104
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,319
this stuff blind

105
00:04:14,098 --> 00:04:19,858
um this fat Bud right here

106
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:21,779
it Knuckles out the calyx kind of Stack

107
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:25,159
and uh

108
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:25,159
it was trimmed really well

109
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:30,839
um as far as the smell

110
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,979
this one has like almost a candy

111
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:33,418
necklace I don't know if you guys

112
00:04:31,978 --> 00:04:35,399
remember the candy necklace it has like

113
00:04:33,418 --> 00:04:38,839
a Kenny necklace terp in there along

114
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:38,839
with some gas and some cream

115
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,500
something I would definitely enjoy

116
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,380
trying if if that comes across in the

117
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:49,019
smoke man that's a great

118
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:50,699
great flavor

119
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:51,959
we're announcing the winners next week

120
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:54,840
on the show

121
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:56,939
on the 15th ten thousand dollar grand

122
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:58,079
prize ten thousand dollars goes to

123
00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:02,540
charity

124
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:05,219
as well charity of your choice

125
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:08,939
really good stuff another definitely

126
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:12,060
like living soil cured out perfectly

127
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:15,800
uh this one right here has

128
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,800
a muskiness to it almost

129
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,720
an underlying candy Terps has like a

130
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:22,978
nice skiddly kind of finish to it that I

131
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,960
really like

132
00:05:22,978 --> 00:05:27,659
now this one is a sleeper I feel like

133
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:29,698
this entry right here number eight

134
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:33,660
is a little bit of a sleeper

135
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:35,639
it doesn't look like it's that good

136
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,620
it honestly looks mediocre compared to

137
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:39,900
the other ones but it has a really good

138
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,519
chirp it kind of reminds me of Skittles

139
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:43,978
as far as the structure

140
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:46,560
uh it doesn't have a lot of trichomes

141
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:48,478
this one is actually sticky but as far

142
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,160
as like it's not nearly as frosted up as

143
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:52,379
some of the other ones and a lot of

144
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,840
times when you're breeding with

145
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:57,478
something like Skittles the actual

146
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:59,819
terpene profile is associated with the

147
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:01,319
structure so if you're breathing stuff

148
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:05,219
together with Skittles you're gonna get

149
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:07,259
stuff that looks amazing if you breed it

150
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:09,479
with something like Oreos but if you

151
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:11,160
want the skiddly side of it you're gonna

152
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:13,680
have to deal with stuff that's not

153
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,500
necessary as Frosty that doesn't have as

154
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,000
nice of a structure sometimes to get the

155
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,519
terpene profile that you're looking for

156
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,519
we got number nine here

157
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:25,740
I mean rock hard

158
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:28,198
there's not a lot of Terps

159
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,538
this one kind of reminds me of Oreos but

160
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,978
the thing is is when you're Fino hunting

161
00:06:30,538 --> 00:06:33,959
and you're going through these different

162
00:06:31,978 --> 00:06:34,918
buds this is basically a final hunt

163
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:36,299
although I'm growing in different

164
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:38,639
environments normally you want a pheno

165
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,978
hunt in the same room so you give each

166
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,079
each different seed each one in the

167
00:06:40,978 --> 00:06:45,120
progeny its own chance each one of the

168
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:46,859
plants its own chance

169
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,418
um but we're doing a Fino hunt with

170
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:51,060
several different environments basically

171
00:06:48,418 --> 00:06:52,620
and it's not on an even playing field

172
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,819
because someone might get lucky with the

173
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,259
lottery

174
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:57,060
they're going to hit the lottery and

175
00:06:55,259 --> 00:07:00,860
they're going to get the winner and

176
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,860
they're going to have the Terps but

177
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:06,060
you just never know this is great

178
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:09,199
this number 10 beautiful structure every

179
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,199
I like everything about it

180
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,639
it kind of reminds me of old school

181
00:07:10,978 --> 00:07:16,740
Bubba Kush structure it's number 10

182
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:20,460
where uh the calyx swell up at the end

183
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:22,439
where they absorb almost all the

184
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:23,939
the uh

185
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:26,759
pistols

186
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:29,519
so they almost the little orange hairs

187
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:31,620
basically go away and so they get eaten

188
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:35,399
up OG is classic and Infamous for that

189
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:37,918
it definitely comes from that afghanika

190
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:40,198
side somewhere over there like like the

191
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:42,779
Hindu Kush that's a great example of

192
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,160
another one where as it swells you don't

193
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:46,258
see a lot of hair you see a lot more

194
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,479
trichome

195
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:49,439
and this one is freaking small little

196
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:50,939
bud

197
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,819
packs a punch

198
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:55,978
we get candy we get gas I'm getting that

199
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:57,660
almost like a Flintstone vitamin candy

200
00:07:55,978 --> 00:08:00,360
out of it

201
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,680
but really nice really approachable I

202
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,780
feel like this one will smell great in a

203
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,038
joint all these ones have a really good

204
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:06,659
