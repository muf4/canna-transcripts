cannabis in general you started I mean

22
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:48,679
obviously you're smoking when you're

23
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,238
younger yep smoking when I was a kid

24
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:54,079
like most people 12 sixth grade started

25
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:57,479
puffing I went to high school in South

26
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,160
Tacoma nice and that's where I started

27
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:00,718
smoking weed and hustling and [ __ ] like

28
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:04,238
that yeah

29
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,960
good weed back then Canadian canadi lots

30
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,118
of Canadian lots of Canadian T coma

31
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:09,759
being so close to the borders that was

32
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:12,000
mainly what we ran through in high

33
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:13,560
school the good weed would come through

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
but it was real

35
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,600
rare yeah yeah yeah so there wasn't a

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,159
lot of people growing like in your

37
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,879
circle of friends no but there was a lot

38
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,560
of people getting Canadian weed a lot of

39
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:27,640
Canadian weed it'd go it and go in three

40
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,840
stages you'd get 1 a 2A or 3A you always

41
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,640
want the [ __ ] that said 3A yeah yeah

42
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,478
right good stuff do you remember the

43
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,640
strains no [ __ ] no it was like

44
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:41,039
red with some Crystal and uh sometimes

45
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,118
you'd get some [ __ ] that was like a

46
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,118
little light green were they like

47
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:45,519
football siiz pounds yeah football siiz

48
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:48,280
pounds sometimes they'd say like good

49
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:50,280
year in the side of them and [ __ ] wild I

50
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,159
guess let's dive you were in kovo you

51
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,159
were in California you worked down there

52
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,560
for a while yeah I start I started

53
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:00,680
growing weed when I was 19 um I rented a

54
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:03,118
house and uh blew up the upstairs and

55
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,439
would sleep downstairs and that was when

56
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:08,239
I was like 19 I started growing indoor

57
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:12,000
my first trains were we had a purple NL

58
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:14,640
NL number four a skunk a Jack and a

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,759
Durban and then I went to Canada and I

60
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:20,639
bought a bunch of mango seeds Canadian

61
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:22,000
mango and some Casey Jones Casey Jones

62
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:25,119
Casey Jones that [ __ ] sucks I haven't

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,878
heard that in forever I know that's old

64
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,959
school uhuh I think that was like uh o

65
00:02:27,878 --> 00:02:33,759
02 or 03 yeah and that was fun I did

66
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,759
soil I'd go to Linda she was like the

67
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:40,039
local lady down the street and she made

68
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:43,399
some A&amp;B and organic aamb you'd mix

69
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:44,919
banana mana and cool Bloom nice that was

70
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,400
kind of the that was the recipe that was

71
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:49,759
the recipe back in the day what did you

72
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:53,319
do for substrate soil and then just it

73
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:56,000
was uh Black Gold no we'd mix a Happy

74
00:02:53,318 --> 00:02:58,000
Frog and ocean Forest together nice and

75
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,598
we'd put them in five gallon pots cuz

76
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,598
the ocean Forest is so hot that you want

77
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:04,000
to let to take it down a notch no

78
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:06,238
because ocean Forest is so thick you

79
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,400
know the Happy Frog is so much lighter

80
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,719
the medium uhhuh and but the ocean

81
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,680
Forest like had they said more nutrients

82
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:16,120
I don't know how how true that is you

83
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,519
know yeah I mean at all I was a big fan

84
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,480
of ocean Forest back in the day we used

85
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,280
that for sure yeah definitely thicker

86
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:22,959
than I like though but creates a good

87
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,080
product at the end of the day at the end

88
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,479
of the day y but you know it's all in

89
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,159
how you grow it it's all yeah I mean

90
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:30,959
there's so much to it it's not just one

91
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:33,359
thing it's not just the substrate the

92
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,239
nutrients the way you grow it's all of

93
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,360
that combined yeah and making sure that

94
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:39,480
you're precise and hitting all those um

95
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,439
requirements when you need to on time

96
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:43,158
and having good genetics yeah good

97
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:44,840
genetics definitely helps but I mean

98
00:03:43,158 --> 00:03:46,079
back in the day the genetics weren't you

99
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,719
think they were that great or you think

100
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,239
the Growers were [ __ ]

101
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:51,598
outstanding um I think that it was both

102
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,360
I think we had really good genetics I

103
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,518
don't think it was diverse like it is

104
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,879
now but I think that they were really

105
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,158
good Growers and really passionate

106
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:00,919
people and people gave a [ __ ] and they

107
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:02,798
weren't growing 100 lights it was normal

108
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:05,238
for people to grow six lights or four

109
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,879
lights or a closet yeah and it's still

110
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:09,319
they still do that now but I think a lot

111
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:11,158
of the stuff came out of closets and

112
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:13,238
bedrooms and garages oh yeah you know

113
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:15,239
way more than now oh yeah back in the

114
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:17,680
day when everyone talks about like how

115
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,840
great the weed was I was thinking how

116
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,918
close to the grower people probably were

117
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,198
and didn't know it you know like the

118
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:28,240
texture of the herb when you would get a

119
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:31,400
real real bomb bag was like all velvety

120
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,439
or had like a tarantula look tarantula

121
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:36,478
hair sort of look you know and if you

122
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:39,000
think about it like us as Growers know

123
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:41,800
that when you cut it and hang it and put

124
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,360
it on the stick it looks [ __ ] amazing

125
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,478
and then once people put their [ __ ]

126
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,520
hands on it and start trimming it and it

127
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:51,719
goes in the turkey and [ __ ] it totally

128
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:53,519
loses that like beautiful flower look so

129
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,759
like the herb back in the day if you

130
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:58,159
think about it it was probably coming

131
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,560
from one to two people who were cutting

132
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,600
it off the stick and throw in a [ __ ]

133
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,038
bag for you to smoke so it's like the

134
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,000
freshness of that I think is what we

135
00:05:06,038 --> 00:05:10,000
were formed a table model we were all

136
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,959
like experiencing where it was like this

137
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,439
is so bomb and you know compared to you

138
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:18,079
know the Canadian or the the Mexican

139
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:20,560
[ __ ] it wases that stuff got smashed

140
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:22,120
yeah smashed and just sucked yeah I mean

141
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,160
I think the genetics back in the day

142
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,560
were good too there was a bunch of

143
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,080
variety but it was different than today

144
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,879
I feel like everything was a lot more

145
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:33,719
distinct we have a lot of gelados

146
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:35,319
there's 100 different gelato derivatives

147
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,919
right now that are popular oh yeah

148
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:39,840
whereas like we probably had you know we

149
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:41,478
had Purple Kush that was kind of gelato

150
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,599
is it's not gelato but like that was

151
00:05:41,478 --> 00:05:47,360
kind of what we had back in the day that

152
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:50,000
was similar what year um I would say 98

153
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,680
99 early 2000s there was like a purple

154
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,560
kush there was a GDP but there wasn't

155
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,720
five gdps or 10 ogs really I mean I

156
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,439
guess OG's kind of picked up and we got

157
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:03,080
more ogs I love OG and there was

158
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:04,959
probably 10 ogs but a lot of them were

159
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:07,159
the same exact cut just renamed

160
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:08,719
something different yeah now we have

161
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:12,319
like derivatives of der what you think

162
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,759
the name of that OG was uh that was the

163
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,598
original OG I think and that's just what

164
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,680
it's called the Josh the real OG like

165
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:21,439
where Josh D or mad dog shout out to

166
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:24,199
Josh D shout out to Mad Dog

167
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,519
rip uh those and same thing ghost OG

168
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:28,000
that's all the same cut the headband

169
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:30,399
that we had up here was that cut and it

170
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,918
was those are just four of the many

171
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:34,959
names uh of the same exact cut where it

172
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:37,198
went to different people and there was

173
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:38,519
like a different model back then you

174
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,160
didn't want to share your genetics with

175
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:42,079
anybody because the second it got out it

176
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,599
would take away the value of it it was

177
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:48,120
more rare oh if you held on to it U and

178
00:06:45,598 --> 00:06:49,759
that OG gas was pretty epic back then I

179
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,918
lost a lot of friends not giving out

180
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,479
Cuts

181
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:56,519
honestly yeah unfortunately you know

182
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:58,120
like there's nothing worse too and

183
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:00,719
someone's like can I get a cut and I'm

184
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,598
like ah I didn't share genetics we

185
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,360
didn't share genetics that much either

186
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:08,120
but then you and your partner we've

187
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,720
shared a lot of genetics because I trust

188
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,598
you guys you guys don't give them out to

189
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,520
people typically yeah not you guys don't

190
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:16,159
give them out to people but we've shared

191
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:17,878
a lot of stuff over the years and you

192
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,360
guys grow really good flower there's

193
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:21,639
only a handful of people out there that

194
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,360
I've shared genetics with on the level

195
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:25,800
that I've shared good stuff with you

196
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,080
guys yeah thank you for sure and vice

197
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,160
versa you guys have shared a lot of good

198
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:31,598
stuff with me yeah you know well

199
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,319
definitely help for when we're chucking

200
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:35,079
pollen and [ __ ] you know yeah making

201
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,720
seeds and making new genetics and you

202
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:39,918
guys love feno hunting just as much as I

203
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,039
do I feel like you know we've been in

204
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:44,758
dozens of gardens where we get our noses

205
00:07:42,038 --> 00:07:47,199
dirty and I love that part of it I think

206
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:49,280
it's amazing I think I love being able

207
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,000
to smell 10 different things like let's

208
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:53,158
say you have 10 different seeds and each

209
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,158
one has its own different personality

210
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:57,399
you know that's fun and some of them are

211
00:07:55,158 --> 00:07:58,759
all good for different reasons M you

212
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:00,279
know and if you grow well enough they

213
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:01,960
take on their own life that's the thing

214
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:03,359
is like you have to be able to grow at a

215
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:05,198
certain level and if you can't grow at

216
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,199
that level there's almost no point in

217
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,639
really pheno hunting because your stuff

218
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,000
all comes out almost identical yeah

219
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:12,680
there's so much variety like you're

220
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,439
saying too especially when you're like

221
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:18,840
getting into like you know 50 50 seeds

222
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:21,120
uh yeah I don't know when I do more than

223
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:23,359
50 seeds I feel like too many fall

224
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,439
through the crack cracks I guess I'm I'm

225
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,840
the same way I don't I used to like

226
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:28,800
doing big fena hunts where you have like

227
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:30,598
300 but you lose stuff but it's a

228
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,918
different fena hunt like it's a you're

229
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:34,399
doing variety testing on a different

230
00:08:32,918 --> 00:08:36,278
level where you're looking at stuff

231
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,399
that's similar and you're trying to find

232
00:08:36,278 --> 00:08:41,320
unicorns and that's okay too like the

233
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,719
guys that are unicorn hunting sh uh Gene

234
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,800
finder you know when they were doing

235
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,959
their big 20,000 seed feno hunts at

236
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,679
Harborside and he's done some really

237
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:50,399
incredible stuff and that's a different

238
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:51,879
model than what I like is to you know

239
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,000
because I also think you should grow

240
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:56,000
them out multiple times to really find

241
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,480
your selections you can find it and hit

242
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,958
it right the first time but sometimes it

243
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,240
changes so after your third round of it

244
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:04,119
it could be completely different yeah um

245
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,879
we've seen that we saw that with the the

246
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:09,440
Pluto s1s those Pluto S1 seeds going

247
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:11,278
through those it went from you know

248
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,720
where it was one way one time it was

249
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:16,360
more candy and more gelato 33 that all

250
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:19,839
of a sudden it turned into more lemon

251
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,759
Citrus with that kind of OG gas coming

252
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,839
off it but yeah I like hunting bag seeds

253
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:27,078
too honestly when when I always just ran

254
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:29,519
clones and then once we started making

255
00:09:27,078 --> 00:09:31,399
seeds I wanted to go through them yeah I

256
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,720
I was never really that big on popping

257
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:35,958
other people's gear or or bag seeds

258
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,959
because I just wanted to have whatever

259
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:40,319
was going to sell the best I just ran

260
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:42,518
clones so what's your philosophy on

261
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,839
breeding like in pheno hunting what what

262
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:46,360
are you looking for nowadays what are

263
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:48,360
you looking for when you go through a

264
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,600
room whatever is

265
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:54,200
different right now I just want whatever

266
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:57,879
is like a so different from the parents

267
00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:00,000
that I'm I'm crossing them to yeah so

268
00:09:57,879 --> 00:10:02,519
like like you're saying I run a lot of

269
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,839
different uh gelato crosses so I'm

270
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:06,679
usually going for whatever the

271
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,279
grandparents are going to um bring out

272
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:10,319
is kind of what I look whatever's not

273
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:12,559
like gelato that I'm going get some

274
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,760
gelato structure and Crystal from well

275
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:16,319
so let's take for example so we've done

276
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:18,919
a collaboration project that's available

277
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,959
on the website which is loud cogenic

278
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:22,639
collaboration and in that we have the

279
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:24,278
glue Lotto seeds you've done some

280
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:26,759
awesome stuff glue lot in the book same

281
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:28,159
thing with rain shadow runs badass cross

282
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:30,879
great one when you're going through

283
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:32,278
those what would you say that you're

284
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:34,439
you're if you have a checklist what's at

285
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:37,639
the top of the checklist on glue lato

286
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:41,160
all those gelato seeds you know we we

287
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:43,839
did multiple 30,000 seed feno hunts you

288
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:46,559
know sniffing sniffing weed till our

289
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,760
noses were like literally raw it was

290
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:51,199
awful so that's why like I got to have

291
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:53,519
like a smaller after you know we did

292
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,720
that I like learned this lesson like you

293
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,240
can't smell weed for like two days

294
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:01,399
straight like that you know it was

295
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,959
like abusive to my nostrils need a lot

296
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:06,200
of coffee yeah we had coffee that didn't

297
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:08,319
do [ __ ] man I needed it does for a

298
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,920
little while but adaptation occurs and

299
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,720
then everything starts smelling the same

300
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:14,120
where your nostrils get burned out oh

301
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:16,759
burnt yeah burnt it hurts so that's why

302
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:19,959
I was saying like the 50 yeah going

303
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:22,039
through 50 50 I mean I don't mind doing

304
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:24,239
I don't want 50 of more than 50 of one

305
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:26,439
thing but I don't mind having multiple

306
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,799
things and going through multiple I you

307
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,399
know I don't know it's uh it's it's

308
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:33,159
really depending on if you know the

309
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,480
genetic as well like your cross if you

310
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:36,000
if you know kind of what you're going to

311
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,480
get and what you're looking for you

312
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,440
start to learn whether you need to pop

313
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,240
50 or you can pop 10 to get something

314
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,360
that you're kind of looking for like

315
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,759
with the blue dream s ones like there's

316
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,519
not that many different expressions of

317
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:49,720
blue dream when you make the s1's

318
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,039
whereas something like gelato 33 every

319
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:55,480
single one of them is different and half

320
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:57,559
of them Herm but but you know it's like

321
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,000
so the more you know your lines it seems

322
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:02,838
like the easier it is is to figure out

323
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,399
how many you need to pop and it's just

324
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:06,000
it's a personal thing too some people

325
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,958
want to pop 300 and they want to do them

326
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,159
outside that's cool too but uh yeah

327
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:13,919
personal preference as far as your

328
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:16,480
favorite thing right now to smoke what's

329
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:19,319
your favorite thing the fendo cross the

330
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,839
GMO gelato cross I made a couple years

331
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:24,240
ago yeah right now is my favorite it's

332
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,440
loud it's loud it's loud and it's

333
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,240
different it's different it's offensive

334
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,920
that's why it's called fendo it's just

335
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:34,440
yeah it still has the G undertones but

336
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:36,000
it's got that GMO chmd kind of overtone

337
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,959
initially and then you have the gelato

338
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,879
that kind of hits you in the back you

339
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:43,679
know the gelato gas no no sweet to it

340
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:45,600
but no sweet to it no sweet it's a

341
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:47,838
little musky little it's got a little

342
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,680
bit of that gelato it's [ __ ] funky

343
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,279
yeah it's got the funk you know that

344
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:55,759
that's what I want right now something

345
00:12:52,278 --> 00:12:57,519
that's just like incredibly loud and

346
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:59,198
offensive yeah where you can smoke it

347
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,278
down to the roach and it still tastes

348
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:04,838
good when you refire it it's got that

349
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:06,360
offensive yeah and I bet it washes it

350
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,920
washes like

351
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,639
motherucker yeah it's a good one I like

352
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:13,360
that you know I still like rain shadow I

353
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,839
love smoking that but yeah so tell us

354
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,399
about rain shadow over the years it's

355
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:17,959
starting to drift to like some other

356
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,039
candy strands we were kind of talking

357
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:21,679
about I think it's getting gassier it's

358
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:23,519
getting gassier and less candy less

359
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:27,198
candy but it was really initially that

360
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:29,600
so it's a skittles gelato 41 and it's

361
00:13:27,198 --> 00:13:32,078
really good you guys have w a Wards with

362
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,399
it it crushes I I feel like it's super

363
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:35,919
special and when you guys I remember

364
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,679
when you guys were first testing it and

365
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:39,319
going through I I checked out the fenos

366
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,319
you helped me pick that one yeah it was

367
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:44,120
the one it was the one it was so good it

368
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,879
was so candy too and it has better

369
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,278
structure than Skittles so it has a

370
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:49,838
improved structure but yet it carries

371
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:52,078
the Skittles turps and Skittles is

372
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,560
really attached to that structure so if

373
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:56,039
you want if you cross nine out of 10

374
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,559
things with Skittles you're going to if

375
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:58,639
you want Skittles you're going to have

376
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:59,559
to get stuff that has the shitty

377
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,759
structure

378
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:03,758
yeah so that's just how it goes with

379
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:04,800
Skittles and if you want you if you're

380
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,879
okay with the different structure you're

381
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,599
going to be okay with different turps so

382
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,480
Seattle the landscape has changed you

383
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,278
guys do everything up there besides have

384
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,480
a dispensary so you guys do extract and

385
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:19,519
you guys do uh greenhouse and outdoor

386
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:22,879
yeah can Organics we started that in

387
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:25,959
2014 me Tim Wendy and Steve my my core

388
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:27,879
friends we all been uh partners for 20

389
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:29,758
years you guys came from California we

390
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:32,679
all came from Tacoma and then we all did

391
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:35,000
a tour down in Cali U me and Steve did

392
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:39,198
uh nine years and I think Tim and Wendy

393
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,679
did six and we learned how to grow uh

394
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:43,519
big outdoor plants and growing green

395
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:46,439
houses but you know when when you're

396
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:48,759
growing in California you uh don't get

397
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,560
the numbers like we do commercially so

398
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:52,759
we tried to get as much weed as we could

399
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:55,758
just off you know what we we're allowed

400
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:58,000
in a mesino was 25 yeah so we'd try to

401
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:01,199
get those 25 as crushing big ass [ __ ]

402
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,839
monster pants dude we we'd get like 10

403
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:06,240
to 12 pound average on Blue dreams and

404
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,519
lemon lares and [ __ ] yeah that was kind

405
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:12,079
of what we we like to grow Tim really

406
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:14,078
love blue dream I love Larry yeah Blue

407
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:15,559
Dream is an easy one to grow yeah we

408
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:18,278
talk about that on the show quite often

409
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:20,039
actually how easy it is to grow it's

410
00:15:18,278 --> 00:15:22,480
easy to get the stalk rod on big ass

411
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:24,198
blue dreams too right yeah and if you

412
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,720
top them you won't you don't have to

413
00:15:24,198 --> 00:15:28,198
worry about Bud Rod or anything like

414
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:31,079
that but it can gets huge massive colas

415
00:15:28,198 --> 00:15:33,198
it yields it takes you know whatever you

416
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:36,559
feed it it'll take it yeah you can

417
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:38,439
really push Blue Dream um yeah it's a

418
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:41,078
good one I'm about to do a cross with it

419
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,639
soon the green crack and the blue dream

420
00:15:41,078 --> 00:15:45,120
yeah that was from the hay Brothers Big

421
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,399
shout out they did the Green Crack too

422
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,360
yes

423
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:51,159
cool that one Tino's genetics has green

424
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,399
crack he's been breeding with it yeah he

425
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:54,039
does some interesting stuff with green

426
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,519
crack I lik Green Crack back in the day

427
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:57,039
but it was like one of those ones where

428
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,679
you'd smoke it and you'd get a tolerance

429
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,838
to it and boom you can't smoke any more

430
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:02,519
of it because it doesn't get you high at

431
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,839
all it was some work for sure yeah but

432
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:06,240
it gets you the yield you wanted

433
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,600
especially if you only had 25 plants 25

434
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,600
plants wow people laugh at 25 plants now

435
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,720
yeah but if you get 200 pounds who gives

436
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:18,319
a [ __ ] yeah totally why especially back

437
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:21,240
then when the prices were high yeah it's

438
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:23,318
a different world now yeah so what year

439
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,600
did you guys move to Washington from

440
00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:28,479
California to do can Organics uh they

441
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:31,360
started can Organics uh two years before

442
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,839
me doing doing the buildout it's like

443
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:37,199
100% mom and pop we started with nothing

444
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,759
and then they just started building it

445
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:42,078
like I was kind of saying like we were

446
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:43,879
only allowed to do 25 big plants so when

447
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:50,039
we started can of Organics we were

448
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:53,439
running 65 gallon plants for 50 by 25 in

449
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:57,000
Greenhouse space yeah and like you know

450
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:59,759
we had longer veg time you know more

451
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,759
clean out more scraw

452
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,519
you know all of it when we learned how

453
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:07,439
to grow weed it was in mesino doing big

454
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:10,240
plants outside yeah so when we started

455
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,720
Cana in Washington we just kind of

456
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,959
transferred that same sort of style over

457
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,919
you went Greenhouse though when you went

458
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:18,078

461
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,160
don't even know how to I'd really

462

two different green houses that my

476
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:02,079
partner Tim has designed

477
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:03,720
um the first ones we did were just uh

478
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:05,158
they're a little rough but they work

479

great he's totally done some like

480

00:18:07,798 --> 00:18:12,960
designed him we've got like heat that

482
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:15,480
runs through the floor he's designed all

483
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,079
our controllers and our old green houses

484
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,519
even have like heat exchangers in them

485
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:23,199
industrial size heat exchangers that

486
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:26,519
take out the old hot air you know so we

487
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,200
can you know control the humidity and

488
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:30,200
the fresh air that comes back in is

489
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,960
tempered so we don't have to pay for you

490
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,960
know higher propane bills and [ __ ] like

491
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,519
that yeah it looks super clean Super

492
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,440
efficient Tim's always efficient with

493
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:40,839
his designs yeah smart [ __ ] yeah

494
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,960
yeah he's smart creative and always

495
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:45,279
thinking outside the box always trying

496
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,798
to improve stuff always just like you're

497
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:49,038
trying to improve flour he tries to

498
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:51,679
improve the system yeah he builds the

499
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:54,279
systems and then I break them tell him

500
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:57,480
to fix the [ __ ] right and then we fix it

501
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:59,599
and it's it's a fun Dynamic you know we

502
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,720
just we're always trying to he's always

503
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:04,119
trying to um innovate some things and

504
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,640
yeah on the extract tip you guys have

505
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:07,599
some of the best tasting pens I've ever

506
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,440
tasted yeah we got all the new stuff is

507
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:11,038
really incredible I was never a pen guy

508
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,558
before them honestly I was never a

509
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:14,000
forbidden fruit guy and then you smoke

510
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:18,558
me so or you gave me some forbidden

511
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:23,079
fruit to SM man impressive TPS long

512
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:25,960
finish yeah uh really good I'm not a big

513
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:27,158
Tangi fan for SE with pens it's just not

514
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,720
is that because it doesn't get you high

515
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:30,919
though yeah I would say mostly I mean I

516
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,240
mean I like the turps but like as far as

517
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:37,080
like it's not that strong no so when you

518
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:40,159
mix it with like 80% [ __ ] thca that

519
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:41,599
[ __ ] is [ __ ] strong and bomb yeah

520
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:43,600
it's weird how much better I was going

521
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:46,119
to say it's like really weird like I'll

522
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:48,918
have like a high tpine extract mixed

523
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:52,119
with disate and I personally it it will

524
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:56,240
never taste like the flower does you

525
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:59,279
know but then you mix the chirping with

526
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,400
just the thca yeah and it's like I'm

527
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:04,079
taking the best [ __ ] dab of my life

528
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,798
every single time I hit it well you're

529
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:08,720
getting a concentrated version of the

530
00:20:05,798 --> 00:20:10,519
tpin yeah concentrated version and every

531
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,798
time you hit the pen it's at the perfect

532
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:15,440
temperature most the times when we dab

533
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:17,079
you know right you heat it up and then

534
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,880
it's somewhat of a guessing game whether

535
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:22,720
you have a timer totally put your hand

536
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,320
next to it I'm old school right you know

537
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,600
you guys goow really good flower up

538
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:28,158
there in Washington and I think that's

539
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:30,599
one thing that separates you plus your

540
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:33,640
your listed genetics y you guys have a

541
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:36,798
pretty long list of good stuff well you

542
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:39,720
know when we first moved up there we're

543
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:42,079
only allowed to like really have so so

544
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,319
many plants and after we brought those

545
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:47,359
plants into the system it was kind of

546
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:49,960
like we had to mimic what California was

547
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:52,839
doing California had you know at that

548
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:56,240
point and it was like 2016 so you needed

549
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:59,038
to have like every strain to like really

550
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,519
sell so like it's not really like that

551
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:01,919
now you know it's kind of leveled out to

552
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:03,918
where people kind of just like what they

553
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,919
like but at that time you know if you

554
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,360
wanted to sell you needed wedding cake

555
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,759
you know you needed Gorilla Glue number

556
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:13,639
four you know that [ __ ] was hot needed

557
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:15,359
some Candy Land and and then once you

558
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,720
know all the strains that we had all

559
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:21,119
died off we still needed to have new

560
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:23,159
[ __ ] so we just started making our own

561
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:25,719
stuff what does they say like from need

562
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:28,760
comes necessity right that was kind of

563
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:31,319
what started all that sort of breeding

564
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:33,480
you know and it it's really it's really

565
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:37,278
a lot easier honestly to uh do your

566
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:40,278
selections outside than it is inside um

567
00:21:37,278 --> 00:21:42,000
so it was easier for us to do and we

568
00:21:40,278 --> 00:21:43,640
were making you do both though you do

569
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,798
selections outside you I mean I've seen

570
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:49,120
some

571
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:51,679
know I personally like um like it inside

572
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:54,519
but it it was easier outside kind of

573
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:57,320
like when I'm spacewise yeah spacewise

574
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:59,480
and it growing Under the Sun seeds is

575
00:21:57,319 --> 00:22:01,558
like super [ __ ] sweet s man

576
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:04,159
especially when you're selecting there's

577
00:22:01,558 --> 00:22:07,599
something about uh the high-intensity

578
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:10,278
lights cause more Herm problems when I

579
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:12,439
grow outside and I'm doing my

580
00:22:10,278 --> 00:22:14,400
selecting sometimes you know most time I

581
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,919
don't have any problems at all yeah

582
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,440
while take the same strains and go

583
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:21,520
inside and the stress from the lights or

584
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:23,159
the feed or something yeah um usually

585
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:25,839
will trigger a little bit more of that

586
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:29,000
if there's a problem with that mhm

587
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:31,240
string yeah we get rid of the seed run

588
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,200
completely and just go from clone that's

589
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,640
that's my way of doing it uh you know

590
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,360
and everyone has their own opinion on

591
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,559
that some people like that initial seed

592
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:39,439
run especially if you're selling seeds

593
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:41,240
for Acres that's great but I feel like

594
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,440
if you're selecting for genetics that

595
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,640
you want to sell clones of starting from

596
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,960
that first clonal generation is key

597
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,038
because then you kind of see what you

598
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,558
get and growing it out again before you

599
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:53,200
really start picking which ones I mean

600
00:22:51,558 --> 00:22:55,038
some I like getting rid of 50% of the

601
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:59,480
stuff that's just not good right off the

602
00:22:55,038 --> 00:23:02,079
bat but you know I honestly I I totally

603
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:04,000
hear that but sometimes when you find a

604
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:06,599
winner you find a winner you don't need

605
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
to run it twice it's just like this is

606
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:10,399
[ __ ] money when you're growing it too

607
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,240
you're you're watching it and you're

608
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,240
like looking at everything and then

609
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,960
there's the one you go back to and it's

610
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,839
like every all your other Growers are

611
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,679
all looking at the same one it's not a

612
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:21,720
mystery on what's going to win this [ __ ]

613
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,919
no but you want to make sure by growing

614
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,759
it again to make sure that you hit it CU

615
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,159
a lot of times you know you're right

616
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:29,679
100% but that second time confirms

617
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,799
because had stuff where we're like

618
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:34,519
that's the one 100% Pluto when we were

619
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:36,158
looking through Pluto bag seies the ones

620
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:38,639
we thought were the winners on the first

621
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:41,799
round were not the winners those were

622
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:44,000
and it [ __ ] completely changed um as

623
00:23:41,798 --> 00:23:45,879
that matured Weir that was weird though

624
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,400
yeah and you think that's cuz it was a

625
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,760
bag seed I think there's a lot of some

626
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,400
[ __ ] well no there's just a lot of

627
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:54,440
genetic diversity in there besides you

628
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:56,159
know being a bag bag seeds besides that

629
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,600
that cross has a lot of genetic

630
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,880
diversity so there's a lot of different

631
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:01,558
Expressions you get in there and a lot

632
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,080
of bad ones to find the good one I think

633
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:04,839
the the winners were found out of

634
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:06,759
probably 500 seeds or something like

635
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:08,399
that wow and then other people have

636
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:10,839
popped and found some winners too out

637
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,278
there they sold seeds sticky Farms gas

638
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:14,240
house those guys sold seeds of that

639
00:24:12,278 --> 00:24:16,119
cross and there's there's some winners

640
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,319
of that stuff out there they make some

641
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:20,918
good

642
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:23,720
stuff they're from uh up there too Co by

643
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:26,038
Koval sticky Farms sticky Farms sticky

644
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,919

646
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,278
with them mhm Pluto's good though that's

647
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,079
got unique especially because it has a

648
00:24:32,278 --> 00:24:36,919
gelato 33 with something special I got I

649

651
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:44,079
I like that one wedding cake crosses are

652
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:47,240
good I think there's some good stuff in

653
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:49,558
there m I like the breadin of it there's

654
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:51,440
a sweet one too though there's like two

655
00:24:49,558 --> 00:24:53,960
cakes there's the bready one there 30

656
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,679
cakes I only know I only know of two I

657
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:58,880
know one that was like super sweet where

658
00:24:56,679 --> 00:25:00,399
you hit it you're like damn this a cake

659
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,520
and then there's a doughy one which is

660
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:05,319
the one I had I had I had the doughy one

661
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:07,278
cvar has the gassy one right but they so

662
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:09,119
SE junkie sold seeds of wedding cake and

663
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:10,880
so there's a lot of Expressions that

664
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:12,000
popped up from people all over and this

665
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,799
is wedding cake they're all calling it

666
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,798
wedding cake and they're all different

667
00:25:13,798 --> 00:25:18,000
and there was like a couple good ones

668
00:25:15,798 --> 00:25:19,558
couple really good ones I think and

669
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,880
gassie and Bry those are the two you

670
00:25:19,558 --> 00:25:22,359
know there was the one that yielded like

671
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,760
crazy they just wasn't that turpy that

672
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:27,119
was going around California quite a bit

673
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:29,839
but uh still really good and I think

674
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:32,000
good breeder good you know as far as bag

675
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:34,918
appeal especially yeah I like I like

676
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,038
cake I did some work with it I crossed

677
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:41,720
the gelato to that across the gelato to

678
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:43,919
everything dude the 41 yeah I've been

679
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,240
long time so the difference with the 41

680
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,960
and the 33 we were kind of talking about

681
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,720
it earlier but the 33 has a lot more

682
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,038
genetic diversity whereas the 41 I think

683
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:53,558
is more stable and for breeding if

684
00:25:52,038 --> 00:25:56,200
you're breeding at scale or breeding to

685
00:25:53,558 --> 00:25:59,639
put stuff out in fields 41's your ticket

686
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,840
oh yeah yeah it does great um you maybe

687
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:04,640
don't you don't get the color you get

688
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:06,879
from the 33 no but but it will send it

689
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,960
two different ways you know you can get

690
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:13,080
whey gas in your selections or you can

691
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:15,079
get whey sweet um which add you know a

692
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:17,639
lot of diversity yeah what do you think

693
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:20,599
about Mochi I think it's just some more

694
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:23,200
gelato yeah it is a gelato yeah it's

695
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:26,599
good though I think it's candy it's okay

696
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,960
I like 41 best by far um but you know

697
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:31,480
when we were first running it it was a

698
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,919
lot sweeter than it is now yeah I mean

699
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,880
it's been been around for like eight

700
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:37,640
years now right nine years something

701
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,480
like that I think it's definitely way

702
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:42,360
gassier what about the champagne cut the

703
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,720
Pink Champagne the bud structure of that

704
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:47,278
pink Champagne reminds me a lot of these

705
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,120
crem Ros crosses that I was uh making at

706
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:51,398
work for a while so crem Ros is one of

707
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:53,678
my favorites I know I don't know why we

708
00:26:51,398 --> 00:26:56,558
[ __ ] up I think you gave you gave it

709
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,919
to me but you also lost it and so it was

710
00:26:56,558 --> 00:27:01,960
the it was the Skittles times

711
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:05,080
creme Ros yeah I still have those seeds

712
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:07,880
but I made the Skittles creme Ros times

713
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:10,798
wedding cake which is a new one out that

714
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:12,600
it's called cakes it's good it's good

715
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:14,639
and that's from the creme Ros line that

716
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:17,359
I like I did so much work with that for

717
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,200
like two years and it was all just trash

718
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:21,479
well so the structure was trash right

719
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,880
trash dude the mail we used but the turs

720
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,798
were so good I don't know I don't think

721
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:29,679
rosew water is really like a turp that

722
00:27:25,798 --> 00:27:31,480
I'm like going for I'm all dud but why

723
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:35,200

724
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:38,720

backat cross to the Skittles so we did

737
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:07,240
work with it but the mail we used on the

738
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:09,918
creme Ros was dominant in everything I

739
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:12,759
just [ __ ] hated it it was like too

740
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:14,640
small and never had the crystal that I

741
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:15,759
like really was going for it doesn't

742
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,080
have back appeal it'd be more of a

743
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:21,278
washer there's this new one called White

744

Thorn Rose it's newer it's not new new

745
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:24,240

746
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:27,558

747

748
00:28:27,558 --> 00:28:33,240
pretty pretty sexy it's on that level

749
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:35,158
it's it's on that that rosewater turp

750
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:39,640
level yeah

751
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:41,240
mild laqua laqua laqua you got say it

752
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:43,000
like that with the hand yeah you got to

753
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:45,200
do it with the hand did you ever grow

754
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,880
big outdoor before uh we did some big

755
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,640
outdoor plants like with my partner

756
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,399
Micah but it wasn't me uh as much as it

757
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:54,159
was my partners in my backyard I did

758
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:55,558
some big ones uh I did more smaller ones

759
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,320
for seed production and stuff like that

760
00:28:55,558 --> 00:29:00,319
but I I do like not big big monsters

761
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:01,918
mine were mostly like they would be like

762
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:05,480
five foot tall plants or six foot tall

763
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:07,320
really wide you know we did seeds with

764
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:10,399
those and I I would that's in the ground

765
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:12,480
or beds in pots in beds and in the

766
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:13,678
ground yeah I liked exper I've always

767
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,839
liked

768
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,880
experimenting uh depending on what in

769
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:21,000
the ground I feel like in the ground is

770
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:22,640
the best but for my opinion pots are

771
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,880
okay too I mean at the same time if

772
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,278
you're doing seed production and you

773
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:28,360
want to be able to move that plant

774
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:30,558
around you know it's like once you know

775
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:32,678
your area where you're going but mine

776
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:34,359
was you know it wasn't commercial like

777
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:38,360
they're doing now this was you know hom

778
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:40,479
grow back in the day so 400 gallon smart

779
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:43,158
pots those are so gangster the guys that

780
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:46,679
do 400 gallons in smart pots it's

781
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:48,399
amazing or the guys 800s too that's so

782
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:50,440
crazy and then you're getting a 12 pound

783
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:52,239
plant off that yeah 12 to 15 pounds on

784
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:54,120
those ones we'd always put them in like

785
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,480
the best spot of the yard yeah when when

786
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:59,239
I was loud seeds my my partner used to

787
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:01,798
crush it big plants Sour Diesel that

788
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:05,159
were just monsters yeah what happened to

789
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:08,798
that cut that cut went away with the

790
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:11,440
virus he The Hop Lon yeah I mean I've

791
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:14,240
I've seen some Sour in the last year

792
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,399
that's been sour but still not that

793
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,720
punch you in the face sour to where you

794
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:20,959
open the bag and you're like oh my God

795
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,319
yeah and I'm still waiting to see that

796
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,519
so let's talk about Grape Ape for a

797
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:26,798
little bit so people sometimes talk

798
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:28,120
about GDP and Grape Ape being related

799
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:29,759
and they might be but they're totally

800
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:33,678
two different plants cuz Grape Ape would

801
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:35,319
yield it would get huge purple buds M

802
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,679
you didn't get that from your GDP you

803
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:40,038
did not get that from GDP no the GDP

804
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:42,360
that we had was a shorter plant and it

805
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:44,960
got really tight buds I didn't have that

806
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:47,599
my gdps uh the ones that I was messing

807
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:50,038
with back in the day the GDP was always

808
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:52,398
the biggest with the least amount of

809
00:30:50,038 --> 00:30:54,398
turps of the three then it went grap ape

810
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:56,119
was like mediumsized plant was the Urkle

811
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:58,599
was the third and the Urkel was the

812
00:30:56,119 --> 00:31:01,798
shortest smallest hardest to grow

813
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:04,199
but just oozed [ __ ] turps man so we

814
00:31:01,798 --> 00:31:06,679
did the GDP indoors and it was like a 31

815
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,080
day veg 28 to 31 days something like

816
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:10,120
that for You' veg them because if you

817
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:12,519
didn't veg them tall enough you wouldn't

818
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:15,119
get enough big butts what size pot were

819
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:17,038
you using for that long veg well so we

820
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:18,719
grew them in octagons for a while where

821
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:21,480
we had five gallon pots where it was

822
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,440
vertical growing uh we grew them in in

823
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,759
beds with you know mostly what we did

824
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,759
back in the day was five gallons

825
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:29,200
sometimes 10 gallons what was your

826
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:31,558
medium in a 5 gallon pot and an octagon

827
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,240
in the Octagon we use soil soil we use

828
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:35,359
soil in the octagons back in the day in

829
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,038
a 5 gallon pot aren't you supposed to

830
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:38,158
use

831
00:31:36,038 --> 00:31:39,480
hydrogen no not in the Octagon that we

832
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,278
had we had Dutch pots that are these

833
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,480
Square pots that have a hole in the back

834
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:46,679
and they fit into the Octagon shelves to

835
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:48,880
where you can fit 26 plants per light

836
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:51,639
uhuh and they all you get small buds and

837
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,080
one time we did the chem dog and I grew

838
00:31:51,638 --> 00:31:55,599
a wall of lar yeah like literally I had

839
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:59,960
a wall of lar it was like it was

840
00:31:55,599 --> 00:32:01,759
beautiful but it wasn't like you sell uh

841
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,639
I grew chem dog in an octagon where you

842
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:05,038
need because it doubles in flour it's

843
00:32:03,638 --> 00:32:06,240
just not the right genetic to grow in

844
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:08,519
something like that you want something

845
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,798
that either you flip it right away

846
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:13,480
because you want smaller because your

847
00:32:09,798 --> 00:32:16,200
your lights's probably I think 28 inches

848
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:18,000
away from the start and it was just one

849
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,480
bulb straight down one bulb in a Cool

850
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,200
Tube so you have a cool

851
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:25,319
tube yeah the cool tubes way back this

852
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:27,440
is like 24 years ago or something like

853
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:28,359
that it was a long time ago yeah I mean

854
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,080
we

855
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:32,439
all kinds of amazing genetics in them

856
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:34,158
but uh the stuff that would double and

857
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:36,278
flower in the more sativa stuff was not

858
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,159
good for octagons M but we were worried

859
00:32:36,278 --> 00:32:39,839
about the carbon footprint not in the

860
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,320
sense of helicopters going over and

861
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:42,480
infrared we were like oh yeah we grow in

862
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:45,359
octagons they're not going to find our

863
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,639
girls yeah so and I had four octagons in

864
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:51,719
my garage at one point and four how much

865
00:32:47,638 --> 00:32:53,759
did that cost to to build four octagons

866
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:57,519
well we had the frame we built ourselves

867
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:59,798
from plywood in 2x4s huh and so yeah we

868
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:02,519
fr cuz there used to be a whole octagon

869
00:32:59,798 --> 00:33:04,398
contraption that they wanted like we

870
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:07,798
never bought that [ __ ] my friend came

871
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:09,479
down hippie style but he had like this

872
00:33:07,798 --> 00:33:11,519
paper where it was all sketched out and

873
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:13,839
the angles were set so we had all the

874
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:16,399
stuff pre-cut where we'd cut it all and

875
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:18,038
then snap it all together and uh it it

876
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:20,839
was really cool I had a 500-gallon

877
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:22,398
reservoir that was on a table that we

878
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:24,119
thought we could just gravity feed right

879
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:25,439
I think we started out trying to do the

880
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:27,479
gravity feed but it didn't work so we

881
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,919
had to get a pump M but uh we got a

882
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:33,558
whole in the reservoir and this was

883
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:35,000
always oh always and so it was a

884
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:36,798
homemade Reservoir where we had one of

885
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,159
those pool liners that we built a box on

886
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:40,759
top of a table Yeah but uh had to do

887
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:42,760
whatever you had to do back then dude we

888
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:44,240
just did whatever we had to do cuz El

889
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:46,839
was going to do I still love the smell

890
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,960
of [ __ ] wet dirt in a house like if

891
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:50,918
you go you know what I mean it's like

892
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,038
there's something wrong about promix

893
00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:56,440
next to carpet where you're like a yeah

894
00:33:54,038 --> 00:33:59,440
seriously reminds me of my youth yeah

895
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:00,919
right good times D the garage grows mhm

896
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:04,038
but some of the best weed's been grown

897
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:06,000
in garages godamn right it still is it

898
00:34:04,038 --> 00:34:07,398
probably still is yes yeah it's so

899
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,679
listen you grow some of the best weed

900
00:34:07,398 --> 00:34:12,118
I've ever smoked thanks what would you

901
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:15,159
say your secret to success is growing

902
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:18,000
cannabis right never takes a

903
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:20,039
break when you hear people say that like

904
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,838
the devotion that it takes to like

905
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:24,800
really nail everything on time sometimes

906
00:34:22,838 --> 00:34:27,358
is [ __ ] crazy you know it doesn't

907
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,399
care about Christmas or kids birthdays

908
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:31,319
or any of that other [ __ ] it might need

909
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:33,319
to get watered at 2: a.m. and you got to

910
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,679
go get that [ __ ] done in your slippers

911
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,320
you know what I mean and there's just

912
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:40,480
like a level of care to grow great

913
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:43,039
cannabis that uh is really hard to

914
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,079
achieve and some people do it and hats

915
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:47,759
off to them you know but it's really

916
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:54,200
hard you know I I grow in green houses

917
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:57,079
for work and that in itself is truly the

918
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:58,159
hardest grow ever you know to grow to

919
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:01,079
grow in wash

920
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:05,399
and Green Houses in beds and to crop

921
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:07,359
steer that is maddening you know we live

922
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:09,920
in a a spot that's like called the

923
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:12,880
banana belt so it's Washington and it

924
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:16,519
doesn't rain a lot but the Sun comes out

925
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:19,079
and the every two hours or something so

926
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:21,960
we might be set up to water two or three

927
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:25,400
times for the day but then the Sun goes

928
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:27,400
away and now it's cloudy forever and I

929
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:30,480
can't do these extra waterings so it's

930
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:32,358
just like learning to do that in a bed

931
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,199
is completely different than learning

932
00:35:32,358 --> 00:35:37,480
how to do that in a pot that you can

933
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:40,960
pick up and feel so the level of care

934
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:43,119
that it takes to grow great cannabis

935
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,440
especially in Washington especially in

936
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:47,720
green houses is just kind of maddening

937
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,358
yeah it takes a lot and I have a great

938
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:51,838
team and I'm I'm proud of the guys I got

939
00:35:50,358 --> 00:35:54,000
right there you know my whole business

940
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:56,440
is how big is your team I we've got like

941
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,119
seven seven guys outside to run almost

942
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:01,920
30,000 square feet feet and we've got

943
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:04,440
like 47 or 48 employees at all you know

944
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:07,639
at can Organics we make a lot of Vapes

945
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:09,079
and we make uh we sell a lot of joints

946
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:11,239
and that's kind of seems to be where the

947
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:15,680
market is is headed you know we were

948
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:17,759
talking about these these Vapes we got

949
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:19,559
um like I was saying I don't I don't

950
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,839
really ever smoke Vapes until I got

951
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:22,279
these Vapes it's not just because it's

952
00:36:20,838 --> 00:36:24,119
the Vape that I'm trying to push don't

953
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,000
get me wrong I'm trying to push my vape

954
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:29,119
but at the same time like it's a vape

955
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,318
that's actually enjoyable all the way to

956
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:35,119
the end you know the turps don't burn

957
00:36:31,318 --> 00:36:37,318
out too quick they last a long time and

958
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:39,160
I mean you can smoke The Vape you know

959
00:36:37,318 --> 00:36:40,880
like anywhere I [ __ ] HIIT it before I

960
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:44,039
went and got my rental car on the way

961
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,720
down here you know like yeah they're so

962
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:47,679
convenient you know you're at Safeway

963
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:49,399
people love convenience dude the other

964
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:52,000
day I was at Safeway I took a hit and

965
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:55,880
then stuck my head inside the cereal box

966
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,880
aisle and blew it out you know

967
00:36:56,519 --> 00:37:00,119
like that's what's up though yeah

968
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:01,679
they're a little dangerous you know in

969
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:04,240
that sense too especially when you're

970
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:06,879
smoking straight thca it's just like

971
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:08,598
[ __ ] fad it when some of them don't even

972
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,119
smell like weed it starts smelling like

973
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:13,960
other things like candy forbidden fruit

974
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:16,599
smells like orange [ __ ] yeah

975
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:19,119
orangesicle orange yeah out of the Vapes

976
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:22,480
I noticed it tastes a lot sweeter than

977
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:25,358
it does in flower form when I smoke the

978
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,880
Vapes it's like a bright sort of orange

979
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:30,199
it's loud they're loud those are the

980
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,039
loudest cards i've smoked on yeah um

981
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:33,719
yeah I'm surprised I love that style cuz

982
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:35,199
they you get big hits out of those too

983
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:37,358
you get big hits and it doesn't burn

984
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:39,358
them too hot you where you lose the

985
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:41,838
flavor yep and I think a lot of these

986
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:44,078
like really like fancy Vapes that are

987
00:37:41,838 --> 00:37:47,199
out there kind of do that they're more

988
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:49,039
of a gimmicky looking than they are like

989
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:51,039
burning well yeah there's a lot of

990
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:52,480
gimmicky stuff out there still yeah but

991
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:53,800
I think we're we're trying to evolve

992
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,280
into new things so there's going to be

993
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,839
gimmicky stuff along the way and then

994
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,400
somebody does it right and then someone

995
00:37:56,838 --> 00:38:01,519
does it right that's right let's talk

996
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,599
about genetics let's do it okay so with

997
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:06,960
the new popular stuff what are you going

998
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:09,400
for what do you like Skittles you know

999
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,199
you talked about you you like offensive

1000
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:14,000
the work that I was doing before I don't

1001
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:16,078
know if I'd really call it like breeding

1002
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,318
as much as I'd call it just like

1003
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:21,640
exploring and pollen chucking basically

1004
00:38:19,318 --> 00:38:24,920
because I was just kind of trying to do

1005
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:27,719
what like either was like popular at the

1006
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:29,880
time or what other people were doing you

1007
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:33,078
know in the sense where they're telling

1008
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:34,480
me they want me to make this you know

1009
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:36,920
the stuff that I'm going to do in the

1010
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:40,838
future like the stuff I have going right

1011
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:43,240

grower totally so so like if the way I

1027
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:22,399
think about it is like up until now I've

1028

just been Crossing like candy with some

1029
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:29,480
popular things but all these old sativas

1030
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:30,838
like the durb the headband and the uh

1031
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:34,358

grapefruit all these like kind of weird

1034
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:41,838
things that phased out yeah I just want

1035
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:44,000
to see what it does so like before you

1036
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:47,078
know it was kind of like I wanted like

1037
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:50,440
genetics that were popular and and now I

1038
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:52,079
kind of just want weird things to come

1039
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:56,200
from it you know we I'm not worried

1040
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:58,640
about like filling a field or um having

1041
00:39:56,199 --> 00:40:01,439
a hot new thing I just want to like have

1042

more fun with breeding and and seeing

1043
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,639
the weird [ __ ] that's going to come out

1044
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,519
of the crosses that really no one's

1045
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:09,838
really doing with the popular [ __ ] cuz

1046
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:12,639
you know like the Skittles T you know to

1047
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:14,599
like a real lemony Haze could be super

1048
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:16,719
bomb yeah and I just really haven't

1049

1052
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:25,400
saying it's sounds good and even like

1053
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:27,358
you know taking like the funk of the

1054
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:30,000
eendo and then Crossing that to

1055
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:32,000
different sorts of like sativas and then

1056
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,199
seeing the weird [ __ ] that comes from

1057
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,559
that because anything that's got GMO in

1058
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:39,480
it it's going to be weird as [ __ ] yeah

1059
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:42,279
you know Funk Funk and then you know the

1060
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:44,440
underlying Funk yeah and then from there

1061
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:47,400
you know I want to make a lot of s1's of

1062

1063
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,680
already have and then I want to explore

1064

strains go and how fast they come and go

1235
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:17,039

00:48:25,838 --> 00:48:28,960
mean California I think totally

1242
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:31,880
different Market in some ways well

1243
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:33,720
California leads the market you know in

1244
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:36,480
in my state it leads a lot of things in

1245
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:38,598
the market for sure not stability

1246
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:42,079
Washington's way more stable I think

1247
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:43,440
they trust Brands a lot more uh and you

1248

1261
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:10,318
trying to narrow a lot of that down

1262
00:49:08,358 --> 00:49:13,639

1263
00:49:10,318 --> 00:49:16,838
from Candy so much because it's just all

1264

we've been growing for years yeah and I

1265
00:49:16,838 --> 00:49:20,519
don't know it's just time the market

1266
00:49:18,679 --> 00:49:22,639

00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:34,480
people go to the store they want you

1272
00:49:31,798 --> 00:49:36,759
know they want something they know and

1273
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,599
they might not even know the name of any

1274
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:40,400
of this [ __ ] so what do they say they

1275
00:49:38,599 --> 00:49:42,280
say can I have an indica or can I have a

1276
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:44,200
sativa because well they don't want to

1277
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:45,760
sound stupid you know what I mean and

1278
00:49:44,199 --> 00:49:47,519
they want something that they think is

1279
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,680
going to [ __ ] them up like that right

1280
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:51,480
that gives them that effect that they're

1281
00:49:48,679 --> 00:49:54,798
looking for yeah yeah and there's so

1282
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:57,599
many names now there's so many names

1283
00:49:54,798 --> 00:50:00,119
it's so hard to find a name I'm so awful

1284
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:01,640
at like naming [ __ ] I [ __ ] hate it

1285
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:03,480
man when it's time to like come up with

1286
00:50:01,639 --> 00:50:05,719
a name I just want to hit my head

1287
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:08,079
against a [ __ ] board yeah well

1288
00:50:05,719 --> 00:50:09,679
because they're all taken right you know

1289
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:12,559
I think honestly I just kind of want to

1290
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:15,719
steer towards funny names from now on

1291
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:17,760
because I every candy is taken every ice

1292
00:50:15,719 --> 00:50:19,598
cream's taken anything that's good that

1293
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,799
you want to put in your [ __ ] mouth

1294
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:25,440
it's taken I mean now you just got to

1295
00:50:21,798 --> 00:50:28,239
start making words up pretty much yeah

1296
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,798
or you know a what's up or some [ __ ] you

1297
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:31,959
could have like a slogan for every

1298
00:50:29,798 --> 00:50:34,159
strain that you come up with you know

1299
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:36,400
the name game is just crazy The Strain

1300
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:38,598
formerly known as Prince you start using

1301
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,760
symbols I've I've thought of that one

1302
00:50:38,599 --> 00:50:42,798
before

1303
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:44,960
man yeah it's wild because there's

1304
00:50:42,798 --> 00:50:46,559
thousands and thousands and thousands of

1305
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,440
different names already you know there

1306
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:50,119
people people are using and then got

1307
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:51,798
people stepping on each other's toes and

1308
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:54,559
people getting offended over taking the

1309
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:57,480
names and yeah and and not only that but

1310
00:50:54,559 --> 00:51:00,319
like some some names of like

1311
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:04,719
been taken by people who don't breed or

1312
00:51:00,318 --> 00:51:07,199
grow they got some weed in in bulk and

1313
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:09,480
gave it a name and now leafly's like so

1314
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:11,960
and so in Colorado says this and I'm

1315
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:13,719
like the [ __ ] is that what happened to

1316
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:15,079
that let's talk about rain shadow runs

1317
00:51:13,719 --> 00:51:17,159
how it got his name because originally

1318
00:51:15,079 --> 00:51:19,079
it was rainbow runs it was rainbow runs

1319
00:51:17,159 --> 00:51:21,399
and then Mike literally came out around

1320
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:23,559
the same time with rainbow runs on six

1321
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:25,798
months later yeah and but you know we're

1322
00:51:23,559 --> 00:51:27,798
so like small man it's not like that

1323
00:51:25,798 --> 00:51:29,239
dude

1324
00:51:27,798 --> 00:51:30,759
no that's not what I'm saying but what

1325
00:51:29,239 --> 00:51:32,798
I'm saying is is like this happens all

1326
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:34,400
the time it hurt my feelings pretty bad

1327
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:36,759
cuz I'm like releasing all these

1328
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,480
pictures and then like I look online I

1329
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:40,720
think it was like around Christmas it

1330
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:43,039
was around Christmas it's like rainbow

1331
00:51:40,719 --> 00:51:44,879
runs and I thought it was so [ __ ]

1332
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:47,358
clever with that name but you know we

1333
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:49,200
live in the rain shadow and one of my uh

1334
00:51:47,358 --> 00:51:53,159
one of my employees a great guy Devon he

1335
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:55,679
was like uh rain shadow runs man I

1336
00:51:53,159 --> 00:51:58,480
[ __ ] hated it at first everyone else

1337
00:51:55,679 --> 00:52:01,199
was like ooh and I was like you know cuz

1338
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:03,199
I wanted rainbow runs you know and

1339
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:06,558
especially like anything with runs at

1340
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:08,558
that time was so hot right and so I was

1341
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:11,119
like whatever and then eventually it

1342
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:12,839
grew on me like nobody's business

1343
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:16,200
because we made it right there in the

1344
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:18,719
rain shadow you know like so I was like

1345
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:20,358
you know this the strain is amazing and

1346
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:22,439
we made it right here and the name's

1347
00:52:20,358 --> 00:52:24,639
perfect and you're were right Devin you

1348
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:26,599
know what I mean totally dude it's

1349
00:52:24,639 --> 00:52:28,558
amazing some of these names though that

1350
00:52:26,599 --> 00:52:30,880
there's so many I mean people are coming

1351
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:32,359
up with weird stuff too yeah for sure

1352
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,599
orangutang titties you like that one

1353
00:52:32,358 --> 00:52:36,078
yeah that was a good one that was a good

1354
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:38,920
one yeah there some good yeah Mike from

1355
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:40,359
exotic has some crazy names yeah his red

1356
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:42,000
pop and like so he has some good

1357
00:52:40,358 --> 00:52:44,598
descriptions of his stuff like red pop

1358
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:47,079
smells like red soda man what's up with

1359
00:52:44,599 --> 00:52:49,920
that cut well that was a good one [ __ ]

1360
00:52:47,079 --> 00:52:52,280
that was a good one I only flowered it

1361
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:54,720
and then it died it's a good breeder I

1362
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:57,359
think so if you look at Red Run which is

1363
00:52:54,719 --> 00:53:00,679
a cross of that which is the runs times

1364
00:52:57,358 --> 00:53:02,440
the red pop MH that's better the chirps

1365
00:53:00,679 --> 00:53:05,159
really come out in it but it has the

1366
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:06,798
chirps that you like from the red pop

1367
00:53:05,159 --> 00:53:08,399
with more of a candy and then it comes

1368
00:53:06,798 --> 00:53:10,679
across in the Smoke because I feel like

1369
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:12,599
it's a little the red pop is a little

1370
00:53:10,679 --> 00:53:14,480
Punchy to me like that purple punch like

1371
00:53:12,599 --> 00:53:16,359
smells amazing grows amazing gets you

1372
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,358
excited then you go to smoke a joint of

1373
00:53:16,358 --> 00:53:19,639
it and it's a little bit of a let down

1374
00:53:18,358 --> 00:53:21,759
not as bad as purple punch because

1375
00:53:19,639 --> 00:53:23,118
purple punch for me is a big let down

1376
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,520
when I go to smoke it it's cardboard

1377
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:27,200
chps I've still never smoked it you're

1378
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:28,199
not missing anything that's what you you

1379
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:30,439
know exactly what it tastes like cuz

1380
00:53:28,199 --> 00:53:32,399
you've never smoked it well I I like to

1381
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:35,400
I have a I have a cut of slurricane that

1382
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:38,039
I slur Cane's cool but um I never

1383
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:40,880
actually got when I by the time like it

1384
00:53:38,039 --> 00:53:42,279
was around everyone was like [ __ ] sucks

1385
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:44,119
I was like man if it smells like the

1386
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:46,079
slurricane I got it's like smells

1387
00:53:44,119 --> 00:53:47,480
delicious and strawberries well it's one

1388
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:48,640
cross away from being amazing because I

1389
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:50,119
think you can cross it with a lot of

1390
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:52,039
other stuff and it comes out great or

1391
00:53:50,119 --> 00:53:53,519
cross it a few times when you're looking

1392
00:53:52,039 --> 00:53:56,279
for stuff and you get get some really

1393
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:57,960
good stuff and it's not it's just for me

1394
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:59,559
the the purple punch by itself is a let

1395
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:01,400
down but I've seen great crosses with it

1396
00:53:59,559 --> 00:54:03,519
I think it's a great breeder I think it

1397
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:05,599
has great potential but by itself I

1398
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:06,880
don't I want the joint to taste because

1399
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:09,079
I'm a joint smoker right so at the end

1400
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,720
of the day when I fire something up I

1401
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:12,559
want it to taste good all the way down

1402
00:54:10,719 --> 00:54:14,639
the joint and purple punch just does not

1403
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:16,400
do that the extract's okay I'm fine with

1404
00:54:14,639 --> 00:54:19,879
the extract but man it's like isn't it a

1405
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:22,200
strawberry tur it is definitely like

1406
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:24,559
strawberryish um dude some of your stuff

1407
00:54:22,199 --> 00:54:28,078

1408
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:30,359
smokes down pretty good it down may you

1409
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:32,160

that's a good one that in fact that cut

1413
00:54:40,599 --> 00:54:44,400
I feel like you guys do that cut Justice

1414
00:54:42,719 --> 00:54:46,719
more than anybody else it comes out the

1415
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:48,280
most candy and it's funny because like

1416
00:54:46,719 --> 00:54:49,879
so I got the cut and I gave it out to a

1417
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:51,960
bunch of my friends and we've all

1418
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:53,000
everybody's grown it pretty much and

1419
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:54,760
I've so I've seen the different

1420
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,838
iterations in different substrates all

1421
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:58,760
these things whatever you guys do it

1422
00:54:56,838 --> 00:55:00,880
comes out candy candy we're probably the

1423
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:02,760
only ones who grow it with mix light you

1424
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:06,599
know yeah in the green houses some

1425
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:08,000
strains just shine with tpin when the

1426
00:55:06,599 --> 00:55:10,440
that one is good and down to the roach

1427
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,519
it tastes like banana candies I know

1428
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:15,039
you're a skittles nut do you think that

1429
00:55:12,519 --> 00:55:17,719
Skittles inside tastes better or

1430
00:55:15,039 --> 00:55:20,558
Skittles outside or in Greenhouse tastes

1431
00:55:17,719 --> 00:55:22,519
better it's so tough cuz I would say

1432
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:24,440
indoor because you gave me skittles from

1433
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:27,480
can and Skittles that you grew indoor

1434
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:30,358
uhuh side by side yeah I don't know the

1435
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:32,358
indoor tasted better it did 100% better

1436
00:55:30,358 --> 00:55:35,358
it it was good don't get me wrong Cana

1437
00:55:32,358 --> 00:55:37,798
Skittles is amazing it's amazing but

1438
00:55:35,358 --> 00:55:40,159
that indoor Skittles it just was so loud

1439
00:55:37,798 --> 00:55:42,440
like mouth coating yeah you smoke it

1440
00:55:40,159 --> 00:55:44,000
it's candy it goes in get that long

1441
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:46,119
finish canons did that too but it was

1442
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,519
just a little louder it was like I mean

1443
00:55:46,119 --> 00:55:50,960
and maybe the the chps are a little

1444
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:52,719
softer on the outdoor uh and it was good

1445
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:54,480
they were both good I would pay full

1446
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:57,519
price I don't even care what they cost

1447
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:59,159
type purchase like I'm I'm super happy

1448
00:55:57,519 --> 00:56:00,880
paying for what stuff is worth when it

1449
00:55:59,159 --> 00:56:02,639
comes down to it because you're buying

1450
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,920
the experience at that point and they

1451
00:56:02,639 --> 00:56:06,639
both give you the experience that you're

1452
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:08,159
looking for yeah so Skittles but

1453
00:56:06,639 --> 00:56:09,440
Skittles and cocoa I'm I'm okay with

1454
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:12,838
Skittles and cocoa I think it tastes

1455
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:15,039
amazing yeah well weed that's grown well

1456
00:56:12,838 --> 00:56:18,798
is going to taste amazing you know the

1457
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:21,400
substrate honestly is whatever you know

1458
00:56:18,798 --> 00:56:24,000
I've had good tasting no till and I've

1459
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:25,720
had shitty tasting no till and the guy

1460
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,119
and the guy who who grew it still

1461
00:56:25,719 --> 00:56:30,199
bragged about the shitty taste in no

1462
00:56:28,119 --> 00:56:32,280
it's a [ __ ] funny thing but I've had

1463
00:56:30,199 --> 00:56:34,279
good Hydro yeah especially back in the

1464
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:37,200
day even three-part with Hydro grown

1465
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:38,480
really well I don't know about that yeah

1466
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:39,879
chem dog grown back in the day my

1467
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:41,519
friends used to grow [ __ ] three- part

1468
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:44,798
and maybe it was just because that's

1469
00:56:41,519 --> 00:56:46,759
what we had Lucas formula oh yeah but it

1470
00:56:44,798 --> 00:56:49,639
was like back in the day

1471
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:51,119
purple dude some of the stuff grown in

1472
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:52,679
[ __ ] rock wol was cool back in the

1473
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:54,838
day though but I don't know I'm not a

1474
00:56:52,679 --> 00:56:59,159
huge Rock wolf fan personally for flow

1475
00:56:54,838 --> 00:57:01,679
person uh for plants for moms for clones

1476
00:56:59,159 --> 00:57:03,199
I think rockwool is key it's great it's

1477
00:57:01,679 --> 00:57:05,558
a great way to keep things sterile for

1478
00:57:03,199 --> 00:57:08,199
clones oh yeah I love it for clones it's

1479
00:57:05,559 --> 00:57:10,280
so easy you just can't overwater it you

1480
00:57:08,199 --> 00:57:11,598
know I always try to tell my guys they

1481
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:13,839
like pick up the trays they're like it's

1482
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:15,640
light I'm like [ __ ] touch it yeah if

1483
00:57:13,838 --> 00:57:18,798
it if it's still got moisture in it it's

1484
00:57:15,639 --> 00:57:21,519
too wet it's too wet right they're like

1485
00:57:18,798 --> 00:57:25,358
no it's dry I'll take a cube out squeeze

1486
00:57:21,519 --> 00:57:27,318
it you know water's just like totally I

1487
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:29,838
know it's felt dry but it's really not

1488
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:31,599
dry yeah when you get so used to working

1489
00:57:29,838 --> 00:57:34,159
with rockwool and the weight that it

1490
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:35,559
should be it's real easy after a certain

1491
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:37,960
point once you've been working with rock

1492
00:57:35,559 --> 00:57:39,319
wool it's really easy to gauge I've

1493
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:42,280
never flowered in

1494
00:57:39,318 --> 00:57:44,279
it really yeah no I've never flowered in

1495
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:47,640
rockwool I've always just done soil what

1496
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:49,119
about cocoa I've done cocoa twice yeah

1497
00:57:47,639 --> 00:57:51,558
so I didn't like growing in Cocoa for

1498
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:55,280
the longest time because my partner that

1499
00:57:51,559 --> 00:57:56,839
we did freaking a garage in back in the

1500
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:59,400
day he's like oh going to try this stuff

1501
00:57:56,838 --> 00:58:01,038
called Coco it comes in these blocks and

1502
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:03,039
these blocks you have to like spray them

1503
00:58:01,039 --> 00:58:04,680
with water put them in a pool break them

1504
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:06,359
don't you have the pH balance them too

1505
00:58:04,679 --> 00:58:08,879
dude you have to yeah I you water them

1506
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:11,318
with pH balance water and nutrients and

1507
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:13,640
nutrients and nutrients we did that and

1508
00:58:11,318 --> 00:58:15,920
but after doing I think it was for 300

1509
00:58:13,639 --> 00:58:17,838
something plants it was a lot of work

1510
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:19,559
and I was like [ __ ] this soil is way

1511
00:58:17,838 --> 00:58:21,199
better anyway like how can you go wrong

1512
00:58:19,559 --> 00:58:23,640
with soil so I was stuck on soil I had

1513
00:58:21,199 --> 00:58:25,519
the soil argument was like [ __ ] Coco but

1514
00:58:23,639 --> 00:58:28,118
I've done that with LEDs too I hated

1515
00:58:25,519 --> 00:58:30,798
LEDs and in 2012 it's like garbage I

1516
00:58:28,119 --> 00:58:32,318
hate LEDs I like LEDs now but I like

1517
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:33,719
adjustable Spectrum it just depends on

1518
00:58:32,318 --> 00:58:35,759
the LED I think there's some good ones

1519
00:58:33,719 --> 00:58:38,199
on the market uh they're better than

1520
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:40,200
they were in 2012 yeah with the purple

1521
00:58:38,199 --> 00:58:42,078
LEDs you know they're still expensive as

1522
00:58:40,199 --> 00:58:44,279
[ __ ] they're still expensive but like

1523
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:46,599
and HPS gives you a great product yeah

1524
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:48,798
you prefer HPS with CMH is that right

1525
00:58:46,599 --> 00:58:52,280
yeah I like I like the mixed Spectrum

1526
00:58:48,798 --> 00:58:55,838
HPS with CMH and I don't usually like to

1527
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:58,160
turn my um gavitas past like 700 Watts I

1528
00:58:55,838 --> 00:59:00,199
think th000 watts is actually like a lot

1529
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:02,239
for a plant especially you know in a

1530
00:59:00,199 --> 00:59:03,919
greenhouse say the Sun comes out yeah

1531
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:06,318
and you got your thousands on man it

1532
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:08,079
only takes a second to cook them out so

1533
00:59:06,318 --> 00:59:09,440
I just like to definitely you still use

1534
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:13,720
gavitas in the greenhous still use

1535
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:15,720
gavitas we we bought like 400 Lux and

1536
00:59:13,719 --> 00:59:18,919
then the two weeks later they went out

1537
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:21,199
of business so as those go out you know

1538
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:22,119
the pile of Lux is getting bigger so I

1539
00:59:21,199 --> 00:59:24,118
don't know we're going to have to

1540
00:59:22,119 --> 00:59:26,680
eventually like figure out a different

1541
00:59:24,119 --> 00:59:30,400
one yeah do you remember going to the

1542
00:59:26,679 --> 00:59:33,919
industry parties they used to be so like

1543
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:36,440
fun and everyone was like and now

1544
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,760
they're just like 15 years ago industry

1545
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:39,679
parties were different cups were

1546
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:41,520
different yeah you know but when you

1547
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:44,239
have it new and fresh and it's like

1548
00:59:41,519 --> 00:59:45,639
there's still that passion there's still

1549
00:59:44,239 --> 00:59:46,919
passion don't get me wrong there's

1550
00:59:45,639 --> 00:59:48,159

1552
00:59:48,159 --> 00:59:52,519
there but it's just different yeah yeah

1553
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:54,720
I mean but I do remember when outdoor

1554
00:59:52,519 --> 00:59:56,559
was more expensive than indoor you do

1555
00:59:54,719 --> 00:59:59,838
yeah that was in the 90s it was was like

1556
00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:02,160
yeah $4,500 a pound for outdoor wow yeah

1557
00:59:59,838 --> 01:00:05,078
I mean I even remember going up to Mendo

1558
01:00:02,159 --> 01:00:07,399
with my buddy Steve and driving and he

1559
01:00:05,079 --> 01:00:10,160
paid me a couple ounces to go up to

1560
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:11,400
Mendo drive him up there and we had this

1561
01:00:10,159 --> 01:00:13,199
is before cell phones but there was

1562
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:15,720
pagers or whatever but we had to meet

1563
01:00:13,199 --> 01:00:19,199
this guy at a specific time at this this

1564
01:00:15,719 --> 01:00:21,199
parking lot and uh he would [ __ ]

1565
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:22,838
flashl and we'd walk towards the light

1566
01:00:21,199 --> 01:00:24,358
or whatever with the money and then he'd

1567
01:00:22,838 --> 01:00:26,639
come up behind you and then give you the

1568
01:00:24,358 --> 01:00:29,719

1572
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:38,119

1578
01:00:47,559 --> 01:00:52,359
all from yeah Purple Kush is probably

1579
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,719
been around since the 70s or 80s so

1580
01:00:52,358 --> 01:00:56,400
purple kushes but there's so many

1581
01:00:53,719 --> 01:00:58,159
different purple cushies I think uh

1582
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,838
Tricom Technologies they have their own

1583
01:00:58,159 --> 01:01:01,159
special purple cush but there's other

1584
01:00:59,838 --> 01:01:02,798
purple kushes that I've seen on the

1585
01:01:01,159 --> 01:01:04,519
market that you know there was one

1586
01:01:02,798 --> 01:01:08,480
circulating uh clones of it were

1587
01:01:04,519 --> 01:01:12,639
circulating in the 90s and it was like

1588
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:15,440
Afghan like purple afghan [ __ ] super

1589
01:01:12,639 --> 01:01:18,159
pungent super amazing did it taste like

1590
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:22,280
that grape flavor it didn't taste as

1591
01:01:18,159 --> 01:01:24,480
grapey it was more gassy and Funky Man

1592
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:25,920
my purple cush was like grapey yeah I

1593
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,280
mean there was grapey for sure there was

1594
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:30,440
grapey purple cush is out there

1595
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:33,200
definitely 100% uh I do like grape turps

1596
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:35,639
I always kind of like grape or floral I

1597
01:01:33,199 --> 01:01:38,199

1598
01:01:35,639 --> 01:01:40,639
of my favorites and always will be Urkel

1599
01:01:38,199 --> 01:01:42,118
was heat and then what was s's lavender

1600
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:45,000
you remember that one that one was so

1601
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:48,880
bomb it was such a [ __ ] to grow God it

1602
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:51,159
was good dude that was some bio Cana y

1603
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:52,880
man that was the mix back in the day

1604
01:01:51,159 --> 01:01:55,078
some bio can I haven't heard that in 10

1605
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:58,039
years I'm telling you though man the bio

1606
01:01:55,079 --> 01:02:01,240
Cana lavender that [ __ ] came out fire

1607
01:01:58,039 --> 01:02:02,520
yeah s had one called s's a plus s A+

1608
01:02:01,239 --> 01:02:05,558
that was going around that was a short

1609
01:02:02,519 --> 01:02:08,838
leafy plant that was the most pungent

1610
01:02:05,559 --> 01:02:10,359
loudest like funky small and squatty

1611
01:02:08,838 --> 01:02:12,880
right with big leaves small with big

1612
01:02:10,358 --> 01:02:15,119
leaves super didn't like water didn't

1613
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:17,079
like water that's the one yeah that was

1614
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:18,640
the one and I guess they called it Rock

1615
01:02:17,079 --> 01:02:20,278
Bud too was the name of but so many plus

1616
01:02:18,639 --> 01:02:22,679
is where where we had it my buddy gave

1617
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:25,119
me some to grow and I only grew it one

1618
01:02:22,679 --> 01:02:26,558
time I loved it I wish I had more seeds

1619
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:29,278
of it it's not the same if you get it

1620
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:30,720
because I since bought seeds of it it's

1621
01:02:29,278 --> 01:02:33,358
not the same as the cut that was going

1622
01:02:30,719 --> 01:02:35,118
around but still amazing yeah my buddy

1623
01:02:33,358 --> 01:02:37,719
who was growing that he was the one who

1624
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:40,079
was um growing a lot of the Seattle sour

1625
01:02:37,719 --> 01:02:43,159
back in the day too he had that Seattle

1626
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:44,880
sour the Tang did did you guys did you

1627
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:46,118
guys ever smoke the Tang I know a little

1628
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:48,000
bit about the Tang I got some

1629
01:02:46,119 --> 01:02:51,278
interesting stories for sure Tang was

1630
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:53,159
good it was going around so so the Tang

1631
01:02:51,278 --> 01:02:55,159
there was one tang that was bred by

1632
01:02:53,159 --> 01:02:56,440
canado he took credit for online but we

1633
01:02:55,159 --> 01:02:58,199
had our own Tang

1634
01:02:56,440 --> 01:03:00,039
that I don't think was any relation to

1635
01:02:58,199 --> 01:03:02,439
but it was like powdery Tang it smelled

1636
01:03:00,039 --> 01:03:05,680
like [ __ ] powdery Tang what it grow

1637
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:07,358
like uh it grew more like a sativa than

1638
01:03:05,679 --> 01:03:08,759
Inda it was like long flowering like a

1639
01:03:07,358 --> 01:03:13,119
10 we maybe

1640
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:14,880
nine big plants did it throw bananas I

1641
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:17,039
don't remember it threw on bananas but I

1642
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:19,400
remember the smell of it was like Tang

1643
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:21,440
it smelled like powdery Tang not like

1644
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:23,920
mixed into but it smelled like that

1645
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:25,358
powder red hair red hairs lots of red

1646
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:27,039
hairs lots of red hairs yeah yeah that's

1647
01:03:25,358 --> 01:03:28,880
the Tang that I remember yeah me too and

1648
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:30,278
then I'm pretty sure karado had a Tang

1649
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:32,440
back around

1650
01:03:30,278 --> 01:03:35,278
2012 he did a lot of [ __ ] badass

1651
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:37,039
crosses back then he did yeah cool good

1652
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:39,480
genetics man there's so many interesting

1653
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:41,359
things Romulan was H dude I love R

1654
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:43,599
Romulan from back in the day yeah you

1655
01:03:41,358 --> 01:03:44,719
don't ever hear about that anymore a

1656
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:46,000
little bit I feel like people it's

1657
01:03:44,719 --> 01:03:47,759
coming back a little bit my buddy

1658
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,639
brooksie who was on the show he's

1659
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:51,920
breeding Romulan into some stuff really

1660
01:03:50,639 --> 01:03:53,960
um yeah and I just saw someone posting

1661
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:56,599
about the Romulan S1 Jake sells Romulan

1662
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:59,400
s1's from Romulan genetic

1663
01:03:56,599 --> 01:04:01,559
cool so that's a good one but yeah

1664
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:02,880
sativas you're going towards sativas too

1665
01:04:01,559 --> 01:04:05,278
yeah I think we're going to end up in

1666
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:07,680
sativa world like maybe a couple years

1667
01:04:05,278 --> 01:04:09,239
from now who knows it's going to be a

1668
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:11,278
little bit of everything and and the

1669
01:04:09,239 --> 01:04:13,798
truth is honestly if you ask me my

1670
01:04:11,278 --> 01:04:16,639
favorite thing to smoke it's candy

1671
01:04:13,798 --> 01:04:18,519
gas I still just want to start doing

1672
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:20,239
other things because you know who knows

1673
01:04:18,519 --> 01:04:22,318
what's out there try something new with

1674
01:04:20,239 --> 01:04:24,078
what I love and then maybe it'll create

1675
01:04:22,318 --> 01:04:28,199
something else bacon grease I'm looking

1676
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:28,200

serious you go there ask Jason he's got

1684
01:04:46,239 --> 01:04:49,519
it growing a lot of times or when he

1685

does all you got to go check it out it

1686
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:54,119

01:04:58,119 --> 01:05:02,680
[ __ ] man yeah I mean the sky's the limit

1691
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:06,400
though

1692
01:05:02,679 --> 01:05:08,919
imagine with what we've seen so far you

1693
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:10,880
can really go anywhere with turps like

1694
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:12,680
the sky is the limit now it's just a

1695
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:14,039
matter of breeding towards specific

1696
01:05:12,679 --> 01:05:16,159
things to to where you get those

1697
01:05:14,039 --> 01:05:18,000
expressions Plum I've seen Plum I've

which but it was like he had some really

1710
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,199
really amazing genetics back in the day

1711
01:05:41,719 --> 01:05:47,679
that he was working with so sour diesel

1712

more than Skittles sour skittles you got

1721
01:06:06,278 --> 01:06:10,798
a pound of each you can choose one what

1722
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:12,400
are you going to walk away with if it's

1723
01:06:10,798 --> 01:06:16,480
this if it's the sour from back in the

1724
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:18,599
day all day there's no not even it was

1725
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:20,119
like a cat piss and sour then we could

1726
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:21,798
talk maybe I'd go back and forth i'

1727
01:06:20,119 --> 01:06:24,039
would get the cat piss if it's the but

1728
01:06:21,798 --> 01:06:26,318
the sour that was the real Sour they

1729
01:06:24,039 --> 01:06:28,079
would that would just you open the bag

1730
01:06:26,318 --> 01:06:29,558
and it would just hit you in the face

1731
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:30,640
and it the buds would stick to the bag

1732
01:06:29,559 --> 01:06:33,000
you could stick them to the window

1733
01:06:30,639 --> 01:06:34,679
they'd be so gooey yeah I love that

1734
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,318
that's the one test yeah if you can

1735
01:06:34,679 --> 01:06:39,719
stick it to the window with your thumb

1736
01:06:36,318 --> 01:06:41,358
my wife hates that [ __ ] dude she hates

1737
01:06:39,719 --> 01:06:42,598
it dude that's the test though I stick

1738
01:06:41,358 --> 01:06:46,358
it to the wall and she's like you're

1739
01:06:42,599 --> 01:06:48,318
[ __ ] up the wall keep sticking we on

1740
01:06:46,358 --> 01:06:49,880
it yeah I mean that's the test if you if

1741
01:06:48,318 --> 01:06:52,759
it'll stick to the wall stick to the

1742
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:54,440
glass good to go you know it's fire yeah

1743
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:56,160
so where do you think you think we're

1744
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:58,159
going towards sativa are you just going

1745
01:06:56,159 --> 01:07:00,798
to go to SW sativas and say [ __ ]

1746
01:06:58,159 --> 01:07:03,798
everybody that's that's just what I want

1747
01:07:00,798 --> 01:07:06,318
to do what like I was kind of saying

1748
01:07:03,798 --> 01:07:09,559
like I want to I want a breed to be more

1749
01:07:06,318 --> 01:07:11,599
creative I guess yeah in what I'm doing

1750
01:07:09,559 --> 01:07:14,278
of opposed to like before when I was

1751
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:16,599
kind of just making what everyone else

1752
01:07:14,278 --> 01:07:19,559
was and just following Trends I don't

1753
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:21,039
see a trend of taking the things that

1754
01:07:19,559 --> 01:07:22,559
candy gas that you like and then

1755
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:26,119
Crossing it to all these other weird

1756
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:27,720
sativas I mean and I don't but you know

1757

1758
01:07:27,719 --> 01:07:31,000
lot of other people to know like what

1759
01:07:29,358 --> 01:07:32,798

amount of like money that's there and

1781

money that's spent on these girls money

1782
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:34,838
that's really spent you know like my my

1783
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:35,838
farm we built like by hand and [ __ ] you

1784
01:08:34,838 --> 01:08:39,000
know

1785
01:08:35,838 --> 01:08:41,719
like we built our farm you know we we

1786
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:43,759
know the ins and outs we know our

1787
01:08:41,719 --> 01:08:46,679
electrical panels like I said Tim built

1788
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:49,238
our controllers like our farm was built

1789
01:08:46,679 --> 01:08:51,520
by us by hand by scratch scratch you

1790
01:08:49,238 --> 01:08:53,278
know once we got enough money we got

1791
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:55,880
another one once we got enough money we

1792
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:57,239
got another one you know like you didn't

1793
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:59,400
take on a bunch of investment money you

1794
01:08:57,238 --> 01:09:02,079
guys did it all the right way I think

1795
01:08:59,399 --> 01:09:02,920
all the right way what we knew you know

1796
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:05,359
which

1797
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:08,239
is what we knew we just followed our

1798
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:10,520
hearts you know in an industry that's

1799
01:09:08,238 --> 01:09:11,879
right now just overcrowded with Chads it

1800
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:15,040
seems like

1801
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:17,640
but yeah well that's gonna come and go

1802
01:09:15,039 --> 01:09:21,399
you think I sure

1803
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:22,719
hope I sure hope I think that uh yeah

1804
01:09:21,399 --> 01:09:25,920
there is a bunch of chats and there's a

1805
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:27,359
lot of misinformed people and people

1806
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:29,399
that have never tried quality but the

1807
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:31,679
more you expose people to things like

1808
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:33,599
quality the more they appreciate quality

1809
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:36,079
and then they want quality yeah that's

1810
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:38,400
true but the same at the same time

1811
01:09:36,079 --> 01:09:40,278
people can only get what they can afford

1812
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:42,479
and right now you know I don't really

1813
01:09:40,279 --> 01:09:45,000

1851
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:12,520
to myself are you about to buy an a hash

1852
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:15,158
plant and he was like dude and I was

1853
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:19,400

1854
01:11:15,158 --> 01:11:22,879
it I soon as I pulled it out I was like

1855
01:11:19,399 --> 01:11:25,439
[ __ ] I broke it up I I rolled it

1856
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:28,000
I lit it I took two hits threw it out

1857
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:30,919
the [ __ ] window you

1858
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:33,000
know God damn it he got me on some hash

1859
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:35,880
plant got hash planted I got hash

1860
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:37,439
plantedit I knew better yeah but you

1861
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:39,239
know the bud tenders are there all day I

1862
01:11:37,439 --> 01:11:40,919
was maybe it was a fresh batch of hash

1863
01:11:39,238 --> 01:11:42,599
plant and I was about to experience

1864
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:44,239
something that I'd never experienced

1865
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:46,239
before totally you never know it's like

1866
01:11:44,238 --> 01:11:47,879
white widow sounds really exciting and

1867
01:11:46,238 --> 01:11:49,599
you know typically White Widow isn't

1868
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:51,800
what I would normally get from like if

1869
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:53,159
it's real white widow I don't get

1870
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:54,920
excited about white widow no I think

1871
01:11:53,158 --> 01:11:57,079
it's a good breeder I think for for

1872
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:58,399
Europe companies the White Widow and we

1873
01:11:57,079 --> 01:12:00,000
did have a white widow back in the day

1874
01:11:58,399 --> 01:12:02,079
that was fire from the 90s that came out

1875
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:05,319
of Richmond that was like strong and

1876
01:12:02,079 --> 01:12:08,359
pungent but the Widow that I mostly know

1877
01:12:05,319 --> 01:12:09,799
is like very vanilla yeah it vanilla

1878
01:12:08,359 --> 01:12:11,319
everything so you cross it with OG

1879
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:13,600
you're gonna get that's what happened to

1880
01:12:11,319 --> 01:12:16,000
Europe they crossed the real OG genetics

1881
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:17,560
got over there for OG Kush and then

1882
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,359
these some of these seed companies bred

1883
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:22,920
it with White Widow for seed production

1884
01:12:19,359 --> 01:12:24,599
purposes and vilified it and so to me

1885
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:26,199
and you you'd be like that's not OG Kush

1886
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:29,440
but the OG that they knew for a long

1887
01:12:26,198 --> 01:12:31,559
time over there was the vanilla fied

1888
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:35,119
version H the sweet one yeah it was

1889
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:36,679
sweet and not gassy not gassy not what I

1890
01:12:35,119 --> 01:12:39,198
know is OG cush at all same thing even

1891
01:12:36,679 --> 01:12:40,880
the structure wasn't even OG for a while

1892
01:12:39,198 --> 01:12:44,439
and now obviously what's that weak and

1893
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:47,520
brut the structure of OG is is weak and

1894
01:12:44,439 --> 01:12:49,960
and it's very finicky the plan is not

1895
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:52,080
you know it's not something that uh you

1896
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:54,319
can just ignore it basically needs

1897
01:12:52,079 --> 01:12:56,840
support you might overwater you might

1898
01:12:54,319 --> 01:12:58,880
underwater it's it's a problem you know

1899
01:12:56,840 --> 01:13:01,119
you might push it too high and it

1900
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:03,159
[ __ ] Burns it's one of those ones and

1901
01:13:01,119 --> 01:13:05,039
like it had shitty node spacing and it

1902
01:13:03,158 --> 01:13:07,399
wanted to Spaghetti out that was the OG

1903
01:13:05,039 --> 01:13:09,840

01:14:27,079 --> 01:14:31,880
as far as TPS the blue dream I'm talking

1939
01:14:29,158 --> 01:14:35,279
about too has no super silver haze

1940
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:38,159
traits whatsoever blueberry it it's very

1941
01:14:35,279 --> 01:14:40,039
strong on the blueberry nice tight buds

1942
01:14:38,158 --> 01:14:42,359
I see a lot of people with these other

1943
01:14:40,039 --> 01:14:44,399
things they call blue dream and I'm like

1944
01:14:42,359 --> 01:14:46,359
that ain't [ __ ] it man if it's not

1945
01:14:44,399 --> 01:14:47,920
nice and tight it's not the one you want

1946
01:14:46,359 --> 01:14:50,039
yeah it Stacks it

1947
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:51,920
Stacks you can tell just when it's

1948
01:14:50,039 --> 01:14:53,800
vegging the smell yeah and the the

1949
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:55,840
leaves are very specific too the way it

1950
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:58,400
has thinner leaves

1951
01:14:55,840 --> 01:15:00,199
uh and it just grows super strong and

1952
01:14:58,399 --> 01:15:02,759
like that was the thing I liked about it

1953
01:15:00,198 --> 01:15:05,399
the most is basically it was super

1954
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:06,960
vigorous it didn't matter you always

1955
01:15:05,399 --> 01:15:08,879
felt good growing it and it never gave

1956
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:10,800
you problems like yeah dude it would

1957
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:11,960
just Crush too it would crush over two

1958
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:14,119
pounds of light back in the day which

1959
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:16,079
was the goal right so I think if you had

1960
01:15:14,119 --> 01:15:17,679
a th watt bulb and you hit two pounds of

1961
01:15:16,079 --> 01:15:20,000
light you were crushing it like that

1962
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:22,158
you're ready to retire and six exactly

1963
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:25,479
you're like I'm good man especially with

1964
01:15:22,158 --> 01:15:27,799
the blue dream and 07 and by2 what was

1965
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:29,399
it like 08 you're like I can't sell this

1966
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:31,560
[ __ ] the blue it turned into the blue

1967
01:15:29,399 --> 01:15:34,039
nightmare you had like one year of just

1968
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:36,120
like thriving with that one dude that

1969
01:15:34,039 --> 01:15:38,359
was the blue nightmare yeah I mean I

1970
01:15:36,119 --> 01:15:40,679
remember those packs just sat man not

1971
01:15:38,359 --> 01:15:43,519
having money because of I couldn't sell

1972
01:15:40,679 --> 01:15:45,440
them I just sit on them it was it was a

1973
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:47,840
harvest season and there was outdoor but

1974
01:15:45,439 --> 01:15:49,279
like the cut had got out to everybody

1975
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:50,360
and so the guys that were crushing it

1976
01:15:49,279 --> 01:15:52,359
for a long time thought they were going

1977
01:15:50,359 --> 01:15:53,960
to continue crushing it like myself we

1978
01:15:52,359 --> 01:15:56,639
were like thinking oh yeah we're going

1979
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:59,279
to crush it and [ __ ] harvested it and

1980
01:15:56,639 --> 01:16:02,480
then I even had the patients Choice

1981
01:15:59,279 --> 01:16:04,479
collect PCC in Berkeley so in Berkeley

1982
01:16:02,479 --> 01:16:06,919
PCC had promised to buy five pounds so I

1983
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:09,198
knew I'd have money for Christmas I go

1984
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:11,199
in there show them the flower and

1985
01:16:09,198 --> 01:16:13,319
they're like sorry we can't buy it we

1986
01:16:11,198 --> 01:16:14,439
just got some for 1,800 and this is when

1987
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:16,880
we was

1988
01:16:14,439 --> 01:16:18,399
3200 and so I show them the stuff and

1989
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:20,199
I'm like dude you guys said you're were

1990
01:16:18,399 --> 01:16:23,559
G to buy five and they said we can't we

1991
01:16:20,198 --> 01:16:24,919
just bought some for 18 basically that

1992
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:28,280
you know I was like can I see it they

1993
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:30,359
showed it to me it it was pretty good it

1994
01:16:28,279 --> 01:16:33,479
wasn't as good as mine was but it was

1995
01:16:30,359 --> 01:16:36,039
comparable in the sense that 18 to spend

1996
01:16:33,479 --> 01:16:37,439
that kind of money you know so people

1997
01:16:36,039 --> 01:16:39,079
are always about Bargains and making

1998
01:16:37,439 --> 01:16:40,919
money for themselves so did you get the

1999
01:16:39,079 --> 01:16:42,559
Christmas money dude I did not get the

2000
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:44,880
Christmas we had to borrow money from my

2001
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:47,000
parents that year like literally it was

2002

[ __ ] yeah we had to borrow money for

2004
01:16:49,399 --> 01:16:52,279
Christmas presents it was one of the

2005
01:16:50,639 --> 01:16:53,960
roughest years that I remember it was

2006
01:16:52,279 --> 01:16:56,840
the blue nightmare is what we called it

2007
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:59,399
yeah I did I was lucky enough the first

2008
01:16:56,840 --> 01:17:02,400
year whole backyard full of Blue Dream

2009
01:16:59,399 --> 01:17:04,759
the next year I split it up I did the

2010
01:17:02,399 --> 01:17:06,079
the berry white and then the humble ogre

2011
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:08,199
did you ever get I remember the berry

2012
01:17:06,079 --> 01:17:10,479
white yeah the berry white was [ __ ]

2013
01:17:08,198 --> 01:17:12,719
great for outdoor but it tasted like

2014
01:17:10,479 --> 01:17:16,238
straight soil if you do it right it's

2015
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:18,319
the most dirt like dirt taste you know

2016
01:17:16,238 --> 01:17:20,079
and I thought it was fabulous man

2017
01:17:18,319 --> 01:17:22,198
everyone bought it and was stoked on it

2018
01:17:20,079 --> 01:17:24,079
till they smoked it and then the next

2019
01:17:22,198 --> 01:17:27,519
year everyone was like no we don't want

2020
01:17:24,079 --> 01:17:29,479
no more Barry White dude seriously yeah

2021
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:31,880
I mean Barry White had its year for sure

2022
01:17:29,479 --> 01:17:34,479
it had the one yeah it had the one

2023
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:36,239
year so yeah good stuff though I mean

2024
01:17:34,479 --> 01:17:37,799
there's been so many different genetics

2025
01:17:36,238 --> 01:17:40,638
that were grown did you ever grow like

2026
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:44,360
or see the aota that was up in that was

2027
01:17:40,639 --> 01:17:47,639
like Sonoma Mendo that was good all the

2028
01:17:44,359 --> 01:17:50,238
above dude and now we're all buot of

2029
01:17:47,639 --> 01:17:54,199
yeah little Skittles Skittles gelato

2030
01:17:50,238 --> 01:17:55,919
Skittles yeah candy yep and color well

2031
01:17:54,198 --> 01:17:58,759
how how do you feel about about color

2032
01:17:55,920 --> 01:18:01,119
what's your opinion on that I feel like

2033
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:02,840
it it doesn't matter even a little bit

2034
01:18:01,119 --> 01:18:04,880
the only thing that matters about color

2035
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:07,079
is those packs sell more to me

2036
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:09,319
personally so when it comes to making

2037
01:18:07,079 --> 01:18:12,840
like different genetics I'd like them to

2038
01:18:09,319 --> 01:18:15,359
be purple but as far as things that I've

2039
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:18,400
found in the last couple years have not

2040
01:18:15,359 --> 01:18:21,079
been purple and your [ __ ] bomb you

2041
01:18:18,399 --> 01:18:22,559
know the end of the day what sells me

2042
01:18:21,079 --> 01:18:26,238
when I'm picking something is when I'm

2043
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:29,159
smoking the joint and I'm like [ __ ] yeah

2044
01:18:26,238 --> 01:18:31,799
like when you pick a winner dude you

2045
01:18:29,158 --> 01:18:35,839
keep looking back at it like after every

2046
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:38,159
hit like holy [ __ ] this is hot I can't

2047
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:40,560
believe I'm [ __ ] getting these turps

2048
01:18:38,158 --> 01:18:43,000
right now like you know you let someone

2049
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:46,440
else hit it and they're like oh you're

2050
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:48,520
like back to me bro cuz I got one plant

2051
01:18:46,439 --> 01:18:52,319

2053
01:18:52,319 --> 01:18:56,359

2054
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:57,920

was could could have been my Gaba goul

2060

things in z z you just got a veg good

2074
01:19:43,158 --> 01:19:46,920
you know you give it an extra two weeks

2075
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:49,279
and it'll eventually just start taking

2076
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:52,440
water like everything else I got this

2077

that [ __ ] is a pain in the ass and it is

2084
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:12,880

2091
01:20:25,158 --> 01:20:29,119

2093
01:20:29,119 --> 01:20:34,559
pen the pen will be good but it the be

2094
01:20:32,319 --> 01:20:37,719
it didn't squish for nothing yeah you

2095
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:40,480
know like when we squished it I was like

2096
01:20:37,719 --> 01:20:43,960
the [ __ ] kind of return is this and when

2097
01:20:40,479 --> 01:20:46,678
it did squeeze it like the turps almost

2098
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:49,760
separated from it it didn't come out

2099
01:20:46,679 --> 01:20:52,840
like a normal ringu it came out more

2100
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:55,079
liquidy yeah and you know was a darker

2101
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:58,520
in color but just kind of like it was

2102
01:20:55,079 --> 01:21:01,880
more of like a water yeah I've never

2103
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:04,880
ever seen anything squish water out like

2104
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:07,239
crazy you just smoked the sap it was so

2105
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:08,960
[ __ ] bomb yeah you know but I don't

2106
01:21:07,238 --> 01:21:11,399
think you could sell that everyone wants

2107
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:14,679
like really beautiful rosin cuz you know

2108
01:21:11,399 --> 01:21:16,719
totally but this [ __ ] was screaming dog

2109
01:21:14,679 --> 01:21:19,880
yeah you know you smear it all over your

2110
01:21:16,719 --> 01:21:21,039
joint or whatever pops yeah super loud

2111
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:23,600
super

2112
01:21:21,039 --> 01:21:26,639
loud yeah I mean there there's still

2113
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:28,960
some loud cross to be made for sure some

2114
01:21:26,639 --> 01:21:30,520
loud candy crosses yeah there's so many

2115
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:32,480
directions with candy that you can still

2116
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:35,480
go that people haven't gone before too

2117
01:21:32,479 --> 01:21:37,718
you think I do think 100% I think the

2118
01:21:35,479 --> 01:21:40,359
name might be taken but yeah you know

2119
01:21:37,719 --> 01:21:42,158
show me some peppermint patties you know

2120
01:21:40,359 --> 01:21:44,079
like something like that do you think

2121
01:21:42,158 --> 01:21:46,599
that's an Avenue that still should be

2122
01:21:44,079 --> 01:21:49,519
explored seed wise like pheno hunting

2123
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:50,960
more candy I think there's potential for

2124
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:53,080
everything and we have somebody doing

2125
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:54,679
and then there's guys hunting washers

2126
01:21:53,079 --> 01:21:56,000
and there's guys hunting this and

2127
01:21:54,679 --> 01:21:57,840
there's guys hunting sativas so there's

2128
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:00,439
a market for everything but I think

2129
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:02,440
candy hasn't fully been exploited yet

2130
01:22:00,439 --> 01:22:05,039
fully it's been exploited but I guess

2131
01:22:02,439 --> 01:22:07,559
what I'm saying is I've worked candy so

2132
01:22:05,039 --> 01:22:09,519
long that I want to just try to get

2133
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:11,159
something else you should because then

2134
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:13,199
you'll get fresh and you can go back to

2135
01:22:11,158 --> 01:22:15,839
Candy if you want or I'll probably will

2136
01:22:13,198 --> 01:22:19,399
end up or maybe going funky with candy

2137
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:21,400
who knows who knows who knows like those

2138
01:22:19,399 --> 01:22:23,479
J Jelly Bellies they're like barf and

2139
01:22:21,399 --> 01:22:25,319
vomit and all those ones you could do

2140
01:22:23,479 --> 01:22:27,879
you ever put those in the the good pack

2141
01:22:25,319 --> 01:22:29,519
you throw you throw 20 in the good pack

2142
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:31,800
and then you know everyone's eating the

2143
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:34,280
good ones that's what you teach your

2144
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:37,639

2149
01:22:43,198 --> 01:22:48,559

2162
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:19,920
[ __ ] weed in

01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:24,639
yeah so like you

2165
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:26,239

01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:29,239
comment earlier but honestly like if

2167
01:23:26,238 --> 01:23:31,479
you're if you're pushing right now good

still in it and you're still in it hats

2171
01:23:36,158 --> 01:23:40,319
off hats off exactly because literally

2172
01:23:39,119 --> 01:23:41,800
if you're still in it fighting that

2173
01:23:40,319 --> 01:23:43,279
means that you think there's something

2174
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:45,800
worth fighting for and that's a good

2175
01:23:43,279 --> 01:23:47,960
thing that exactly right you know the

2176
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:50,199
next five years is going to [ __ ] say

2177
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:52,960
it all though cuz I've watched so many

2178
01:23:50,198 --> 01:23:54,839
great Growers [ __ ] tap out yeah

2179
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:56,520
especially in the last two years people

2180
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:58,319
going into back I have a friend went

2181
01:23:56,520 --> 01:24:00,000
just found out yesterday he's gone back

2182
01:23:58,319 --> 01:24:02,079
into construction you you know and

2183
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,639
there's people doing whatever and

2184
01:24:02,079 --> 01:24:06,319
there's nothing wrong with that too no

2185
01:24:03,639 --> 01:24:09,800
not but uh you know it's it's tough it's

2186
01:24:06,319 --> 01:24:12,039
super competitive it's super expensive

2187
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:14,079
you know the's not expensive your buddy

2188
01:24:12,039 --> 01:24:16,439
who did you know going back into

2189
01:24:14,079 --> 01:24:19,238
carpentry more than likely he did

2190
01:24:16,439 --> 01:24:20,879
carpentry before he started gr cannabis

2191
01:24:19,238 --> 01:24:24,638
I've been growing cannabis since I was

2192
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:26,359
19 I'm 41 this is the only job I've ever

2193
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:29,239
had the thought of me picking up a

2194
01:24:26,359 --> 01:24:31,198
[ __ ] Hammer at 42 yeah ain't going to

2195
01:24:29,238 --> 01:24:34,439
happen right you know what I'm saying so

2196
01:24:31,198 --> 01:24:36,719
I better make this [ __ ] work right I

2197
01:24:34,439 --> 01:24:38,919
feel you right it's going to work though

2198
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:41,880
it is going to work you know and and the

2199
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:45,079
thing too about cannabis is it always EB

2200
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:48,079
and flows like the plant itself EB and

2201
01:24:45,079 --> 01:24:51,319
flows from beginning till end like it

2202
01:24:48,079 --> 01:24:54,439
pulsates you know it drinks water as a

2203
01:24:51,319 --> 01:24:56,319
pulse it breathes as a pulse it shuts

2204
01:24:54,439 --> 01:24:59,000
off and on like a pulse and this

2205
01:24:56,319 --> 01:25:01,599
industry is a pulse too I remember when

2206
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:04,600
I was young like Bush shut down the

2207
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:07,480
borders in01 after the terrorist bombed

2208
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:09,679
you know [ __ ] them Towers yeah and

2209
01:25:07,479 --> 01:25:12,279
and I was like oh my God what do I do I

2210
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:14,079
can't get the Canadian anymore yeah so I

2211
01:25:12,279 --> 01:25:16,039
started growing weed you know so it

2212
01:25:14,079 --> 01:25:18,760
evolved to that you know from that

2213
01:25:16,039 --> 01:25:20,519
because I was do you remember droughts

2214
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:22,679
that used to be a thing there was so if

2215
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:24,600
you don't know what a Dr drought like it

2216
01:25:22,679 --> 01:25:27,039
happened every year come August in

2217
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:28,960
September everyone's scrapping for [ __ ]

2218
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:33,000
so tell these people what a drought is

2219
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:36,880
back in the day weed would run dry so

2220
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:40,079
all the packs that you'd have would be

2221
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:42,600
gone your dealer would be gone no one

2222
01:25:40,079 --> 01:25:45,319
would have anything between what was it

2223
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:46,800
July August September because hot months

2224
01:25:45,319 --> 01:25:48,279
were dry months a lot of times because

2225
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:50,279
there wasn't people weren't banging

2226
01:25:48,279 --> 01:25:51,679
depths out that much anymore yeah

2227
01:25:50,279 --> 01:25:53,960
outdoor and depths and it was like

2228
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:55,279
circled around that cycle there was

2229
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:56,600
indoor

2230
01:25:55,279 --> 01:25:58,198
sometimes You' hit indoor but like a lot

2231
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:59,239
of times it would sell out and then

2232
01:25:58,198 --> 01:26:02,118
there' be times where you couldn't get

2233
01:25:59,238 --> 01:26:04,359
it from anybody anyone you smoke resin

2234
01:26:02,118 --> 01:26:06,559
exactly you you just would run out and

2235
01:26:04,359 --> 01:26:09,319
then the [ __ ] that would come back in

2236
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:11,320
would get bought out so fast the price

2237
01:26:09,319 --> 01:26:13,439
would go up to something stupid where

2238
01:26:11,319 --> 01:26:16,198
everyone would be competing with the

2239
01:26:13,439 --> 01:26:18,279
same mids at best you know and try to

2240
01:26:16,198 --> 01:26:20,198
like the money would just it'd be

2241
01:26:18,279 --> 01:26:22,519
[ __ ] gone you'd be scraping your bong

2242
01:26:20,198 --> 01:26:25,719
to get high yeah it was people did that

2243
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:27,600

2244
01:26:25,719 --> 01:26:29,920
I have friends I I'm not saying that I

2245

2251
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:46,000
you put the vodka in and then you do

2252
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:50,159
shots of bong water that's nasty yeah he

2253
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:52,960
mix it with orange so remember soie yeah

2254

making a great product right now um one

2266
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:27,279
that I think is honestly going to take

2267
01:27:25,319 --> 01:27:29,000
over the market it just dropped a couple

2268
01:27:27,279 --> 01:27:32,000
weeks ago and they're already catching

2269
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:35,039
on um one thing that I'm really stoked

2270
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:38,800
about with these CS carts the main thing

2271
01:27:35,039 --> 01:27:42,079
is the access and convenience to taking

2272
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:46,960
a great hit full of the right ratio of

2273
01:27:42,079 --> 01:27:48,840
tpping to thca it [ __ ] puts your dick

2274
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:52,560
in the dirt I probably shouldn't say

2275
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:55,319
that it [ __ ] you up real good

2276
