5
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:15,038
friends from Colorado we've known each

6
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:17,879
other since about

7
00:00:15,038 --> 00:00:19,519
2013 Denver at the cup we met in line

8
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:22,239
when I was waiting to get in that's

9
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:24,079
right yep totally yeah man that's when

10
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:26,719
uh you're at the peak of your High Times

11
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:28,000
experiences and yeah I had been a i'

12
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:29,640
I've been caught up in the chef world

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,960
for a long time at that point cannabis

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,480
had just become legal in Denver and uh

15
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:37,120
the medal side of things and uh so yeah

16
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:38,398
I was really focused on being a chef at

17
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:40,038
that time but I was still picking up

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,160
High Times every once in a while and I

19
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:45,439
remember seeing you quite a bit in there

20
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:49,000
yeah yeah walking into the show I was I

21
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:51,000
kind of got a a little Fanboy I remember

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,238
I was like hey dude that's that's James

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,280
loud you know like what's up man dude it

24
00:00:53,238 --> 00:00:58,358
was it was a well it was an amazing time

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,079
for cannabis in general and then you I

26
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:01,160
could tell you P about week and you seen

27
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,480
me in high times and I had extra

28
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:05,319
wristbands and I think we became friends

29
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:06,640
over that wristband absolutely got you

30
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:08,118
in the show and then we hung out and

31
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,640
then you invited me to your farm cuz you

32
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:12,519
were working at a farm too at the time

33
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,879
yeah we had the big um 43,000 foot

34
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:18,158
underglass in Lafayette Colorado so it

35
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:19,599
was one acre underglass yeah um pretty

36
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,680
sure was the biggest operation in

37
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:23,118
Colorado at the time it was it was a

38
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,840
spectacle too and I think a lot of

39
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:26,759
people had never seen like that was a

40
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,880
big grow back then it was pretty amazing

41
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,759
and impressive and you know I think you

42
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,239
guys struggled in a lot of ways too like

43
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:34,319
in the beginning whoever you know

44
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:36,118
starting out there's always struggle in

45
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:38,078
trying to figure out and navigate how

46
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:39,560
you do it when you go to scale like that

47
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:41,879
absolutely the craziest part was we

48
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,118
found that property and um I believe it

49
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:46,560
they were growing carnations back in the

50
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:48,560
80s and before they moved the Cut Flower

51
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,600
business down to South America yeah so

52
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,478
we found the property and there was

53
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:54,640
literally mocking birds nests in the

54
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:56,759
roofing of the

55
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,280
greenhouse it was completely naked there

56
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,799
was you know no skins on the greenhouse

57
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,680
it had no no heat it had you know

58
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,360
terrible water the soil had been

59
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,959
polluted from the years of chemical

60
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:11,360
flower production yeah so it was pretty

61
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,360
much everything learning the building

62
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,440
completing the grow you know the

63
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,640
buildout um and this is kind of before

64
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:18,878
there was just a dude you could pick up

65
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:20,318
the phone and say hey man I need a

66
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:22,560
greenhouse you know of course there's

67
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:24,479
like Farm Tech and guys like that sure

68
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,920
those guys jumped in but like it it

69
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:29,000
wasn't obvious and it wasn't it wasn't

70
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:31,399
apparent you didn't jump on the internet

71
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,159
and it wasn't like now like it is now no

72
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,560
you had to you had to really take some

73
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:36,359
time sit in the office and dig it out

74
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,080
and find that help find the person that

75
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,239
was willing to work with you you know

76
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,040
like even when it came down to testing

77
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,239
genetics we I was running up plants to

78
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,919
CSU and getting chased out of the

79
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:46,599
University by people that were like get

80
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:47,719
that cannabis off the property you know

81
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:50,839
they wouldn't even work with you that

82
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:53,199
way yeah yeah so what was your first

83
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,080
experience with cannabis my first

84
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:57,158
experience with cannabis was just like

85
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,120
an after school special man like it

86
00:02:57,158 --> 00:03:02,318
really was um my best friend keep his

87
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,560
name quiet cuz he works for the

88
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:05,919
government at this point he's got some

89
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,759
kind of secret whatever past stuff he

90
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:10,238
can't get in trouble with but um I mean

91
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:12,359
it literally was like that like his

92
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,920
uncle came in town like left some weed

93
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,840
behind you know we went around the side

94
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:19,000
of the house we smoked a little bowl I

95
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,158
was 15 years old

96
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,519
um it was kind of at the time I was down

97
00:03:21,158 --> 00:03:23,959
in South Florida so a lot of my friends

98
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:25,959
were starting to experiment with alcohol

99
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:28,680
and stuff like that and I quickly

100
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:32,039
realized it was it was pretty apparent

101
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,920
when you were drunk versus you know you

102
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:35,560
could smoke a little weed and I mean

103
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:36,958
maybe your eyes got a little red but you

104
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,719
still coherent and you were still with

105
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,080
it depending on how much back the

106
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:43,280
quality you know it was a little preppy

107
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,519
you know like we started off with some

108
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,680
swaggy stuff but moved quickly into the

109
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,799
[ __ ] but um yeah it went along really

110
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,599
well with my skateboarding and my

111
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:53,079
surfing and stuff like that so yeah

112
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,119
stuck with it so let's talk about the

113
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:56,879
crippy your experience with the crippy

114
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,079
so we had mango on here and we've had

115
00:03:56,878 --> 00:03:59,479
some other people from Florida and

116
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:00,840
crippy was pretty much all the good

117
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:02,199
stuff stuff right yeah that's yeah that

118
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,200
was it it was kind of a loose ter for

119
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:06,679
kind bud you know

120
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:07,798
um most of the time it was homegrown uh

121
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,599
there was some dudes down there that

122
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:12,599
were really cranking it out like uh yeah

123
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:13,798
just remember meeting people randomly

124
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:14,959
like at the beach or something like that

125
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:16,239
they're like oh you smoke weed and then

126
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,720
invite that guy to the party and that

127
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,719
guy would show up with like an Igloo

128
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:24,360
cooler full of the same Cola of crippy

129
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,600
like just sea of green crippy and um

130
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,520
yeah it taught me really quick like

131
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,280
flavors everything in cannabis you know

132
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,319
like if you're going to do something

133
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:32,559
especially highly illegal at the time

134
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:35,639
yeah it might as well taste good and

135
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,439
make you feel good um yeah so yeah that

136
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:38,639
was kind of the well and I feel like

137
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:39,800
it's one of those things if you've never

138
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,600
experienced it you don't know what good

139
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,800
weed tastes like you don't you don't

140
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,400
know what you're missing and then the

141
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,400
second you taste it whether it's at a

142
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,599
young age or whether it's older then you

143
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:51,198
realize the contrast between everything

144
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:54,439
else and then the good stuff absolutely

145
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:57,400
yep and uh I would say like that that

146
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:59,199
experience in life really paved the road

147
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:01,000
to me becoming a chef yeah cuz I was

148
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,759
like well Everybody Eats all day long

149
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,478
but are you putting quality in your

150
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:06,879
mouth you know what what are you doing

151
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:09,319
right so yeah that it definitely was a

152
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:13,159
big influence on it has a huge like

153
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:15,079
working in the kitchen has so much uh as

154
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,160
far as so much in common with cannabis

155
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:19,000
like those two Fields I feel like

156
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,319
they're both passion driven Fields like

157
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,160
I think a lot of people see the

158
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:26,439
financial aspect or did in the past of

159
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,280
cannabis but I think also people watch

160
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:30,360
TV and they're like oh these celebrity

161
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:31,719
chefs and it's like all glammed out and

162
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,319
that's not the real kitchen you know

163
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,800
that's not the real world is you know

164
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,720
it's like but there is like like uh

165
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,918
water boys and dishwashers have a lot in

166
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,720
common you know it's like absolutely um

167
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:45,439
and I think it's valuable to learn all

168
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,000
those things together it's amazing um

169
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:48,600
how many similarities there are and then

170
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,399
pallet wise too like I feel like that's

171
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,680
where I develop I develop my pette from

172
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:55,439
both you know I feel I feel most of us

173
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,000
that worked in the kitchen it's like

174
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:58,478
it's all from collecting data points

175
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,680
right so like the more data points you

176
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:01,918
have over time the more developed your

177
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,360
pallet is and the more things you

178
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:05,799
experience you you figure out what you

179
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,038
like what you don't like and then at a

180
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,478
certain point you can figure out what

181
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:10,839
other people like too I feel like that's

182
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:12,598
one of the things uh that makes cooking

183
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:14,758
special too it's not always about what

184
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:16,319
you like but but understanding what

185
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:17,520
everybody likes or what most people

186
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,039
would like going in there what they

187
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,318
would be impressed with or or you know

188
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:22,959
add to the experience because at the end

189
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:24,800
of the day it's all about an experience

190
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,239
yeah absolutely I mean um for a

191
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,160
restaurant to be successful there has to

192
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,598
be some form of a Mass Appeal you know

193
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,319
something's got to hit and right

194
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:33,639
resonate with everyone and I think

195
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,520
that's where you get certain strains of

196
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:37,879
cannabis that become legendary for a

197
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:41,439
long time you know like the cppy down in

198
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:42,759
the South uh Blue Dream out here in Cali

199
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:44,279
you know like those things hit and they

200
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:47,280
resonated for a long time well the

201
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:48,638
crippy somehow turned into OG Kush right

202
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:51,758
right but it was cppy was kind of

203
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:54,120
encompassing but then it emerged as the

204
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:57,919
OG Kush cut that we know today is OG

205
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,959
Kush which is like that earthy piny gas

206
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:01,279
totally yeah I think that that was um

207
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:04,279
you know the successful growers in

208
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:06,399
Florida that were able to attract some a

209
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:07,959
little bit of gravits and attention and

210
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:10,399
you know they got the the West Coast

211
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:13,519
people paying attention and um they were

212
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:15,519
able to come out here and make OG like a

213
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:18,279
California thing you know like I I I

214
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:21,000
don't think of OG is or like crippy is

215
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:24,038
Florida but OG is California absolutely

216
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,160
yeah thanks to St talk Ricky Palamino

cannabis for me man is it just um I mean

223
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,959
it's brought my best friends into my

224
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:44,399
life um it brought my wife into my life

225
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:47,399
um you know I was running around Athens

226
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,959
Georgia for a little while in the 90s um

227
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:51,959
we were definitely we were selling swag

228
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:53,878
to buy good bud you know yeah and um we

229
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:55,918
actually got to a point where we make

230
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:57,479
enough money that we we rented Bon Joy's

231
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:59,839
tour bus and his driver to take us down

232
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:02,839
to the Dead shows oh wow Athens to

233
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:04,758
Atlanta in 95 and um that's where I met

234
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:06,279
my wife Man On A Grateful Dead lot you

235
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:08,840
know like I was like hey you want to get

236
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:10,279
on the bus and come check it out and she

237
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:13,000
got on the bus and never got off you

238
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:17,839
know so yeah yeah and that was in mid

239
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,918
90s 9 April or March 31st 95 wow awesome

240
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:21,719
yeah yeah that's great yeah it's cool

241
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:23,478
it's it's funny how the Grateful Dead

242
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,479
has so much influence over or not not

243
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:28,079
even influence but impact on the

244
00:08:25,478 --> 00:08:29,878
industry I think the Cannabis industry

245
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:32,158
wouldn't be what the cannabis industry

246
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:34,200
is without the impact from the Grateful

247
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:36,559
Dead and there so many of us have

248
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,680
stories that revolve around either the

249
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,559
lot or around the genetics that came

250
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:43,278
from there absolutely you know it's it's

251
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:45,479
pretty yeah like in in Athens you know

252
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:48,240
like as soon as the kids left town after

253
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,120
school got out um typically there was a

254
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,600
huge drought all through the summer yeah

255
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,799
and that's where like summer tours of

256
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,519
the Grateful Dead coming through would

257
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,679
absolutely save the summer you know like

258
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:58,200
you'd load up on your glass you load up

259
00:08:56,679 --> 00:09:00,239
on your mushrooms you load up on your

260
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,278
you know your jars of weed and totally

261
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,039
try to make it through you know pinch it

262
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:05,679
pinch it through till till everything

263
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:07,360
came back around in the spring you know

264
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:09,439
right but that's yeah why I started

265
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,959
growing is because I I was like why what

266
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,040
this is a plant why are we running out

267
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:14,799
of it you know if we can just grow it

268
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:18,078
let's grow it so when did you start

269
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:22,319
growing um let's see my first plants

270
00:09:18,078 --> 00:09:23,799
were in high school uh 1994 um there was

271
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,278
a window in my basement I planted a

272
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:27,599
bunch of plants in my window and I

273
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:28,919
actually went away on a little trip I

274
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,399
came back home and all my plants are

275
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:34,360
sitting on the kitchen table and my my

276
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:36,839
parents were basically like uh you know

277
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:39,320
you said this was basil

278
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:41,040
and I have a really cool uncle and he he

279
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,800
was like that's that's not basil you

280
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:45,958
know so he blew it he blew uh he blew my

281
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:47,679
cover but it all worked out well because

282
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:49,439
I was able to you know I graduated from

283
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:53,199
high school and then went up the road to

284
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:57,320
Athens um the the first plant I was

285
00:09:53,200 --> 00:10:00,680
gifted was a mother plant of big bud in

286
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:02,440
1996 oh wow it was huge this thing had

287
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:04,199
been topped forever I mean it probably

288
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,800
had 50 Tops on it when I got it it

289
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,480
showed up in one of the big old school

290
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:12,240
TV boxes you remember used to

291
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:15,320
be now they're flat but it took up the

292
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,079
whole thing and um one of my good

293
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,360
buddies is like we need a grow light and

294
00:10:17,078 --> 00:10:20,838
you know back then you couldn't just go

295
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,278
to the grow store so or you had to go to

296
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:23,880
the electrical shop and build one and

297
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:26,240
that was outside of my realm of

298
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:27,639
knowledge right so we stole one from my

299
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,799
Community College you know it's like a

300
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:33,240
400 watt HPS or something like that you

301
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:35,120
know when the light was on also like you

302
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,839
know like could have lost a good friend

303
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,759
in that process but we didn't and yeah

304
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,680
that thing went into a closet and um

305
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:45,559
what doesn't kill you right only only

306
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:47,278
makes a career right but yeah man so

307
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:49,759
that was the first PL it was pretty good

308
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:51,720
you know I mean it was 90s big bud so

309
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:53,799
yeah it was impressive the the smoke

310
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,600
wasn't all that great but and then I got

311
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:59,278
into you know it still Georgia in the

312
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,440
90s um so a lot of penalties be paid if

313
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:03,919
you got caught yeah so uh mostly Gorilla

314
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,639
growing and stuff like that um I

315
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:07,319
remember yeah I remember my dad sitting

316
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:08,519
down at the kitchen table and being like

317
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,760
I don't know whose plants those were in

318
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:13,919
the woods but they just had crop failure

319
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:17,240
you like like trying not to react at the

320
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:20,838
dinner table you know oh man yeah but um

321
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:22,399
yeah man I grew all the way so yeah the

322
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:26,079
Athens thing went good for a while till

323
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:27,958
it didn't we actually had um some we had

324
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:30,679
a federal thing happen and one of my

325
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:32,439
buddies a really my kind of my best

326
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:35,719
friend at the time started wearing a

327
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:37,399
wire and actually yeah it was it was it

328
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,000
was a weird time everybody's houses

329
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:42,000
started getting kicked in and um we

330
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,919
didn't know what was going on you know

331
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,799
but it was kind of strange my best

332
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:48,240
friend at the time like the guy that had

333
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:49,799
all the weed and the best weed all of a

334
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,959
sudden didn't have any weed you know and

335
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:54,479
he was asking us for weed and things

336
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:57,319
just got weird you know yeah but um one

337
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,159
by one they all got in trouble and um I

338
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,760
think I don't really know exactly cuz I

339
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:03,439
never talked to I didn't ever talk to

340
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:05,559
any officers about it yeah but I guess I

341
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,160
was so low on the totem pole you know I

342
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:09,958
think they had who they wanted yeah so

343
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:12,000
they usually go for the big fish yeah

344
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:13,759
you know that's kind of especially back

345
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,679
then it's like get them you know hit

346
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:17,879
them hard yeah I mean they hit people

347
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,838
hard they hit people hard man yeah a lot

348
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:22,078
of my friends uh you know like their

349
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,839
parents had to put their houses up to

350
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:25,278
keep their kids out of jail and you know

351
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:28,160
like just stuff like that and oh yeah

352
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:31,639
they' seize property too SE property

353
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:34,360
yeah so uh asset forfeiture sucks it's

354
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:37,360
you know I mean this the whole the the

355
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,720
road has been so weird but um that's

356
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,120
what sent me to culinary school you know

357
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,839
I was like I got to learn a trade I need

358
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,039
to get out of this and get into

359
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,480
something else and yeah so I went to the

360
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:48,399
Art Institute of Atlanta and learned to

361
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:50,720
become a chef and nice yeah and then did

362
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,320
that for a while did that forever man

363
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,240
and I was drinking the Kool-Aid man I

364
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,199
was like not doing anything else besides

365
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,720
being a chef the beauty of being a chef

366
00:12:56,198 --> 00:12:59,919
is you you're a chef forever you learn

367
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,278
how once you learn how to cook

368
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:02,719
it just changes your life it's just like

369
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:04,399
learning how to grow though it's I feel

370
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,920
like absolutely you once you understand

371
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,679
the plant once you understand the

372
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:10,120
kitchen and there's a formula to it and

373
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:12,039
everybody makes their own formula up as

374
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,399
you go along you learn things and you

375
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:14,759
pick up things from different cultures

376
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:16,480
but you understand how Food Works

377
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:19,120
together and that's it's an amazing

378
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,759
thing to be able to just kind of create

379
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,399
and and there's there's an artistic side

380
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:24,838
to it too absolutely yeah I think it's

381
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:27,120
cool like you know culinary school gives

382
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:29,760
you the the intros and the hows and the

383
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,159
wise and then once you learn that it's

384
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:32,319
it's kind of like all cuisine's pretty

385
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:34,360
much the same you just have a different

386
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,040
set of ingredients to work with and you

387
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:39,159
know um yeah same with canab was same

388
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:41,000
with growing you know like I I KN I I

389
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:42,719
instantly realized like I didn't want to

390
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,320
work at at chilies I didn't want to cook

391
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,959
something out of a bag and pour it in

392
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,760
and call that soup of the day like that

393
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:50,958
wasn't me and that that approach worked

394
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:52,399
for me in cannabis too I was like I'm

395
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:55,159
not a hydro guy like I don't want to

396
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:58,240
take part a Part B and then throw in

397
00:13:55,159 --> 00:14:00,600
some C and then call it my creation you

398
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,198
know I don't think that's no shame on

399
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,079
anybody doing it you know it's just not

400
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:06,000
me I like to like oh I made this input

401
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:08,519
and I put that input on to ground up

402
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,320
both ways yeah yeah when it reflects in

403
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:13,000
your flour too like at the end of the

404
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,519
day yeah you got some good flour you I

405
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,039
love I love smoking every time I go to

406
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:18,078
Colorado that's one of the places I look

407
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:19,360
forward to going to is to I always love

408
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:21,039
to see you show up man and show you what

409
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,440
I've been working with for sure but you

410
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:23,639
know it was that big flood we had in

411
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,199
Colorado when I was running that

412
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:26,720
Greenhouse we had a huge flood come

413
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:29,879
through and I believe it was I think

414
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,959
it's 10 years ago September um yeah but

415
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:33,799
it literally cut my town in half you

416
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:35,439
know like we had to drive all the way

417
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:37,519
around just to get to town but my

418
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,839
Greenhouse I remember waking up at 4

419
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,959
o'clock in the morning and turning on

420
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:43,560
the news and seeing that Lafayette was

421
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,879
underwater and I jumped in my truck at 5

422
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:47,758
o'clock in the morning and drove to that

423
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:49,720
greenhouse and every it was like an

424
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:51,480
episode of Ghost Hunters like the trash

425
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,360
cans floating across the room you know

426
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,759
it's just the kitty cat that we had

427
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,399
Durban was all the way in the rafters

428
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:00,600
like he was hiding out and but because

429
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,159
of that it locked up the ground so bad

430
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,240
and we were in the ground organic or

431
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:08,319
trying to be as organic as possible yeah

432
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:10,720
um but we couldn't grow anything like we

433
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,278
were getting every kind of anything you

434
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,160
could imagine like if it was fungal

435
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:16,320
based it was in the soil I mean it was

436
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:18,120
just anything just a nightmare to deal

437
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,320
with it was almost like a bad Bugs Bunny

438
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,600
cartoon like when the little all the

439
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,320
carrots start disappearing you know

440
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,720
going down the road right we'd water a

441
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,560
plant and it would die we'd water a

442
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,160
plant and it would die and I so we had

443
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:30,919
two or three Growers at the time and we

444
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:34,120
all kind of you know we headbutting a

445
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:36,399
little bit on things but um every time

446
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,799
we put chemicals into the soil it was

447
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:42,559
worse like salt-based stuff just would

448
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:45,599
kill things so that's when um I got to

449
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:47,958
know Brian from vital um absolutely yeah

450
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,000
like Carl Gorka from photosynthesis plus

451
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:51,638
micro life like yeah I started reaching

452
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,958
out to all these organic guys and I was

453
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:56,360
like Hey like how do how do we stop this

454
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:58,119
you know and um Brian's answer was

455
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,519
compost he you know and I was like okay

456
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,519
you know I'm with that I brought in a

457
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,519
master horticulturist he was like

458
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,399
compost tea I was like okay all right

459
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,159
now we're getting somewhere so we

460
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:09,039
started bringing in better supplies we

461
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:10,439
couldn't water anything because as soon

462
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:12,958
as water hit the ground it locked up

463
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,959
everything wow um so we started folar

464
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:18,278
feeding compost teas and we turned that

465
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:21,518
grow around I mean it took we still got

466
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:23,799
a crop in I if I remember correctly I

467
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:26,879
think I watered the crop one time in 90

468
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:29,039
days and everything else was Fuller and

469
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:31,000
dude we had Jurassic leav on these

470
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:33,439
plants and I'm like

471
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,278
okay I'm starting to see the connection

472
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,759
here you know and so yeah through the

473
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:38,318
Organics you know I learned about

474
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:39,720
probiotics which brought me to Alan

475
00:16:38,318 --> 00:16:42,838
ainson and

476
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:44,839
gashi um using his products and then

477
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:46,560
watching everything change watching the

478
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:48,240
soil change watching the composition of

479
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:52,159
the soil change watching the pH of the

480
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:55,198
soil change right and like yeah uh I

481
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:57,278
guess my point is like feeding cannabis

482
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:58,958
in that situation taught me how to feed

483
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:01,078
myself you know I was like why am I not

484
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:03,119
drinking coconut water why do I not take

485
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:05,879
aloe you know like why do I not eat

486
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:09,400
probiotics totally and I was I was just

487
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,799
coming out of my chef you know career

488
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,000
which they tell you in culinary school

489
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:14,519
like fat is Flavor you know like anytime

490
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,880
you can throw more butter in there hit

491
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:19,038
it with some cream you know like it I

492
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,839
don't believe Fat's the problem just

493
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:24,720
personally I think I mean you know I do

494
00:17:22,838 --> 00:17:27,000
love I I do love it and I think it's a

495
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,079
good energy I think the problem right

496
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,160
now today with people's eating is that

497
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:34,759
they're eating processed foods totally

498
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,279
you know I mean I think Butter's okay in

499
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:38,879
my opinion Butter's okay I think

500
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:41,000
exercise and eating raw ingredients is

501
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,320
the most important thing I think so too

502
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,839
and yeah yeah like and now I understand

503
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:47,720
like through like fermented products you

504
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:49,159
know like your kimch and your kombuchas

505
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,960
and your sauerkraut it's like totally

506
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,360
now we're looking at knf right and it's

507
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,759
like these guys are just fermenting

508
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:55,000
things and micronizing those things and

509
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:56,319
applying them straight to the plant the

510
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,079
plant's eating itself or the plant's

511
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:59,399
eating whatever it wants to eat right

512
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:01,079
when we're we're doing that eating the

513
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,720
fermented stuff everything's micronized

514
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:04,879
for us it's easier for our bodies to

515
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:09,079
uptake you know it's good for our body

516
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:11,200
pH yeah it's very similar you know um I

517
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:13,639
actually just read an article about how

518
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,000
similar the root system is in soil

519
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:18,360
versus our gut system in our

520
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,640
microbiota and um one of the cool

521
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:23,759
takeaways from the article was you know

522
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,520
like if people have um like surgeries

523
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:27,400
and stuff like that and their their

524
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:28,918
probiotics completely shut down you know

525
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,240
like and they're basically of like

526
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:33,360
diarrhea and dentary AAL transplant that

527
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,480
you can do you know where you actually

528
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:36,439
take

529
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,279
somebody's it doesn't sound like what it

530
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,759
is you're basically eating a pill right

531
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:42,720
it's eating a pill but it I have uler of

532
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:44,119
colitis so I know all about these things

533
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,759
there you go yeah that's why I do coal

534
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:48,359
plch there you go so but I read in this

535
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:51,519
article that a compost tea is just like

536
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:53,359
doing a feal transplant for the soil

537
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:56,119
which totally made sense to me you know

538
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:57,719
I was like okay so yeah it's just like

539
00:18:56,119 --> 00:19:00,239
when things aren't right you take what

540
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:03,319
is right and apply it in and then yeah

541
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:06,400
let the symbiotic process occur you know

542
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:08,399
yeah yeah it's cool totally yeah yeah

543
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,519
it's a trip and we're starting to learn

544
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,200
so much more science about like uh GI

545
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:15,200
issues and also about cannabis all at

546
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,480
the same time science is just kind of

547
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,319
there's a lot of stuff we knew but we're

548
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,120
learning a lot of stuff you know I think

549
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:23,000
you know especially about eating things

550
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:24,759
that aren't sprayed with pesticides dude

551
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,079
totally and when I was saying like fat

552
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:29,480
is Flavor like there's a big difference

553
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:31,319
between like grass-fed beef butter you

554
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,759
know like grass butter or

555
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:35,399
whirl you know like we like I worked

556
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,599
place like grab the Whirl and put it on

557
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,600
the green beans you're like what the

558
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:41,279
[ __ ] is whirl you know like and it's

559
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:43,639
just some crazy oil some hydrogenated

560
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:45,839
hydrogenated oil that tastes like butter

561
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,759
you know like it's made for a buffet so

562
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:49,959
your butter your butter never breaks you

563
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:51,599
know it's cheap butter it's cheap butter

564
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,840
but that's kind of that's kind of stuff

565
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:57,599
that I was looking at and it's the spice

566
00:19:54,839 --> 00:20:00,879
of butter it is yes like how [ __ ] is to

567
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:03,399
cannabis right right exactly yeah yeah

568
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,400
yeah trip but yeah man so it became like

569
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,440
I realized quickly the best way to raise

570
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,480
and if you can I know it's not for

571
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,000
everybody but the best way to over

572
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,279
raisee cannabis in my book is to feed it

573
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,960
organically yeah and you know I just I

574
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:17,678
mean I do shop at Whole Foods I eat

575
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,960
mostly organic food I strictly organ

576
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,080
paycheck yeah whole paycheck exactly

577
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,200
yeah they freaking out the other day

578
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:23,158
when you can check out with your palm

579
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,558
now have you seen that I know it's

580
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:26,960
really weird I'm like I think I'll skip

581
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:30,558
that Tech but I appreciate your celery

582
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:33,200
juice you know yeah blood

583
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:35,720
sample no big deal finger prick you know

584
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,840
right right but yeah it's it's

585
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,880
interesting and how how these things

586
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:41,678
relate and there's so much crossover

587
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,320
totally you know in life and then with

588
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:46,360
your family and then you're raising your

589
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:48,038
kid on these things and absolutely yeah

590
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:49,678
absolutely I know I know my wife thinks

591
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:51,798
I'm crazy because I'm always you know

592
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,400
like if I'm cook rice then I'm shaking

593
00:20:51,798 --> 00:20:55,000
it in rice water and I'm making my own

594
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,038
Labs you know there's always a project

595
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,960
on my counter like right now I know

596
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:01,679
there's there's a huge thing of garlic

597
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,480
fermenting and honey on the counter um

598
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,038
but no it does become a lifestyle and I

599
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,360
think you're right the problem that's

600
00:21:06,038 --> 00:21:08,798
going on right now is you know we're

601
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:10,918
sending our kids off to school with

602
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:13,679
heads full of sugar and artificial

603
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:15,559
colors and you know and then they can't

604
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,120
concentrate at school and then it's your

605
00:21:15,558 --> 00:21:18,798
kid's fault you know and then you get

606
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:20,079
mad at the teacher for not engaging your

607
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:22,679
kid and it's

608
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:24,558
like no like feed your kid Whole Foods

609
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:26,120
and you teach your kid how to grow you

610
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:28,720
know I think that's what's really cool

611
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:31,519
like stop the disconnect your kids how

612
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,278
to grow you know I think also like if

613
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:34,720
you're a meat eater I don't vegetarian

614
00:21:33,278 --> 00:21:36,200
whatever that's fine but like if you eat

615
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,440
meat you should understand the process

616
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:41,240
of how animals come to end up on your

617
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:43,640
plate absolutely I I love the whole

618
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,720
process of all that stuff I do and

619
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,080
understanding but I mean all these

620
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,480
things are Lost Art absolutely yeah I

621
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:50,519
would love since I'm in Colorado I'd

622
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,759
love to um Embrace more hunting and

623
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:54,119
stuff like that and always have like a

624
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:56,278
full freezer of some good elk and stuff

625
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:58,399
to go to yeah Elk's my favorite Elk's my

626
00:21:56,278 --> 00:22:00,640
favorite so I I like a lot of different

627
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,159
kinds of meat I like bear bear jerky too

628
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,000
Bear's great I shot a big old bear and

629
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,960
we made some stew out of it it was it

630
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,278
was interesting it works and bear can

631
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,880
vary so much from animal to animal yeah

632
00:22:09,278 --> 00:22:12,079
oh yeah yeah it's kind of what they're

633
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,640
eating on and stuff like that you can

634
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:17,639
get the trash bear out of PR much all

635
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:19,038
animals totally yeah but no yeah it's I

636
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,240
mean cannabis has taught me how to feed

637
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:23,000
myself completely and yeah there's

638
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,919
really not much difference between like

639
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,440
the amount of salt we can take you know

640
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:29,440
you well and salt and and what we think

641
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,720
of as salt like for us it's like there's

642
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,278
different types of salt too it's like

643
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:35,600
you know there's table salt which is

644
00:22:33,278 --> 00:22:37,679
very linear and then there's sea salt

645
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:38,959
right which is very complex right it's

646
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,559
and then there's all the components also

647
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,200
like magnesiums and all those other

648
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:45,240
things and like they all in those plants

649
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,960
I mean we know like growing cannabis is

650
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,120
all about your micronutrients you know

651
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,720
and same same like that's gotten me

652
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:52,759
every morning taking a little Celtic Sea

653
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,120
salt and dropping it under my tongue and

654
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:56,599
getting all you know getting all my good

655
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:59,759
vitamins in that way right so again I

656
00:22:56,599 --> 00:23:01,798
mean she's she's the one man she's the

657
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:04,038
goddess she's like the number one woman

658
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:05,400
of the world you know what I mean like I

659
00:23:04,038 --> 00:23:07,079
personally think it's really hard to

660
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,200
wrap around my head that like an orange

661
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:11,319
could taste like cannabis or a cannabis

662
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,840
can taste like orange but a cannabis can

663
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:15,798
also taste like any other thing like

664
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:17,759
like Green Dot Dave's got the A5 wagu

665
00:23:15,798 --> 00:23:20,839
out right now yeah if you haven't tried

666
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:23,240
that I mean it's a greasy meaty it's an

667
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:25,439
experience you know I've had some uh

668
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:28,720
fried chicken turps before Fried Chicken

669
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,320
turps for sure like that lemon G um that

670
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,480
lemon g i I don't know if I got the

671
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:33,439
lemon G from you I got it from someone

672
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,240
in Colorado but that lemon G is fire

673
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,159
it's so fire but it's also got like a

674
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:40,079
funky Fried Chicken Gas Station like

675
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,919
bathroom in a Alabama gas station where

676
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:43,759
they fry their own chicken tur like

677
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,200
you're back there borderline offensive

678
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:46,759

679

713
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:06,398
morning uh I mean we started work at

714
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,038
7:00 which meant smoking OG at like 7:15

715
00:25:06,398 --> 00:25:09,839
and drinking coffee and then we would

716
00:25:08,038 --> 00:25:12,079
leave the table at like

717
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:13,678
10:30 higher coffee is the balance

718
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:15,480
though higher than giraffe [ __ ] you

719
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,240
know what I mean just like way up there

720
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,480
and then like okay let's get to work and

721
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,159
it's like uh let's get to lunch you know

722
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,360
right but the the the information that I

723
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:24,799
gathered from all those guys and you

724
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:26,319
know this is still this is a couple

725
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:29,240
years back so it's like a lot of Bro

726
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:31,398
Science still you know but sure just the

727
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,880
EXP pushing to figure it out so we can

728
00:25:31,398 --> 00:25:34,759
we could get to the where we where we

729
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,159
are today you know I mean I feel like it

730
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:37,240
takes a lot of trial and a a lot of

731
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,080
people don't understand because we're

732
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:41,278
standing on the shoulders of giants and

733
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:42,599
these are such big giants that we don't

734
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:45,200
even really see the work that they've

735
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:47,678
done necessarily yep but like the work's

736
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:51,080
been going on for 40 50 years really and

737
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:52,519
then even 2,000 years in the making but

738
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:54,038
we're standing on the shoulders of some

739
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:55,639
amazing Giants and there's a lot of

740
00:25:54,038 --> 00:25:59,679
trial and error to get to where we are

741
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:59,679
today to get funneled into gelato

742
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:04,038
you're right dude you're right I just

743
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:06,200
grew some outdoor runs this year in

744
00:26:04,038 --> 00:26:07,359
Colorado and I was like see why it's got

745
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,240
you know I see why it's got its good

746
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:10,599
reputation it's delicious but I totally

747
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,079
love the appeal of some of this stuff

748
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:13,398
and I totally love the flavor but I also

749
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:16,759
love diversity and I think that comes

750
00:26:13,398 --> 00:26:19,439
from the chef background too absolutely

751
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:20,960
yeah I I yeah cannabis is not just like

752
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,278
sitting around getting stoned for me you

753
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,278
know it's like okay what's going to

754
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:26,798
start my day get my get my processes

755
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:28,640
going you know get my whether it's get

756
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:31,200
my exercise in get the dog out for a

757
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,880
walk like just make a list you know

758
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,798
whatever it is and then there's like the

759
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,159
midday stuff and then like once I'm done

760
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:39,119
working like I'm 47 now man my body

761
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:40,559
hurts you know so I'm ready to like feel

762
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:41,719
smoke some of that dog walker or

763
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:43,278
something like that that's just going to

764
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,960
put me in the couch and put me you know

765
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:46,798
in a good space getting ready to gets

766
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,278
you to relax at least I feel like

767
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:50,798
stimulants are good in the daytime the

768
00:26:48,278 --> 00:26:52,359
sedative stuff at night sure but I I

769
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:53,879
have like things like OG Kush where I

770
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:55,199
can smoke them day or night Skittles

771
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,679
another one I smoke it in the morning I

772
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,720
smoke it at night yep uh it's it's

773
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,200
interesting and I'm constantly changing

774
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,200
when I'm smoking and probably smoking

775
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:07,278
whatever the best [ __ ] I have is what I

776
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,840
smoke first yep y totally yeah um I

777
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:10,079
think I you know I have built up a

778
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:12,959
tolerance for all the Kims and all the

779
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:15,158
ogs so I can still function but I I

780
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,640
personally like to be a little scared

781
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:18,840
when I'm done smoking weed like there's

782
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,799
something about it it just I don't know

783
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:22,839
it like brings me Clos yeah it brings me

784
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:24,558
more I'm more attentive actually to like

785
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:26,918
everything around me Hyper sensitive

786
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:29,319
almost but yeah um not in a bad way not

787
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:31,278
in a paranoid way but just you know like

788
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:33,519
no but where you can be comfortable in

789
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:35,640
that borderline place like that's kind

790
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:37,319
of how mushrooms work too yeah like once

791
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,440
you get like At first it's like it can

792
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:40,639
be borderline like not micro do I'm not

793
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,320
talking about micro do but I'm talking

794
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,440
about like a real dose like we do grew

795
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:46,119
up doing and I think right uh now

796
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,798
everyone's on the micro do kick but like

797
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:50,518
technically you get the most benefit

798
00:27:47,798 --> 00:27:52,960
from doing the larger uh doses of

799
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:54,558
mushrooms and it is borderline scary and

800
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,880
then once you learn that how to relax

801
00:27:54,558 --> 00:27:59,519
then you can really appreciate um

802
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:03,399
everything it has to offer yep yeah

803
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:05,319
mushrooms are amazing like that um I

804
00:28:03,398 --> 00:28:07,518
last time I had one of those trips was

805
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:10,158
about a year and a half ago and it was

806
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:12,759
3.5 grams of this Brazilian strain that

807
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:15,360
my buddy grows and instead of lemon Tech

808
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:16,960
I did grapefruit Tech you know i' heard

809
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:18,599
I'm like okay heard is works better

810
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,159
whatever yeah so I made this little

811
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:22,798
grapefruit thingy and um it was 3.5

812
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:25,080
grams and then I blended it into this

813
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:26,798
tiny little grapefruit margarita it was

814
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:28,558
like a little tiny tequila and a little

815
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:30,879
tiny grandma yeah it I mean it was a

816
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:32,960
shot yeah and I shot that thing down and

817
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:36,519
by the time I could clean the blender I

818
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:39,440
was having like DMT visuals like I don't

819
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:41,640
know what was going on but yeah it hit

820
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,919
me so hard it was the strongest trip and

821
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,360
I was thinking back I'm like there's no

822
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:47,038
way I could be in a public setting right

823
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:49,289
now I mean I felt like I was DNA going

824
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:51,240
through somebody's like Bloods

825
00:28:49,289 --> 00:28:54,038
[Music]

826
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:56,000
like but yeah man it was awesome and

827
00:28:54,038 --> 00:28:58,278
yeah but I do micro do a lot I do micro

828
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,119
do like five times or five days a week

829
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:02,640
try to take couple days off I think you

830
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:05,479
were the first person to get me on micro

831
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,278
dois to be honest you gave me some pills

832
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,480
in Denver one time that had a whole

833
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:11,079
bunch of different mushrooms including

834
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,679
the 15 mushroom blend yeah it was like

835
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:14,839
the 15 mushroom blend and those were

836
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:16,000
like real micros too and they were like

837
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:17,319
you weren't taking them to get high you

838
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,440
were taking them for the mushroom

839
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:22,558
benefit absolutely yeah man y yeah I

840
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:23,880
think you know like everybody's got

841
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:25,000
their traumas and stuff like that and

842
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,919
you know the more I learn about the

843
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,278
brain and like uh concussion and stuff

844
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,720
like that like how I mean I I did surf I

845
00:29:30,278 --> 00:29:33,798
skateboarded I played a little bit of

846
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,759
football you know like yeah I've taken

847
00:29:33,798 --> 00:29:39,398
and I fought I used to be a fighter you

848
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:40,720
know so I've taken some shots and um now

849
00:29:39,398 --> 00:29:42,558
yeah now that I'm in my 40s I'm like

850
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,558
okay we got to protect this noodle you

851
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:47,158
know because I'm looking at the next 40

852
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:49,599
and I don't want to be you know useless

853
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:51,880
as far as my brain or my my vocabulary

854
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:53,879
and stuff like that so yeah I I do I

855
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,799
spend a lot of time um trying to rebuild

856
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,760
those things and I think that's the way

857
00:29:55,798 --> 00:29:59,440
to do it yeah I talk talk about cold

858
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:01,240
plunge a lot I'm a huge cold plunge fan

859
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,840
and I I do these longer plunges now

860
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:05,640
which is like goes goes against a lot of

861
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:06,879
stuff you read but I feel like you got

862
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:09,880
to listen to your body and give your

863
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:12,120
body what it wants and you know I do

864
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:15,159
days where I do 15 minute plunges now oh

865
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:17,879
my God and so well Joe Rogan did like 20

866
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:19,720
and then Rick Rubin he did like a 30 he

867
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:22,278
says he did a 30 but I saw Joe Rogan's

868
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,798
20 minute plunge and so I realized that

869
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:25,679
anything's possible you just listen to

870
00:30:23,798 --> 00:30:26,918
your body and if it's too much like as

871
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,798
you're building it up you don't go past

872
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:31,240
that didn't go past 5 minutes for the

873
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:32,839
longest time I think three 3 minutes and

874
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,120
30 seconds has been about it depends on

875
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:35,439
the temperature too so I get a little

876
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:38,518
warmer temperature so I can go for

877
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:41,558
longer but you get in more of like a

878
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:43,440
meditating type meditative State like

879
00:30:41,558 --> 00:30:45,558
you I feel like it's in a you're in a

880
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,278
different state of mind especially with

881
00:30:45,558 --> 00:30:49,038
the cold like then you start breathing

882
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:51,398
through it and relaxing you're in the

883
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:53,519
moment too because you're cold yeah the

884
00:30:51,398 --> 00:30:55,638
the yeah for me the very first initial

885
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:58,200
plunge is it's pretty ugly you know I'm

886
00:30:55,638 --> 00:31:00,479
like not in control of my vote I'm

887
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,319
you know like yeah yeah it it I do I do

888
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,919
it every day now too so I do it every

889
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:05,278
day first thing in the morning right

890
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:07,159
when I get out of bed so I'm not really

891
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:09,240
thinking about it and then you're hot

892
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:11,000
from sleeping so then when you get in

893
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,359
it's almost like going in the SAA that's

894
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,398
cool but I need to get one for my house

895
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:17,199
um you know I live in Colorado so cold

896
00:31:15,398 --> 00:31:19,398
plunge can literally be just run outside

897
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,720
the in the snow literally at this time

898
00:31:19,398 --> 00:31:23,038
of year you could probably just put a

899
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,519
trough out yeah exactly yeah yeah like a

900
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:25,839
baby pool and just go crack the ice and

901
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:27,319
jump in there but I you know I was

902
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:28,278
thinking like this has been theast

903
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:30,359
couple years have been the year of the

904
00:31:28,278 --> 00:31:31,558
cold plunges so yeah I was like oh maybe

905
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:34,599
I'll just wait and see what pops up on

906
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:36,398
Craigslist and snack ABS you can I mean

907
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:38,480
you can buy the $10,000 ones on the

908
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:41,079
Internet or you know the Morosco which I

909
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,798
think is badass it's $10,000 but then

910
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:45,319
you can make one for $2,000 it works

911
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:47,079
just fine um you know and if you're in a

912
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:49,079
cold enough region I just I'm so worried

913
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:51,199
about balancing out everything like

914
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:52,678
chemical wise because you can if you

915
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,960
don't do it right you can get bacteria

916
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:56,480
infections and die yeah that's the other

917
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,360
thing you know I'd worry about kind of

918
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,000
doing it by yourself s or like fainting

919
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:02,240
you know from like holding your breath

920
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,960
or not you know well okay so this is the

921
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,278
thing I the first when I first started

922
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,798
doing it I'm like what if I have a heart

923
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:08,000
attack that was kind of like going

924
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:10,200
through my head the first time I did it

925
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,798
I used to dump H ice and I did it we had

926
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:15,080
a jacuzzi tub and I go in the jacuzzi

927
00:32:11,798 --> 00:32:17,000
tub and it was super cold but after a

928
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:18,960
week you start realizing like I even not

929
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,880
doing it every day you start realizing

930
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,278
that you're fine and now even at the

931
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,360
cold temperatures I can go in them and I

932
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:27,240
don't feel like I'm going to faint like

933
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:29,079
you feel a little lightheaded at first

934
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:31,278
but like it's all about breathing and

935
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:33,558
knowing that you're safe I think that's

936
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:35,720
the doing it regularly you develop that

937
00:32:33,558 --> 00:32:38,480
too where you realize that you're safe

938
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:40,360
even if you're going extreme yeah it

939
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,480
really is amazing the power of breath in

940
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:44,638
your brain and like if you can if you

941
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,599
connect those too uh my yoga teacher

942
00:32:44,638 --> 00:32:48,439
back in Colorado you know she's like

943
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:50,158
watch how fast your heart changes when

944
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,639
you focus on your breathing you know and

945
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,600
like or just how like how your shoulders

946
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:56,558
settle you know and everything your face

947
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:59,079
is tight you relax your face all those

948
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:00,440
things like all of a sudden you realize

949
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:02,278
your tongue's not pressing against the

950
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:04,080
top of your throat all the time you know

951
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:05,480
like relax when time really slows down

952
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:07,519
when you're doing co- plunging my my day

953
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,960
goes by like this I mean it seems like I

954
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,319
wake up and I'm doing all these things

955
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,798
and the next thing you know is the next

956
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:14,119
day that's awesome and I think part of

957
00:33:11,798 --> 00:33:16,000
that getting older but also we can look

958
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:17,558
at life in perspective but that that

959
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,919
small amount of time in the morning

960
00:33:17,558 --> 00:33:21,678
whether it's five or 10 or 15 minutes

961
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,480
it's not 15 minutes every day but I've

962
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,679
been doing like building up to the 15

963
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:28,839
minutes very impressive man like that's

964
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:30,840
a lot um but yeah so like it really

965
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:32,038
slows life down and then I don't drink

966
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:34,439
coffee first thing in the morning either

967
00:33:32,038 --> 00:33:35,798
I feel like gives me what I need to wake

968
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,278
up and be I'll drink coffee in the

969
00:33:35,798 --> 00:33:38,759
afternoon or if I smoke a bunch of weed

970
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:41,759
and then I'm like I feel a little tired

971
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:43,119
I'll yeah coffee is the balance I love

972
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:45,319
coffee I love the way it makes me

973
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:46,798
feeling coffee and cannabis I feel like

974
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:49,319
those two are meant to go together like

975
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:51,359
one chefs and coffee working as a

976
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:53,638
chef yeah I mean we're working long

977
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:55,479
hours like coffee is just part of the

978
00:33:53,638 --> 00:33:57,678
job and then with cannabis it kind of

979
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:00,079
balances it used to be with drinking and

980
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:02,000
being a chef you know now it's like

981
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:03,519
growing weed and making seeds and

982
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,759
everything and then like smoking weed

983
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,359
all day you gotta have the coffee to

984
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:09,280
kind of balance it yeah for sure I have

985
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:11,960
appreciated getting older and not having

986
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,200
such a like crazy head esteem you know

987
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,398
like when you're younger it's just like

988
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:16,759
all right dude put your head down and

989
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:18,159
plow through everything and right um

990
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,359
yeah getting older is definitely like

991
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,838
okay like separating things and taking

992
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:26,039
time to listen to your body and heal

993
00:34:22,838 --> 00:34:28,559
your body and yeah um you know some it's

994
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:30,838
it's not all go go go these days you

995
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:32,960
know I gotta have some downtime yeah

996
00:34:30,838 --> 00:34:34,480
well it's funny because there's there's

997
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,119
different ways of doing stuff in life

998
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,918
and I feel like part of the chef

999
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:42,119
mentality is uh because you're you're

1000
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:43,519
working so fast and everything's you're

1001
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:45,760
only as good as your last plate to a

1002
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:47,759
degree absolutely right so like you have

1003
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,960
to make snap decisions and you have to

1004
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,800
be right the first time every time yep

1005
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,000
right and and the thing is is like yeah

1006
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,919
you make mistakes and you learn from

1007
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,480
your mistakes but eventually like in the

1008
00:34:54,918 --> 00:35:00,039
restaurant because it's repetition time

1009
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,838
and time again you learn how to navigate

1010
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:03,320
through those so like you can correct

1011
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:04,838
mistakes where you almost make mistake

1012
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,280
and you correct it right I mean there's

1013
00:35:04,838 --> 00:35:08,078
nights on the line where you're cooking

1014
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:10,480
too where it's like everything's almost

1015
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,920
falling apart literally almost falling

1016
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,800
apart and you feel like you're failing

1017
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,000
the whole time but you pull it off

1018
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,880
nobody else

1019
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,880
knows years exactly it's you know and

1020
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:23,160
the papers D like your [ __ ] tickets

1021
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,559
just keeps stacking up I think those

1022
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:28,319
experiences in the kitchen yeah made

1023
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:30,880
every day in the grow that much easier

1024
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,320
you know because I'm like you're not

1025
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,559
going to burn yourself you're not gonna

1026
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,039
you might cut yourself but it's going to

1027
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:37,480
be a little Nick of some scissors or

1028
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:38,960
something but to deal with all those

1029
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,639
like you just said all those problems

1030
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,358
and all those things that arose all the

1031
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:45,879
time and having to put out the fire

1032
00:35:42,358 --> 00:35:48,279
pivot put out the fire pivot replace it

1033
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:50,200
that yeah well yeah I mean those are

1034
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,280
those are the the things that define you

1035
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:54,519
to a degree and like me mentally also

1036
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:57,319
prepare you you know those type of

1037
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:58,440
moments it's like they really prepare

1038
00:35:57,318 --> 00:36:01,079
you for other things in life and you

1039
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,960
realize how small some of the things

1040
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:05,480
that we worry about so much are too and

1041
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,838
it's like that that phrase this two

1042
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:09,679
Shall Pass right like this two shall the

1043
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:12,000
hard times and the good times absolutely

1044
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:13,559
it's like you know and no matter how bad

1045
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
it seems like it is it's like you're

1046
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:16,920
going to pass into something else

1047
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,079
eventually no matter what and so

1048
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,119
breathing getting through those moments

1049
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:22,680
you know it's like I don't know how many

1050
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:25,318
times over the last 10 years it's like

1051
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:27,719
seemed like it was just tough and it was

1052
00:36:25,318 --> 00:36:29,800
gonna [ __ ] everything was you know at at

1053
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:33,039
the lows but then your lows become highs

1054
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:35,160
and then your highs then become lows ex

1055
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:36,400
somewhere in between and yeah you know

1056
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:38,399
at the end of the day you just have to

1057
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,440
put one foot in front of the other and

1058
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,720
uh you know there there's days where you

1059
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,960
just got to get up and suck it up and

1060
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:46,318
you know you don't just get to stay in

1061
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:50,318
bed you just get up and you you power

1062
00:36:46,318 --> 00:36:52,039
through yeah yeah um I had one I was

1063
00:36:50,318 --> 00:36:54,000
growing you know you you've been out to

1064
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:57,358
the hemp Farm um there was we were

1065
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,280
getting ready for one season and man I

1066
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:02,239
think starting in like November December

1067
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:04,160
I started all the plants I had these

1068
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:06,239
plants perfect like the best looking

1069
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:08,318
mothers completely organic nothing going

1070
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:09,838
on with them as far as bugs which no

1071
00:37:08,318 --> 00:37:11,039
bugs in a greenhouse in Colorado is

1072
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:14,318
pretty easy you know because everything

1073
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:17,239
outside's dead yeah but um we got into

1074
00:37:14,318 --> 00:37:19,400
the cloning and first set of cloning

1075
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:22,679
went great we needed to cut I think it

1076
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:26,000
was 125,000 clones to populate the field

1077
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:28,919
um first 25,000 went fine the next

1078
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,079
100,000 clones uh we would cut them they

1079
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,480
would look perfect we'd walk in the

1080
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:34,760
greenhouse and these things were folded

1081
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:37,318
over within 24 hours and nobody knew

1082
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:38,920
what was going on you know we some

1083
00:37:37,318 --> 00:37:40,119
people oh too much airf flow too much

1084
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,680
humidity you know there all these

1085
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:43,200
opinions but no it was it was some kind

1086
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:44,679
of pathogen that was inside that

1087
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:47,439
Greenhouse that was just jumping in

1088
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:49,399
there and knocking these things out and

1089
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,960
um we didn't even talk about pathogens

1090
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,440
back then I know that was just it you

1091
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,639
know you're like what is it is it

1092
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,400
pythium is it you know we don't know

1093
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:57,480
again we're bro scientists at this point

1094
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,920
you you know just trying to figure it

1095
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:01,760
out and but you're right like getting up

1096
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,000
every morning to go check that

1097
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,280
Greenhouse 24 hours after I cut those

1098
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,239
clones like I didn't even I couldn't

1099
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:10,200
even drink coffee I was so stressed out

1100
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:12,118
I mean sweat would be pouring out of my

1101
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:13,639
hands on the steering wheel and then

1102
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:15,960
just a whip open that Greenhouse door

1103
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:18,719
and see them all folded over yeah you

1104
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:20,800
know I was like okay like pull in the

1105
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:22,719
Bobcat throw all these in the bucket

1106
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,760
bucket goes to compost file you know and

1107
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:28,399
like fo in front of the next do it again

1108
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,760
yep yeah and C cutting that many clones

1109
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,240
that I mean that's like being on the

1110
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:35,319
Viking ship and somebody's just like

1111
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:37,759
boom yeah boom you know you just got to

1112
00:38:35,318 --> 00:38:40,119
keep going you got to keep going so how

1113
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,839
did you go from being a chef to

1114
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:43,880
transition and doing it scale when we

1115
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:46,358
met you you were at scale you've been

1116
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:48,480
working at scale with Farmers hemp

1117
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:51,279
Farmers growing you know massive amounts

1118
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,079
of acres for hemp and huge green houses

1119
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,839
how did you go from being a homeg grower

1120
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:58,519
and a chef to get into that so the

1121
00:38:55,838 --> 00:39:00,039
little bit of medical time um as soon as

1122
00:38:58,519 --> 00:39:03,000
medical popped off a buddy of mine I was

1123
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:05,239
living on an 80 Acre Farm in Colorado um

1124
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,880
we decided to push the envelopes a

1125
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:10,598
little bit we built four big green

1126
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:12,480
houses um I was basically going off of

1127
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:15,079
what I had seen in Greenhouse production

1128
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,280
in in California like through High Times

1129
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:17,480
or what you know I kind of was like okay

1130
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,760
these plants need to be big they need to

1131
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:21,599
fill out the space but we still got to

1132
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:23,359
have some air flow whatever so I had um

1133
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,200
I think it was two seasons under my belt

1134
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:28,119
Colorado outdoor and these big green

1135
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:29,480
houses and that's when all the the

1136
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:32,838
venture capitalist and all that started

1137
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:34,039
to come to Colorado yeah um so yeah a

1138
00:39:32,838 --> 00:39:36,000
bunch of dudes are coming in town with a

1139
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:38,000
bunch of money

1140
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,239
and this one guy had walked through my

1141
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,880
Greenhouse with an iPad and you know

1142
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:43,639
taken a bunch of pictures or whatever

1143
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,880
and um he showed it to one of these guys

1144
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:47,879
and this guy showed up and he's like

1145
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:50,720
you're hired you know you're fired you

1146
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,760
know like this whole it was crazy wow

1147
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:52,759
and I was like well what are we doing

1148
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,040
he's like I want you to look at this

1149
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,240
property and he showed me this property

1150
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:56,759
and he's like we got to rebuild this

1151
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:59,000
thing and I want you to do it exact like

1152
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,640
you did it over there and so yeah man I

1153
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,480
went from four green houses that were

1154
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:07,239
like I don't know 312s to 43,000 square

1155
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,679
feet you know that's crazy I think what

1156
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:09,919
it is is like it's just like being a

1157
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:11,440
chef you know it's like it really

1158
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,079
doesn't matter if you're cooking one

1159
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,000
cover or if you're cooking a thousand

1160
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:18,000
covers you just got to prepare for it

1161
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,480
you know and and yeah just see it all

1162
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,719
the little stuff first all the way out

1163
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:24,400
to the big picture and that's you know I

1164
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:27,159
um I didn't have any staff at the time

1165
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:29,960
so I went to the local skate park I I I

1166
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:31,440
love skateboarders are my dudes like if

1167
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,079
I'm going to hire anybody they're either

1168
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,240
going to be a wrestler from high school

1169
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:36,920
or a skateboarder cuz those two people

1170
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:39,078
are some of the most driven people that

1171
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:40,960
you could ever imagine you know like to

1172
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:43,720
be able to ride a skateboard on a ramp

1173
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,559
or in a park and to fall down repeatedly

1174
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:47,559
exactly do it over and over it over and

1175
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:49,358
over get back up and think about what

1176
00:40:47,559 --> 00:40:51,559
you did wrong and do it again fall down

1177
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:53,440
seven stay up eight yep shout out to

1178
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:55,000

Big Jay he was little Jay that guy

1180
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,358
followed me you know helped me out a ton

1181
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,640
at that place and went to Washington

1182
00:40:58,358 --> 00:41:02,799
with me and yeah yeah man he was a guy

1183
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:04,719
that could like he knew vegetation and

1184
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,280
cloning like just like that was just in

1185
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:08,799
his blood you know yeah it's funny those

1186
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,079
life lessons that you can apply to

1187
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,720
cannabis too it's like you and not even

1188
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:14,519
cannabis but doing everything it kind of

1189
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:16,199
all follows suit like if you want to be

1190
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:18,400
good at something doesn't matter whether

1191
00:41:16,199 --> 00:41:20,439
it's growing or or breeding or whatever

1192
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,119
it's like you want to play the guitar

1193
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,838
you want to learn how to do this or that

1194
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:26,640
you w to you know you got to fail a

1195
00:41:23,838 --> 00:41:28,159
bunch along the way to really learn how

1196
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:30,719
to do it properly or to be really good

1197
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:32,279
at it yep yeah it's it's very much using

1198
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:34,679
your eyes you know it's using your brain

1199
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:36,000
and using your eyes and uh looking at

1200
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:37,559
things and yeah you should be able to

1201
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,119
read a plant just by looking at it you

1202
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:41,119
know like what's going on with that

1203
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,160
plant like is it are the stems green all

1204
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:43,480
the way through or does it have any

1205
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:44,679
little purple streaks going through it

1206
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,000
like oh looks like you missed out on

1207
00:41:44,679 --> 00:41:48,078
some night right there dude you know

1208
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,599
like just being yeah just being able to

1209
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:52,560
read those plants like that and read it

1210
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:54,160
from afar and well in repetition over

1211
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:56,000
and over and over and learning how to do

1212
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:58,239
it your own way yep and and you know all

1213
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,800
these cultivars they're all just like

1214
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:01,439
anybody else in your life you know like

1215
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:04,480
you know certain things about them it's

1216
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,159
like okay like that Afghan or that hash

1217
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,199
plant you know like she likes to be a

1218
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:10,039
little bit wider and a little bit lomer

1219
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:13,358
soil she doesn't like all that water she

1220
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:15,480
doesn't like dense soil you know um OG

1221
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:17,440
ge's as little of water as possible but

1222
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:19,000
as often as possible you know with a ton

1223
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,599
of calcium and magnesium to help things

1224
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,719
move around in that little spaghetti

1225
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:27,318
like stem you know like it's just yeah

1226
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:30,039
they all have their nuances and OG you

1227
00:42:27,318 --> 00:42:31,880
don't je like my favorite stuff but dude

1228
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:35,159
yeah it's just like come on girl like

1229
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:37,160
stand up straight um yeah it's just yeah

1230
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:38,480
it's getting to know them all and um and

1231
00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:40,159
how they work for you you know and I

1232
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,800
think like that's what we saw like

1233
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:44,039
especially in Colorado um you know like

1234
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,119
it's really hard to find a dispensary

1235
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:49,440
that's got like pre98 Bubba Kush now

1236
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:52,640
because like the pl there's a whole

1237
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:54,159
bigger oh it fit into the I mean it

1238
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:55,799
finished early there was definitely

1239
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:57,558
benefits but the pre-98 isn't really

1240
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,599
what you see today you see a Bubba cush

1241
00:42:57,559 --> 00:43:01,839
that the one that finishes in like 50

1242
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:05,680
days I think I think that's Burgers

1243
00:43:01,838 --> 00:43:07,519
right I'm pretty sure um yeah yeah that

1244
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:09,000
was just it you know like it it was a

1245
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:10,759
little bit longer to clone so it kind of

1246
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,960
screwed up your twoe routine and your

1247
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:14,599
and your clone there and then as opposed

1248
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,760
to having it ready for the feel in 21

1249
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:18,960
days it might need 35 so then it screwed

1250
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:20,720
up your time and veg and then you know

1251
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:23,838
you got this huge canopy I mean you saw

1252
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:25,759
it had 14 foot 14 foot wide blue dreams

1253
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:27,480
or whatever you know Super Lemon hazes

1254
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,800
yeah then you got this little Fu dream

1255
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,358
or this little bubba cush you know

1256
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,280
hanging out and you know investors are

1257
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:33,480
walking by they're like what's wrong

1258
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:35,440
with that one yeah you're like

1259
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,240
absolutely nothing it just doesn't look

1260
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,000
like that one you know right well

1261
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:41,159
California we had the mids Market was

1262
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,599
filled with Bubba and they grew it at

1263
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:46,159
scale like you wouldn't believe yeah um

1264
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:48,960
so but then that's kind of transitioned

1265
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:51,558
into the runs gelato Lemon Cherry gelato

1266
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:55,000
runs yeah you know gelato all the

1267
00:43:51,559 --> 00:43:56,760
different gelato 33 41s you guys it's

1268
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,400
crazy because I'm you know in Colorado

1269
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:00,040
I'm always about 2 and a half years

1270
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,680
behind what you guys are up to like it

1271
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:03,440
takes that long for us to actually get

1272
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:04,960
our hands on it typically unless you

1273
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,240
know you got the plug over here that's

1274
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,000
eventually it's GNA come back all the

1275
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:09,078
way

1276
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,079
around yeah I think it's I think it's

1277
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:13,359
fun to watch new markets open up because

1278
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:15,559
that's when you find some of these trins

1279
00:44:13,358 --> 00:44:17,318
that we considered gone you know it's

1280
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:18,800
like well some dude in Oklahoma's had it

1281
00:44:17,318 --> 00:44:21,279
in his closet for 20 years just talking

1282
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:23,680
to Crockett we were talking about Green

1283
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,960
Crack I like green crack yeah I really

1284
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:26,679
like green crack now it doesn't

1285
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,639
necessarily fit into

1286
00:44:26,679 --> 00:44:32,039
the commercially popular varieties of

1287
00:44:29,639 --> 00:44:33,679
cannabis that we're enjoying today on

1288
00:44:32,039 --> 00:44:36,039
the the wreck Market but it could make

1289
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:38,759
it comeb back but either way I like the

1290
00:44:36,039 --> 00:44:42,440
I like some of the traits I like the

1291
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:44,240
effect especially um you know the the

1292
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:46,599
effect where it just hits you hard but

1293
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:47,959
then you build a tolerance to it yeah

1294
00:44:46,599 --> 00:44:49,079
it's a fun one to grow and it's quick

1295
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,440
you know like I mean it's it's

1296
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:53,680
definitely like it's a userfriendly

1297
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:55,358
plant pretty much from A to Z like um

1298
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:59,000
yeah definitely has a spot to be

1299
00:44:55,358 --> 00:45:00,358
appreciated totally so with food you

1300
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,159
kind of I think one of the biggest

1301
00:45:00,358 --> 00:45:03,440
things is you build this foundation and

1302
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:05,078
you learn how to make a dish and then

1303
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,800
make your own twist to it as a chef

1304
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:08,318
right so like if you're coming in

1305
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,280
whereas with breeding it's like a

1306
00:45:08,318 --> 00:45:10,679
different thought process but you've

1307
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:14,119
been getting into breeding too over the

1308
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:16,838
last year how's that going it's good um

1309
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:18,599
I look at it more of like a part of me

1310
00:45:16,838 --> 00:45:21,119
wants to be a preservation breeder you

1311
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:22,559
know and increase what's already I I

1312
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,160
would hate for something to go away just

1313
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:27,119
because people lost interest in it you

1314
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:28,598
know I'm I'm old enough to know that

1315
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:30,559
like one day jenos are going to come

1316
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:33,680
back you know what I mean like all these

1317
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:35,040
oh jenos are like $400 a pair on eBay

1318
00:45:33,679 --> 00:45:36,318
like I saw somebody wearing doc Marts

1319
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:38,318
the other day I'm like wow that reminds

1320
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:39,800
me of 1994 in high school you know punk

1321
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:42,960
rock scene which is even older than that

1322
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:44,359
but yeah I think it all um it all comes

1323
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,800
back around so what I was first

1324
00:45:44,358 --> 00:45:49,639
concerned about um I wanted to I want to

1325
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:51,359
push as many canabo into a plant as I

1326
00:45:49,639 --> 00:45:54,039
could yeah and that was kind of coming

1327
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:55,159
from the Hempfield to the lab um because

1328
00:45:54,039 --> 00:45:57,239
it used to be kind of a pain in the ass

1329
00:45:55,159 --> 00:45:58,920
to be like oh well I've got this CBG

1330
00:45:57,239 --> 00:46:01,078
strain here that's this section of the

1331
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:03,639
field I've got this CBC over here this

1332
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:06,440
is CBD yeah this is all my

1333
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:08,679
vas and I would have to you know batch

1334
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:10,119
them for the lab to figure it out versus

1335
00:46:08,679 --> 00:46:11,519
knowing what happens in the lab and the

1336
00:46:10,119 --> 00:46:13,280
fact that they can just spill over

1337
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:15,318
whatever they want to spill over and and

1338
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:18,040
grab it right so I started working on a

1339
00:46:15,318 --> 00:46:20,000
project I called it the Noid it dates me

1340
00:46:18,039 --> 00:46:23,199
from the old Domino's commercials you

1341
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,079
know like avoid the Noid uh so just the

1342
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:27,000
canabo plant and I really wanted to just

1343
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:28,680
push as much as I could into that and I

1344
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,960
wasn't really you were looking for the

1345
00:46:28,679 --> 00:46:32,919
most amount of diversity or complexity

1346
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,440
as POS as you could possibly push into a

1347
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:38,318
plant yep and what I ended up with I

1348
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:43,159
mean this thing is nasty like she is uh

1349
00:46:38,318 --> 00:46:45,199
loaded with d g lot lots of c um but

1350
00:46:43,159 --> 00:46:48,679
she's stinky she is very much like a

1351
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:50,439
Hindu Kush um so then I took that and I

1352
00:46:48,679 --> 00:46:53,480
put it into other things like Puck you

1353
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:55,559
know like old more hash plans just yeah

1354
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:57,039
just to kind of go B BX on that and

1355
00:46:55,559 --> 00:46:58,800
because because the fact like that that

1356
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:00,318
puck was that's one of the hardest

1357
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,200
plants I've ever had to hang on to like

1358
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:05,400
she is so finicky and yeah um so yeah

1359
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:07,598
kind of do an increase on that and

1360
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:09,039
then I also wanted to do for the hemp

1361
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:11,519
Farmers I wanted to do you know triple

1362
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:16,159
crop was becoming a big thing um you

1363
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:18,519
know to get your seed um your fiber and

1364
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:20,358
your canabo all in one plant the perfect

1365
00:47:18,519 --> 00:47:22,759
plant yeah so I was trying to go for

1366
00:47:20,358 --> 00:47:25,318
something that was like 14 feet tall you

1367
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:27,119
know with like no offshoots at all and

1368
00:47:25,318 --> 00:47:28,719
then I was packing on like about a foot

1369
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:30,680
foot and a half tall Cola on the top

1370
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:33,358
that's just load to with seeds so

1371
00:47:30,679 --> 00:47:37,199
basically breeding the interex traits

1372
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:39,078
into it and having the complete yeah yep

1373
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:41,399
yeah because I was realizing you know as

1374
00:47:39,079 --> 00:47:43,000
modern well hemp farming in Europe you

1375
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:45,079
know they take the tops off the plant

1376
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,559
grab everything they want there and then

1377
00:47:45,079 --> 00:47:47,920
they let it you know basically sit in

1378
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:50,000
the field for a little bit longer and

1379
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:52,079
that outter it'll decorticate itself

1380
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,880
really It'll like take the just sheath

1381
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:55,359
off you know yeah so then you got that

1382
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,720
pure fiber down below it so I was trying

1383
00:47:55,358 --> 00:47:59,358
to go for that where I was like okay

1384
00:47:56,719 --> 00:48:01,078
Harvest your canabo and your food

1385
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:03,119
products first and then come back and

1386
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:07,640
get your fiber content

1387
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:10,800
last but yeah now I'm like I don't know

1388
00:48:07,639 --> 00:48:11,838
I I I I love like all this purple gassy

1389
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,400
stuff like we were just talking about

1390
00:48:11,838 --> 00:48:16,440
Star Killer and stuff like that I love

1391
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:18,240
star killer I I yeah I mean the thing is

1392
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:20,838
is with the green I feel

1393
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:24,558
like you want stronger stuff it's going

1394
00:48:20,838 --> 00:48:27,039
to be green and not purple right um so

1395
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:28,079
yeah as far as people people always want

1396
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:29,440
what they can't have they want this

1397
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:31,359
purple stuff and then they want it to be

1398
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,679
super potent and it's like there is some

1399
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:36,078
stuff that's borderline strong but

1400
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:38,719
there's not it's not like the gassy

1401
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:42,280
stuff no that gassy stuff was its own

1402
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:45,439
era or the hazy stuff again yeah like

1403
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:47,480
wow you know like some of the first good

1404
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:49,079
weed that I got um there's a dude around

1405
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:52,000
Athens Georgia that was growing this

1406
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:54,359
swazi oh dude the swazi yeah the swazi

1407
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,920
and like I mean you could take five

1408
00:48:54,358 --> 00:48:59,318
little kexes and put put it into a bowl

1409
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:01,159
and go throw a frisbee for 4 hours you

1410
00:48:59,318 --> 00:49:02,920
know it's like completely psychedelic

1411
00:49:01,159 --> 00:49:04,719
and I mean it's completely ceiling the

1412
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:07,760
higher you the more you smoke the higher

1413
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:09,558
you got um most of the stuff isn't like

1414
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:11,280
that now it's not like that at all and a

1415
00:49:09,559 --> 00:49:13,440
quarter of it was like that big you know

1416
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:17,559
yeah you see a lot of stuff in Europe

1417
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:19,240
too seriously yeah 16 weeks not it's not

1418
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:21,200
announced like nope it's just it's just

1419
00:49:19,239 --> 00:49:22,679
a big quarter yeah that's funny but yeah

1420
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:24,558
that stuff I was tripping on acid one

1421
00:49:22,679 --> 00:49:26,239
night and the homie came through with a

1422
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:28,200
jar of it and

1423
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:30,598
it literally shut down my ability to

1424
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:35,838
speak like I had to had to totally shut

1425
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:38,039
it just like I can't talk right yeah so

1426
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:39,838
uh what is the favorite what's your

1427
00:49:38,039 --> 00:49:43,880
favorite thing to grow and what's the

1428
00:49:39,838 --> 00:49:46,960
the best thing you've ever smoked oo

1429
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:50,240
um man right now my favorite thing to

1430
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:52,679
grow um and it was a total accident it

1431
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:54,439
came out of my old trap I had a room

1432
00:49:52,679 --> 00:49:57,318
full of Kim and I had a room full of

1433
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:59,240
crippy and I found one seed in a crippy

1434
00:49:57,318 --> 00:50:02,759
Bud and I popped that thing and it

1435
00:49:59,239 --> 00:50:04,439
turned into this like OG KB looking

1436
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:08,040
plant slow

1437
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:11,119
growing silver purple it's got like this

1438
00:50:08,039 --> 00:50:12,880
almost like a soapy piffy smell to it

1439
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,119
really heavy buzz like it's really

1440
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:17,519
crippy in the

1441
00:50:14,119 --> 00:50:20,160
buzz um I called it the ducky because

1442
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:23,039
it's got just a complete duck leaf and

1443
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:25,519
that's my son's nickname just by

1444
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:28,199
coincidence so the ducky is my favorite

1445
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:29,719
to grow right now it's definitely not

1446
00:50:28,199 --> 00:50:31,159
it'll never be a production strain

1447
00:50:29,719 --> 00:50:34,598
there's no way it can be it's just too

1448
00:50:31,159 --> 00:50:36,239
slow um but I am you know I try to run

1449
00:50:34,599 --> 00:50:39,079
through all the hypy stuff you know I

1450
00:50:36,239 --> 00:50:41,239

at MJ Biz this year him and I are

1485
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:56,759
releasing Sage Against the Machine

1486
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:58,280
crosses oh [ __ ] so yeah is that part of

1487
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:59,839
the sage and sour project yeah that was

1488
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:03,160
the sage and sour I made the seeds and

1489
00:51:59,838 --> 00:52:04,440
he yeah he helped curate the man the

1490
00:52:03,159 --> 00:52:06,239
stuff and he did the packaging and all

1491
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,880
that but I did the breeding work I was

1492
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:10,399
on his show we smoked some sage and sour

1493
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:12,000
that a buddy had sifted and was it sage

1494
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,798
and sour crosses or was it was it actual

1495
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,519
Sage s it was a sage and sour from a few

1496
00:52:13,798 --> 00:52:18,480
years back it was wild man it was really

1497
00:52:16,519 --> 00:52:21,079
I love sage and sour I love the one that

1498
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:23,798
has the open bud structure the most

1499
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:26,559
where it's not the nested not the nested

1500
00:52:23,798 --> 00:52:29,280
bra but very open and yeah podil where

1501
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:31,040
the bra stack but like that that stuff

1502
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,599
we had it Harbor we used to get it at

1503
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:35,880
Harborside too okay that stuff tasted

1504
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:39,400
crazy it tasted it tasted like a blend

1505
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:41,280
of sour and Sage with a lot of gas in it

1506
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:43,400
and it was just really that's awesome it

1507
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:45,119
was a really unique flavor yeah man I

1508
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:47,039
love all the Diesels like I I still hang

1509
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:48,318
on to the day record um I've got a

1510
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:50,440
couple I've got like an East Coast Sour

1511
00:52:48,318 --> 00:52:52,318
Diesel I like a lot I just um I've got

1512
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:54,960
an Alban s diesel that I'm really

1513
00:52:52,318 --> 00:52:56,558
digging on um yeah so I like those old

1514
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,679
flavor flors but you know I'm not scared

1515
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:01,640
to try anything new um I just don't I

1516
00:52:58,679 --> 00:53:03,598
don't I don't get the potency on some of

1517
00:53:01,639 --> 00:53:06,519
the newer stuff that I prefer the taste

1518
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:08,039
is amazing you know I think back on my

1519
00:53:06,519 --> 00:53:10,079
younger self I'm like man if I was

1520
00:53:08,039 --> 00:53:11,719
smoking this when I was 19 like I I

1521
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:12,720
wouldn't leave the couch you know I just

1522
00:53:11,719 --> 00:53:14,919
sit here and smoke this all day it

1523
00:53:12,719 --> 00:53:17,279
tastes so good and it tastes so good so

1524
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:19,200
I find myself with some of these rosins

1525
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,798
where I'll like have them in a jar and

1526
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:23,239
while I'm watching TV or something I

1527
00:53:20,798 --> 00:53:24,960
keep smelling it over and over taking

1528
00:53:23,239 --> 00:53:26,000
the TPS away from it but you know it's

1529
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,679
like

1530
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,318
yeah taking all the aroma out of it but

1531
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:31,798
yeah I mean I enjoy just the smell of

1532
00:53:30,318 --> 00:53:33,440
the stuff and I feel like that's one of

1533
00:53:31,798 --> 00:53:35,679
the the beauties of the cannabis plant

1534
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:37,358
is like it has these amazing profiles

1535
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:39,519
that we can really relate to and we get

1536
00:53:37,358 --> 00:53:40,798
excited about totally man it's such a

1537
00:53:39,519 --> 00:53:42,639
diverse plant and that's kind of like

1538
00:53:40,798 --> 00:53:46,199
what I was saying earlier I feel like

1539
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:49,400
it's and you know I'm just a dude but

1540
00:53:46,199 --> 00:53:51,159
like I feel I find it impossible that

1541
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:52,880
everything else like cannabis can smell

1542
00:53:51,159 --> 00:53:54,358
like everything like how is that

1543
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,079
possible like it seems like that has to

1544
00:53:54,358 --> 00:53:58,279
be like the first plant that it created

1545
00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:00,160
tpin and like everything else like

1546
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:01,760
evolved into well it's interesting CU

1547
00:54:00,159 --> 00:54:03,199
you think you could take cucumbers and

1548
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:06,680
breed them into all kinds of I mean

1549
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:08,679
there lemon cucumbers right so cannabis

1550
00:54:06,679 --> 00:54:11,318
is the most cultivated plant on the

1551
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:13,519
planet there is more variet not not most

1552
00:54:11,318 --> 00:54:15,679
cultivated but there's more diversity in

1553
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:17,400
cultivated cannabis than anything else

1554
00:54:15,679 --> 00:54:20,480
so what if we applied all that same

1555
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:23,200
diversity to cucumbers or you know

1556
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:24,880
anything cruciferous related from yeah

1557
00:54:23,199 --> 00:54:25,598
yeah my latest pivot man I kind of you

1558
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,318
know

1559
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:28,720
I'm not done with cannabis by any means

1560
00:54:27,318 --> 00:54:31,318
but the industry is just in a place

1561
00:54:28,719 --> 00:54:32,719
where I'm not as involved right now you

1562
00:54:31,318 --> 00:54:34,880
know kind of taking a step back watching

1563
00:54:32,719 --> 00:54:36,480
the plan Circle The Runway a little bit

1564
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:39,119
um doing some behind the scenes work

1565
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,719
that you know I I feel will be prudent

1566
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:43,358
work whenever I want to pop it back in

1567
00:54:40,719 --> 00:54:47,959
but um I met a really awesome dude Grant

1568
00:54:43,358 --> 00:54:50,078
my man um this guy's got a a a a flower

1569
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:51,480
farm yeah and uh dude that's been the

1570
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:55,119
biggest pivot for me is like growing

1571
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:56,920
these dollas and um like checking out

1572
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:59,079
you talk about a diverse plant you know

1573
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:00,519
like these dollas they have I forget the

1574
00:54:59,079 --> 00:55:02,559
set of chromosomes they have but it's

1575
00:55:00,519 --> 00:55:04,079
very similar to cannabis where you know

1576
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:05,559
you can start breeding something and you

1577
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:08,318
might not get anything that looks like

1578
00:55:05,559 --> 00:55:09,680
mother or father you know totally with

1579
00:55:08,318 --> 00:55:12,279
all these recessive traits and then

1580
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:14,719
inbreeding too yeah but yeah it's funny

1581
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:17,720
like if you look at

1582
00:55:14,719 --> 00:55:20,000
cruciferous and how it evolved into like

1583
00:55:17,719 --> 00:55:21,558
rasa like wild mustard how it evolved

1584
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,119
into all these different things they're

1585
00:55:21,559 --> 00:55:26,200
talking about broccoli cabbage yeah I

1586
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:27,720
mean it's wild all these all these

1587
00:55:26,199 --> 00:55:29,358
different expressions like there's that

1588
00:55:27,719 --> 00:55:31,558
amount of diversity too like if you go

1589
00:55:29,358 --> 00:55:32,920
back into something like wild mustard

1590
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:35,599
but like the potential for what we can

1591
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:37,159
do with the plant even more we're we're

1592
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:38,640
just it's not that we're scratching the

1593
00:55:37,159 --> 00:55:40,838
surface we've done a lot of interesting

1594
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:42,558
stuff but in some ways with technology

1595
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:44,318
we're scratching the surface the

1596
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:46,319
potential is going to be even more

1597
00:55:44,318 --> 00:55:48,639
amazing I think in the future yeah I

1598
00:55:46,318 --> 00:55:50,920
think you're right man we're you

1599
00:55:48,639 --> 00:55:52,759
know back when we were playing with it

1600
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:53,920
it wasn't you know you weren't allowed

1601
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,720
to play with this stuff you know so

1602
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:57,480
everything had to be kept quiet you know

1603
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:59,239
it was very much of quiet Society you

1604
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:01,119
know and now it's like we can share the

1605
00:55:59,239 --> 00:56:02,399
information we can share the cut

1606
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:03,880
everybody's talking about it you know

1607
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,000
it's like yeah or you know like you're

1608
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,318
going to have the ability to sell

1609
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,318
somebody their favorite cut and it'll

1610
00:56:06,318 --> 00:56:10,519
show up 24 hours after they click a

1611
00:56:08,318 --> 00:56:13,119
button you know like yeah that's amazing

1612
00:56:10,519 --> 00:56:14,798
like before it used to be dude start

1613
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:16,440
going through the Old Hippie Rolodex and

1614
00:56:14,798 --> 00:56:18,960
see who you knew and track it down or

1615
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:22,119
you know whatever and yeah make a long

1616
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:23,960
trip a road trip a dangerous one

1617
00:56:22,119 --> 00:56:27,640
dangerous one yeah cuz you got your weed

1618
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:30,000
on you totally yeah so you grew you well

1619
00:56:27,639 --> 00:56:31,719
you've grown in both Colorado and

1620
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,318
Washington so you were in Washington for

1621
00:56:31,719 --> 00:56:35,318
a little while and those are the most

1622
00:56:33,318 --> 00:56:37,119
opposite places on the whole planet as

1623
00:56:35,318 --> 00:56:40,920
far as cultivation is concerned you're

1624
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:44,798
talking about super dry Colorado versus

1625
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:47,599
super humid Washington and I was 20 22

1626
00:56:44,798 --> 00:56:50,759
miles from the beach so it was yeah man

1627
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:53,000
fog rolled in every morning um big

1628
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:55,000
learning curve there big learning curve

1629
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,760
um and that again that's when I really

1630
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,960
started to figure out like the

1631
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:01,119
microbiology behind things you know yeah

1632
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:02,280
like if you keep the traderma pumping

1633
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:04,160
you're going to keep a lot of those

1634
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:05,960
problems away um we brought some strains

1635
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:08,358
up from Colorado that were hitters you

1636
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:10,199
know like this old Purple Diesel we had

1637
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:12,639
it th it was was that like the Oregon

1638
00:57:10,199 --> 00:57:15,279
diesel um one of the purple fenos of it

1639
00:57:12,639 --> 00:57:16,879
or you know I don't know it came from my

1640
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:18,559
experience it came out of a dispensary

1641
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:20,200
in Colorado I think when we were when we

1642
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:22,039
were sourcing plants in the very

1643
00:57:20,199 --> 00:57:24,318
beginning I remember Purple Diesel from

1644
00:57:22,039 --> 00:57:25,920
Colorado it was good and it it it

1645
00:57:24,318 --> 00:57:27,400
performed really well and the yield was

1646
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:30,318
really well but we took that strain to

1647
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:32,920
Washington State and um we set up a

1648
00:57:30,318 --> 00:57:35,358
little like kind of R&amp;D medical

1649
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:37,000
Greenhouse you know whatever and uh I

1650
00:57:35,358 --> 00:57:38,960
remember putting like 22 of these plants

1651
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,280
out and seeing a little bit of Bud rot

1652
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:42,400
and I was like okay you know we're all

1653
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:44,480
right we're yeah we'll carve that out

1654
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:47,200
yeah the next day you could walk up and

1655
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:49,599
just like slop the whole thing on the

1656
00:57:47,199 --> 00:57:51,480
ground I was like okay you know we got

1657
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:53,519
to we got to learn a lot about how to

1658
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:55,798
move this air around and dry this air

1659
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:58,838
out and yeah yeah

1660
00:57:55,798 --> 00:58:01,400
yeah struggles huge well then genetics

1661
00:57:58,838 --> 00:58:03,400
it's like field testing the stuff that

1662
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:05,760
works good in Colorado does not

1663
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:08,160
necessarily work in Washington

1664
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:10,640
especially for outdoor so doing proper

1665
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:12,838
field testing and being able to identify

1666
00:58:10,639 --> 00:58:15,038
what works well it's so different than

1667
00:58:12,838 --> 00:58:18,078
indoor people don't really always

1668
00:58:15,039 --> 00:58:19,720
understand how much different and how

1669
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:22,599
plants respond in a different you could

1670
00:58:19,719 --> 00:58:25,038
have the same exact cultivar in in

1671
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:26,119
Washington or in Colorado you're going

1672
00:58:25,039 --> 00:58:28,039
to get a different expression of the

1673
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:30,079
plant 100% And I think you know a lot of

1674
00:58:28,039 --> 00:58:31,559
that's UV a lot of it you know like um

1675
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:33,960
altitude is a big thing too you know

1676
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:36,599
like in Boulder Colorado we're kind of

1677
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:38,440
sitting similar to like a Hindu Kush

1678
00:58:36,599 --> 00:58:40,760
Afghani environment you know we're kind

1679
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:43,920
of high desert very Aid cold weather

1680
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:45,240
cold nights dry as dry as and so like

1681
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,440
yeah these plants want to stay close to

1682
00:58:45,239 --> 00:58:48,838
the ground they want to spread their

1683
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:50,440
feet out you know versus some of these

1684
00:58:48,838 --> 00:58:52,159
tropical varieties that want to shoot up

1685
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:53,679
like a pole to out compete anything that

1686
00:58:52,159 --> 00:58:55,399
might be near them right you know

1687
00:58:53,679 --> 00:58:57,038
they've got a kind of a narrow root

1688
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:59,160
stock that doesn't go out too far that

1689
00:58:57,039 --> 00:59:00,640
way you can pack them in tighter yeah um

1690
00:58:59,159 --> 00:59:03,440
yeah it's just all these different it's

1691
00:59:00,639 --> 00:59:06,000
been cool and you know I think about

1692
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:07,760
like Oklahoma I'm like okay now you kind

1693
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,079
of got Colorado but then you're throwing

1694
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:12,119
in all that humidity and that heat and

1695
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:14,280
then you already have like natural

1696
00:59:12,119 --> 00:59:16,280
fungus blowing around in that wind

1697
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:18,519
totally I mean there's tons of stuff and

1698
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:20,119
then you go further south it's like I

1699
00:59:18,519 --> 00:59:21,838
mean Tomatoes yeah they grow great in

1700
00:59:20,119 --> 00:59:23,480
the South but they also get tons of

1701
00:59:21,838 --> 00:59:25,519
pathogens you know for sure and then you

1702
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:28,400
go to Florida yeah you know now you're

1703
00:59:25,519 --> 00:59:31,079
growing in a swamp you know so it yeah

1704
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:34,639
indoor versus anything else you have to

1705
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:36,000
have the it's so different and nothing

1706
00:59:34,639 --> 00:59:37,598
against a good indoor grower you know

1707
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,079
because I mean it it takes the eyes and

1708
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:40,400
it takes the effort whatever you're

1709
00:59:39,079 --> 00:59:42,400
doing to get it whatever you're doing

1710
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:44,079
yeah if there's passion involved like I

1711
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:46,639
mean and it's not easy that's the thing

1712
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:49,000
is it's like it's it's easy to every

1713
00:59:46,639 --> 00:59:52,400
once in a while get lucky in a small hom

1714
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:54,639
grower you know to to do it at scale is

1715
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:56,079
so different right like yeah and to be a

1716
00:59:54,639 --> 00:59:57,519
able to produce good flower at scale it

1717
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:59,000
takes a special eye and it doesn't

1718
00:59:57,519 --> 01:00:01,480
matter whether it's outdoor at scale or

1719
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,318
indoor at scale or whatever it is like

1720
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:06,199
there's learning curves to all of it and

1721
01:00:03,318 --> 01:00:07,480
being able to move past the tough times

1722
01:00:06,199 --> 01:00:09,038
yeah and everybody you know everybody

1723
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:10,798
likes doing anything the first time when

1724
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:11,799
it's fun and it looks good you know it's

1725
01:00:10,798 --> 01:00:13,079
like oh man we got this brand new

1726
01:00:11,798 --> 01:00:14,798
facility we're gonna crank out let's see

1727
01:00:13,079 --> 01:00:16,039
what we can hit you know but then you

1728
01:00:14,798 --> 01:00:17,199
got to keep doing it you got to keep

1729
01:00:16,039 --> 01:00:18,839
doing it you got to keep doing it you

1730
01:00:17,199 --> 01:00:20,078
got to keep showing up you know and

1731
01:00:18,838 --> 01:00:21,358
right you can't get comfortable with

1732
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:23,280
what you think you're doing because

1733
01:00:21,358 --> 01:00:25,239
eventually you're going to fall off your

1734
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:27,119
own path you know like takes almost

1735
01:00:25,239 --> 01:00:29,838
somebody else to be like hey man let's

1736
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:31,400
bring it back this way you know right so

1737
01:00:29,838 --> 01:00:33,440
yeah it's it's very much like you got to

1738
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:35,880
be your own cheerleader you got to be a

1739
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:38,000
lot that's life though that's you got to

1740
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:40,280
be your cheerleader in life but that's a

1741
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,679
great example of yeah you know

1742
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:43,079
motivating other people to be there with

1743
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:45,719
you you know you're like all right man

1744
01:00:43,079 --> 01:00:47,480
like we got a thousand plans to take

1745
01:00:45,719 --> 01:00:50,919
down a day you know like we don't stop

1746
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:52,920
at 12 yeah yeah well I mean I used to

1747
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:55,000
sleep a lot less and now I'm forcing

1748
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:56,760
myself to sleep more but I you know it's

1749
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,280
like as we've gotten older it's like I

1750
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:00,720
when I was in my 30s I'm like I only

1751
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:03,519
need four hours 5 hours of sleep maybe

1752
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:04,558
and and you know in partying when I was

1753
01:01:03,519 --> 01:01:06,038
younger that was different but then I

1754
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:07,519
went through this phase where I'm like I

1755
01:01:06,039 --> 01:01:09,920
don't need a lot of sleep I can do it

1756
01:01:07,519 --> 01:01:12,199
but like I value sleep now because I

1757
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:14,000
feel like for for health for health for

1758
01:01:12,199 --> 01:01:15,480
health I value sleep and you know it's

1759
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,760
like and then being as productive as

1760
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:20,440
possible during the day is you know

1761
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:22,119
agreed um I love my wife for giving me

1762
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:24,720
that right now you know she's like dude

1763
01:01:22,119 --> 01:01:26,559
you need to get that morning sleep you

1764
01:01:24,719 --> 01:01:29,639
know you need to rest like because as a

1765
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:31,480
farmer the past what Henry's 11 I've

1766
01:01:29,639 --> 01:01:33,598
been doing it longer than that you know

1767
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:36,719
for cannabis so yeah I mean man we're up

1768
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:40,240
at 5:00 4:30 5:00 you know in the field

1769
01:01:36,719 --> 01:01:41,480
by 6 in the greenhouse by 6:30 7 o'clock

1770
01:01:40,239 --> 01:01:43,798
but I mean it's a greenhouse so you got

1771
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:45,000
to be out of there by like 2:30 you're

1772
01:01:43,798 --> 01:01:47,759
still going to you know you're going to

1773
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:50,519
have a life but Life Starts early and

1774
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:52,000
then you take all that stress and then

1775
01:01:50,519 --> 01:01:53,278
years and years and years and years of

1776
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,039
that compound and all of a sudden you

1777
01:01:53,278 --> 01:01:56,599
know I don't know some days I'm going

1778
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:58,359
down the stairs I feel like an old

1779
01:01:56,599 --> 01:02:00,720
uncooked spaghetti noodle I'm crack

1780
01:01:58,358 --> 01:02:03,440
crack crack and it's like I know the

1781
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:05,519
feeling interes with cooking it's better

1782
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:07,079
than not that it's better than cooking

1783
01:02:05,519 --> 01:02:09,440
it's different than cooking being a chef

1784
01:02:07,079 --> 01:02:11,880
and that that's a whole different sort

1785
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:14,200
of toll that that takes on your body too

1786
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:15,599
I agree and and different kind of stress

1787
01:02:14,199 --> 01:02:18,519
we have different stresses now about

1788
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:19,760
plants rather than food but it's like

1789
01:02:18,519 --> 01:02:22,679
and all those things are character

1790
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:25,319
building for sure man I wouldn't trade a

1791
01:02:22,679 --> 01:02:27,719
thing like being a chef taught me

1792
01:02:25,318 --> 01:02:29,880
yeah it put my like this is how you

1793
01:02:27,719 --> 01:02:31,159
become a man this is how you stay a man

1794
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:32,440
like you know these are the things

1795
01:02:31,159 --> 01:02:34,759
you're going to focus or you're going to

1796
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:36,358
have to face and focus on and if you

1797
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:37,559
don't then you're not going to be a chef

1798
01:02:36,358 --> 01:02:39,920
very long or you're not going to be a

1799
01:02:37,559 --> 01:02:42,839
top you know a head chef very long no

1800
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:44,278
and and I think if you want to be a chef

1801
01:02:42,838 --> 01:02:46,639
or if you want to be a girl the biggest

1802
01:02:44,278 --> 01:02:48,798
thing is realizing where you're really

1803
01:02:46,639 --> 01:02:50,400
at and you know it's like because you

1804
01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:52,199
can improve if you know that you can

1805
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,400
improve you can improve but if you think

1806
01:02:52,199 --> 01:02:55,879
you've got it all figured out that's

1807
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:57,639
when you you know you failed to a degree

1808
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:59,798
because there's always Improvement

1809
01:02:57,639 --> 01:03:01,239
there's always room for improvement and

1810
01:02:59,798 --> 01:03:03,079
going through life it's like whether

1811
01:03:01,239 --> 01:03:04,838
you're a chef like being able to take a

1812
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:06,960
step back and get rid of the ego I think

1813
01:03:04,838 --> 01:03:08,400
that's ties into the mushrooms too even

1814
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:11,240
like yeah I mean being able to get rid

1815
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:13,680
of your ego and real realize who you are

1816
01:03:11,239 --> 01:03:15,719
and authenticity is such a big thing now

1817
01:03:13,679 --> 01:03:17,679
too as we've gotten older it's like I

1818
01:03:15,719 --> 01:03:19,959
think being authentic is so

1819
01:03:17,679 --> 01:03:22,598
important yeah I I thought that I worked

1820
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:24,798
with a lot of egotistical Maniacs in The

1821
01:03:22,599 --> 01:03:26,440
Culinary world but

1822
01:03:24,798 --> 01:03:29,038
nothing on these breeders when I got

1823
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:30,720
into cannabis man I'm like wow like yeah

1824
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:33,278
cannabis is a whole another like and I

1825
01:03:30,719 --> 01:03:35,480
think is like the whole Rockstar side of

1826
01:03:33,278 --> 01:03:37,440
it but the funny thing is is like as

1827
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:40,079
funny as like the whole Rockstar side of

1828
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:42,079
these guys and people wanting to be you

1829
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:43,920
know pot celebrities or whatever we're

1830
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:45,278
going back to being tomato farmers and

1831
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,599
you got to do it because you love it

1832
01:03:45,278 --> 01:03:49,278
exactly and it's not like the rock star

1833
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:50,920
image that you know I mean there were

1834
01:03:49,278 --> 01:03:52,880
cannabis rock stars sure you know it's

1835
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:55,440
like look at Arian from Greenhouse he's

1836
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:57,480
definitely like the can abis Rockstar

1837
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:59,798
lives up to that he's done it and you

1838
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:02,519
know a handful of other guys as well but

1839
01:03:59,798 --> 01:04:05,400
we're going back into agriculture to a

1840
01:04:02,519 --> 01:04:07,400
degree and farming and doing stuff

1841
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:10,000
because you love it we're tomato Farmers

1842
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:11,798
to a degree and right maybe not tomato

1843
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,519
Farmers but we're still it's similar I

1844
01:04:11,798 --> 01:04:15,318
feel like cannabis right now is going

1845
01:04:13,519 --> 01:04:17,159
through what like culinary went through

1846
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:19,400
when the slow food movement started yeah

1847
01:04:17,159 --> 01:04:20,719
and it was like you know what dude like

1848
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:21,960
you may think you know how to make a

1849
01:04:20,719 --> 01:04:23,838
tomato sauce but like where your

1850
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:27,119
Tomatoes coming from let's go all the

1851
01:04:23,838 --> 01:04:30,078
way back down to the field Tomatoes

1852
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:31,680
tomatoes are important in the but

1853
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:33,160
quality Tomatoes it's funny CU like

1854
01:04:31,679 --> 01:04:36,358
there's such

1855
01:04:33,159 --> 01:04:38,118
a a difference and a wide variety of

1856
01:04:36,358 --> 01:04:41,119
tomatoes and the quality of the tomatoes

1857
01:04:38,119 --> 01:04:42,838
and how how impactful that is to food

1858
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:44,559
absolutely and that that goes across the

1859
01:04:42,838 --> 01:04:46,838
board with all the vegetables that are

1860
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:48,960
that are cultivated out there yeah you

1861
01:04:46,838 --> 01:04:51,199
know and I think a lot of times we only

1862
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:52,278
see one one or two expressions of those

1863
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:54,118
things in the store but like with

1864
01:04:52,278 --> 01:04:55,920
potatoes there's I don't know thousands

1865
01:04:54,119 --> 01:04:57,880
thousand thousands right thousands of

1866
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:59,760
different cultivars of potatoes or

1867
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:01,240
varieties of potatoes I almost think

1868
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,640
this is the gift that cannabis is going

1869
01:05:01,239 --> 01:05:04,519
to give us it's going to teach a bunch

1870
01:05:02,639 --> 01:05:06,078
of people how to grow it yeah and then

1871
01:05:04,519 --> 01:05:07,719
they're going to get the tools and then

1872
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:10,359
they're going to use those tools to go

1873
01:05:07,719 --> 01:05:11,919
grow dollia so they're gonna grow yeah

1874
01:05:10,358 --> 01:05:14,679
you know like Go Geek out on something

1875
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:16,159
else and I think that's one more of her

1876
01:05:14,679 --> 01:05:17,480
her gifts you know she's going to

1877
01:05:16,159 --> 01:05:20,278
educate you to the point where you're

1878
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:22,358
like why am I not growing celery or you

1879
01:05:20,278 --> 01:05:23,719
know what can I do in my backyard and

1880
01:05:22,358 --> 01:05:25,920
totally especially if you're following

1881
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:28,038
you know these like build a soil and I

1882
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:30,358
mean you can yeah you do living soil so

1883
01:05:28,039 --> 01:05:32,520
we talked about yeah you do and it's

1884
01:05:30,358 --> 01:05:34,239
it's a low tail living soil right yeah I

1885
01:05:32,519 --> 01:05:35,719
can't say it's no till because I do top

1886
01:05:34,239 --> 01:05:37,439
dress and scratch and stuff like that

1887
01:05:35,719 --> 01:05:38,919
and I mean if if a Situation's bad

1888
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:43,079
enough I will dig up some soil and

1889

1906
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:26,159
sisters technique this year where you're

1907
01:06:24,358 --> 01:06:30,239
growing corn melons and beans together

1908
01:06:26,159 --> 01:06:32,159
yeah same soil no fertilizer and what's

1909
01:06:30,239 --> 01:06:33,439
that called complimentary planting

1910
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:36,480
something like that yeah so you're using

1911
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:38,880
the corn to grow tall the beans will

1912
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:41,358
grow up the corn and then the melon will

1913
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:43,640
ground cover but the beans are also

1914
01:06:41,358 --> 01:06:45,078

big pat on the back and a big hug yeah

1936
01:07:22,679 --> 01:07:26,078
including the Cannabis ones I think but

1937
01:07:24,798 --> 01:07:28,038
anybody who's still doing it whether

1938
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:31,000
it's you know agriculture cannabis

1939
01:07:28,039 --> 01:07:32,440
whatever man fact is times are tough and

1940
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,159
we're going to make it through this just

1941
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:35,920
like everything else and there's always

1942
01:07:34,159 --> 01:07:37,639
going to be a need for food and I think

1943
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:39,760
the more awareness there is about

1944
01:07:37,639 --> 01:07:42,239
quality the more we're seeing it with

1945
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:44,240
cannabis Colorado is a more mature

1946
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:47,078
market and Washington's a more mature

1947
01:07:44,239 --> 01:07:48,598
Market than California and I feel like

1948
01:07:47,079 --> 01:07:49,839
in Colorado brands have become

1949
01:07:48,599 --> 01:07:52,838
established and they're not going off

1950
01:07:49,838 --> 01:07:54,960
the hype as much as they are Brands and

1951
01:07:52,838 --> 01:07:56,719
brand awareness is a big thing and the

1952
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:59,079
THC percentage that stuff's all going to

1953
01:07:56,719 --> 01:08:02,879
go away we're going to be talking

1954
01:07:59,079 --> 01:08:05,039
about Aroma and other things in effect

1955
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:06,798
yep yeah in Colorado it's now it's

1956
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:09,880
definite like you have your bargain

1957
01:08:06,798 --> 01:08:12,000
shoppers who you know that's kind of the

1958
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:13,519
dude that buys the mountain Thunder

1959
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,880
instead of buying Mountain Dew you know

1960
01:08:13,519 --> 01:08:17,399
what I mean he goes to Walmart and buys

1961
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:18,679
the knockoff soda there's there's plenty

1962
01:08:17,399 --> 01:08:19,879
of that weed out there you know there's

1963
01:08:18,679 --> 01:08:21,679
plenty of what you know people are

1964
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:24,279
calling mids or whatever like it's it's

1965
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:25,319
salty weed that is not that great yeah

1966
01:08:24,279 --> 01:08:26,520
but the brands that are doing really

1967
01:08:25,319 --> 01:08:29,120
good and the brands that can sell their

1968
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:30,640
pounds of weed or their extracts are all

1969
01:08:29,119 --> 01:08:32,880
about quality and they're breeding their

1970
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:34,798
own in-house cultiv ours that nobody

1971
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:36,798
else has so it you know separates them

1972
01:08:34,798 --> 01:08:38,560
there um they're separating themselves

1973
01:08:36,798 --> 01:08:41,158
through the technique or whatever it may

1974
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:42,759
be yeah um yeah the Mass Appeal that's

1975
01:08:41,158 --> 01:08:44,238
like for the back of the The Westward

1976
01:08:42,759 --> 01:08:47,279
Magazine you know like if you're looking

1977
01:08:44,238 --> 01:08:49,879
for a $50 ounce it's out there probably

1978
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:52,319
even cheaper prob I mean I saw $10

1979
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:54,000
ounces in Oregon like advertised like

1980
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:55,640
but you know like Green Dot like that

1981
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,719
that you know Green Dot Dave that guy

1982
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:59,520
like constantly raising the bar every

1983
01:08:57,719 --> 01:09:03,000
time they make a drop the bar is raised

1984
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:07,040
and have you heard of NorCal Nemo no so

1985
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:10,640
NorCal Nemo sells the $1,800 ounces of

1986
01:09:07,039 --> 01:09:14,600
Skittles And1 th000 ounces

1987
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:17,719
of uh guava gas and so and the stuff is

1988
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:20,719
phenomenal it's like organic organic

1989
01:09:17,719 --> 01:09:23,838
yeah it's it's amazing that's awesome uh

1990
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:26,158
obviously super turpy super flavorful

1991
01:09:23,838 --> 01:09:27,559
good effect but like I love those

1992
01:09:26,158 --> 01:09:29,599
stories and some people are like oh

1993
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:32,159
that's not worth it whatever but I love

1994
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:35,079
hearing stories about somebody

1995
01:09:32,158 --> 01:09:37,519
succeeding like that on that level uh

1996
01:09:35,079 --> 01:09:39,439
especially if they're true because it

1997
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:41,000
adds the it increases the value of

1998
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:43,678
everything anybody else is doing it

1999
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:45,399
quality right I agree so because at a

2000
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:46,759
certain point when we're talking about

2001
01:09:45,399 --> 01:09:48,920
the most amazing stuff that we like to

2002
01:09:46,759 --> 01:09:51,039
smoke and that that's of the highest

2003
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:54,039
quality the a plus stuff I think that

2004
01:09:51,039 --> 01:09:56,279
has flavor and effect and all that it's

2005
01:09:54,039 --> 01:09:59,519
all uh subjective to the individual it's

2006
01:09:56,279 --> 01:10:01,800
almost like art yep like tattoos tattoos

2007
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:03,360
yeah exactly yeah very good yeah great

2008
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:05,079
example you know you can go get

2009
01:10:03,359 --> 01:10:07,319
scratched on by some guy down on Main

2010
01:10:05,079 --> 01:10:09,840
Street for you know 20 bucks or you can

2011
01:10:07,319 --> 01:10:11,679
you know pay $1,000 for a couple hours

2012
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:13,800
from your favorite artist you know or go

2013
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:15,480
to Japan get hammered on get Hammer yeah

2014
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:17,239
yeah exactly yeah go somewhere and get a

2015
01:10:15,479 --> 01:10:20,158
whole different technique you know like

2016
01:10:17,238 --> 01:10:22,399
yeah it's wild man yeah I think cannabis

2017
01:10:20,158 --> 01:10:24,960
there's I don't feel like anybody should

2018
01:10:22,399 --> 01:10:26,279
feel like their ship is left the harbor

2019
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,840
whatever the saying is like there's

2020
01:10:26,279 --> 01:10:29,920
plenty of room at the table for

2021
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:31,800
everybody but you do need to pull up

2022
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:35,119
your own seat you do need to be present

2023
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:36,880
and yeah yeah and just yeah like pick a

2024
01:10:35,119 --> 01:10:38,679
reason to do it but do it for a good

2025
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:40,600
reason passion should drive you and

2026
01:10:38,679 --> 01:10:42,440
that's so this is one thing I know we

2027
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:43,800
can agree on is it passion should drive

2028
01:10:42,439 --> 01:10:46,359
you in everything in life and it's like

2029
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:47,719
being a chef you really get that like

2030
01:10:46,359 --> 01:10:50,920
passion driven because you wouldn't work

2031
01:10:47,719 --> 01:10:52,800
those long hours and do those shitty

2032
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:53,840
days that you know there's good days to

2033
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,880
come along with it but but there's

2034
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:57,640
shitty days too and you wouldn't suck it

2035
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:59,640
all up if you didn't love it same thing

2036
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:00,840
with cannabis and I feel like as we get

2037
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:03,000
older it's like there's other ways to

2038
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:04,840
make money too but it's like being able

2039
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:06,119
to be in cannabis and to be able to

2040
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:09,159
contribute to something that's so much

2041
01:11:06,119 --> 01:11:10,719
bigger than us I feel like is an amazing

2042
01:11:09,158 --> 01:11:12,879
thing and it's an amazing opportunity

2043
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:15,520
that we're blessed to be a part of it is

2044
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:18,359
man it really is like you know it taught

2045
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:19,880
me how to feed myself it helped me I

2046
01:11:18,359 --> 01:11:22,359
mean I've helped I don't even know how

2047
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:25,079
many people with different problems you

2048
01:11:22,359 --> 01:11:27,279
know like I mean my brother-in-law had

2049
01:11:25,079 --> 01:11:30,679
stage four gleo blastoma and got six

2050
01:11:27,279 --> 01:11:33,158
months to live and CBD man like just

2051
01:11:30,679 --> 01:11:35,039
huge fat sing syringes of CBD it's a

2052
01:11:33,158 --> 01:11:36,639
game CBD is a game changer he's doing

2053
01:11:35,039 --> 01:11:39,639
he's rad you know he's great he's

2054
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:41,280
fineing yeah yeah man it's just it's

2055
01:11:39,639 --> 01:11:42,719
saves lives it saves lives it makes the

2056
01:11:41,279 --> 01:11:44,519
world a better place I think that's the

2057
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:45,920
biggest thing is is like it saves lives

2058
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:47,199
it does all these things it brings us

2059
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:48,480
together we wouldn't be here today

2060
01:11:47,198 --> 01:11:49,719
without it we wouldn't be having this

2061
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:52,599
conversation would have walked right

2062
01:11:49,719 --> 01:11:54,039
past you if I never e the weed you know

2063
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:55,760
yeah I mean it's such a big part of my

2064
01:11:54,039 --> 01:11:58,119
life big part of your life and and a lot

2065
01:11:55,760 --> 01:12:00,480
of the people that watch the show it's

2066
01:11:58,119 --> 01:12:02,920
just such a special plant and special on

2067
01:12:00,479 --> 01:12:04,559
so many levels and it's like you know

2068
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:05,840
it's definitely part of uh everything

2069
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:08,800
that we

2070
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:10,279
do yep I mean it's sometimes it's the

2071
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:11,800
reason I can't go on that super long

2072
01:12:10,279 --> 01:12:13,639
vacation I want to go on with my wife

2073
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:15,520
and my family and sure you know there's

2074
01:12:13,639 --> 01:12:17,440
a lot of sacrifice man to hang I've had

2075
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:19,199
PL I've had longer than my son you know

2076
01:12:17,439 --> 01:12:21,960
like I've kept a little plant longer

2077
01:12:19,198 --> 01:12:24,678
than I've had my son you know and yeah

2078
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:26,639
it is awesome it it's it presents so

2079
01:12:24,679 --> 01:12:30,560
many opportunities in this in this world

2080
01:12:26,639 --> 01:12:32,359
so yeah uh it gives back it does for

2081
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:33,440
sure what you put in you get out of it

2082
01:12:32,359 --> 01:12:35,119
and there's not a lot of things you can

2083
01:12:33,439 --> 01:12:38,039
say about that in life you know

2084
01:12:35,119 --> 01:12:41,359
relationships are another one you you

2085
01:12:38,039 --> 01:12:44,319
get what what comes out is what you put

2086
01:12:41,359 --> 01:12:45,759
into it and I think or it should but you

2087
01:12:44,319 --> 01:12:47,479
learn real quick with relationships with

2088
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:48,560
relationships yeah you start coasting

2089
01:12:47,479 --> 01:12:49,919
you take your foot off the gas and you

2090
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:51,600
start coasting and things start getting

2091
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:54,600
real swervy you know like you got to

2092
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:56,239
stay focused and well with relationship

2093
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:59,039
until it gets tough you really don't

2094
01:12:56,238 --> 01:13:00,919
know the relationship or the person it's

2095
01:12:59,039 --> 01:13:02,639
when you go through tough times that

2096
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:04,920
that's when you really see who people

2097
01:13:02,639 --> 01:13:07,440
are and what people are made of yeah

2098
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:08,639
who's there for you and who's not and uh

2099
01:13:07,439 --> 01:13:11,399
you know and it's important to go

2100
01:13:08,639 --> 01:13:13,639
through those things in life struggle is

2101
01:13:11,399 --> 01:13:15,519
it's like I I wanted to run away from

2102
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:17,159
struggle as a kid you know whatever like

2103
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:19,280
I thought the struggle was bad we wanted

2104
01:13:17,158 --> 01:13:21,198
to like live a comfortable life and

2105
01:13:19,279 --> 01:13:24,000
comfort isn't what life's all about and

2106
01:13:21,198 --> 01:13:25,678
uh it's real interesting because as I've

2107
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,399
gotten older I feel like struggle is

2108
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:29,399
what makes you great but it's also what

2109
01:13:27,399 --> 01:13:30,879
makes life great yeah like experiencing

2110
01:13:29,399 --> 01:13:33,279
struggle and to be able to make it past

2111
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:35,199
that and growing and to be able to grow

2112
01:13:33,279 --> 01:13:37,198
a plant and experience those type of

2113
01:13:35,198 --> 01:13:39,198

puppy stage is like the best part until

2124
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:01,440
we had a senior dog that like the senior

2125
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:04,000
years were the best where she wanted to

2126
01:14:01,439 --> 01:14:07,759

01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,319
he was named after one of the best

2138
01:14:27,399 --> 01:14:31,439

01:14:33,238 --> 01:14:37,919
you turned me on to sturg Simpson back

2142
01:14:35,158 --> 01:14:39,479
of the day long long time ago I hope his

2143
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:41,480
voice gets better apparently like he's

2144

got some Voice issues or something

2145
01:14:41,479 --> 01:14:47,039

2146
01:14:44,238 --> 01:14:50,839
country to doing amazing Bluegrass

2147

2149
01:14:52,439 --> 01:14:55,519
great and he's another passionate guy

2150
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:57,119

for a big old goofy rwe totally yeah

2160

2161
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:20,360
kind of in line with the Grateful Dead

2162
01:15:18,039 --> 01:15:22,679

01:15:59,639 --> 01:16:04,440
he's I mean he he's in inspirational

2184
01:16:02,279 --> 01:16:05,960
especially for moving into the older

2185
01:16:04,439 --> 01:16:08,000
years of our lives like going to that

2186
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:10,639
next stage it's like well that's going

2187
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,920
to be okay too yeah but when I was a kid

2188
01:16:10,639 --> 01:16:15,119
I thought 40 year olds were old when I

2189
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:16,920
was 18 I was like man that dude's hella

2190
01:16:15,119 --> 01:16:19,158
old and he was like 40 and really you

2191
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:21,560
know like now that I'm past 40 it's like

2192
01:16:19,158 --> 01:16:23,559
I don't feel all that old no and I think

2193
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:24,840
it's important now because you know you

2194
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:27,520
you're a healthy guy and you're focused

2195
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:28,960
on your health and I I am similar to I

2196
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:32,719
you know take a lot of supplements and

2197
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:34,279
stuff like that but I'm 47 now like but

2198
01:16:32,719 --> 01:16:36,359
I'm not going to be

2199
01:16:34,279 --> 01:16:37,920
47 you know here in the next couple

2200
01:16:36,359 --> 01:16:39,359
years so I think it's really important

2201
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:41,199
to start thinking about that like okay

2202
01:16:39,359 --> 01:16:43,960
man like here comes 55 and what's that

2203
01:16:41,198 --> 01:16:45,399
look like you know because I got a man I

2204
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:48,158
got a 11 and a half year old he's almost

2205
01:16:45,399 --> 01:16:49,719
12 like you know it's not all like it

2206
01:16:48,158 --> 01:16:51,799
used to be just do what you want to do

2207
01:16:49,719 --> 01:16:53,840
for you you know right now I got people

2208
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:57,679
to look out for and there's a bigger

2209
01:16:53,840 --> 01:17:00,560
picture sturge to feed sturge yeah I

2210
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:01,679
love the dogs though yeah no yeah um

2211
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:03,239
yeah so I want to stick around for as

2212
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:05,158
long as possible man I mean there's a

2213
01:17:03,238 --> 01:17:07,079
reason I don't do hard drugs or smoke

2214
01:17:05,158 --> 01:17:08,799
cigarettes or whatever I asked you a

2215
01:17:07,079 --> 01:17:10,960
question but I didn't get the answer

2216
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:12,840
what your favorite thing to smoke was

2217
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:16,359
I'm gonna have to

2218
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:18,880
say my desert island strain would be dog

2219
01:17:16,359 --> 01:17:21,759
walker OG nice if I was just going to

2220
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:23,800
sit on you know if I had just to enjoy

2221
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:25,360
just to be high and not one thing you

2222
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:26,679
could only smoke for the rest of your

2223
01:17:25,359 --> 01:17:28,599
life while you lived on that desert

2224
01:17:26,679 --> 01:17:30,480
island yeah I think it would you know it

2225
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:32,079
make me paranoid enough to keep moving

2226
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:34,359
it would get me stoned enough to go to

2227
01:17:32,079 --> 01:17:36,760
sleep you know like it's great when

2228
01:17:34,359 --> 01:17:38,439
Theon those tolerant free strands to

2229
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:41,159
where like there's no

2230
01:17:38,439 --> 01:17:43,079
tolerance uh this the tolerance free

2231
01:17:41,158 --> 01:17:45,158
where like doesn't matter how long you

2232
01:17:43,079 --> 01:17:46,399
smoke it you don't fully build a

2233
01:17:45,158 --> 01:17:48,638
tolerance to it where it'll still get

2234
01:17:46,399 --> 01:17:50,158
you high in the morning yeah yeah or or

2235
01:17:48,639 --> 01:17:52,560
even in the evening after You' been

2236
01:17:50,158 --> 01:17:54,439
smoking all day for for like three

2237
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:56,280
months of the like green crack after a

2238
01:17:54,439 --> 01:17:57,638
week that's it yeah you know there's a

2239
01:17:56,279 --> 01:18:00,399
lot of stuff like that I would say cam

2240
01:17:57,639 --> 01:18:02,400
91 but it's just like if you even like

2241
01:18:00,399 --> 01:18:04,158
look at that wrong it's gonna turn out

2242
01:18:02,399 --> 01:18:06,679
different than it did the time before

2243
01:18:04,158 --> 01:18:08,960
it's just she takes a lot of effort and

2244
01:18:06,679 --> 01:18:10,319
a lot of knowledge and so yeah I think

2245
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:11,760
my yeah my go-to is at dog walker

2246
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:13,639
because I can grow her big and strong

2247
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:15,800
and yeah I like it and all the

2248
01:18:13,639 --> 01:18:18,239
concentrates are great from her I bet

2249
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:21,719
but yeah she's a head head ringer man

2250

we're going to smoke some good sour in a

2272
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:07,439
minute here sounds perfect yeah so if

2273
01:19:04,399 --> 01:19:09,198
you had or if you had the opportunity to

2274
01:19:07,439 --> 01:19:10,678
go back and talk to your younger self

2275
01:19:09,198 --> 01:19:11,599
that had' been in the industry for just

2276
01:19:10,679 --> 01:19:14,079
about a

2277
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:16,880
year what would you tell your younger

2278
01:19:14,079 --> 01:19:19,639
self number one would be get rid of the

2279
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:22,480
chef ego day one right cuz like that was

2280
01:19:19,639 --> 01:19:24,039
out of control I was trying to like it

2281
01:19:22,479 --> 01:19:25,439
was just like a kitchen and I was trying

2282
01:19:24,039 --> 01:19:27,279
to climb up the ladder and like if

2283
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:29,039
you're in my way I was a little rough

2284
01:19:27,279 --> 01:19:30,599
dude and you know I think I would have

2285
01:19:29,039 --> 01:19:34,158
been a little bit more

2286
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:36,520
Kumbaya um I think I did a good job on

2287
01:19:34,158 --> 01:19:38,879
keeping my eyes and my ears open but I

2288
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:41,040
would now with all the research there is

2289
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:43,480
like especially with the socials and the

2290
01:19:41,039 --> 01:19:45,840
patreons and all that I would I would

2291
01:19:43,479 --> 01:19:48,039
dive deep into all that stuff right now

2292
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:49,760
like what Brandon Russ is talking about

2293
01:19:48,039 --> 01:19:51,800
like I mean he's been on the show he's

2294
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:53,280
the man he's the man like I just was

2295
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:55,520
listen to him on uh first smoke of the

2296
01:19:53,279 --> 01:19:57,439
day the other day and like I mean yeah

2297
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:59,639
those kind of dudes there's like so much

2298
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:02,759
knowledge to gain and I don't care like

2299
01:19:59,639 --> 01:20:04,239
if you want to run selftaught that's

2300
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:05,159
it's the beauty of it right you don't

2301
01:20:04,238 --> 01:20:07,079
have to if you don't want to go to

2302
01:20:05,158 --> 01:20:09,000
school you don't have to go to school no

2303
01:20:07,079 --> 01:20:10,960
yeah no like yeah just it's all about

2304
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,198
reverse engineering what you really love

2305
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:14,520
you know like if it's like dude I love

2306
01:20:12,198 --> 01:20:16,158
mountain biking it's like well don't not

2307
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:18,040
go to college because you want to ride

2308
01:20:16,158 --> 01:20:20,599
your mountain bike go work at a bike

2309
01:20:18,039 --> 01:20:23,679
shop or go get sponsored or you know

2310
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:25,079
like yeah start getting some coins

2311
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:26,359
from something you didn't start early

2312
01:20:25,079 --> 01:20:28,198
doesn't mean you can't do it that's the

2313
01:20:26,359 --> 01:20:29,799
beauty you know like I've learned to

2314
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:31,158
reinvent myself over the years with

2315
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:32,840
doing different things cannabis has

2316
01:20:31,158 --> 01:20:35,359
always kind of been a constant I've

2317
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:37,119
always smoked you know so but as far as

2318
01:20:35,359 --> 01:20:38,399
like I've worked in it I've done all

2319
01:20:37,119 --> 01:20:41,639
kinds of different stuff worked as a

2320
01:20:38,399 --> 01:20:44,319
chef so and also had a backup plan so

2321
01:20:41,639 --> 01:20:46,560
yeah when [ __ ] goes sideways I you have

2322
01:20:44,319 --> 01:20:48,759
to Pivot you know and I think in this

2323
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:49,960
like this day and age you can like back

2324
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:51,119
you know back in the day it was kind of

2325
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:53,079
like you picked a career and you had to

2326
01:20:51,119 --> 01:20:55,319
stick with that career or yeah you know

2327
01:20:53,079 --> 01:20:57,519
change to a really other boring career

2328
01:20:55,319 --> 01:20:59,639
well for since the beginning of time you

2329
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:01,679
did what your father did right so like

2330
01:20:59,639 --> 01:21:03,960
and I think there's some beauty in that

2331
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:05,639
as well is like perfecting something

2332
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:07,679
that you know I like I've lik to try to

2333
01:21:05,639 --> 01:21:09,039
do everything and you know I've I've

2334
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:11,520
like to experience different things find

2335
01:21:09,039 --> 01:21:13,920
out what I like but there is a beauty to

2336
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:17,760
doing one thing that you love your whole

2337
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:20,199
life and mastering that to the next

2338
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:22,119
level where you are in the very elite of

2339
01:21:20,198 --> 01:21:23,799
that and so and that stuff takes time

2340
01:21:22,119 --> 01:21:25,760
but also can be a combination of

2341
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:28,600
different things that lead you there

2342
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:31,920
like you know yeah yeah I think the

2343
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:34,280
plans led me to understanding soil and

2344
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:37,560
and you know vegetables and and growing

2345
01:21:34,279 --> 01:21:39,519
and then that would be my my gift to my

2346
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:41,159
son would be like hey man like I

2347
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:45,400
remember when Henry was I think about

2348
01:21:41,158 --> 01:21:46,920
four years old his uh his nephew was in

2349
01:21:45,399 --> 01:21:48,879
town or my nephew was in town the kid's

2350
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:50,679
like 11 years old yeah and Henry's in

2351
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:52,600
the garden like pulling things out and

2352
01:21:50,679 --> 01:21:54,719
showing this kid like this is what how

2353
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:56,679
carrots grow you know the guy's like

2354
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:58,600
carrot you know and he's like I thought

2355
01:21:56,679 --> 01:21:59,719
he they came inside and the kid was like

2356
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:01,600
I thought all this stuff just came from

2357
01:21:59,719 --> 01:22:03,119
the grocery store yeah you know and I

2358
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:05,600
was like that's cool that my little kid

2359
01:22:03,119 --> 01:22:07,920
is showing you what's underground you

2360
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:09,400
know like he knew what the leaf looked

2361
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:11,840
like to pull the carrot you know he

2362
01:22:09,399 --> 01:22:14,319
didn't get to see a carrot yeah so yeah

2363
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:16,880

2364
01:22:14,319 --> 01:22:19,238
it's it's gonna be really amazing to see

2365

01:22:25,119 --> 01:22:28,840
the things that they're doing and the

2370
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:30,159
things that you know as as young adults

2371
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:31,800
and then as your kid as he's going to

2372
01:22:30,158 --> 01:22:34,279
grow up in a whole different world which

2373
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:36,679
different it's gonna be amazing yeah and

2374

2375
01:22:36,679 --> 01:22:39,920
like everything in life is beautiful

2376
01:22:38,679 --> 01:22:42,719
from the right

2377
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:44,279
angle well not everything but you know a

2378
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:45,480
lot of stuff you know there's the good

2379
01:22:44,279 --> 01:22:47,198
the good in the dark but a lot of the

2380
01:22:45,479 --> 01:22:50,158
stuff that we think is bad is

2381
01:22:47,198 --> 01:22:51,839
necessarily not bad and it you know yeah

2382
01:22:50,158 --> 01:22:53,879
it's funny like my kid has kind of like

01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:55,279
a bad taste in his mouth about America

2384

2386
01:22:57,639 --> 01:23:01,159
all this crap going on and we actually
