big supporter of the show and before you

25
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,038
had a podcast I remember saying Chad you

26
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:04,399
should probably have your own podcast

27
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,239
man you're really good at this stuff and

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,040

29
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:09,559

31
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,280
chat was fun because that's where the

32
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,040
kind of the community is built that's

33
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,040
where we learn so much from each other

34
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,799
that's where we meet new people you've

35
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,960

fun hanging out in the chat yeah I mean

37
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:26,719
this show is built around greatness

38
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:29,478
besides myself I think our guests are

39
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:32,039

40
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:35,640

41
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:38,439
and then our our client base the people

42
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:42,040

43
00:01:38,438 --> 00:01:44,599

48
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,000
just a catalyst for this whole thing

49
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:56,000
really at the end of the day as as

50
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,879
podcast hosts it's not about us it might

51
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,680
be the James lad podcast or the Chad

52
00:01:57,879 --> 00:02:05,158
Westport podcast or whatever the James

53
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:08,319
loud show but really our job is to be

54
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,800
able to help the guest tell their story

55
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:11,519
and that's the beauty of the podcast is

56
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,560
we get to hear these I get to hear in

57
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,319
the first person get to talk to these

58
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,479
people and they get to tell me their

59
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:19,079

61
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,599
tell your amazing story today yeah thank

62
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,760
you it's always fun to have a front row

63
00:02:22,598 --> 00:02:26,238
seat as the podcast host to be able to

64
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:27,878
raise your hand and get the question

65
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,159
anytime you want it you know I always

66
00:02:27,878 --> 00:02:31,759
say I have a front row all the like

67
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,400
Freestyle right like so we don't we

68
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:35,679
don't record questions and give

69
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,800
questions out beforehand I'm not like

70
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,120
that we did that with the future

71
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,920
cannabis project when I did the James

72
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,878
loud show I'd give them some some

73
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:43,759
questions but what happened was I would

74
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:45,639
realize that I would ask them six or

75
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:47,679
eight questions and it would go way off

76
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:49,958
topic almost every time right some of

77
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,000
the science guys loved that but I feel

78
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:55,280
like uh when it's just fresh and off the

79
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,120
cuff it's just so much more fun and

80
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,199
enjoyable and it's like the conversation

81
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,158
can go anywhere literally it's like the

82
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:02,598
Grateful Dead with when they're jamming

83
00:03:01,158 --> 00:03:04,199
you know what I mean like I feel like

84
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:06,759
we're jamming like the Grateful Dead

85
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:07,919
jams and it's like it's Innovation and

86
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:09,919
it's all over the place and the

87
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:11,199
conversation can go anywhere we know

88
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:14,119
what we're doing here we're telling a

89
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:15,359
story and it's like this is great that's

90
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,439
I mean that's a lot of what cannabis

91
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,519
brings though is really kind of a Vibe

92
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:20,919
and that really has kind of brought

93
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,080
together a lot of people that probably

94
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:25,158
wouldn't have hung out normally it's

95
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,000
that Vibe and I you know I kind of joke

96
00:03:25,158 --> 00:03:28,878
too it's like younger generation will

97
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,840
never know what the Dealer's couch is

98
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:32,719
like right cuz where you know you met

99
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,959
people from like different schools or

100
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:38,080
different areas and different walks of

101
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,319
life um so yeah it's the plant brings us

102
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,560
together but it's all that Vibe so it's

103
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:42,878
cool to see it translate into the show

104
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,519
well yeah and it's all everything

105
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:46,840
circles back for me everything circles

106
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,680
back to genetics right like I'm a

107
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:52,479
genetics focused person and Company it's

108
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:56,040
all everything we do whether it's my

109
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:58,719
book whether it's the podcast uh whether

110
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:02,158
it's our clothing line it all circles

111
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:03,438
back to the gentics M and to the plant

112
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:06,679
right and I think it's our

113
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:09,318
responsibility as stewards to you know

114
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,920
as podcast host to to highlight people

115
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:12,958
that have experienced with the plant and

116
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:14,639
share their experiences with the world

117
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,439
with the future the people that are

118
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,759
watching this show 50 years from now you

119
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:19,959
know we talk about I talk about that

120
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:22,040
quite a bit on my show you know about

121
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,879
the future I think that's the importance

122
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,479
of podcasts and uh yeah and I love

123
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:27,600
interviewing other podcast hosts because

124
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:29,399
they know how to talk they know how to

125
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,600
have great conversations it's always a

126
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:32,879
lot of fun fun yeah well I'm glad you're

127
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,680
here and too sometimes in normal

128
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:36,159
conversation I I I talk to my wife and

129
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,879
she always cuts me off and I'm like

130
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,600
sweetie you need to start a podcast

131
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:42,959
because you learn how to talk yeah well

132
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,919
you really do I mean I think even the

133
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:47,478
way I project my voice is different than

134
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:49,680
the first episode when I first was doing

135
00:04:47,478 --> 00:04:51,680
podcast I feel like I know how to speak

136
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,680
better which is a strange thing but I

137
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,439
you know I I I know how to conversate

138
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,840
better for sure and I'm I've always been

139
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:00,079
good at letting people talk and not

140
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:03,279
interrupt over some some podcast host

141
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:05,680
not naming any names but some of them

142
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:07,359
love to interrupt and talk over and you

143
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,478
know it is what it is but you get you

144
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,919
get a little bit of everything with

145
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:11,359
different podcasts and different podcast

146
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:12,879
hosts but I really want to hear the

147
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,960
story from the guest and I also while

148
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,759
they're telling their story I'm like man

149
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,839
what should I ask them next and that's

150
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:20,560
what gets me excited too like man so I

151
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:22,000
learned this about this person and if

152
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,160
you write the questions before you don't

153
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,478
get that right so like you can go in the

154
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,800
middle and you're like whoa well I want

155
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:28,240
to know more about this person because

156
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,199
you can always ask them well when did

157
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,120
you first start smoking you know right

158
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:34,360
generic generic stuff like that and

159
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,879
that's okay and sometimes you need to do

160
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,560
that to get into some of the deep stuff

161
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,199
but uh you know we've gotten to some

162
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,720
really cool stuff on this show we've had

163
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:45,960
amazing guests uh you know I think you

164
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,680
you liked our Christmas special so much

on for Christmas I have some big

183
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,079
projects that I'm going to be working on

184
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:36,240
uh for the next year some big breeding

185
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:37,758
projects with SF Cana and planta okay uh

186
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,639
with both of those companies we're doing

187
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,479
some projects and then my buddy's

188
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:44,879
company hush so I'm doing some reversals

189
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:48,159
and sharing pollen and pollinating stuff

190
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:49,800
and so I think 2025 is going to be a

191
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,960
pretty freaking amazing year I'm looking

192
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,960
forward to it yeah you got to set

193
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:56,318
yourself up this year for the busy of

194
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:58,198
next year yeah I mean I'm always trying

195
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,039
to set myself up for the success of the

196
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,478
future I think if you're not planning

197
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:04,079
ahead than you're behind I mean talking

198
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:05,639
genetics and breeding I mean how many

199
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:07,839
years ahead are you in your head right

200
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:10,000
now as far as what you want to do I mean

201
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:12,119
we do so much more work than we can so

202
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,879
so we do like let's say we just do 300

203
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,560
outcrosses a year okay that's a lot we

204
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:17,800
can only test a small percentage of

205
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,399
those right to to properly test them

206
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,120
right it's one thing testing them and

207
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:22,959
just pop oh yeah we pop one of each one

208
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,120
they're good we pop 10 of each one

209
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:26,959
they're good but to actually pop them

210
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,519
grow them out multiple times and go this

211
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:30,439
is the winner from this this is the

212
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:32,639
winner from that we don't have time to

213
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:34,759
do all the work that we do every year so

214
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,240
like each year we get backlogged a

215
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:38,639
little more right but we can always go

216
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,280
back and revisit that stuff we store

217
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,160
seeds correctly uh and you you know you

218
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:45,719
got to spend time at the facility today

219
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,000
yeah uh at the Oakland facility and it's

220
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,879
you know what what's your opinion on

221
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,639
that I loved it man it's been a while

222
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,280
since I walked into a warm just dank

223
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,400
smelling room uh full of plants and

224
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:56,399
something that I used to do but I

225
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:58,399
haven't done for a while so it was

226
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:01,719
really cool to see that the way that you

227
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:03,598
have it set up again and um I'm I'm

228
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,919
primarily like a hom grower hom Growers

229
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:07,000
is where I spend the majority of my

230
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:08,198
focus the majority of my attention yeah

231
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,560
you're going to be doing things

232
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:13,080
different when you have a larger space

233
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,199
and it's always fun to come in and see

234
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:16,959
what is being done how it's being done

235
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,079
you know what plants look like I learned

236
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:22,198
so much working commercially of just how

237
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:24,158
to handle plants in itself right so

238
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:26,120
being able to come in and see a facility

239
00:08:24,158 --> 00:08:28,000
like this is great because in my mind

240
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm always like how can something that I

241
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,519
see here apply how it help somebody else

242
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,799
that's where we get a lot of the you

243
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:37,240
know a lot of the uh information we

244
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:39,000
learn yeah so yeah we put you to work

245
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,839
today we we were going sexing plants

246
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,879
we're in that stage of the feno hunt

247
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:44,360
where literally we're going in and

248
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:47,759
trying to pull out all the males from

249
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:49,440
the regular seeds and uh observing

250
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:51,159
traits we're looking for stuff that's

251
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,959
you know also stuff that's taken off

252
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:54,879
where the we got really tall plants and

253
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:57,199
really short plants and trying to

254
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:59,000
determine what's what right now and it's

255
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,759
an exciting time going stuff going into

256
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,480
flower because it all goes into flower

257
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:05,078
at different days even though it's

258
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,079
triggered on the same day mhm you know

259
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:09,838
the light is triggered doesn't mean that

260
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:11,239
that plant will actually go into flow

261
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,160
two or three days later some of them

262
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,200
it's a week later some of them it's 10

263
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:18,199
days later before you're really able to

264
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,879
properly sex them and like some of it is

265
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,519
with the stability of the plants some

266
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:24,360
are longer flying varieties they just

267
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,240
take longer to show their signs but and

268
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,320
then you know we're looking for

269
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,720
hermaphrodites that's the next thing so

270
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,480
we're going through those rooms every

271
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,720
day pulling males uh I found some real

272
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:36,680
we found a z mail today that was really

273
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:40,079
cool uh big shout out to Leo Stone of

274
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:42,599
fish a genetics uh Leo's a badass and I

275
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:44,399
love his genetics and I got a mail that

276
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,560
looks pretty killer like the structure

277
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,200
is great and the stem rub was really

278
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:50,239
cool yeah that you know that was fun

279
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,600
again kind of just going through the

280
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,919
room and looking at some of them because

281
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,159
there were there there was the

282
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:57,199
observable traits of some just weren't

283
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:59,480
there yet While others were fully

284
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,079
letting you know what they were oh yeah

285
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,519
yeah and some of them that are really

286
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:06,278
unstable you'll get 20 plants that all

287
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,240
look different mhm and some stuff they

288
00:10:06,278 --> 00:10:11,278
look identical across the board they

289
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,480
look like they're the same thing and so

290
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,240
those and those plants are all really

291
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,320
healthy and I feel like if you can keep

292
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,159
your plants really healthy you can grow

293
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,920
them properly that's the best way to

294
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,759
make them Express so they show different

295
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:23,519
characteristics people that just grow

296
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:24,919
mediocre they have a problem getting the

297
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,679
plants to express properly then it's

298
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:28,519
really The pheno Hunt is that much

299
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:30,120
harder when you're not able to grow the

300
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:31,600
plants really well and there's a lot of

301
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,039
varieties out there that you know I've

302
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,560
heard of that if you don't grow it right

303
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:37,000
you're not going to think it's the real

304
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:39,679
thing yeah and so that that's Sour

305
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,440
Diesel it's a big part of it a lot of

306
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:45,479
people uh you know they they they rush

307
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,560
to uh work with something before they

308
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,800
get good at growing yeah and if you if

309
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:50,399
you're ever trying to do any kind of

310
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:52,838
selections you really have to get that

311
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,480
growing part down it's so important to

312
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:55,839
the end picture well yeah there's so so

313
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,480
many guys that want to be breeders and

314
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,560
they just want to make seeds and it's

315
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,159
like man that's great making seeds is

316
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:04,399
great it's cool and I think everybody

317
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:06,120
should do it but I also think it's more

318
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,919
important to be a good grower and

319
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,919
cultivator than it is to be a seed

320
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:14,078
producer like you'll be a better seed

321
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:15,519
producer and grower and breeder if you

322
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:17,958
know how to make the plant Express

323
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,360
really well you understand plant Health

324
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:21,799
optimal plant Health how to keep your

325
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,720
plant healthy all the way and then

326
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:25,078
drawing and curing that's so important

327
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,399
and if you don't have those things how

328
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:29,000
are you really going to be able to feno

329
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:31,240
hunt so building up those skills and

330
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,159
then breeding should just be a natural

331
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,799
transition you know it shouldn't be like

332
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:38,319
I need to learn how to breed so much

333
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:40,439
like I there a lot of that you learn on

334
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,760
the cultivation side when you're doing

335
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,000
that uh it's it's a trip though because

336
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:45,120
I think people get excited about

337
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,839
breeding and they're like oh I want to

338
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,240
be a breeder and it's it's not as

339
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:51,320
glamorous a lot of stuff also seems very

340
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,600
glamorous from the outside and you're

341
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:56,120
like oh man these guys are doing this

342
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,560
this or that and it sounds awesome and a

343
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,440
lot of it boils down to do you really

344
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:01,559
like data collection do you really like

345
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,160
like examining plants and comparing and

346
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:05,559
taking notes and you're doing at the end

347
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:07,480
of the day you're doing a lot of AB

348
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:09,119
testing and you're like okay is this

349
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,639
better than this and why is it better

350
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,799
than this and you you know so it's not

351
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:16,278
just I found the next winner and I'm GNA

352
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:18,719
be rich right some of there's like that

353
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:21,120
philosophy is kind of gone anyway yeah I

354
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,839
I see more people now that it's kind of

355
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,600
shaken out that there's more people

356
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,399
willing to put in the work reallying to

357
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,879
to recognize the work um but you

358
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:30,958
mentioned data collection too you know

359
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:33,198
it's like like on a small scale craft

360
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:35,439
scale home scale tent scale we have to

361
00:12:33,198 --> 00:12:37,159
work with observable traits so when

362
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,920
we're pheno hunting it's like was it a

363
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:40,759
heavy feed or how did it like water

364
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:42,439
whereas you know if we were bigger we

365
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:45,278
could use things like sap analysis and

366
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:47,399
soil analysis to really determine is it

367
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:50,919
truly a heavy feeder and what it

368
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:52,399
particular is it heavy in yes but you

369
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:53,919
can just throw all those tests away

370
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,679
because at the end of the

371
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:59,599
day the effect and the taste are the two

372
00:12:56,679 --> 00:13:01,479
most important things and you can have

373
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,800
data that backs up those things right

374
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:08,079
you can have you can have coas and you

375
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:10,759
get lab results for cannabinoids and and

376
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:13,599
tpin and you can you can find out a lot

377
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:14,838
of things from Lab analysis but at the

378
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,759
end of the day it's not going to tell

379
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:18,480
you how that it makes you feel and it's

380
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:20,559
not going to fully tell you exactly how

381
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,959
it tastes you might know the tpine

382
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:24,719
percentage is 5 and a half percent right

383
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:26,958
but does that mean anything what does

384
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,120
that translate into and the more you

385
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,518
know your breeding lines the better

386
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,000
obviously you know I feel like the more

387
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,560
you work with those same plants and you

388
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,958
breed them together you're going like

389
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:36,439
yeah the mother's if I if you use this

390
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:38,919
as a donor it's going to do this and if

391
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,240
I use this as receiver it's probably

392
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:42,799
going to do this and usually it's a

393
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,680
probably because you never know with

394
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:46,120
recessive and dominant traits unless you

395
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:48,239
know both sides and then you're like

396
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,000
yeah this is going to be the outcome

397
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,519
it's very it gets more predictable the

398
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,039
more that you understand the lines and

399
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:56,240
so the the less guessing you have to do

400
00:13:55,039 --> 00:14:00,639
which is kind of great because a lot of

401
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:03,240
people are like well what is GMO times

402
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,198
Donny Burger going to do and it's like

403
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:08,278
well you're going to lean he more heavy

404
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:12,240
on that GMO you know and so it's G to go

405
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:14,480
more into that chmd GMO gassy side right

406
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,639
it's already kind of gassy and it but I

407
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,480
love Donny bur you know we've been

408
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:18,959
talking about this show quite a bit it's

409
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,839
it's a good one it's a good one I've

410
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:23,638
actually had that one so yeah I'm huge

411
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:24,880
into the extracts flora and Flame they

412
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:25,959
gave me some and changed my mind

413
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:27,399
completely he gave me some flour I

414
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:29,518
wasn't impressed he gave me the extract

415
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,958
I was like some of the best I've seen

416
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,759
okay yeah that that sometimes that

417
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,278
changes it sometimes the concentration I

418
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:36,560
almost think like the isolation of

419
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:38,679
things yeah can bring out the different

420
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,319
nuances um you know you're you're

421
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:42,359
talking about the effect being the most

422
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,278
important thing right and that usually

423
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,360
that comes after the fact though it's

424
00:14:44,278 --> 00:14:48,120
like you've you have to grow it first

425
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:51,199
you have to be like is this one worth

426
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:53,198
growing is this one desirable but you

427
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:54,679
should be growing a plant multiple times

428
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:56,399
so you already know those things and

429
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:58,159
then you have the effect too but when

430
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,839
I'm initially trying to look at

431
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:01,600
something

432
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,279
I I'll get preconceived notion like if

433
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,800
it's kind of a beast to grow I don't

434
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:07,078
really like it maybe it's not going to

435
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:08,919
taste as good to me yeah I don't know I

436
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:12,519
kind of like try not to have too much of

437
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:15,078
an opinion on those things until I taste

438
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:16,120
them or you know I think there's when

439
00:15:15,078 --> 00:15:17,679
you're when you're doing when you're

440
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,519
working with 500 plants there's also the

441
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:21,239
commercial viability aspect of it is

442
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,720
this something that because that's why

443
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,720
I'm doing it right like to license them

444
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,360
to sell clones how's this going to

445
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:30,160
perform for my friends or the people I

446
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,039
want to sell a clone to or license a

447
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:34,600
clone to yeah you know so there's that

448
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:37,719
we get get rid of some of the stuff that

449
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:40,639
are just runty but every once in a while

450
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,959
I'll find some little runty plant and

451
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,639
I'm like uh we're going to keep this for

452
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,719
breeding maybe we're not going to ever

453
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,440
sell this to anybody but I love the way

454
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,199
this tastes or I love the way this

455
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,800
smells and so we'll save that stuff for

456
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:55,679
something special but it's then this

457
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:56,838
purpose is really for the breeding you

458
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:58,439
know and there's some stuff that's a

459
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:01,839
real big yielder or something that's a

460
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:04,279
super fast finisher and maybe it's

461
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,519
amazing for the that trait that specific

462
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:09,759
trait it finishes really fast right so

463
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:12,879
has this amazing quality finishes in 45

464
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:16,959
days done yields three pounds per

465
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:18,720
4x4 gets purple and so but but it's

466
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:20,000
missing something right but that doesn't

467
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,399
mean you need to throw it away because

468
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,639
it's missing something that means that

469
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:25,120
maybe you could breed it with other

470
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:28,079
stuff to potentially you know especially

471
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,240
other fast finishers uh especially if

472
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:32,198
you get high can avonoids you know

473
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,079
there's there's so many things that

474
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:35,719
maybe they don't fit into the model but

475
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:37,679
they still have use and they still have

476
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,278
purpose and then when you have you know

477
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:41,519
like five to six or 700 plants in a feno

478
00:16:40,278 --> 00:16:43,360
hunt you're going to find a lot of good

479
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,720
stuff and a lot of interesting stuff and

480
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,720
a lot of stuff you think is interesting

481
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,440
that's not so I see that a lot where I'm

482
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,399
like oh I get excited about something

483
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,600
and you you never know yeah and you know

484
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,958
personal opinions too some of some of my

485
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,600
favorite things that I've had um it's

486
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,838
not the first jar that's empty out of

487
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,079
some of the things that I put on the

488
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,800
table so that's all subjective as well

489
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:05,678
the jar test is always the true it's the

490
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:07,279
best test yeah sometimes it'll break

491
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,600
your heart but it's the best

492
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:10,759
test yeah and I mean it's like with my

493
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,399
friends too it's like which ones are

494
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:14,480
they coming back for which are which

495
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,038
ones are the which ones everybody asking

496
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,120
for yeah yeah so tell us a little bit

497
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:20,078
about some of the breeding projects

498
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:22,159
you're doing right now yeah so you know

499
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:24,678
I am just in the infancy as we all know

500
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,120
it takes time um for years I've been

501
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:29,200
working on just like selecting something

502
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,279
that I really liked something that works

503
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,679
with my body well um something that's

504
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:34,839
nice to grow and you mentioned

505
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:37,679
commercial viability that's also a thing

506
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:39,240
so I want to be able I know I know that

507
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,160
if I find something that works great for

508
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,679
my body it's going to help other people

509
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:46,320
and for me that's just the real intent

510
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:49,679
behind it so I I've found the ones that

511
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:50,879
I like some things that help me um you

512
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,200
know I'm sure as anybody in breeding

513
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,559
will tell you don't work with a plant

514
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,720
that you don't absolutely love because

515
00:17:53,558 --> 00:17:56,960
you're going to be working with it for a

516
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,159
long time yeah so i' I've been working

517
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,679
on selecting things that work for for my

518
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:03,840
palette and then slowly working with the

519
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,559
Westport grape juice to try that against

520
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:07,480
a variety of different things to see how

521
00:18:05,558 --> 00:18:09,558
that expresses to see what is

522
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,720
consistently coming over sometimes what

523
00:18:09,558 --> 00:18:13,558
gets

524
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:16,400
buried in the infancy so I'm really

525
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:18,918
honing in on those right now to put that

526
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,480
forward in the future so in a few more

527
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:21,840
years hopefully I'll have it more dialed

528
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,000
but yeah right now that's that's what

529
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:25,720
I'm doing yeah well these things are

530
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,759
long-term projects it's not instant

531
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,640
gratification and that's that's why you

532
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:31,440
get so much Gra ification out of them

533
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,960
when they go well is because it's a lot

534
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,440
of these projects take a long time I

535
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,519
you've been working on the uh Westport

536
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,880
grape juice for a while yeah for at

537
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:42,519
least three years that you can document

538
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:44,480
so and that's you know that's another

539
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:45,720
really fun aspect to me is in the

540
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,640
ospring it's like when you're so

541
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,120
familiar with a plant and you do make

542
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,080
seeds with it and you're able to look at

543
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:53,599
The Offspring You're like oh instantly

544
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:55,119
that is you and oh that is you and

545
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,678
that's a fun part of it for me too

546
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:58,000
because ultimately with selection

547
00:18:56,679 --> 00:18:59,559
that'll help you get back to what you're

548
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,400
trying to really get to feeling like

549
00:18:59,558 --> 00:19:02,399
you're part of the family I love it

550
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,159
that's awesome you know what I mean but

551
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,280
it is like that too because you're like

552
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:08,080
oh where did this come from because this

553
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:09,399
is kind of strange I I'm not seeing this

554
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:11,359
from either one of the parents and all

555
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,320
of a sudden we got this weird plant or

556
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:16,678
today we found a really cool thing yeah

557
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:19,439
we found in a feminized seed lot we

558
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:23,240
found a male plant out of a progyny of

559
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:28,798
feminized seeds there was a full male

560
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:30,400
and it was my zbx times grape gas okay

561
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:32,440
okay and so that's the first time I've

562
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,320
seen that in a while nature will find a

563
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,759
way though nature will find a way or was

564
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:38,439
it pollen that came in on someone's

565
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:40,519
shirt or who knows but we're going to

566
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,960
send the test over to my flora and

567
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:43,440
they're going to sex test it for me so

568
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,159
we'll look at the chromosomes that would

569
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,080
be great I'm excited to get those

570
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:49,000
results and uh let you know how it goes

571
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:51,079
but yeah that's you know it's

572
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,038
like I'm glad we caught that because if

573
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:54,558
it was all feminized seeds I wouldn't be

574
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:57,000
as worried right now in the stage we're

575
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:59,639
in to look for males I'd be more looking

576
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,079
for Herms in the next couple weeks right

577
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,919
right but because there are males in the

578
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:04,158
room I go through every plant and we sex

579
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:08,080
every day we're going through there and

580
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:09,440
trying to find uh signs of males and I

581
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:11,279
love that part too because then you

582
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,080
really get to know your plants you you

583
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:14,678
do again Hands-On what is it that the

584
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:16,319
farmer Shadow is the best nutrient a

585
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:18,600
plant can receive I know I'm butchering

586
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:20,839
that but that is something somewhat

587
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:22,798
along the saying uhhuh but it is totally

588
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:24,720
true you know it's it's the more plants

589
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:26,158
you have the harder it is but it's still

590
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,640
definitely possible to get in there

591
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,799
every day when the more you put in the

592
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,000
more you get out of it like if you don't

593
00:20:29,798 --> 00:20:33,440
spend enough

594
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,319
time uh you you might have time for

595
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,159
other things and then you neglect your

596
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:40,678
room but what happens is if you have a

597
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:43,520
mail and you have a 20 or 30 light room

598
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:45,519
you are going to have a lot of seeds a

599
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:47,158
lot of seeds and maybe you'll get some

600
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:49,200
interesting stuff out of there may you

601
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:51,840
know maybe but also when you're feno

602
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,440
hunting it's really hard to to say that

603
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,038
this is the expression that I'm going to

604
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,679
get when the plant's not seated because

605
00:20:56,038 --> 00:21:00,359
that's just not the case you get a

606
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:02,880
different expression from seated plants

607
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:04,678
you know I I've I've heard that I I

608
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,600
can't conclusively say myself but yeah

609
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:08,120
you know I've kind of heard that and to

610
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:10,278
go back to some of the things that pop

611
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:11,879
out I did a S1 or reversal on the

612
00:21:10,278 --> 00:21:13,839
Westport grape juice yeah and there

613
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,200
there's a a tuck Leaf feno so you know

614
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:17,439
you typically got your lease like this

615
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,080
they're all like this it's consistent

616
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,159
along that particular style all gas yeah

617
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:24,119
now where that comes from in the

618
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:27,039
Westport grape juice it's not present in

619
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:28,599
the actual thing so yeah again going

620
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:29,839
back with the S1 that was kind of fun

621
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:32,079
because there are things that popped out

622
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:34,158
there I'm like okay well that's

623
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:37,678
interesting to me yeah I love well I

624
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:40,080
love seeing recessive traits too mhm and

625
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,798
I love proving myself wrong or proving

626
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:44,759
myself right yeah so that was that that

627
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:47,240
was fun but that was kind of a kind of a

628
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:50,720
oneand done I think um I

629
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:53,839
like males have a lot more pollen damn

630
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,880
it they do but I can really get a ton of

631
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:58,599
pollen out of my my females my reversals

632
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,880
I mean you guys most people seen

633
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:03,000
reversals online and we our our

634
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,640
reversals dump and it's it's a genetic

635
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,640
thing too you don't expect me to get

636
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,840
those reversals on sfv or a handful of

637
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:12,799
other things but but on the typical

638
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:16,199
plant I can reverse them and get jars of

639
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:17,798
pollen per plant nice you know I I was

640
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,319
probably going to ask about what you use

641
00:22:17,798 --> 00:22:20,679
and the ratios and stuff I'm sure that's

642
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:23,158
proprietary but do you think it comes

643
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:26,360
down to a lot of the mix you're using

644
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:29,559
versus genetics or environment or health

645
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:33,359
there's a bunch of things Okay so I mean

646
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:36,278
yeah you're interviewing me now that's

647
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:39,119
okay well so with with silver when

648
00:22:36,278 --> 00:22:41,278
you're using ethylene blockers M uh

649
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:44,639
there's several Silvers that work cidial

650
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:46,880
silver will work MH true cidial silver

651
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,278
it's in my book too like we go into that

652
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,760
like I use nano silver that's from my

653
00:22:49,278 --> 00:22:55,919
friend Tim humiston can Organics really

654
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:58,519
good stuff it I think it's the most

655
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,400
effective and I have the best results on

656
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:01,720
stuff that doesn't reverse really well

657
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,919
so it pretty much reverses everything

658
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,880
and that's why I use it there's single

659
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:09,278
spray one and done boom boom boom STS

660
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,080
you have to spray a few times but you

661
00:23:09,278 --> 00:23:13,000
damage the plant damage the stamata

662
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:15,278
those plants look like death afterwards

663
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,440
look like they're damaged right and so I

664
00:23:15,278 --> 00:23:19,319
don't particularly like STS but STS

665
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,759
works really well okay they still use it

666
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:22,879
in Europe I still think it's the

667
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:24,839
standard for people that make feminized

668
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,520
seeds but I do like the nano silver the

669
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:29,959
best and it's 1 ml per gallon stabilized

670
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:32,400
shelf stable you can make a gallon of it

671
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:35,519
it can sit for the the week that you're

672
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:38,919
okay using it for reversals it's really

673
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:40,679
really good and easy to use um but yeah

674
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:42,720
I mean there's even silver that you can

675
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:44,120
use in your your feet and you can put it

676
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,919
into the roots and then the roots will

677
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:48,719
uptake it and uh yeah you can get

678
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:50,400
reversals like that there's all kinds of

679
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,880
different ways to do it there's so many

680
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,798
different ways to skin a cat it's just

681
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:57,760
all what you prefer and I believe that

682
00:23:54,798 --> 00:24:00,000
you need to test it out before you sign

683
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:02,000
off on it to do a run whether it's a one

684
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,558
light run or a 50 light run you should

685
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
have experience probably have a backup

686
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:08,319
plan in case your reversal doesn't go

687
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,440
quite as well make pollen in advance

688
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:13,439
Plus have fresh pollen and and those

689
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,840
combinations so it's always good

690
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,880
redundancies are good you've seen the

691
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:18,439
building we have redundancies here you

692
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,760
know it's like we got the dosatron on

693
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,240
one side and we're putting the agretech

694
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:24,960
uh irrigation skit up and I'm super

695
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,640
excited with that dosing system yeah U

696
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,640
and then we'll be able to do those tests

697
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,320
but also that's a redundancy what

698
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,759
happens if our dosing system goes out or

699
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:33,599
a dosatron goes out for the day we can

700
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:36,359
switch it over boom boom boom we're

701
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:38,398
instantly switched over to agretech same

702
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:40,119
thing with uh you didn't get to see the

703
00:24:38,398 --> 00:24:42,199
controls in the room but we use groan

704
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:43,079
grow sense and we use the agch system

705
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:47,319
and we're

706
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:49,038
determining uh the root Zone temperature

707
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,918
with the grow sense whereas like we can

708
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:53,359
get environmentals from both and then

709
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:55,679
compare and go okay well why is it this

710
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:57,158
way or why is it that way what's going

711
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,480
on here it gives us a better picture of

712
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:03,480
the room and then if one fails it's the

713
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:05,798
fail safe we can always go back to it um

714
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,919
so yeah it's it's well it's a fun

715
00:25:05,798 --> 00:25:09,839
project but it's like there's a lot of

716
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:12,080
moving Parts literally with those types

717
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:14,439
of things and it is fun that you you

718
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:15,480
know I like the A&amp;B mindset as well

719
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:18,960
because at the end of the day we're

720
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:21,038
trying to get to the best path somewhere

721
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,720
well and if I can figure the best way to

722
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:25,079
do something and I can Empower a

723
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,679
customer to get better results I'm

724
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:28,879
winning they're winning yeah and by them

725
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,519
winning they're going to to buy seeds

726
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,480
for me or genetics from me and it's a

727
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:36,038
win-win situation if I can tell somebody

728
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:37,558
the optimal way to get the best results

729
00:25:36,038 --> 00:25:39,759
from what they're doing whether it be

730
00:25:37,558 --> 00:25:42,798
lighting Spectrum under canopy how

731
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:44,119
valuable is it I'm doing some tests

732
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:46,278
right now with the favin we're doing the

733
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:48,158
faens with the light lifts and we're

734
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:50,200
doing for seed production but also do

735
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,559
doing it for flour and I really like

736
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:56,558
under canopy I think it's a game

737
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:59,079
changer uh yeah plant Health plant Vigor

738
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:00,879
also do you do less work but I feel like

739
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:02,439
the plants just look healthier and the

740
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,200
the bottoms and undercar that don't get

741
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,320
enough light now all of a sudden you get

742
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,159
a lot of light down there and you get

743
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:10,038
bigger yields are you gosh I'm about to

744
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,720
interview again I'm sorry but I I'll

745
00:26:10,038 --> 00:26:13,119
just cut to saying like yeah I this is

746
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,600
the first run where I'm experimenting

747
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:16,519
with some sidelining and underlighting

748
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:17,959
as well just because I I typically I'll

749
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:20,398
lollipop pretty hard I'll get rid of

750
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:22,360
that stuff nobody likes to trim lar no

751
00:26:20,398 --> 00:26:25,079
so yeah I mean the future's bright

752
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:28,079
literally especially with thunder canopy

753
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:29,398
so yeah yeah big big shout out to faven

754
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:33,278
and all the guys that are doing under

755
00:26:29,398 --> 00:26:35,038
canopy faven who I use I like faven um

756
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:37,759
you know and then we got bug lights now

757
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:41,679
I don't know if you saw the episode with

758
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:43,000
uh Grandmaster LED yes y yeah so they're

759
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,960
they're sending some bug lights out

760
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,759
we're gonna be doing R&amp;D with them I'm

761
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:50,399
super excited um I think there's so much

762
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:52,558
potential and we're just now tapping

763
00:26:50,398 --> 00:26:54,599
into some of this stuff the potential

764
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:57,480
for bug lights that'll kill spidermites

765
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:59,879
or help control spidermites and thps how

766
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,919
can you not want want that it it you

767
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:04,600
know that sounds handy and there was a

768
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,919
few years ago um a ring light that the

769
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:07,240
the guy would say you put on top of your

770
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,000
bucket now he said it was all

771
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,519
proprietary he couldn't tell you how it

772
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,079
worked it had to run at night so there

773
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:13,879
were a lot of questions about it and at

774
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:15,798
the time I remember getting it getting

775
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,679
pooed because there were a lot of

776
00:27:15,798 --> 00:27:19,480
logical questions of like well how close

777
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,080
does it have to be to these bugs to

778
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:24,360
affect them how about the duration but

779
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:27,038
that seems to now actually be being

780
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:28,918
getting vetted out to something that's

781
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:31,119
really a practical system

782
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:33,880
yeah Thomas that was on the show

783
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:37,439
grandmas level Thomas yeah he's a he's a

784
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:38,760
OG and I think I mean I'll tell you how

785
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,919
the lights work when I use them I'm

786
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:43,000
excited to test them out you got try and

787
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:45,519
I think the potential for it and UVC and

788
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,278
all these different things are are great

789
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:49,399
we'll see you don't use it for that much

790
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:51,880
and the fact is is if I don't ever have

791
00:27:49,398 --> 00:27:54,278
to spray my plants that's the best IPM

792
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:57,360
ever yeah uh but we you know we

793
00:27:54,278 --> 00:27:59,519
basically Don't Spray be because we're a

794
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:01,359
closed loop system M until we have to

795
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:03,278
spray right you know hydrogen peroxide

796
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:05,038
that's we use a little bit of hydrogen

797
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:06,679
peroxide but other than the hydrogen

798
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:08,879
peroxide we try not to spray I don't

799
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:10,679
want to sell sprayed clones if I don't

800
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,159
have to spray them if it's part of our

801
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:15,600
IPM regimen and we find out that we need

802
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:17,760
to do that in the future we'll do it but

803
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:19,639
as of right now we're a closed loose

804
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:22,759
system everything's from tissue culture

805
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:24,799
so everything's coming in clean right uh

806
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:27,398
and that's the game changer I try to

807
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:29,720
always preach like cultural controls or

808
00:28:27,398 --> 00:28:32,319
cultural IPM because that as you know

809
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:35,919
just like a hom grower um it's easier to

810
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:37,200
be well reactive than proactive larger I

811
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,960
understand proactive because you have a

812
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,000
large investment to take but I

813
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,600
personally would not want to put some

814
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,038
things on my plants and so that's always

815
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:47,359
what I encourage is you know again good

816
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:50,359
cultural controls um all the things that

817
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:51,479
you've done today um but you can get

818
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:53,240
very far with that and I think

819
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,278
ultimately that affects the outcome of

820
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:58,240
the flower as well right you know it's

821
00:28:55,278 --> 00:29:00,159
not going through as much for sure

822
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,519
testing for hopl and verid is so huge

823
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,440
too and popping seeds anymore you got to

824
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:05,839
test all your seed progenies for hopl

825
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,399
and viroid especially if you're getting

826
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:08,918
them from other people if you know like

827
00:29:07,398 --> 00:29:12,639
we're we're using tissue culture to make

828
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:14,360
seeds right so our tissue culture seeds

829
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,720
are not going to have hopl and ver I can

830
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:17,678
guarantee that like that's something we

831
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,519
will guarantee if it's from tissue

832
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,159
culture parents from both of them I will

833
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:23,440
guarantee that there's no hoplon in

834
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:26,360
there that's one thing we're committed

835
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,519
to and so starting in 2025 you're going

836
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:30,519
to see all our seeds are made from

837
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:34,759
tissue culture moms tissue culture

838
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:37,399
parents nice um nice and so that

839
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:40,079
potentially spreads less viroid and and

840
00:29:37,398 --> 00:29:41,398
virus and there's so many other things I

841
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:43,119
mean we just talk about hot PL and and

842
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:47,158
that's one of 50 things that the plant

843
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:48,639
can get it is and you know ultimately

844
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:51,159
over time that that does kind of bring

845
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,360
down a crop or you know destruction

846
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:55,120
that's the the Beast of it is it's not

847
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:57,119
always immediate so you don't

848
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:59,719
necessarily know I mean how much of this

849
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:03,479
industry is actually infected with HL

850
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:05,200
you know huge more than 75% yeah yeah

851
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:09,720
and and we're all still in business

852
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:12,038
somehow but we're for a reason right so

853
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:14,399
it may Express on one limb it may

854
00:30:12,038 --> 00:30:17,359
Express on one plant it may Express on

855
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:19,239
one section one row or the whole room

856
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:21,038
and until it's stressed out sometimes it

857
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:23,120
doesn't Express at all and so some

858
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:25,720
people are like well I got it beat

859
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:27,239
enough it's like you do until you don't

860
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,399
and that's what I so I have a couple

861
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:31,200
friends that basically were the ones

862
00:30:29,398 --> 00:30:32,759
like ah it's not that big of a deal and

863
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,240
now my buddy's like [ __ ] we're [ __ ]

864
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:37,960
and now I got to pay I have 250 things I

865
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:40,880
need cultured or cleaned and it's going

866
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:43,440
to cost so much money and it's crazy and

867
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,960
those things happen dude and it's like

868
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,200
you're good until you're not right and

869
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:50,159
unfortunately a lot of people wait until

870
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,720
they're not before they try to resolve

871
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,519
the issues and so the the issues are you

872
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,120
know it's like how do I solve that

873
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:58,960
problem I I treat it before it's a

874
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:02,638
problem right so if you can do

875
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:05,038
preventative preventative is worth every

876
00:31:02,638 --> 00:31:06,879
every bit of its weight in gold

877
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:08,679
especially with hot plate Andoid and the

878
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,919
potential we have for tissue culture and

879
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:12,720
banking in tissue culture and to be able

880
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:14,639
to grow your moms from tissue

881
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,240
culture that's huge and there's a lot of

882
00:31:14,638 --> 00:31:18,079
people like tissue culture this tissue

883
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,599
culture that talking negatively about it

884
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:20,798
I hear some of those people now but it's

885
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:23,079
like they're not seeing the bigger

886
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:26,038
picture it's like we're talking about

887
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:27,798
virus and viroid prevention yeah and if

888
00:31:26,038 --> 00:31:29,278
you can not have it in your system at

889
00:31:27,798 --> 00:31:31,038
all all if you have a closed loop

890
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:32,480
facility you're never going to have

891
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:33,759
those problems right and if you don't

892
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,079
have those problems you're not going to

893
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:37,480
lose the money that you would have if

894
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:40,720
you had those problems and every

895
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:41,759
day the product gets cheaper and cheaper

896
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,519
it's more

897
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:44,960
competitive uh and I just want to

898
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:48,960
empower because we're a genetics company

899
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,519
I I don't cultivate I cultivate seeds I

900
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,919
cultivate for seed production and for

901
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:55,839
feno hunting and that's it I work with

902
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:57,600
people that produce flour right to me

903
00:31:55,839 --> 00:32:00,319
that's a really the the flower side the

904
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:02,079
C ation side is is much harder to

905
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:04,319
monetize these days unless you already

906
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:06,319
have an established brand or you create

907
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:07,720
the best of the best flower you're in

908
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:10,119
competition with so many other people

909
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,839
that are producing pretty good flour and

910
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:14,599
the price is so cheap that they can

911
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:16,558
charge so little it's very competitive

912
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:19,798
and I I see a lot of people struggling

913
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:21,240
on that side you know the word craft has

914
00:32:19,798 --> 00:32:23,158
always been tossed around for you know

915
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:25,159
as long as I can remember and that just

916
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:27,240
kind of small scale and for for a while

917
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:28,919
that seemed to be where some of the

918
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:31,240
quality was

919
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:33,038
um but those a lot of them at least in

920
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,440
Washington you know seem to be bought up

921
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:36,359
there there are still ones that exist

922
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,519
but there's a lot of

923
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:41,278
consolidation um there's a lot of large

924
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:43,000
players but hopefully as if if we do go

925
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:45,200
federally legal or at least the gates

926
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,240
are open I hope that's kind of like the

927
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,880
return to the craft it's almost you know

928
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:51,919
it's like what what was once underground

929
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:54,278
is now above ground and a lot of times

930
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:58,679
that will rebirth another underground it

931
00:32:54,278 --> 00:33:01,558
didn't work for disco so hey EDM man EDM

932
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:04,240
well no but disco was in the 7s yeah

933
00:33:01,558 --> 00:33:05,558
yeah Studio 54 oh yeah once disco was

934
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,638
they have that saying once disco was

935
00:33:05,558 --> 00:33:09,519
gone it was never the same and I don't

936
00:33:07,638 --> 00:33:11,759
think cannabis will ever be quite the

937
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,558
same I mean I love that you're positive

938
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:15,798
about it and I try to be very optimistic

939
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:18,038
and positive as well um and I don't

940
00:33:15,798 --> 00:33:19,599
think Boutique or craft cannabis is

941
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:22,038
going away I hopefully it'll only get

942
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:24,000
bigger and better and hopefully they'll

943
00:33:22,038 --> 00:33:26,158
allow interstate commerce cuz that's

944
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,519
like the biggest one it's like man some

945
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,960
of my friends they grow amazing flower

946
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:33,038
if they could just sell it in all 50

947
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:34,960
states they would be crushing it yeah

948
00:33:33,038 --> 00:33:36,558
absolutely there there are there's a lot

949
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,880
of places a lot of regions that have

950
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:41,638
really good stuff but you know once it

951
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:45,039
becomes such a big commodity it's not

952
00:33:41,638 --> 00:33:46,678
going to be as valuable as it is so

953
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:48,720
again you're G to kind of have M it's

954
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:50,159
not in the middle it's not on the

955
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,278
extremes there's going to be the

956
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:53,880
extremely cheap and the extremely

957
00:33:52,278 --> 00:33:55,599
expensive yeah we see that with the

958
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,559
NorCal Nemo and some of these Brands

959
00:33:55,599 --> 00:34:01,480
down in LA and New York the you know the

960
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:03,158
sprinkle sprayed whatever stuff you

961
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,720
whatever I mean I'm not I'm not one to

962
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:06,120
judge right like if people want to buy

963
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,319
it and that's their choice it's like I'm

964
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:09,519
not going to hate on them at all they're

965
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:11,398
doing their they've done it whatever it

966
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:13,159
may not be what I smoke but I'm not

967
00:34:11,398 --> 00:34:14,799
going to like knock it because if that's

968
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:16,878
what you enjoy and you think that's cool

969
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,560
then [ __ ] right on because it's weed

970
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:20,199
right yeah there there's all kinds of

971
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:21,599
people with all kinds of motivations

972
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:23,000
though and you you know you hopefully

973
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,480
you find the ones that align with you

974
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,079
but there's some that absolutely don't

975
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,800
align with you in the same industry

976
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:30,079
doing the exact same thing and to the

977
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:32,159
Outsiders you are one and the same right

978
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:34,639
so yeah there has to be a

979
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,358
differentiation but it it takes time man

980
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:40,919
it takes the lover it takes the true

981
00:34:36,358 --> 00:34:43,279
connoisseurs to care yeah so I'm getting

982
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:45,960
my hats make weed green

983
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:48,960
again that's for the election 2024

984
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:51,079
that's awesome uh yeah I mean I think we

985
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,440
need to go back to green weed we need to

986
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:53,800
the green flower I can't wait for the

987
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,639
green flower to make a huge comeback

988
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,119
it's starting to people are starting to

989
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:58,800
get more into sativas I spent some time

990
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,119
in Humble so I'm like these people know

991
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,920
weed they like that they like stuff

992
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,200
that's not just Lemon Cherry stuff

993
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,519
that's not just purple and there's

994
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:07,559
nothing wrong with purple that's mostly

995
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:08,920
what I breed that's most of the stuff

996
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:10,719
I'm working on right now and that those

997
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,838
rooms you're in today 80% of that is

998
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:14,439
going to be purple candy okay right and

999
00:35:12,838 --> 00:35:16,159
there's nothing wrong with that I also

1000
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:18,599
have some sativas in there and I also

1001
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:21,399
have some crazy CBG varieties and I also

1002
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:23,640
have some really off-the-wall you know

1003
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:26,400
rare canono stuff that we'll see what it

1004
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:28,519
comes out like and so I kind of but but

1005
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,160
the main focus is still

1006
00:35:28,519 --> 00:35:31,880
give the people what they want and right

1007
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:35,559
now the people want candy and they want

1008
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:37,559
color Y and I'm okay with that I'm all

1009
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:39,838
about Flavor too so it's got to have a

1010
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:43,719
[ __ ] good flavor yeah I love good

1011
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:44,799
flavor you know being a chef and working

1012
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:46,480
with something that has the potential

1013
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,640
for good flavor why would you not want

1014
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,719
to select for that and for effect right

1015
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:52,519
at the end we talk about that a lot yeah

1016
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:53,799
I'm okay with there being I I breed for

1017
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:54,719
effect but it's like some things I'll

1018
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,000
breed for effect because they're

1019
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:57,318
uplifting other things I'll breed

1020
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,838
because they're narcotic and some things

1021
00:35:57,318 --> 00:36:00,440
I'll breed cuz they're right in the

1022
00:35:58,838 --> 00:36:02,599
middle and I like the effect of

1023
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,920
something right in the middle well you

1024
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:05,920
know I like to have something for all

1025
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,960
times a day cuz I'm a pretty regular

1026
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,559
smoker every day constantly throughout

1027
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,119
the day I always describe myself as a

1028
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:12,719
sipper though I don't really sit down

1029
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,599
and just take one to the head I usually

1030
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:16,759
have like a little chill them little

1031
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:20,039

1032
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:22,880

1033
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:25,039
right if you're offering though yeah

1034
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,640
we'll do whatever you know uh yeah we

1035
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:29,440
should probably fire something up I

1036
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:32,799
would be game fire something up here you

1037
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,920
know I've got to smell and uh taste a

1038
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,160
lot of great things so far today so what

1039
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:39,800
do we got

1040
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:45,399
now these big joints man

1041
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:48,359
these that was man okay I got to draw

1042
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:51,358
the line at the eighth joint like only

1043
00:36:48,358 --> 00:36:52,920
eight today yeah one one of the one of

1044
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:55,440
the things you know you always hear is

1045
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,159
you know it tastes good the next day

1046
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,240
yeah like if you're if you're rolling a

1047
00:36:57,159 --> 00:37:02,440
joint that big and that you have to fire

1048
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:03,879
it up the next day roll a smaller joint

1049
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,159
finish that [ __ ] I don't know man I'm

1050
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,720
okay with firing it back up it's like

1051
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:09,318
something like this if if I'm in the

1052
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:11,000
mood I will sit and puff it for an hour

1053
00:37:09,318 --> 00:37:12,880
right but if I'm not I might puff it for

1054
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,480
30 minutes put it out sometimes I'll

1055
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,960
come into work yeah and I'll smoke uh or

1056
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,480
whatever at the house like I'll smoke

1057
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:22,039
something that's already there and I'll

1058
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,199
also do it just to see if it tastes good

1059
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:24,480
and if it doesn't taste good obviously I

1060
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:26,519
won't finish it I'll fire something else

1061
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,838
up but if it still tastes good and it's

1062
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:32,599
like so me candy or some good OG or some

1063
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:33,880
funk I'm like oh yeah that tastes great

1064
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:36,519
it makes me want to smoke because the

1065
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:38,200
flavor is so good still yeah like the

1066
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:40,400
the identification game that was

1067
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:42,598
something that happened recently with me

1068
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,358
um I was out of town I had a friend

1069
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:46,359
taking care of things and doing some

1070
00:37:44,358 --> 00:37:47,960
trimming and they totally mixed up the

1071
00:37:46,358 --> 00:37:49,358
labels on the jars there's like here's

1072
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,838
this here's that here's that I was able

1073
00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:54,039
to open the jar and be like no you you

1074
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:55,759
got these mixed up that's an important

1075
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:58,119
thing with flavor too like I always say

1076
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,920
you know if if you do come back to it

1077
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:02,280
you should be able to identify it and if

1078
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:05,159
you can't maybe that's not worth keeping

1079
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:07,040
around because that's you know all

1080
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:09,318
killer no filler is kind of what I like

1081
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:12,119
to try to get to there there's so much

1082
00:38:09,318 --> 00:38:13,519
average out there um there's a lot of

1083
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:15,400
amazing yeah I mean I have so much

1084
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:17,318
access to stuff I want to smoke the very

1085
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,960
best of the best and you know it's

1086
00:38:17,318 --> 00:38:20,400
always like what can I get that's better

1087
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,519
than that or what's you know and it's

1088
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,480
like but I have usually like 10 or 12

1089
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:26,159
things that I enjoy smoking at any one

1090
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,119
given time now I I like to keep a

1091
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:29,559
variety as well like in my in my drawer

1092
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:31,838
I always kind of have at least 10

1093
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:33,400
different strains that I can choose from

1094
00:38:31,838 --> 00:38:36,519
depending upon how I'm feeling what I'm

1095
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:38,358
looking for um yeah variety is is really

1096
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:40,400
key to me and that's kind of one reasons

1097
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:42,318
why I I grow like smaller plants because

1098
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,920
I want to try to do a larger quantity

1099
00:38:42,318 --> 00:38:49,440
how small um veg for about 30 days maybe

1100
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:52,519
flip you know 18 inches 20 inches flip

1101
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,639
at about that but I'm also have been

1102
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:55,559
going when I've been going through

1103
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:57,679
things I've been selecting for shorter

1104
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:59,719
squater things things that don't have as

1105
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:01,279
large of a stretch because again if

1106
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:03,078
you're growing in a smaller environment

1107
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,920
you're growing in a tent you don't want

1108
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:06,400
things with large stretches I've grown

1109
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:10,079
some sativas in there that just

1110
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:12,000
absolutely took over the tent but I have

1111
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:15,280
kind of a purpose and a specific goal in

1112
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,559
mind so yeah I I I let them maybe get a

1113
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,240
little bit taller than some other people

1114
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:22,078
but I'm also looking for ones that don't

1115
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:24,439
stretch a lot and this one is this is a

1116
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:27,800
permanent midnight okay we got SE of

1117
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:29,039
this so there's some interesting fenos

1118
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,960
that is a

1119
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:33,440
3.5 and uh also you can tell it's grown

1120
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,880
to Perfection because it's got some nice

1121
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:39,679
white ash and it's got a little Oil ring

1122
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:42,240
there gotta love the oil

1123
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:44,639
yeah but uh it's got good flavor and

1124
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:49,279
this one this batch came out really good

1125
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:53,118
it tastes good down to the roach I like

1126
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:56,160
that yep I do too well these are ones

1127
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:58,358
where like it's hard to put it down like

1128
00:39:56,159 --> 00:40:01,598
I can just sit here with it and talk and

1129
00:39:58,358 --> 00:40:04,400
take a hit talk and take a hit and talk

1130
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:05,960
and take a hit for two hours or whatever

1131
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,160
you know this was this is an hour joint

1132
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:10,838
I think this is probably a 60 Minute

1133
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:12,639
like if we do it nice and slow I used to

1134
00:40:10,838 --> 00:40:14,400
judge chairlifts when I go uh

1135
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:16,639
snowboarding by how many how many

1136
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,800
cigarettes you could have H it's a two

1137
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:19,838
two smoke lift nowadays it'd be better

1138
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,440
if it was joints I don't smoke

1139
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:22,639
cigarettes anymore but yeah you you

1140
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,318
could do it probably with joints these

1141
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:27,318
days yeah for sure we used to smoke

1142
00:40:25,318 --> 00:40:29,519
joints going on the chairlifts oh yeah

1143
00:40:27,318 --> 00:40:31,079
or hot boox the gondolas I've never been

1144
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:32,440
I've never had the opportunity but there

1145
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:35,680
there's something special about smoking

1146
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:37,119
at altitude like I enjoy so we used to

1147
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:39,440
so when I used to go snowboarding we

1148
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:41,358
also used to have a plastic bong that we

1149
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,039
used to travel with and pack it with ice

1150
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:46,400
and so we get ice bong RS back in the

1151
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:48,599
day I mean this is like 20 years ago

1152
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,240
over 20 years ago we used to just rock

1153
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:51,519
it out with bong herbs right out of the

1154
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:53,959
you know right in the beginning of the

1155
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:56,400
day going down the mountain yep my

1156
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:59,400
favorite we uh Stevens Pass is one of

1157
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:01,680
the local Mountains in Washington and uh

1158
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,079
decades ago I had friends that worked up

1159
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:04,519
there and I went and stayed in the you

1160
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:06,560
know kind of like the employee cabins

1161
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:08,318
for a week and there's a little 420 cave

1162
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:10,358
up there that always just had like a

1163
00:41:08,318 --> 00:41:12,119
bong just like permanently installed

1164
00:41:10,358 --> 00:41:14,000
there so if you knew where it was and

1165
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:16,838
you could actually Traverse over to this

1166
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,679
place uh you hit the 420 cave and the

1167
00:41:16,838 --> 00:41:21,960
420 bong and that was always fun there's

1168
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:23,279
there's a big culture I mean there

1169
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,800
there's a lot of people there's a lot of

1170
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,519
snowboarders that I know that have been

1171
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,880
involved with weed and that was almost

1172
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:30,358
kind of like their their side hustle

1173
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,680
they were Reps for certain companies

1174
00:41:30,358 --> 00:41:33,799
which brought them all around to

1175
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:36,078
different shops and different people but

1176
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:38,039
uh the they also had their own little

1177
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,519
side hustle and it's fun sometimes

1178
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:40,719
figuring these things out years later

1179
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:43,039
because I did work in the skateboard

1180
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:45,239
snowboard industry and so I'd meet them

1181
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:48,199
in one aspect and then in the parking

1182
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:50,118
lot I'd be like wait a minute you're the

1183
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:53,598
guy with that

1184
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:54,680
okay and that was actually the last the

1185
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:56,760
last time I'm remember BR bring up a

1186
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:58,719
triggering word here um but that was the

1187
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:01,119
last time I really smelled a skunk yeah

1188
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:03,078
was in the parking lot of Steven's Pass

1189
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:05,318
I I looked for it but they had probably

1190
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:07,240
walked off like half hour earlier but I

1191
00:42:05,318 --> 00:42:08,519
I had everything that I had with me and

1192
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:10,399
I was goingon to give him everything for

1193
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:12,639
a nug like just give me a nug of that

1194
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,880
that's all I want no I could smell it

1195
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:17,598
but they probably just walked off

1196
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:19,960
already nice little $100 joint

1197
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:22,318
there this is but these are this is what

1198
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:24,960
I enjoy so like right I can smoke this

1199
00:42:22,318 --> 00:42:26,239
24 hours a day I I and have a good time

1200
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,599
I feel like this is one of those morning

1201
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:29,318
ones I could smoke in morning I can

1202
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:32,800
smoke it afternoon evening it's got the

1203
00:42:29,318 --> 00:42:35,000
right flavor it's uh it's a big one

1204
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,920
though but I guarantee you put it out

1205
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,119
you come back to it an hour later 10

1206
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:41,680
hours later the next day still tastes

1207
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:44,400
just like this damn yeah okay that's

1208
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:46,919
impressive that is it's an advancement

1209
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,639
that's one thing that you know at least

1210
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,880
I think that legalization has brought is

1211
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:52,679
there's so many more flavors so many

1212
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,640
more profile there's more but I remember

1213
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:56,639
smoking weed that was like this good

1214
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:58,519
yeah back in the 90s right the cat piss

1215
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:59,799
to me was like this we'd smoke joints of

1216
00:42:58,519 --> 00:43:03,119
cat piss and literally smoke them the

1217
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:05,680
next day and they tasted good no cat

1218
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:07,200
piss roach ever went to waste we would

1219
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:09,000
smoke them down we would take it and put

1220
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:10,239
it in bongs at the end that last little

1221
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,159
roach break it out of the paper and

1222
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:13,799
smoke it in a bong R before we would

1223
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:15,639
throw the cat piss roaches we and it was

1224
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:18,119
$60 an a straight

1225
00:43:15,639 --> 00:43:20,519
up and that was the skunkiest weed back

1226
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:22,720
in the day though it was like fowl skunk

1227
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:24,880
ammonia did you did you appreciate it

1228
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:27,399
for what it was at the time or was it

1229
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,160
this hindsight of like pining for that

1230
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:31,599
you're like I appreciated it so much at

1231
00:43:29,159 --> 00:43:34,039
the time it was so amazing and I was in

1232
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:35,800
disbelief that it could taste so good

1233
00:43:34,039 --> 00:43:37,358
and all the way down when you smoke it

1234
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:40,079
that you could have flavor like that and

1235
00:43:37,358 --> 00:43:42,759
it it really sparked my curiosity and

1236
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:44,519
set me up for the person that I am today

1237
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,920
because I also realized that I talk

1238
00:43:44,519 --> 00:43:48,159
about this a lot of my shows well the

1239
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,039
ugly weed is not necessarily the stuff

1240
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:53,000
that doesn't look good isn't necessarily

1241
00:43:50,039 --> 00:43:54,599
bad yeah it might have an amazing effect

1242
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,400
but a lot of people today think it has

1243
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:59,079
to look good too and we had the ugly

1244
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:01,318
stuff ever was the best stuff back in

1245
00:43:59,079 --> 00:44:03,480
the day so I never want to like look

1246
00:44:01,318 --> 00:44:05,159
past any of the ugly one we want to go

1247
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,838
through and smoke everything and yeah

1248
00:44:05,159 --> 00:44:09,759
the commercial viability side is cool

1249
00:44:06,838 --> 00:44:11,159
and important but sometimes some of the

1250
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:13,079
stuff we want to keep just for ourselves

1251
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:14,920
too yeah a lot of the product I mean if

1252
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:16,839
we're just talking flour doesn't

1253
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:18,358
actually make it to the consumer's eyes

1254
00:44:16,838 --> 00:44:19,759
right whether it's getting concentrated

1255
00:44:18,358 --> 00:44:21,199
or put into a joint like that like the

1256
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,440
consumer never sees what that flour

1257
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:25,439
looks like people that help me feno hunt

1258
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,358
do they never see it either I give them

1259
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,800
joints they get joints like this there

1260
00:44:27,358 --> 00:44:31,039
you go and the reason is is because I

1261
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,200
know what the weed looks like I know

1262
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:33,558
what the flower looks like I know what

1263
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:35,318
the structure looks like I know what it

1264
00:44:33,559 --> 00:44:36,559
smells like too I would really like to

1265
00:44:35,318 --> 00:44:38,558
know what it tastes like and what the

1266
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:40,599
effect are I think those are the two

1267
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:41,800
most informative pieces of information

1268
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:44,000
that somebody who's trying to help you

1269
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:46,039
do selections can do for you yeah they

1270
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,400
can be like oh this one's great but if

1271
00:44:46,039 --> 00:44:49,800
you can roll them a joint of it and they

1272
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:52,559
can be like you gave me 20 joints this

1273
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:54,440
one was by far the best or this one was

1274
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:56,400
by far the best and it felt like this or

1275
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:58,318
this one made me feel like this but it

1276
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,838
didn't taste very good but the effect

1277
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:02,119
was something special you know cuz those

1278
00:45:00,838 --> 00:45:03,719
are the kind of feedback that's that's

1279
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:06,920
the kind of stuff you can't get from a

1280
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:08,719
COA right and just because it smells

1281
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:10,880
good doesn't mean it translates into the

1282
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:12,358
smoke and the flavor and maybe it tastes

1283
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,160
good in the beginning but then halfway

1284
00:45:12,358 --> 00:45:15,199
down it you don't taste it at all yeah

1285
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:16,679
but when you get something like this

1286
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:20,679
where we're getting into it right now

1287
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:22,118
and it's still just amazing flavor

1288
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:23,519
that's what I like you know and I want

1289
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:25,760
it to taste that good all the way down

1290
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:28,159
to the roach I would love for the roach

1291
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:31,720
tomorrow to taste just as good as it did

1292
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:33,879
today well that thank and that just

1293
00:45:31,719 --> 00:45:36,439
again that just goes back to the amount

1294
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:38,599
of flavors and profiles that we're

1295
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:40,639
seeing out there now because it for me

1296
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:43,680
it has to be a smack you in the face

1297
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:45,879
there is no more subpar like I don't

1298
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:49,159
want to have to imagine what this is

1299
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:50,838
like I want to instantly know I mean we

1300
00:45:49,159 --> 00:45:53,920
all have that influence of like oh you

1301
00:45:50,838 --> 00:45:55,838
know you know asphalt or whatever but I

1302
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,358
want it just to smack me in the face and

1303
00:45:55,838 --> 00:45:58,679
there's there's a few profiles that do

1304
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:00,880
that so it's funny cuz you're talking

1305
00:45:58,679 --> 00:46:03,318
about asphalt and earlier today we had

1306
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:06,400
the asphalt pheno of the GMO banana

1307
00:46:03,318 --> 00:46:08,079
Skittles and that is the most asphalt

1308
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,880
I've smelled in a long time where it

1309
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:12,960
straight up smells like hot asphalt

1310
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:14,000
that's just been poured and it's like

1311
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,639
it's funny because when you're going

1312
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,280
through different selections things that

1313
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:20,519
remind you of childhood or past memories

1314
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,880
those are the things that excite me the

1315
00:46:20,519 --> 00:46:23,239
most and that's why I love doing this

1316
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:25,280
that's that's one of the things that I

1317
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:26,479
love the most about going through rooms

1318
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:29,240
is when you can find something where

1319
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,800
it's like o fresh hot asphalt and then

1320
00:46:29,239 --> 00:46:33,039
in your mind it's like when you start

1321
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,519
thinking when did I smell that last and

1322
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:36,679
you know but it's like I've smelled that

1323
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:39,920
a bunch over over time throughout my

1324
00:46:36,679 --> 00:46:41,358
life um and there's so many little

1325
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,318
things like that green tea we got a

1326
00:46:41,358 --> 00:46:46,199
green tea plant the other day that's

1327
00:46:43,318 --> 00:46:47,838
spelled straight like green tea and I

1328
00:46:46,199 --> 00:46:49,919
love all that stuff I love it when

1329
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:53,279
they're unique and I love especially the

1330
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:55,079
different ones mhm Fried Chicken yeah

1331
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,640
yeah that's that's a weird tur but it

1332
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:59,039
does exist um I mean I was smelling one

1333
00:46:57,639 --> 00:47:01,118
earlier and it smelled just like the

1334
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:03,119
rubber dolls like when you were a kid

1335
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,318
not like the like like He-Man characters

1336
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:05,760
but there's a dis You' been smelling

1337
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:09,039
Barbies

1338
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:11,640
I Barbie smell

1339
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:13,599
different but uh yeah it's there's you

1340
00:47:11,639 --> 00:47:16,480
know a bit of nostalgia with it and

1341
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:18,400
music too that's totally you know that's

1342
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,838
oh yeah it brings you back man that's

1343
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,639
such a cool thing when you get a

1344
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:23,159
connection to the plant it Sparks

1345
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:25,000
something in the brain and it becomes

1346
00:47:23,159 --> 00:47:27,399
special well and the thing like with

1347
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,719
pheno hunting if if you do it right

1348
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:31,559
you're spending a lot of time with those

1349
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:33,159
plants so like as they're progressing

1350
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:36,280
and as they're going in from a

1351
00:47:33,159 --> 00:47:37,960
vegetative plant into flower uh you

1352
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:40,040
start seeing the subtleness and the

1353
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:41,480
changes and it's it comes on very

1354
00:47:40,039 --> 00:47:44,318
quickly and sometimes in other things

1355
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:47,358
it's very soft and subtle things that

1356
00:47:44,318 --> 00:47:49,318
you notice are like very subtle after it

1357
00:47:47,358 --> 00:47:50,719
goes into flow and then it's like okay

1358
00:47:49,318 --> 00:47:52,880
well we have this structure we have this

1359
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:55,318
or that or these smells and where you

1360
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:57,200
can have some that are you know you take

1361
00:47:55,318 --> 00:47:59,519
20 things from the same progy and they

1362
00:47:57,199 --> 00:48:01,000
all smell completely different and then

1363
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:02,679
sometimes you find those ones where it's

1364
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,719
they're all pretty much the same or

1365
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:06,838
they're all they're all shades of almost

1366
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:08,199
almost The Identical same thing you know

1367
00:48:06,838 --> 00:48:10,679
whether it's orange and one's a little

1368
00:48:08,199 --> 00:48:12,279
more rindy or it smell one's a little

1369
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:14,358
more orange juice smelling and one

1370
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:17,440
really smells like the fruit and one

1371
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:18,639
smells like the fake concentrate M you

1372
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,039
know because you can get that or you can

1373
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:22,000
get some that are like oh this one

1374
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:23,759
smells like burnt rubber and this one

1375
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,599
smells like a completely different type

1376
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:28,359
of gas that's sometimes the terminology

1377
00:48:26,599 --> 00:48:30,400
too I think gets into place as funny it

1378
00:48:28,358 --> 00:48:32,679
reminds me of of a friend he always says

1379
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,280
nuances like that's his answer to most

1380
00:48:32,679 --> 00:48:36,879
everything but there are there's like

1381
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:39,160
different levels of like grape you know

1382
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:41,960
is it candy grape is it a wine grape is

1383
00:48:39,159 --> 00:48:45,440
it what kind of grape is it so is it

1384
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:47,318
like wine grape sparkling is it you know

1385
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:50,519
there's grape juice there's conquered

1386
00:48:47,318 --> 00:48:51,719
grapes there's a grapefruit rollup yeah

1387
00:48:50,519 --> 00:48:53,000
you know what I mean like there there's

1388
00:48:51,719 --> 00:48:55,719
all kinds of exciting there's grape

1389
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,079
candy like a grape Skittles you know cuz

1390
00:48:55,719 --> 00:48:58,959
I think of grape Skittles think of

1391
00:48:57,079 --> 00:49:00,440
Skittles as all the just Skittles I mean

1392
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,639
there's the can like when someone says

1393
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:04,280
that I think of the the cultivar right

1394
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:06,358
but if you talk about grape Skittles as

1395
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:09,519
opposed to Green Skittles like that to

1396
00:49:06,358 --> 00:49:11,078
me those are distinct yeah so and then

1397
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:12,960
with grape it's like there there's a

1398
00:49:11,079 --> 00:49:15,160
bunch there's a ton of bunch and and

1399
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,720
especially when you compare it to want I

1400
00:49:15,159 --> 00:49:20,239
said a ton of bunch I'm making up words

1401
00:49:17,719 --> 00:49:22,039
but you know it's funny uh but with

1402
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:23,479
things like grapes and with oranges that

1403
00:49:22,039 --> 00:49:25,279
are complex and there's so many

1404
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:27,798
components of them you know because

1405
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:30,119
there's even the zest right like yeah

1406
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:33,719
yeah go into the zest of an orange or

1407
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:35,599
whatever it's interesting I got um it's

1408
00:49:33,719 --> 00:49:37,078
a good joint by the way it's pretty

1409
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:39,119
strong too it's it's it's ton a bunch

1410
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:42,039
strong yeah ton a bunch strong T bun

1411
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:43,838
strong it'll get you there I feel like

1412
00:49:42,039 --> 00:49:46,039
yeah and well so this is one that checks

1413
00:49:43,838 --> 00:49:49,880
the boxes right it looks beautiful

1414
00:49:46,039 --> 00:49:51,798
smells amazing tastes good MH the effect

1415
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:53,680
is just over the top I feel like it's

1416
00:49:51,798 --> 00:49:56,358
good and it comes on pretty strong and

1417
00:49:53,679 --> 00:50:00,480
then it just kind of goes nice and even

1418
00:49:56,358 --> 00:50:03,798
yeah so you know the with the the um you

1419
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:07,000
know like flavors there's um so John

1420
00:50:03,798 --> 00:50:10,239
gross based killer shout out um he he

1421
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:14,318
backs up my Westport grape juice and he

1422
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:16,000
he actually um this last Dabo that they

1423
00:50:14,318 --> 00:50:19,558
had he took second place with the

1424
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:23,039
hachimaki grape juice um it was a

1425
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:24,960
combination of his 818 headband yep and

1426
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:27,318
the Westport grape juice

1427
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,838
and interesting enough he was able

1428
00:50:27,318 --> 00:50:30,239
obviously he had to get analytics so I

1429
00:50:28,838 --> 00:50:31,960
have you know like data and stuff for

1430
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:33,838
these now but their tpine profiles

1431
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:37,559
exactly what they had the percentages

1432
00:50:33,838 --> 00:50:40,279
they matched so closely but yet when you

1433
00:50:37,559 --> 00:50:42,040
try them as individuals there is such a

1434
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:44,400
difference but you know he's he's

1435
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:46,480
starting to talk about the nuances of

1436
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,480
blending to oh that's awesome I like

1437
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:50,798
blending rosin yeah but if we talk about

1438
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:52,679
nuances there's also you know we talking

1439
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:54,838
about the white papers from abstracts

1440
00:50:52,679 --> 00:50:57,239
Tech that were released this year on

1441
00:50:54,838 --> 00:50:59,920
flavorant and th

1442
00:50:57,239 --> 00:51:01,959
and sulfur and these things and they're

1443
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:05,200
measured in such minute amounts that

1444
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:06,880
maybe on a COA it looks like they're

1445
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:11,598
similar that's okay that's what I was

1446
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:16,400
trying to that's okay not on the table

1447
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:18,559
DNA that's [ __ ] hilarious uh but yeah

1448
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:20,720
uh with these things they're such small

1449
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:22,599
amounts that they might even look like

1450
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:23,919
it's very similar but like they can be

1451
00:51:22,599 --> 00:51:26,000
completely different but in different

1452
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:28,599
concentrations and a lot of the coas

1453
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,440
that we're looking at there's no dials

1454
00:51:28,599 --> 00:51:32,599
on there flavor or anything they're not

1455
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:34,838
testing for any of that right so we're

1456
00:51:32,599 --> 00:51:37,160
not getting the whole picture no and

1457
00:51:34,838 --> 00:51:39,920
then compared with the canabo that give

1458
00:51:37,159 --> 00:51:41,239
you the effect then it's like but but

1459
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:42,838
over time we're going to collect a lot

1460
00:51:41,239 --> 00:51:43,879
more data yeah and that's what I'm

1461
00:51:42,838 --> 00:51:46,759
excited about is all this data

1462
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:48,000
collection it's like especially when you

1463
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:49,319
can compare it to effect because a lot

1464
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,280
of people their Labs or whatever they

1465
00:51:49,318 --> 00:51:53,199
can compare all this data to more data

1466
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,240
but then can you really compare it to an

1467
00:51:53,199 --> 00:51:57,039
effect because once we can start telling

1468
00:51:55,239 --> 00:51:58,879
you okay it feels makes me feel like

1469
00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:01,798
this or makes me feel like that then you

1470
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:03,000
can have some observable data

1471
00:52:01,798 --> 00:52:05,239
information that I think is very

1472
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,960
valuable that's the key to a billion

1473
00:52:05,239 --> 00:52:09,000
doll industry though is when you can get

1474
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:11,639
that single serving effect like they

1475
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,599
figured out with beer how it can affect

1476
00:52:11,639 --> 00:52:15,440
the majority of the population you can't

1477
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:17,318
do that with cannabis yet like we

1478
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:19,079
haven't figured out single serving

1479
00:52:17,318 --> 00:52:20,719
dosage because because beer pretty much

1480
00:52:19,079 --> 00:52:23,039
does the same thing to everybody and it

1481
00:52:20,719 --> 00:52:24,919
makes you not very good at driving right

1482
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:28,199
cannabis makes me a better driver I

1483
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:31,838
don't drive high usually um never

1484
00:52:28,199 --> 00:52:33,838
allegedly never but but especially uh

1485
00:52:31,838 --> 00:52:35,798
when when we're talking about like being

1486
00:52:33,838 --> 00:52:38,480
impaired to impaired to drive if you're

1487
00:52:35,798 --> 00:52:40,358
a regular cannabis user you're not

1488
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,318
impaired like in that sense some people

1489
00:52:40,358 --> 00:52:43,798
might say you are it's really hard to

1490
00:52:42,318 --> 00:52:45,679
measure for one thing but I feel like

1491
00:52:43,798 --> 00:52:47,400
some people usually if you're if you're

1492
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:48,679
everyday smoker that smokes all day

1493
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:51,639
you're fine driving and you're probably

1494
00:52:48,679 --> 00:52:54,199
more cautious uh and you're more aware

1495
00:52:51,639 --> 00:52:56,199
and the reason is this is what the

1496
00:52:54,199 --> 00:52:58,879
reason is is because alcohol Tunes you

1497
00:52:56,199 --> 00:53:01,439
out mhm and cannabis Tunes you in right

1498
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:03,039
so it's making you more aware of your

1499
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,519
surroundings your environment I feel

1500
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:07,480
like the more that you smoke the more

1501
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:09,559
tuned in you are and aware of everything

1502
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:11,880
whereas the more you drink the less

1503
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:13,640
tuned in you are you're tuned out and it

1504
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:16,160
gets worse and worse and worse to where

1505
00:53:13,639 --> 00:53:18,798
your perception of reality and your

1506
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:21,960
awareness is we down yeah so that's that

1507
00:53:18,798 --> 00:53:23,119
to me is why it's you know you it really

1508
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:25,480
bothers me that they want to arrest

1509
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:27,720
people for smoking weed for driving and

1510
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:30,480
I feel like if you're driving bad maybe

1511
00:53:27,719 --> 00:53:32,039
you should just get a ticket anyway

1512
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,039
right for bad driving no matter what

1513
00:53:32,039 --> 00:53:35,480
whether you're high or whatever but if

1514
00:53:34,039 --> 00:53:37,599
you're you're endangering other people

1515
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:39,798
yeah that's a problem but I don't see a

1516
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:42,798
bunch of putthe heads driving out there

1517
00:53:39,798 --> 00:53:45,519
that are endangering other people no and

1518
00:53:42,798 --> 00:53:47,199
and you're right A lot of people do pay

1519
00:53:45,519 --> 00:53:49,159
more attention when they're doing that

1520
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:50,519
there is a line like there have been a

1521
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:53,480
few times where I'm like I'm not going

1522
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:55,199
to drive at this moment but I'll wait

1523
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:57,039
until I get there if anything it has

1524
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:58,919
just made me more aware

1525
00:53:57,039 --> 00:54:02,000
of what I'm doing but there there's no

1526
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:05,318
again you can't quantify that sort of

1527
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,639
intoxification like a grandma smoking

1528
00:54:05,318 --> 00:54:09,719
that you know not a regular smoker would

1529
00:54:07,639 --> 00:54:13,078
be hurting somebody who is a regular

1530
00:54:09,719 --> 00:54:14,879
smoker is going to be just fine so if

1531
00:54:13,079 --> 00:54:16,680
the same amount of THD is in the blood

1532
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:19,119
how you how do you define that and

1533
00:54:16,679 --> 00:54:22,318
that's a big problem I had a friend

1534
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:24,280
recently in another country um get

1535
00:54:22,318 --> 00:54:26,400
pulled over and they do blood draws

1536
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:29,400
there that's something they can't really

1537
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:31,000
do here at least in Washington no but he

1538
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:33,400
was smart about it he said please give

1539
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,239
me your sobriety test because he gave

1540
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:37,079
him the field sobriety test he passed

1541
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:38,679
with flying colors but he knew that his

1542
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:40,400
blood was going to indicate he was

1543
00:54:38,679 --> 00:54:43,039
intoxicated do you know what country

1544
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:46,240
This was um I I do but I don't really

1545
00:54:43,039 --> 00:54:50,000
want to say okay yeah Canada for sure it

1546
00:54:46,239 --> 00:54:52,239
was can no no I'm kidding but uh but

1547
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,719
yeah it's it's interesting because there

1548
00:54:52,239 --> 00:54:57,199
are countries like that where I've heard

1549
00:54:53,719 --> 00:54:59,439
of people getting arrested for having

1550
00:54:57,199 --> 00:55:00,759
marijuana cannabis in their blood mhm

1551
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:02,559
yeah yeah which I think is absolutely

1552
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:04,240
crazy I think it makes the world a

1553
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:06,559
better place not a worse place first of

1554
00:55:04,239 --> 00:55:08,279
all that needs to be the first point of

1555
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:09,599
discussion yeah second of all it's a

1556
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:13,359
hell of a lot better than alcohol and

1557
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:15,240
tobacco for you so those two things that

1558
00:55:13,358 --> 00:55:17,078
it's we those are legal and those are

1559
00:55:15,239 --> 00:55:20,118
very widely accepted by people

1560
00:55:17,079 --> 00:55:21,798
especially in the US but cannabis the

1561
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:23,640
majority of people I think is they think

1562
00:55:21,798 --> 00:55:25,440
it's okay but there are still some

1563
00:55:23,639 --> 00:55:27,118
people that are like oh man that's just

1564
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:28,318
the worst thing ever

1565
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:30,079
yeah but those people will be gone

1566
00:55:28,318 --> 00:55:33,279
someday they will and they're getting

1567
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:35,318
closer every day um you know I really go

1568
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:37,920
back to Charlotte figgy and the sanj

1569
00:55:35,318 --> 00:55:40,880
Gupta special like I really think that

1570
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:43,280
special changed the minds of a lot of

1571
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:45,640
people or at least it made it harder to

1572
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:48,039
deny once somebody

1573
00:55:45,639 --> 00:55:50,118
sees there's all kinds of ways to use

1574
00:55:48,039 --> 00:55:51,920
cannabis yeah but when there and there's

1575
00:55:50,119 --> 00:55:54,640
a lot of medicinal ways that people can

1576
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:56,720
use it and that was one of them and if

1577
00:55:54,639 --> 00:55:58,159
you can kind of watch that and think

1578
00:55:56,719 --> 00:56:01,118
that it's a bad thing I just think

1579
00:55:58,159 --> 00:56:03,279
you're an a-hole yeah so yeah you're

1580
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:05,400
just a bad person yeah I I really go

1581
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,400
back to that that point because that you

1582
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,480
know that's when we got a lot more

1583
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:10,240
Medical but sorry I cut you off there no

1584
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,280
that's all right but yeah I mean it's

1585
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:13,639
it's interesting that to say some

1586
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:16,798
someone shouldn't be able to heal

1587
00:56:13,639 --> 00:56:18,440
themselves or heal their children yeah

1588
00:56:16,798 --> 00:56:20,199
there's something wrong with that person

1589
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:21,440
that says that it's not okay for plant

1590
00:56:20,199 --> 00:56:23,399
medicine to do that if they're not

1591
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:25,920
hurting other people how can you say

1592
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:28,000
that's bad you know but so many people

1593
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,639
saw that and if if you haven't seen it

1594
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,358
you probably should go look up 60

1595
00:56:29,639 --> 00:56:32,639
Minutes in sanj Gupta and cannabis you

1596
00:56:31,358 --> 00:56:36,000
type that in Google you're going to see

1597
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:38,199
it and it's just a life-changing thing

1598
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,159
it changed my parents mind about

1599
00:56:38,199 --> 00:56:42,078
cannabis more too yeah for more than

1600
00:56:40,159 --> 00:56:44,759
anything I think that that one interview

1601
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:46,240
changed my mom's look at the whole thing

1602
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:48,640
yeah and I don't know her views on it

1603
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:52,439
weren't great before but definitely

1604
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:55,118
after that it's like hard to deny that

1605
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:57,119
you know it's not a bad thing and it's

1606
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:59,240
again it's how it you used too we've

1607
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:01,039
discovered the endoc canabo system

1608
00:56:59,239 --> 00:57:02,719
through this in the 9s and the

1609
00:57:01,039 --> 00:57:04,280
endocannabinoid system is probably one

1610
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:06,318
of the major targets for most

1611
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:08,200
pharmaceutical companies right now for a

1612
00:57:06,318 --> 00:57:10,759
range of different things yeah if we

1613
00:57:08,199 --> 00:57:12,919
didn't know about THC and we didn't try

1614
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:15,240
to figure out where it was working we

1615
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:17,639
wouldn't know about that so there will

1616
00:57:15,239 --> 00:57:19,038
be Pharmaceuticals that come from the

1617
00:57:17,639 --> 00:57:21,038
discoveries that we've made because of

1618
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:22,960
cannabis there already are if that's

1619
00:57:21,039 --> 00:57:24,200
yeah if that's I mean Marinol and that

1620
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:26,599
but if if that's what people want to

1621
00:57:24,199 --> 00:57:29,439
take then fine but give me the right to

1622
00:57:26,599 --> 00:57:31,599
have the origin yeah plant medicine you

1623
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:33,559
know just plant itself GW

1624
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:35,359
Pharmaceuticals you know they they're

1625
00:57:33,559 --> 00:57:38,200
definitely on the cusp and have been

1626
00:57:35,358 --> 00:57:42,199
working with Pharmaceuticals and making

1627
00:57:38,199 --> 00:57:44,318
what's the CBD THC the the epidex so the

1628
00:57:42,199 --> 00:57:46,719
epidex is the one that came out for the

1629
00:57:44,318 --> 00:57:49,519
J syndrome which is what Charlotte figgy

1630
00:57:46,719 --> 00:57:51,519
had um I think they're behind satex as

1631
00:57:49,519 --> 00:57:54,400
well which was just I think it was a

1632
00:57:51,519 --> 00:57:57,239
sublingual yeah but um Jazz Pharma in

1633
00:57:54,400 --> 00:58:00,280
the UK has has since bought GW

1634
00:57:57,239 --> 00:58:02,719
Pharmaceuticals and yeah again they're

1635
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:05,519
coming out with all kinds of stuff Dr

1636
00:58:02,719 --> 00:58:06,919
Ethan Russo who was I think I don't

1637
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:09,038
think he's with them anymore but and the

1638
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:10,798
GW Pharmaceuticals he's the one who ran

1639
00:58:09,039 --> 00:58:12,559
like the clinical trials and the the

1640
00:58:10,798 --> 00:58:16,440
double triple blinds for the epid

1641
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:19,880
dialects right um lives up in Washington

1642
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:21,400
and I've been lucky enough to be to at a

1643
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:22,760
place where he was speaking and kind of

1644
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:27,039
got to listen to him but it was The

1645
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:29,039
Taming THC the T paper about tpin in 200

1646
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:31,839
yeah that's what really grabbed my

1647
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:34,839
attention to all these nuances of the

1648
00:58:31,838 --> 00:58:37,759
profile and how they impact what we're

1649
00:58:34,838 --> 00:58:40,000
going after so nice yeah to bring that

1650
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:41,799
full circle totally well let's go even

1651
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,760
more full circle and I want to hear

1652
00:58:41,798 --> 00:58:47,280
about your past so let's let's talk

1653
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:50,079
about your or cannabis origin story I

1654
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,920
would love to hear it so I was just kind

1655
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:53,280
of always you know the rebellious kid

1656
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:55,240
tell me not to do something I'm probably

1657
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,920
going to do it skateboarder just hanging

1658
00:58:55,239 --> 00:59:00,759
out with the older kid kids that's kind

1659
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:04,519
of how I got into it um as far as just

1660
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:06,400
kind of cultivating myself that was I

1661
00:59:04,519 --> 00:59:09,000
always point back to uh when it went

1662
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:11,519
Medical in Washington state when it was

1663
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:14,318
easier for more people to get cards I

1664
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:17,119
did a little bit before that but it was

1665
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:18,719
not very good or successful but that is

1666
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:20,318
really when I kind of dove into it and

1667
00:59:18,719 --> 00:59:24,318
again getting the effects that I get

1668
00:59:20,318 --> 00:59:27,038
from it um just I could do it and I just

1669
00:59:24,318 --> 00:59:29,079
never stopped and I won't stop so that's

1670
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:31,240
that's kind of how it got started there

1671
00:59:29,079 --> 00:59:35,880
nice yeah favorite

1672
00:59:31,239 --> 00:59:38,199
cvar chem 91 chem 91 that's awesome did

1673
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:40,400
you see the chem 91 I got here it's yeah

1674
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:42,639
it's chem 91 cross yes yes from flow

1675
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:44,960
Gardens yes there were there was a lot

1676
00:59:42,639 --> 00:59:49,239
of very nice smelling things yeah yeah

1677
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:51,559
yeah for sure uh yeah chem 91 Game

1678
00:59:49,239 --> 00:59:53,399
Changer the article I just wrote

1679
00:59:51,559 --> 00:59:55,160
actually there's a big chunk of it

1680
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:57,240
that's in soft Secrets it's about chem

1681
00:59:55,159 --> 01:00:00,920
91 and the important importance of chem

1682
00:59:57,239 --> 01:00:02,439
91 and yeah I think people need to hear

1683
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:04,798
that story over and over so we don't

1684
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:07,119
forget it because a lot of times people

1685
01:00:04,798 --> 01:00:09,280
forget history for whatever reason a lot

1686
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:10,798
of history has been forgotten you know

1687
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:12,839
and we're on the shoulders of giants all

1688
01:00:10,798 --> 01:00:15,920
of us all of us that are here today

1689
01:00:12,838 --> 01:00:17,639
every single one of us is standing on

1690
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:19,639
the shoulders of other people's work in

1691
01:00:17,639 --> 01:00:22,078
this industry if you're in this industry

1692
01:00:19,639 --> 01:00:23,519
working for cannabis as a steward of the

1693
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:26,519
plant you're working on the shoulders of

1694
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:30,199
the Giants that came before us people a

1695
01:00:26,519 --> 01:00:32,440
lot of unknown heroes from the 60s and

1696
01:00:30,199 --> 01:00:34,919
70s people that were doing the Lord's

1697
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:36,880
work because they loved it yeah that

1698
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:38,559
we'll never know their names you know

1699
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:40,760
some of these people that did the real

1700
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:43,319
stuff but yet we are able to work with

1701
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:45,880
their plant and things that they created

1702
01:00:43,318 --> 01:00:47,880
that help push the plant forward pretty

1703
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:50,119
cool thing you know when you put it into

1704
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:51,880
perspective like that it absolutely is

1705
01:00:50,119 --> 01:00:53,640
and it's important like podcast to

1706
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:56,000
record this because so much bad

1707
01:00:53,639 --> 01:00:57,920
information gets repeated like I do

1708
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,599
writing for a few different companies

1709
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:01,079
and so I'll do my research and they

1710
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:02,640
always will send me links of you know

1711
01:01:01,079 --> 01:01:04,240
like basically what the competitions

1712
01:01:02,639 --> 01:01:06,759
article looks like so look at that do

1713
01:01:04,239 --> 01:01:08,318
something freaking different yeah um a

1714
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:10,680
lot of times I see the same spelling

1715
01:01:08,318 --> 01:01:13,239
errors like there's a lot of copy paste

1716
01:01:10,679 --> 01:01:15,558
out there and unfortunately that is the

1717
01:01:13,239 --> 01:01:17,000
information that is most front and

1718
01:01:15,559 --> 01:01:19,240
center to a lot of people who are

1719
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:21,719
looking for that type of information

1720
01:01:19,239 --> 01:01:23,759
yeah so it's important to really nail

1721
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:26,239
down these details and talk to these

1722
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:28,839
people and preserve those stories

1723
01:01:26,239 --> 01:01:31,038
because I always say AI is going to suck

1724
01:01:28,838 --> 01:01:32,719
at cannabis because there is so much bad

1725
01:01:31,039 --> 01:01:34,000
cannabis information out there that's

1726
01:01:32,719 --> 01:01:36,838
what it's going to scrape and that's

1727
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:39,039
gonna that's how it thinks it works so

1728
01:01:36,838 --> 01:01:40,880
cannabis I don't think it's gonna get AI

1729
01:01:39,039 --> 01:01:42,760
or AI is not g to get cannabis it's a

1730
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:46,358
really good joint in the beginning it

1731
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:48,640
won't right but in the end it will when

1732
01:01:46,358 --> 01:01:50,679
you train when you train Skynet with

1733
01:01:48,639 --> 01:01:53,118
your system man then then we're in

1734
01:01:50,679 --> 01:01:54,519
trouble but uh yeah just don't turn to

1735
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:55,920
the I mean I don't think it's a bad

1736
01:01:54,519 --> 01:01:59,599
thing I think we just need to know the

1737
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:02,318
true stories and I think we are

1738
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:04,359
all you know in the in the we all have

1739
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:05,798
the opportunity to do amazing things

1740
01:02:04,358 --> 01:02:08,480
with this plant whether

1741
01:02:05,798 --> 01:02:11,400
it's being a producer for the James loud

1742
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:14,318
podcast or whether it's being meno dope

1743
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:16,639
that sings about cannabis or podcast

1744
01:02:14,318 --> 01:02:20,920
hosts or people that are cultivating or

1745
01:02:16,639 --> 01:02:25,278
extrack artists or the writers like uh

1746
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:27,278
like Angela Baka Jimmy Divine yeah um

1747
01:02:25,278 --> 01:02:29,519
Greg Z and he's another great author and

1748
01:02:27,278 --> 01:02:32,400
these guys are just just amazing authors

1749
01:02:29,519 --> 01:02:35,079
but they are doing their contribution

1750
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:37,920
that all is working synergistically what

1751
01:02:35,079 --> 01:02:40,318
with what we do and we're part of this

1752
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:42,559
bigger Community but even

1753
01:02:40,318 --> 01:02:44,079
like it's even bigger than just the

1754
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:45,200
community right so we're the Cannabis

1755
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:46,480
Community but we're part of this

1756
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:48,960
something something that's so much

1757
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:50,039
bigger and it's you know and it's like I

1758
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,798
love talking about that kind of stuff

1759
01:02:50,039 --> 01:02:53,319
because it makes me feel good yeah to be

1760
01:02:51,798 --> 01:02:55,559
part of something so much bigger and

1761
01:02:53,318 --> 01:02:57,278
kind of know my place in the world or

1762
01:02:55,559 --> 01:02:59,119
what or or at least feel like I know my

1763
01:02:57,278 --> 01:03:01,039
place in the world it's it's it's part

1764
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:02,640
of the culture and it is when you know

1765
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:05,400
it's it's fun to see other people

1766
01:03:02,639 --> 01:03:09,118
succeed and and when we work together we

1767
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:11,480
do we succeed a lot more that there

1768
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:14,000
there's something about the collective

1769
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:15,960
just like the collective Consciousness

1770
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,358
kind of working together yeah cuz you

1771
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:20,119
know like being going back to being a DJ

1772
01:03:18,358 --> 01:03:22,679
like I was I was listening to a song up

1789
01:03:56,278 --> 01:03:59,798
yeah and that comes from kind of the

1790
01:03:58,318 --> 01:04:01,480
culture and that's kind of what we're

1791
01:03:59,798 --> 01:04:04,159
trying to do and a lot of people are

1792
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:05,639
doing it don't pay attention to a lot of

1793
01:04:04,159 --> 01:04:07,558
the negativity out there it's always

1794
01:04:05,639 --> 01:04:10,159
going to exist that's just kind of life

1795
01:04:07,559 --> 01:04:12,440
but there are good people and yeah

1796
01:04:10,159 --> 01:04:14,000
working together to the to sum it up

1797
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:16,240
quickly but working together is a great

1798

01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:25,960
having you on the podcast right and

1803
01:04:24,239 --> 01:04:28,399
seeing you back in the day like

1804
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:30,318
supporting the James loud show it was

1805
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:32,119
like you were a big supporter of podcast

1806
01:04:30,318 --> 01:04:33,759
and you were the reason that I did

1807
01:04:32,119 --> 01:04:35,480
podcast back in the day people like you

1808
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:38,599
that were watching that were tuning in

1809
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:40,039
we had like some crazy 4,000 people live

1810
01:04:38,599 --> 01:04:41,920
on some of those episodes from all

1811
01:04:40,039 --> 01:04:43,480
around the world and you got to give

1812
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:45,079
credit to Peter for doing such a good

1813
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:46,960
job with the future cannabis project I

1814
01:04:45,079 --> 01:04:48,640
need to get him on the show yeah that

1815
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:51,000
would be a rad interview that would be a

1816
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:53,920
rad interview yeah he's a good dude and

1817
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:56,719
uh but yeah I mean we have a we have an

1818
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:58,240
amazing opportunity now all of us

1819
01:04:56,719 --> 01:05:00,480
because the thing is is times are going

1820
01:04:58,239 --> 01:05:01,759
to get better mhm times are also going

1821
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,960
to get worse and then they're going to

1822
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:05,480
be better again yeah and when they're

1823
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:06,798
good we need to remember that they won't

1824
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:08,960
always be good and when they're bad we

1825
01:05:06,798 --> 01:05:11,679
need to remember that they can be better

1826
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:14,000
and they will be better and uh but it

1827
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:16,519
takes this this whole Community this

1828
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,358
Collective Consciousness to really put

1829
01:05:16,519 --> 01:05:20,880
forth the effort to make it better but

1830
01:05:18,358 --> 01:05:23,318
there's so many good people yeah there's

1831
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:24,559
there's some Bad actors of course with

1832
01:05:23,318 --> 01:05:27,599
whatever you do there's always going to

1833
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:29,440
be bad actors yeah but as a whole

1834
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:31,519
there's still a lot of good in the

1835
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:34,798
community there's people that believe in

1836
01:05:31,519 --> 01:05:37,119
this plant for the right reasons y uh

1837
01:05:34,798 --> 01:05:39,119

people that they don't know but this

1889
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:24,960
preserving the stories are so important

01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:32,759
the Derek from planta episode was really

1916
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:35,198
freaking amazing I feel like we had a

1917
01:08:32,759 --> 01:08:37,520
lot of synergy we he's he sees the plant

1918
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:40,358
on the same level that I do and I think

1919
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:43,080
he does an amazing job with cultivation

1920
01:08:40,359 --> 01:08:44,719
as far as he's one of the best out there

1921
01:08:43,079 --> 01:08:46,759
awesome and so I love that and then Maya

1922
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:48,679
fromom it's just you can't go wrong with

1923
01:08:46,759 --> 01:08:51,838
Maya she's another one that

1924
01:08:48,679 --> 01:08:53,279
like we've hung out a couple times we

1925
01:08:51,838 --> 01:08:54,759
know each other from events and stuff

1926
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:57,080
like that but getting her on the podcast

1927
01:08:54,759 --> 01:09:00,359
to be able to talk talk to her in depth

1928
01:08:57,079 --> 01:09:02,000
like that she sees the world in the same

1929
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:04,120
way that I see the world in a lot of

1930
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,719
ways which having guest that you can

1931
01:09:04,119 --> 01:09:08,238
like connect with on that level and I

1932
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:09,439
have a lot of guests that I connect with

1933
01:09:08,238 --> 01:09:11,238
but but hers it was like the

1934
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:14,318
conversation I feel like was really

1935
01:09:11,238 --> 01:09:16,559
great and uh so many other ones there's

1936
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:19,080
so many other there's just been so many

1937
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:21,199
isn't it yeah I mean you know having

1938
01:09:19,079 --> 01:09:24,759
Jeff from further come in on the Sarah

1939
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:26,759
pin he was great she's great that was a

1940
01:09:24,759 --> 01:09:28,158
fun interview and you know the funny

1941
01:09:26,759 --> 01:09:31,279
thing about podcast is I really like

1942
01:09:28,158 --> 01:09:33,119
interviewing two people almost more than

1943
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:35,080
individuals and I feel like there's

1944
01:09:33,119 --> 01:09:36,439
something about that energy where like

1945
01:09:35,079 --> 01:09:37,838
you're just shooting around and you're

1946
01:09:36,439 --> 01:09:40,039
talking to both people and it's just a

1947
01:09:37,838 --> 01:09:41,798
little faster paced and it just can go

1948
01:09:40,039 --> 01:09:45,079
in different directions too because now

1949
01:09:41,798 --> 01:09:47,640
instead of two ideas we have three ideas

1950
01:09:45,079 --> 01:09:49,278
and that can take us anywhere especially

1951
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:51,159
yeah when they when they buy well as

1952
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:52,799
well I I do like kind of having guest

1953
01:09:51,158 --> 01:09:54,278
and I used to do that a lot more too is

1954
01:09:52,798 --> 01:09:56,560
just have kind of two people to bounce

1955
01:09:54,279 --> 01:09:58,199
things off of cuz it is stimulate the

1956
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:00,920
conversation three minds are better than

1957
01:09:58,198 --> 01:10:03,359
two sometimes I agree and it's like uh

1958
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:05,119
well and cuz when you're asking

1959
01:10:03,359 --> 01:10:07,079
questions people want to ask questions

1960
01:10:05,119 --> 01:10:08,519
and it can just go the conversation can

1961
01:10:07,079 --> 01:10:11,359
go in so many different

1962
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:13,800
directions um but yeah and I feel like

1963
01:10:11,359 --> 01:10:17,399
we've grown as a podcast like from our

1964
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:19,159
first episode to now it's like nobody's

1965
01:10:17,399 --> 01:10:21,039
even seen the episode that we filmed

1966
01:10:19,158 --> 01:10:23,639
before the first episode that our

1967
01:10:21,039 --> 01:10:25,479
current producer Ryan wasn't a part of

1968
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:27,199
and it's not that it was bad it was was

1969
01:10:25,479 --> 01:10:29,879
just different and Chris Castle was the

1970
01:10:27,198 --> 01:10:31,319
guest and so we have that hidden maybe

1971
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:33,400
we'll release it one of these days

1972
01:10:31,319 --> 01:10:35,759
easteregg it was a good interview and I

1973
01:10:33,399 --> 01:10:37,759
feel like and and I've Ma I've been made

1974
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:39,119
friends from people being on the show

1975
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:40,560
now I'm friends with a bunch of people

1976
01:10:39,119 --> 01:10:42,679
that were guests that we were just kind

1977
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:44,120
of I knew them or maybe I had their

1978
01:10:42,679 --> 01:10:45,560
phone number but I wasn't really good

1979
01:10:44,119 --> 01:10:48,079
friends and now like I feel like I have

1980
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:50,159
a lot more friends yeah absolutely a lot

1981
01:10:48,079 --> 01:10:51,880
more people like-minded people and it's

1982
01:10:50,158 --> 01:10:52,960
always great to feel that because

1983
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:54,359
there's so many good people in the

1984
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:55,719
industry that are like that too though I

1985
01:10:54,359 --> 01:10:57,039
mean there's so we have so many good

1986
01:10:55,719 --> 01:10:58,319

1987
01:10:57,039 --> 01:11:00,238
been on the show that are great that I'm

1988
01:10:58,319 --> 01:11:02,840
looking forward to getting a lot of a

1989
01:11:00,238 --> 01:11:04,879
lot of the nice guys are shy guys yeah

1990
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:06,800
or girls oh yeah you know it's like so

1991
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:08,800
we had I was up a canif Fest and there

1992
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:10,840
was like a couple people I really wanted

1993
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:12,840
to interview and like they're on my

1994
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:15,039
bucket list of people to interview and

1995
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:17,679
they're a little shy some of them yeah

1996
01:11:15,039 --> 01:11:19,479
yeah where they clam up yeah they're

1997
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:20,960
talkative without the red light on some

1998
01:11:19,479 --> 01:11:22,479
people some people are like that they

1999
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:23,840
the camera they don't yeah they they

2000
01:11:22,479 --> 01:11:25,879
can't open up on the camera but it's

2001
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:27,319
just practice cuz I was a little nervous

2002
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:30,359
the first time I did it and now I'm I'm

2003
01:11:27,319 --> 01:11:32,319
definitely not nervous from filming

2004
01:11:30,359 --> 01:11:34,039
although at canif Fest I [ __ ] was

2005
01:11:32,319 --> 01:11:35,719
nervous yeah that was the first time

2006
01:11:34,039 --> 01:11:38,719
I've been nervous on camera for a while

2007
01:11:35,719 --> 01:11:40,520
but it was because every time I would

2008
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:41,840
get too close to the mic or too far away

2009
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:44,280
from it either you couldn't hear it or I

2010
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:47,239
get close and then we'd get feedback

2011
01:11:44,279 --> 01:11:49,238
right and it was just it wasn't that I

2012
01:11:47,238 --> 01:11:52,079
was nervous as much as I was annoyed by

2013
01:11:49,238 --> 01:11:54,238
it and it was like making me cautious of

2014
01:11:52,079 --> 01:11:57,279
how I was having to talk yeah well you

2015
01:11:54,238 --> 01:11:59,519
cared for sure you cared about the end

2016
01:11:57,279 --> 01:12:02,759
the end consumer about the quality so

2017
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:04,880
yeah I get that we had Johnny and uh so

2018
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:07,480
Johnny from Huckleberry Hill Farms and

2019
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:11,359
we had Jason from Ridgeline on a panel

2020
01:12:07,479 --> 01:12:13,198
that I did when I was up at canest 2024

2021
01:12:11,359 --> 01:12:14,639
an event nice hopefully I see that

2022
01:12:13,198 --> 01:12:17,119
sometime the interview is really good

2023
01:12:14,639 --> 01:12:18,880
and those guys are super passionate yeah

2024
01:12:17,119 --> 01:12:20,559
yeah that's awesome I mean out outside

2025
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:21,880
of the studio things are really out of

2026
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:23,719
your hand

2027
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:25,520
sometimes yeah you know that's what

2028
01:12:23,719 --> 01:12:27,520
impresses me the most about these stereo

2029
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:29,639
systems that I've been to like at

2030
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:31,280
festivals over the last like year and a

2031
01:12:29,639 --> 01:12:33,560
half two years how much better the sound

2032
01:12:31,279 --> 01:12:35,639
systems have gotten good I'm all for it

2033
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:37,920
man I I like as the audio engineer I

2034
01:12:35,639 --> 01:12:39,159
don't like bad sound so I'm all for it

2035
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:41,039
me neither and I've heard plenty of bad

2036
01:12:39,158 --> 01:12:42,920
sound in my life at events I mean I us

2037
01:12:41,039 --> 01:12:44,359
to go to Raves back in the day and

2038
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:46,840
concert a lot of a lot of concerts

2039
01:12:44,359 --> 01:12:48,559
throughout my life and there's been good

2040
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:49,800
sound and bad sound and sometimes you go

2041
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:51,199
and you think it's going to be amazing

2042
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:53,199
and it's bad and other times you think

2043
01:12:51,198 --> 01:12:55,439
it's going to be bad or not have any

2044
01:12:53,198 --> 01:12:58,039
expectations I like the no expectation

2045
01:12:55,439 --> 01:13:01,519
to be honest in life I found whether

2046
01:12:58,039 --> 01:13:03,399
it's going to the movies or going to

2047
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:05,840
shows like that I'm not sure about

2048
01:13:03,399 --> 01:13:07,559
having no expectations is so much better

2049
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:08,960
than somebody said it was going to be

2050
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:10,639
good or somebody said it was going to be

2051
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:13,679
bad because a lot of times when they say

2052
01:13:10,639 --> 01:13:15,039
it's bad maybe it's okay or if they say

2053
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:17,239
it's really really good I have these

2054
01:13:15,039 --> 01:13:20,920
high expectations and I go to this event

2055
01:13:17,238 --> 01:13:22,718
and I'm just like eh right it was all

2056
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:24,399
right you got to judge it by the source

2057
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:25,359
too movies a lot of times are like that

2058
01:13:24,399 --> 01:13:26,920
when somebody's like oh you you got to

2059
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:28,439
see this movie and it's like if I don't

2060
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:29,880
know that person I know some of my

2061
01:13:28,439 --> 01:13:32,439
friends when they say that for sure I'm

2062
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:33,840
like yeah I need to see that movie y but

2063
01:13:32,439 --> 01:13:35,719
sometimes if somebody's like oh man you

2064
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:37,719
got to see this movie and it was

2065
01:13:35,719 --> 01:13:39,439
amazing uh maybe we don't have the same

2066
01:13:37,719 --> 01:13:41,000
taste always there's nothing wrong with

2067
01:13:39,439 --> 01:13:43,238
that but I always try to go with less

2068
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,238
expectations and stuff yeah that's good

2069
01:13:43,238 --> 01:13:46,638
you're less disappointed that way yeah

2070
01:13:45,238 --> 01:13:48,319
you get less disappointed in life for

2071
01:13:46,639 --> 01:13:50,480
sure yeah you set yourself up for your

2072
01:13:48,319 --> 01:13:51,519
mind to be blown as well right so it all

2073
01:13:50,479 --> 01:13:53,399
depends on how you look at it that's

2074
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:56,040
happened a bunch in my life too you know

2075
01:13:53,399 --> 01:13:57,638
with weed too yeah where you're like

2076
01:13:56,039 --> 01:14:01,439
someone says it's good and then you're

2077
01:13:57,639 --> 01:14:05,159
like oh well good to you and good to

2078
01:14:01,439 --> 01:14:06,839
me or holy [ __ ] what was that I can't

2079
01:14:05,158 --> 01:14:09,319
wait to smoke more of it oh there's no

2080
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:11,360
more available that sucks I know I'm a

2081
01:14:09,319 --> 01:14:13,319
little Bunch little sad about the sour

2082
01:14:11,359 --> 01:14:14,599
tea I'm just gonna say that yeah I wish

2083
01:14:13,319 --> 01:14:16,599
I had some right now if you were here

2084
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:18,880
next week you you could try it because I

2085
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:21,600
will have some to taste it's super

2086
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:24,359
special that sourd is something special

2087
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:25,960
I bet but no really in all reality that

2088
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:27,759
sourd is some the best stuff I've smoked

2089
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:29,399
in a long time and it made me realize

2090
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:31,440
how much I love Sour Diesel still even

2091
01:14:29,399 --> 01:14:33,359
though I talk about it a lot until you

2092
01:14:31,439 --> 01:14:34,960
get to experience it again it's the

2093
01:14:33,359 --> 01:14:36,119
conversation is much different than the

2094
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:38,760
reality and then when you see it you're

2095
01:14:36,119 --> 01:14:40,800
like ah I was right all along it was

2096
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:44,039
this good yeah so and sometimes I think

2097
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:46,239
our minds can be fickle or our minds can

2098
01:14:44,039 --> 01:14:47,719
you know deceive us we think we remember

2099
01:14:46,238 --> 01:14:49,119
things a certain way and maybe it wasn't

2100
01:14:47,719 --> 01:14:50,520
that way I mean I hear some of the

2101
01:14:49,119 --> 01:14:52,639
stories from my friends and I've seen

2102
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:54,120
them change over time I hope that's not

2103
01:14:52,639 --> 01:14:56,440
the way with me too you know what I mean

2104
01:14:54,119 --> 01:14:57,800
I always think [ __ ] I hope my stories

2105
01:14:56,439 --> 01:14:59,879
don't change as much as some of my

2106
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:01,400
friend's stories and I don't know if I

2107
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:03,400
think a lot of it's accidental but your

2108
01:15:01,399 --> 01:15:05,279
mind maybe REM stuff differently as we

2109
01:15:03,399 --> 01:15:07,158
get older and yeah and a lot of this we

2110
01:15:05,279 --> 01:15:08,920
weren't really thinking or the people

2111
01:15:07,158 --> 01:15:11,559
weren't thinking they needed to remember

2112
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:12,800
it it wasn't important at the time so

2113
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:14,560
yeah I mean we were drinking way too

2114
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:17,760
much at the time you know or whatever it

2115
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:19,800
is right or high on this or you know

2116
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:21,159
I've definitely done that that was a

2117
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:24,119
very good joint I think I've said that

2118
01:15:21,158 --> 01:15:26,158
three times so ity at least three stars

2119
01:15:24,119 --> 01:15:28,000
that's yeah that's five star yeah we

2120
01:15:26,158 --> 01:15:29,559
didn't have to put Ros in it it's it's

2121
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,479
the size of a hash hole without the hash

2122
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:33,039
hole very nice that would probably

2123
01:15:31,479 --> 01:15:34,599
destroy me if I went for one of those

2124
01:15:33,039 --> 01:15:36,880
again like back in the day that was all

2125
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:38,600
I could afford for like two weeks at a

2126
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:40,400
time yeah like you got to make that

2127
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:41,639
eighth get by just a little bit here a

2128
01:15:40,399 --> 01:15:43,479
little bit there take a couple hits a

2129
01:15:41,639 --> 01:15:45,880
night or how would you do it you take a

2130
01:15:43,479 --> 01:15:48,519
pack bowls of it and then smoke like a

2131
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:51,760
pipe yeah yeah I mean protop pipe

2132
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:53,199
flashback to that um the little chamber

2133
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:55,600
pipes that you would have you try to

2134
01:15:53,198 --> 01:15:57,960
keep your resonated piece in there I got

2135
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:59,840
my protop pipe over here nice I'm all

2136
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:02,399
about protop pipes oh yeah they still

2137
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:04,639
make them I the real ones they also make

2138
01:16:02,399 --> 01:16:06,559
the knockoffs which suck okay I wouldn't

2139
01:16:04,639 --> 01:16:08,239
smoke a knockoff how can you tell well

2140
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:10,440
don't order it off eBay order it from

2141
01:16:08,238 --> 01:16:11,919
protop pee.com like literally if you

2142
01:16:10,439 --> 01:16:13,479
order it from prototype. comom you're

2143
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:16,239
not going to get a knockoff if you order

2144
01:16:13,479 --> 01:16:18,559
it anywhere else you're taking risks

2145
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:20,039
yeah uh even in head shops I don't know

2146
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:22,480
that I would trust it I would order it

2147
01:16:20,039 --> 01:16:24,439
directly from them protoype decom

2148
01:16:22,479 --> 01:16:27,399
Classics I love it I love supporting the

2149
01:16:24,439 --> 01:16:28,919
brand they're OG small business they're

2150
01:16:27,399 --> 01:16:31,238
the type of people we we need as a

2151
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:32,679
community to support and I'm trying to

2152
01:16:31,238 --> 01:16:35,158
get them on the show because you know

2153
01:16:32,679 --> 01:16:36,880
they have the best stories company like

2154
01:16:35,158 --> 01:16:39,158
that it's like they've been around since

2155
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:42,920
the 70s they were in San Francisco they

2156
01:16:39,158 --> 01:16:45,599
were they were up north uh in NorCal

2157
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:47,520
which I think they still are cool and

2158
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:49,760
those pipes are made from brass and

2159
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:52,760
they're legit that little poker that's

2160
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:55,000
on those and you need the poker you know

2161
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:56,400
you have to yeah yeah the little rubber

2162
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,920
tip on the end totally we used to have

2163
01:16:56,399 --> 01:17:01,799
screens in them right and uh I don't use

2164
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:02,960
screens in my pipe anymore any of them

2165
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:04,199
whether it's glass or whatever I don't

2166
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:05,679
like screens but did you go to the

2167
01:17:04,198 --> 01:17:08,000
hardware store and take the screens out

2168
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:09,639
of the sinks no I took my parents

2169
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,039
screens and they don't they still don't

2170
01:17:09,639 --> 01:17:12,359
know that I took the screens out of the

2171
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:14,158
sinks of the house but I took the

2172
01:17:12,359 --> 01:17:18,238
screens out of all the bathroom why is

2173
01:17:14,158 --> 01:17:19,479
it run so funny yeah yeah but yeah I

2174
01:17:18,238 --> 01:17:22,119
mean that's where we used to get screens

2175
01:17:19,479 --> 01:17:25,559
when we were younger all the things we

2176
01:17:22,119 --> 01:17:27,840
put into our lungs yeah you no I think

2177
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:29,719
and we're okay it turned out okay turned

2178
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:32,760
out fine we're doing podcast so we're

2179
01:17:29,719 --> 01:17:35,439
okay reasonably intelligent today yeah I

2180
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:37,760
don't know about that but for me but I

2181
01:17:35,439 --> 01:17:40,238
have my moments and as long as I'm cold

2182
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:41,800
plunging typically you know been taking

2183
01:17:40,238 --> 01:17:44,559
a break from cold plunging by the way

2184
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:46,279
you're taking it yeah I'm taking I moved

2185
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:48,120
to a new place and so now we're at the

2186
01:17:46,279 --> 01:17:49,759
new place and I'm waiting to figure out

2187
01:17:48,119 --> 01:17:52,158
what I want to do for cold plunges but I

2188
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:54,560
took about the last two months off okay

2189
01:17:52,158 --> 01:17:56,479
which is a big step for me so especially

2190
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:58,000
since the very first show that we did

2191
01:17:56,479 --> 01:17:59,158
I've been doing cold plunges and then

2192
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,238
all the way straight till about two

2193
01:17:59,158 --> 01:18:03,279
months ago yeah like almost every day

2194
01:18:01,238 --> 01:18:05,479
are you excited or afraid to do the next

2195
01:18:03,279 --> 01:18:07,599
one no I'm not I don't I don't get

2196
01:18:05,479 --> 01:18:09,519
afraid of that like cold water doesn't

2197
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:11,520
scare me at all it okay neither does

2198
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:13,360
heat none of that stuff but I do like

2199
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:14,880
cold water and I I mean I could go in a

2200
01:18:13,359 --> 01:18:16,639
cold punch today and I would feel great

2201
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:19,800
right now like just thinking about it

2202
01:18:16,639 --> 01:18:21,639
makes me relaxed come surfing up with me

2203
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:23,560
come surfing the real cold water you

2204
01:18:21,639 --> 01:18:25,679
don't need a wet suit you'll just you'll

2205
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:27,400
love it I'll without up there I can do

2206
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:30,480
out for like a good 10 15 minutes and

2207
01:18:27,399 --> 01:18:31,519
then freeze in place yeah cuz the how

2208
01:18:30,479 --> 01:18:34,479
cold is the water out there you're

2209
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:36,440
looking at 50s probably probably at

2210
01:18:34,479 --> 01:18:38,039
least I I don't know specifically but

2211
01:18:36,439 --> 01:18:39,919
yeah I if you don't wear booties up

2212
01:18:38,039 --> 01:18:41,479
there like I've gotten frostbite on the

2213
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:43,639
top of my feet before because I didn't

2214
01:18:41,479 --> 01:18:45,439
wear booties that is the most painful

2215
01:18:43,639 --> 01:18:46,880
thing for three weeks every step felt

2216
01:18:45,439 --> 01:18:48,879
like a sledgehammer on the top of my

2217
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:50,679
feet oh that's all bad yeah it's not

2218
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:53,400
good so wear booties if you're you're

2219
01:18:50,679 --> 01:18:55,520
wearing pretty thick Mill wet suits y

2220
01:18:53,399 --> 01:18:56,638
yeah yeah full full with the ring so

2221
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:58,800
when you get done you just have this

2222
01:18:56,639 --> 01:19:01,239
like tan ring if it's a sunny day it's

2223
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:03,279
great that's hilarious yeah it's awesome

2224
01:19:01,238 --> 01:19:05,359
really cool you got sharks up there too

2225
01:19:03,279 --> 01:19:08,599
we do we have sharks I swear I was

2226
01:19:05,359 --> 01:19:10,599
stocked by one once but I'm still here

2227
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:12,679
so uh yeah surfing surfing can be
