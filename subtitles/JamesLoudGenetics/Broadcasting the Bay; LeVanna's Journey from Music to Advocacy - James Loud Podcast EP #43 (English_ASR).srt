19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:46,558
honor for you to include me as well I

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:48,439
got a show on 89.5 FM KCT oscat radio in

21
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:51,159
Vallejo really cool it's called the

22
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:53,878
basses I've been doing it for a little

23
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:57,238
over five years now started it um

24
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:59,238
Thanksgiving of 2019 wow mhm time sure

25
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:01,198
flies I got offered the show I was doing

26
00:00:59,238 --> 00:01:03,718
some so decided I wanted to create a

27
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:04,920
brand within cannabis when it started I

28
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:06,439
could quickly see I didn't have the

29
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,840
resources to pull together for like

30
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:11,359
licensing and all that but I figured

31
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,159
what I could do was build sort of start

32
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:15,319
with like a Lifestyle brand NorCal

33
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:17,080
flower and then I was doing that for

34
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:19,279
about a year and I got offered this slot

35
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:21,840
on the radio and I've actually been a DJ

36
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,040
since 1998 when I got my turntables down

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,600
on Market Street wow so I wasn't

38
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,359
unfamiliar with that as well as like

39
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:29,438
having gone to film school and been in

40
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:30,359
film and post- production so I started

41
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:32,758
DJing

42
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:35,840
at midnight till 2: a.m. for about 2

43
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:38,000
years and that started as houses of

44
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,000
cannabis and I would play like Stony

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,359
music and talk to people in their cars

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,560
like are you out in your car smoking

47
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:46,319
weed you know late night or whatever and

48
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,439
um I just kept doing that I had some

49
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:52,798
guests on and then it became the bay

50
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:55,319
sesh wow and as the like culture shifted

51
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,680
into the legalization I saw a lot of my

52
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:58,359
friends that were just like sort of

53
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,118
stuck on the hill maybe didn't have a

54
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:01,959
lot like couldn't really promote

55
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:03,680
themselves so much on social media and

56
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:06,118
content and everything like that feeling

57
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,239
left out while some other people were

58
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:11,159
sort of taking that place and and

59
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,560
filling that hole so I wanted to make my

60
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:15,239
show about sort of holding that space

61
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,640
and like telling the stories of my

62
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:20,719
friends from the culture from like the

63
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:25,119
bay to Humble you know what I mean uh

64
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:27,359
and through music and growing a lot and

65
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,519
uh that's how I found like uh found play

66
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,319
myself playing a lot of meno Dope Boys

67
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:34,560
um highgrade all stars and I started

68
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:36,479
doing some videos too but like the core

69
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,439
like Foundation of it all is that show

70
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:41,598
in Vallejo nice I feel like there's so

71
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,400
much the culture people haven't seen and

72
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:45,799
it's great to be able to share I mean

73
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,000
people like yourself being able to share

74
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,800
audiences like uh you know they'll learn

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,680
about you and then maybe you'll talk

76
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,080
about me on your show and people learn

77
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,439
about our show and I feel like uh you

78
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,879
know it's it's an amazing time to be

79
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,519
alive it's an amazing time to be in the

80
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:01,840
industry it's changed and evolved so

81
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,759
much much in the last you know 15 years

82
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,200
especially definitely definitely has not

83
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:08,598
how exactly we imagined it no you know

84
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:10,759
what I mean I'm actually living in

85
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:12,919
Brooklyn right now I'm not sure that you

86
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:14,560
knew that um I'm still broadcasting the

87
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:16,598
show and I'm in the studio when I'm home

88
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,199
visiting here I've been going there on

89
00:03:16,598 --> 00:03:20,238
and off for since 2022 and then I home

90
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,719
based it there because I just really

91
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,400
wanted to see where things went wow and

92
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,560
uh one day I was getting off the train

93
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,158
and there was like a taco truck next to

94
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,000
like a a girl had an ambulance that was

95
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:34,639
like a mobile dispensary and I was like

96
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,840
this is what I thought it was going to

97
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:40,759
be like in California right and so yeah

98
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,598
A lot's changed uh in the past few years

99
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:45,840
and I think we're finally like year five

100
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:48,560
into like recreational legalization here

101
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,200
in California turning a corner and a lot

102
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,598
of things are starting to kind of like

103
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:54,280
settle and like the ogs and a lot of

104
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:56,560
people the the real people from the

105
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,680
culture are finally getting their

106
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,680
platforms and their their stuff in the

107
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,319
dispensary or their dispensaries or

108
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,239
whatever right and so I'm glad to have

109
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:08,679
like held the torch for this long and

110
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,200
now everybody's sort of getting there

111
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,000
with it yeah we got a long ways to go

112
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:14,359
though we got a long ways to go and it's

113
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
really interesting all the stuff that's

114
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,680
going on in the industry New York and

115
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,399
there the the Bas that are in New York

116
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,720
and you know I feel like that's that's a

117
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,959
whole interesting I haven't been out to

118
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,479
New York to check it out but that's a

119
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:27,159
very interesting scene out there from

120
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:30,000
what I hear very unstable but uh with a

121
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,160
lot of potential indeed uh there's a

122
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,160
relationship there's always been a

123
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,280
relationship between us and you know

124
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,479
what is like the biggest consumer Market

125
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:40,478
in the world and the biggest what you

126
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:43,439
know was the biggest supplier or grower

127
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:45,399
cultivators of not just cannabis but

128
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:48,120
food here in California that's not going

129
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:51,959
to change too soon there's an obvious

130
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,959
relationship there right right um so but

131
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:55,638
now yeah with their freedoms and and the

132
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:58,399
way things are going it's pretty

133
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:00,800
interesting it's like La was right after

134
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:03,359
um you know with the gray area totally

135
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,879
there but it's like a threeyear long Ray

136
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,600
area and it's New York city so it's yeah

137
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:10,560
much much different different energy out

138
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,080
in New York than La even though they're

139
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,680
they're both big cities and amazing and

140
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:15,599
in the United States there's totally two

141
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,199
different energies and people are

142
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,919
different both both great I like people

143
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,680
from LA and I like people from New York

144
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:24,079
they they all have their intricacies and

145
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,360
uh yeah it's a lot of fun always yeah

146
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:29,240
for sure it's interesting to see people

147
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:32,520
like um buddies Bodega opening up a shop

148
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,199
in in La now and like the aster Club

149
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:36,758
opening up and bringing what they've

150
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,560
been doing there to the LA scene now too

151
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:40,639
and of course it could start in La maybe

152
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,000
there's a little more freedoms here I'm

153
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,519
more of a NorCal Bay Area person and I

154
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,120
love it up here me too you know but I

155
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:50,758
would hope that we could do like the

156
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,038
aster Club thing model is really cool

157
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,160
like we don't have anywhere here I'm

158
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:57,478
still getting weed and like hanging I

159
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:00,039
don't drink alcohol so I'm still hanging

160
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:01,639
out in my car and smoking weed after I

161
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:04,279
get it I don't really have anywhere to

162
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:05,720
go like hang out with people too much

163
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:07,879
right there's only a handful of clubs in

164
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,199
California that allow smoking right cool

like loved weed ever since then and like

198
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:28,839
dank weed for sure um when it went legal

199
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:31,120
and everything here I think I started

200
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:33,399
like you know planting seeds and stuff

201
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,280
went in like maybe like 98 like around

202
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:39,758
when I could get my medical like around

203
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:41,439
18 nice then you know people I knew grew

204
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,199
I kind of found out that my dad Grew

205
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:45,038
From somebody from high school cuz he

206
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,560
was like oh my God like your dad grows a

207
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:48,959
hella good weed um but I didn't really

208
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,038
know I was a little bit sheltered in

209
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:54,120
that way and then I got um I think I

210
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:56,759
started trimming for people in like 2005

211
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,319
in the crest side in valo oh wow and

212
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:00,598
they were like hanging the trees like

213
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,879
whole mhm and we had we were just all

214
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:03,598
sitting around this big circle with like

215
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:06,080
the whole tree hung like that trimming

216
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:08,478
them with like paper scissors oh wow

217
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:12,359
yeah do you guys trim wet or trim dry

218
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:14,680
then I think I feel like it was dry yeah

219
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,520
we started trimming wet a long time ago

220
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,840
we trimmed wet first and then we'd H

221
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:22,038
hang it and then trim it off the bud or

222
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:23,478
off the stem right off the stem yep and

223
00:08:22,038 --> 00:08:25,800
then we'd also have the fresh frozen it

224
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:27,359
was wet so all the fine trim we put that

225
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,919
in the freezer and make bubble hash

226
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,120
you're doing that right in the90s in the

227
00:08:28,918 --> 00:08:32,038
'9

228
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,158
um you know originally we didn't do

229
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:34,399
anything with our trim but then once

230
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:37,000
somebody figured out how to do bubble

231
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,599
hash we started freezing all our trim to

232
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,839
make the bubble hash and amazing stuff

233
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,959
that's so cool yeah and we didn't even

234
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,519
have Bubble Bags originally there was a

235
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:48,159
silk screen right you use Solo cups and

236
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:49,360
you poured it over the silk screen you

237
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:51,360
you stirred it there was like this

238
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,879
recipe you know and you had to stir it

239
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,480
one way and then stir it the other way

240
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:56,039
and then scoop it out over the silk

241
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,800
screen and let it we we used to let it

242
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:59,799
dry on the silk screen who showed you

243
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:01,399
how to do all that so my body Micah

244
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:04,799
showed me some of the stuff who I was

245
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:07,159
partners with for quite a while and uh

246
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:08,639
we had a group of uh bunch of us that

247
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:10,559
just kind of shared the information

248
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,519
between the group and you know it's like

249
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:14,639
trimming we didn't pay trimmers we all

250
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:16,278
helped each other trim you know this was

251
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:18,120
in the '90s so like there was trim

252
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:20,559
parties yeah it was like we're going to

253
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,600
go party at someone's house yeah I

254
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:25,199
remember watching I mean the late 90s

255
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:28,639
early 2000s watching the the disc set of

256
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,000
In Living Color uh we watched those over

257
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:32,199
and over over and over while we trimmed

258
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,559
and I think I still have them and

259
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,360
they're sticky with resin so so from way

260
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:37,919
back in the day but yeah I mean it was a

261
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,959
different it was a different world back

262
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:41,679
then and you know we had knife hits we

263
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:45,838
didn't have dabs really right you know

264
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:48,559
we smoked we smoked extract on coal with

265
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,279
with a little tube and then we also did

266
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:52,319
knife hits and knife hits were what

267
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:54,639
would you'd smoke the you know old

268
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,920

269
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:59,480
knives it was like a super hot dab ruin

your throat good stuff yeah so hot I

271
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,120

the hot I mean we were doing hot that

275
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,919
and then we're doing hot do gravity

276
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:13,000
gravity wasn't a question for a long

277
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:14,799
time yeah did you do gravity bongs back

278

artists and right yeah it was all it was

296

all produced by real artists and they

297
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:59,440
were sold at the head shops and you know

298
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,880
they were still fairly inexp expensive

299
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:05,240
but they were pretty amazing you know

300
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:07,039
the the work that went into them and

301

307
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:21,078
before there was the Chinese glass there

308
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,959
was a lot of artists that made it from

309
00:11:21,078 --> 00:11:26,199
everywhere from Eugene Oregon I mean

310
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:27,799

from all over shs were so cool you know

313
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,920
and that's like where you would learn

314
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:36,838
things back in the day totally find

315
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:38,240

lot if you went to a dead show or you

318
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:43,599
could go to Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley

319
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,000
and you'd be able to get some telegraph

320
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,200
was a big deal exactly I was going to

321

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,720
his glass online people can still buy it

380
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
it's not as easy as it was back in the

381
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,278
day to get them from him I'm sure

382
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,198
because you know they're they're in more

383
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:56,879
high demand all these things that are

384
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:59,919
slowly going away and then we have China

385
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:01,559
who's producing glass hand over fist and

386
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:03,198
they're selling it for $5 just

387
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:04,919
undercutting the market and a lot of

388
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:06,838
people are okay with the Chinese glass

389
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:09,958
yeah I mean that could be said about

390
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:12,800
pretty much all markets pretty much

391
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:14,239
everything yeah yeah but I still go for

392
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:16,359
Quality you know what I mean I'll still

393
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,120
go to a farmers market before I'll go if

394
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,560
they have a choice yeah you know what I

395
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,600
mean over a Safeway anytime or whatever

396
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:25,479
me too quality over quantity a lot of

397
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,399
people eat McDonald's and drink Coke and

398
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,480
like you know there's a market for

399
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:31,958
everything you know what I mean so like

400
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:34,759
there is China can't undercut you I mean

401
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:37,399
they just can't do handmade like that or

402
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:39,120
you know buying artisanal glass if

403
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:40,958
that's what you might call it yeah it's

404
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,240
I mean even flour we go back into the

405
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:45,039
quality of flour it's like you can grow

406
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,480
at a large quantity and you can get a

407
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:49,120
pretty good quality but you're not going

408
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,800
to get the artisanal quality it's very

409
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,240
rare why do you think that is well I

410
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:55,479
think anything when you're trying to

411
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,879
replicate it at that scale it's much

412
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,639
more difficult to control all the

413
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:03,000
variables

414
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:05,240
um and so the guy who's putting his love

415
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,320
into the plant and it goes like tomatoes

416
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,519
in your backyard you can go buy a decent

417
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,160
you can get a Berkeley Bowl you can get

418
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,278
pretty good tomatoes but then if you

419
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:16,639
grow your own tomatoes in your backyard

420
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:18,759
you can pick them when they're perfect

421
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,159
you can grow each one exactly how you

422
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:23,919
want and there's also uh the secret

423
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:25,759
ingredient with all of it is love I was

424
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:26,958
going to say and energy right cuz you

425
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:30,199
were talking about how much you love

426
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:33,039
crystals and like why you know I think

427
00:15:30,198 --> 00:15:35,399
that first someone couldn't be incapable

428
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:38,078
of giving all that love to a bigger grow

429
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:40,000
and all that but it's not the focus in a

430
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:41,758
lot of these places anyways I know a

431
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,480
couple people that do a really good job

432
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:47,000
at scale I do know people I worked for

433
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,159
like uh I wish I could remember her name

434
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,078
right now but one of the women

435
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:53,000
cultivators over at Flor Cal yeah um

436
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:54,838
would have us you know they they would

437
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,958
be telling each plant they love it it's

438
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:59,279
beautiful they would have us doing that

439
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:00,958
as we were bucking it trim it putting it

440
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:02,879
into the jar and sending it off like

441
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:05,318
doing that whole energy and it was

442
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:07,679
phenomenal yeah but yeah I mean I think

443
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:10,039
that there's got to be like an energetic

444
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:13,479
spiritual like thing with growing these

445
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:15,838
thca crystals on these plants it's yeah

446
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:18,079
present in tomatoes but perhaps even

447
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,959
more present because it's crystals in

448
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:22,439
this in the these plants you know yeah I

449
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:24,719
mean there's got to be alignment there

450
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,120
and I I mean I have my friends over at

451
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,399
SF Cana that crush it they do a really

452
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,759
good job fig farms in the area they do a

453
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:33,639
really good job there's a bunch of grows

454
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,519
that I think they do a great job for

455
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:36,600
what it is especially at scale but

456
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,078
there's still something to be said for

457
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:42,319
the Homegrown and to allow people

458
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:44,919
everywhere to grow homegrown weed I

459
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:47,838
think that uh it's it's also just such

460
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:49,479
an amazing experience because then

461
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,440
there's a story behind it and then

462
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:54,240
you're consuming something that you help

463
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,240
produce and so you understand pretty

464
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,600
much every day what happened in the life

465
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,480
of that plant if you're smoking it or

466
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,600
you're sharing it with your friend

467
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,039
friends and there's some alignment there

468
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,038
that's just amazing I agree I love

469
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:06,480
growing my own and I always make use of

470
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:08,279
it and you know a lot of times it's not

471
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,838
as good as what all my friends grow so I

472
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:11,119
ended up like sort of giving that to

473
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:12,599
someone that might need it and then

474
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,318
smoking the other weed from other

475
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:17,519
friends that I like maybe better but

476
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:20,399
it's always comes in valuable and the

477
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:22,558
experience itself grounds me love being

478
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,240
in the garden and like having something

479
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:25,678
to cultivate and grow like that and all

480
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,279
the little smells that come along with

481
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:32,519
it I also love juicing my cannabis raw

482
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:35,079
yeah um the leaves and the little nugs

483
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:36,240
like they'll juice the leaves but then

484
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:38,159
the little nugs I'll put into like

485
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,038
smoothies with some fruit from my garden

486
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,320
too yeah and that's something I can't

487
00:17:40,038 --> 00:17:44,079
really like at this point get although I

488
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:46,759
hope down the line I could maybe go to

489
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:48,558
the grocery store and buy like a Frozen

490
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:50,400
pack of like baby nugs that were super

491
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:52,798
organic I don't want you know I didn't

492
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,200
spray these like either so I don't want

493
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:57,079
I don't want it sprayed with something

494
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:59,360
weird cuz it's so fresh and raw totally

495
00:17:57,079 --> 00:18:01,119
but that and you learn learn that to

496
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:03,678
respect the people that or the root weed

497
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:06,399
that was grown so well you realize like

498
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:08,320
you you know I'm going to pay some money

499
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,759
for that cuz like I you know it's not as

500
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:12,119
good as my weed I think it teaches you

501
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:14,000
that too and to be like maybe I'm not in

502
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:16,839
maybe I shouldn't I don't have time and

503
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,079
energy and I'm not that good at growing

504
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:21,678
weed so maybe I should just buy other

505
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:24,480
people's it requires a lot of energy a

506
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:27,559
lot of time a lot of uh repetition to

507
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,279
grow really good flower and uh yeah not

508
00:18:27,558 --> 00:18:31,359
everybody appreciat it either some

509
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:33,000
people are okay with mediocre I mean

510
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:34,479
mediocre everything I mean and also

511
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,200
there I mean mediocre what is that

512
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,599
anyways I think it's like you know

513
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,759
subjective subjective indeed I mean it

514
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:43,038
should smell good and taste good and

515
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:46,240
make you feel good it should but like

516
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:47,599
lots of people um because I did some bud

517
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,240
tending workout in New York got good

518
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:51,279
read on the on the you know the people

519
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,038
but a lot of people you know especially

520
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:55,879
uh they want they don't really want like

521
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:57,440
a it to be so strong you know they want

522
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,320
it they're actually looking for like

523
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,400
lower lower

524
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:04,240
THC weed some of the older people

525
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,400
especially saying that's a good Market

526
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,319
though if we're talking business you

527
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,759
know what I mean that's the big Market

528
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:10,480
the Baby Boomers they come in looking

529
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:13,000
for some stuff that reminds them of the

530
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,000
flower back in the 60 nostalgic weed my

531
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,480
mom always talks about the aqua gold

532
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,480
that's her nostalgic weed you know she's

533
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:22,558
born and raised in the Bay Area it was a

534
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,519
big deal Northern Lights even is pretty

535
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:28,319
nostalgic for a lot of us oh yeah for

536
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:31,400
sure piff piff I mean Cuban black Haze

537
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:33,960
piff yeah piff is cool uh is there a

538
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:36,720
difference between piff and Haze no piff

539
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:39,960
is definitely a tip so piff comes from

540
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:42,038
the Cuban black Haze and it's a I

541
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,840
believe it's an S1 of the Cuban black

542
00:19:42,038 --> 00:19:47,599
Haze so it is definitely hazy but I feel

543
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:49,199
like it's on the more mild side of haze

544
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:51,599
and they get that characteristic with

545
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,880
the trinoline and lyine a lot of it

546
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:56,639
comes from places like Colombia there's

547
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,720
genetics from Africa that have that

548
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,600
characteristic in there and usually it's

549
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,319
associated with a really strong effect

550
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:06,199
but with the piff it's not that strong

551
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:08,038
and it's I feel like it's it's uplifting

552
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,840
and then it just kind of Mellows off and

553
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:12,640
it makes you feel really good and the

554
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:15,199
piff always makes me feel great it's one

555
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:18,320
of those ones uh my buddy Josh Freeman

556
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,558
from Sebastapol grows piff black yeah

557
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:21,960
and it's really great he's actually

558
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:23,599
rolling me up some right now oh really

559
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,919
and The Taste is good it tastes good

560
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:26,158
down to the if it's grown correctly it

561
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:28,240
tastes good down to the roach and it has

562
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,480
a unique flavor profile it's not purple

563
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,558
candy gas like everybody likes you know

564
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,720
like a lot of people like it's got a

565
00:20:33,558 --> 00:20:39,038
little bit of the hazy but it's uh it's

566
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:41,360
really an amazing cultivar you know and

567
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:44,038
I would love to see us getting back into

568
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:46,479
more of the the varieties of cannabis

569
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:48,240
that are just outside the box a little

570
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,558
bit adding some more diversity some more

571
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,798
of the old school stuff you know train

572
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:55,558
wrecky stuff is good I like train wreck

573
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:58,400
but I also like Durban Poison and I also

574
00:20:55,558 --> 00:21:00,678
like Romulan like going back to some

575
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,240
Romulan we that's a popular Bay Area

576
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:04,120
genetic that we had I mean it's from all

577
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,159
over but you know we definitely had it

578
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:08,000
in the Bay Area it was hot it was real

579
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,520
hot for a minute yeah you know and then

580
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,599
we had some European stuff and I really

581
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:13,319
like some of the European genetics that

582
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:15,079
they they they took California genetics

583
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:16,639
and molded them there way and there's

584
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:19,439
some really interesting stuff over there

585
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,038
like the Liberty Haze and but some of

586
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,640
the hazes are a little bit too strong

587
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:24,119
for people because they they they don't

588
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,799
want to take just a half a hit they want

589
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:27,519
to smoke like three or four hits and

590
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:30,679
they do and some people get heart

591
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:33,759
palpitation and stuff like that whereas

592
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:36,480
like uh I think the the stuff that leans

593
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:39,038
on the sedative side is more popular

594
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,599
right now more of the

595
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:44,558
indicia but it all goes in waves we talk

596
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:46,399
about it a lot you know I think uh 80%

597
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:48,359
more than 80% of the market is purple

598
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,080
candy right now and people want purple

599
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:52,599
flour right I mean I think that there a

600
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:55,599
lot of those people that think they're

601
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:58,879
smoking purple weed or smoking like hemp

602
00:21:55,599 --> 00:22:01,879
sprayed I mean no I mean I think there's

603
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,840
runs and gelato yeah yeah yeah gelato 33

604
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,760
always runs and gelato I love those

605
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:07,519
though but it's my install it's like my

606
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:09,759
it's like I think it's like Regional at

607
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:13,119
this point almost like Regional tastes

608
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:15,278
what's your nostalgic flavor catpiss

609
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:17,000
catpiss catpiss from the Bay Area yeah

610
00:22:15,278 --> 00:22:18,839
we talk about it a lot on the show we

611
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,599
talk I'm doing a documentary later this

612
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:22,240
year we're going to do one on catpiss we

613
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:25,119
have some great Stories We got some

614
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,519
great storytellers yeah um and there's

615
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:30,918
there's amazing history with cat piss

616
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:33,000
and it's there's a lot of argument on

617
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:34,159
where it came from who created it a lot

618
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,720
of people want to take credit for

619
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,400
creating it and I believe a lot of

620
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,679
people did create their version of

621
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,038
catpiss right and it's an aroma it's a

622
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,720
it's a something that smells like

623
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:47,200
ammonia yeah and people relate that to

624
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,679
catpiss and so it is very possible it's

625
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,960
not like the name blue dream where it's

626
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:51,640
like okay the Hayes Brothers they

627
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,919
created the blue dream that's we can

628
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,360
trace that back to them and that's a

629
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,600
very specific name we have something

630
00:22:55,359 --> 00:23:01,319
that describes an aroma so anytime

631
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:03,639
someone in Kentucky or Florida or LA or

632
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:05,678
San Diego or the bay area which it was

633
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,679
very popular here they grow something

634
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,840
and it's got some ammonia you know the

635
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,440
first thing out of a lot of people

636
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:13,599
they're like catpiss catpiss and I

637
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,880
remember when catpiss came around yeah

638
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:17,399
the real cat SM like cat piss like oh it

639
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,480
really does it's kind of gross but it

640
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,960
smokes hella it smoked hella good and

641
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,360
the thing is is it it was the ugliest

642
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,278
weed and so I I love ugly weed yeah I'm

643
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:27,199
looking at ugly weed is like is like

644
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:29,000
catching my eye now after all seeing all

645
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,960
this like weird I had a whole revoltion

646
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,200
in New York I didn't know what TP spray

647
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,278
was I didn't know what was I've been

648
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,120
just on the hill trimming staying out of

649
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:39,519
that stuff for a while so I was like why

650
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:41,479
ises this like look like this but it

651
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:44,720
don't it's and I've smoked a couple of

652
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:46,679
of of these like sparkly purpley oh yeah

653
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,960
some of the stuff that's rolled in thca

654
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:51,559
where they they they toss it in thca so

655
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,120
it's especially if it's Sparkle thing

656
00:23:51,558 --> 00:23:56,399
yeah so they have the they call them

657
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:59,119
snowballs or snow caps I'm not a big fan

658
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,798
personally it's like uh moonrocks 2.0

659
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:03,119
and I I wasn't a really big fan of moon

660
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:05,319
rocks and they had their Heyday and they

661
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:07,439
it went relatively quickly which I think

662
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:09,000
is going to be the same thing so I mean

663
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,558
I want to taste the real flour same

664
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,079
thing with the the sprayed turps where

665
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:14,558
they're infusing different flavors you

666
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:17,319
know I don't know how safe it is for one

667
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:19,759
thing but I want the flower to represent

668
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:21,079
the genetics and you know the effort

669
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:24,278
that the grower went through not the

670
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:26,519
person who's infusing the flavor yeah

671
00:24:24,278 --> 00:24:28,519
yeah I know I mean there's uh it's a

672
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:31,240
market for the flavor stuff you know and

673
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:34,038
that's that but I personally no thank

674
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,399
you flavor is so subjective and all

675
00:24:34,038 --> 00:24:37,359
these things are so subjective to the

676
00:24:35,398 --> 00:24:39,398
individual from one person to the next

677
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:41,678
it's like I mean I think I can tell

678
00:24:39,398 --> 00:24:44,359
somebody what good flower is but it's

679
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,200
all very personal and you know with with

680
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:49,199
your own individual relationship with

681
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:51,038
the plant and relationship with these

682
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,200
flavor profiles and at the end of the

683
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:56,038
day it's an experience right so yeah I

684
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,880
mean it's aroma therapy and but I think

685
00:24:56,038 --> 00:24:59,558
I read somewhere that the Tarpin are

686
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:03,000
what inform our endocannabinoid

687
00:24:59,558 --> 00:25:07,200
receptors which cannaboids to take into

688
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,599
the system to you know send out so I I

689
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,240
don't know if I'm right on that I'm

690
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:12,079
pretty sure I read that somewhere I

691
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,960
believe that is correct and I you know I

692
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:15,240
think we don't know so much more we're

693
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,640
just still scratching the surface you

694
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:19,278
know they just came out with the the

695
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:22,000
white papers on flavorants which are

696
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:24,119
basically th and Esters and alcohols

697
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,519
that are in the plant stuff like that

698
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:27,119
and so we're just still scratching the

699
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:29,918
surface of it we're getting a better

700
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:32,918
understanding um and I love the fact

701
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,759
that that's advancing but you know it

702
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:36,880
can all be traced back also to our

703
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:39,079
relationship to the data points that

704
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,200
we've experienced in our life so you've

705
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:42,558
smelled different types of Rose or you

706
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,038
tell different types of orange is it

707
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:49,038
Orange Blossom is it Orange Peel is it

708
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:52,278
orange U juice is it a

709
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:54,720
orange um extract I mean there's all is

710
00:25:52,278 --> 00:25:56,519
it fake candy orange turps you know

711
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,278
there's so many different things and the

712
00:25:56,519 --> 00:26:01,038
more data points we collect

713
00:25:58,278 --> 00:26:02,919
over time whether it's with food or with

714
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:04,558
life experiences that's how we see

715
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:06,679
that's that's our lens we see the world

716
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:09,398
under right and so that's the pretty

717
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:12,200
amazing part is like all these different

718
00:26:09,398 --> 00:26:14,398
Tes um and different combinations of

719
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,840
Tarpin I guess there's 40,000 different

720
00:26:14,398 --> 00:26:17,959
Tarpin in existence that they know of

721
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:22,000
which is pretty

722
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:23,640
amazing um yeah and it's just the the

723
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,278
wide variety of stuff that we're going

724
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:28,480
to be able to experience over the next

725
00:26:26,278 --> 00:26:30,038
10 years I mean I think that's to change

726
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,079
from the purple candy to hopefully some

727
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:33,960
other interesting things the the hash

728
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:35,319
burger if you smelled that SM like in

729
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,000
and out there some greasy there's a

730
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:41,119
bunch of greasy Donnie Burger's pretty

731
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:43,398
greasy too yeah um so what would you

732
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:45,158
consider nostalgic as far as genetics

733
00:26:43,398 --> 00:26:48,918
what what what takes you back when you

734
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:51,000
smell um well I we talked before about

735
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:53,799
like you know the champal was the turp

736
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,880
that I was always chasing down but yeah

737
00:26:53,798 --> 00:26:58,679
that's the like weed I always wanted to

738
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:01,799
smoke again and then um the the

739
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:04,320
Granddaddy Purple when it was good yeah

740
00:27:01,798 --> 00:27:06,200
in the purple days you know perss and

741
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:08,000
everything oh yeah purple was trendy

742
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,720
back in the day before it wasn't right

743
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,960
and it wasn't purple actually the weed

744
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,278
well the we had real GDP that was dark

745
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,360
purple there was a Ken Ken's GDP some of

746
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:19,480
them they weren't super dark but then we

747
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:21,558
had a I mean I remember my friends going

748
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:24,679
super dark GDP where the leaves were

749
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:26,839
black and plants were real short and it

750
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:28,519
was super floral it was like the first

751
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:31,759
Floral for all the candy stuff it was

752
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:33,759
floral gas floral so like yeah I was

753
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:35,720
chasing the Rosé around for a while cuz

754
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:38,359
this Rosé that we that floral was

755
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:42,798
growing at a time was

756
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:44,079
so so good and like sexual Turks you

757
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:45,480
know what I mean it was really fun cuz

758
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,480
we had like 50 trimmers and they're all

759
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,278
super Stoners and so you can see like a

760
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,038
good data point of like what like

761
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:52,519
everyone kind of says and that was like

762
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:55,440
definitely one of those just like

763
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:57,000
everyone's like ooh ah like you know

764
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,120
can't get enough of it you're just like

765
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,798
oh my God

766
00:27:58,119 --> 00:28:02,759
I wonder if it's related to creme Ros

767
00:27:59,798 --> 00:28:05,480
from a fish in a they had this one Leo

768
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:07,480
had this one uh at least my buddy had

769
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:11,200
the phenotype of it that was rosewater

770
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:13,159
turs it was like rosew waterer amazing

771
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,440
it was it wasn't the most complex but it

772
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:18,640
was like it smelled like perfume almost

773
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,840
yeah like a perfume but like a sweet

774
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,120
undertones and then all that flavor in

775
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:24,599
your mouth we were pressing it and it

776
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:26,439
was like lavender rosin oh I bet it was

777
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:28,199
amazing yeah and then they had another

778
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:32,840
one over there called ra

779
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:34,640
which was like a a Nigerian land cross

780
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:38,158
mhm and like a

781
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:40,799
lemon and that that was a really fire

782
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:43,919
and also like super high like I miss

783
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:48,038
like weed that really does get you like

784
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:50,360
super Yonk like you know gu cultivator

785
00:28:48,038 --> 00:28:53,440
smoked some of maybe his hello with me

786
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:55,278
his hello strain and that was the last

787
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,880
time that I really like hit some weed

788
00:28:55,278 --> 00:28:59,839
and was just like I coughed so so hard

789
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,480
but it was like that cough that expander

790
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:02,639
cough where your lungs are like doing

791
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,360
things and then you're about to be

792
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,759
whatever yeah and then just like not

793
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:12,319
just bloodshot eyes but like blood red

794
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:15,240
eyes yeah and just that like I'm hella

795
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:18,918
high right now I haven't really been

796
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:21,960
getting that from for any bud too much

797
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:24,679
for a while that's why you dab that is

798
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:26,759
why I dab yeah right it'll it'll take

799
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:28,399
you there yeah but that weed took me

800
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:30,798
there you know back in the day I think

801
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:33,000
we took us there a little more and um

802
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:35,119
you know I don't know if we watered down

803
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,880
all of the land race genetics and we're

804
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:39,000
never going to have that potency back or

805
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,760
is there the potency going to bring us

806
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,798
back you know it's you got to convince

807
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:42,879
these people to grow some of these

808
00:29:41,798 --> 00:29:45,200
longer

809
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,799
flowering uh these longer flowering

810
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,080
varieties well people got to pay for

811
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:51,398
that because if you think you know you

812
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:53,720
want to grow twice as long flowering

813
00:29:51,398 --> 00:29:56,398
time that's going to cost twice as much

814
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:58,558
yeah and that's like you know definitely

815
00:29:56,398 --> 00:30:00,398
feeding into the lack of I think like

816
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:01,720
more quality stuff on the market here is

817
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:03,959
like if you're going to push the price

818
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,720
down yeah that people I mean the math

819
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:08,480
isn't mathing in California right now

820
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:10,038
they really got to fix it well we were

821
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,880
talking about the northern lights and we

822
00:30:10,038 --> 00:30:14,398
were talking about Haze and you know

823
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:17,440
just off the top of my head the the piff

824
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:19,479
is nl5 times Haze I believe it's

825
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,960
Northern Lights times Haze is what makes

826
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,720
the piff ah and same thing with the when

827
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,679
I smoked the PFF in New York it tasted

828
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:29,000
like Northern kns a little bit to me cuz

829
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:30,320
it is it's Northern Lights Haze okay and

830
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,679
same thing with the Fort Collins cough

831
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:34,200
it's another amazing that one's pretty

832
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:36,960
strong actually the Fort Collins cough

833
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:40,120
is pretty strong and it's it's got this

834
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,519
crazy flavor that that's unmistakable

835
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:43,959
that that's musky it's got a nice musky

836
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:46,319
characteristic to it that's that's

837
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,319
unique to the Fort cins cough but do you

838
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:51,720
think people can dial down the flowering

839
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:54,918
time or you think that's sure intricate

840
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:56,960
to the success of a really good like

841
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:59,399
psychedelic sativa cuz we're in the the

842
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:02,120
right you're saying yeah I think well I

843
00:30:59,398 --> 00:31:03,479
think someone made a point the other day

844
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:05,239
that said the longer it takes the flower

845
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,839
the longer the high the longer the

846
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:10,679
effect but we can breed into I mean I've

847
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:12,678
seen stuff bred into shorter flowering

848
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:15,600
varieties for sure and it's a lot of the

849
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:19,200
stuff has gotten shorter over time uh

850
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:21,879
but there is a relationship to tpin and

851
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,720
structure tpin and flowering time you

852
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:26,639
know there's all these interconnected

853
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:28,278
traits and so through work through

854
00:31:26,638 --> 00:31:30,079
effort like if you have breeding goals

855
00:31:28,278 --> 00:31:33,200
where you're like I like this specific

856
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:35,119
flavor over time you can breed those to

857
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,798
Shorter flowering times Sour Diesel we

858
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:39,839
want Sour Diesel and we want to capture

859
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:43,000
this exact thing that tastes good smells

860
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:45,759
good has a similar effect but it doesn't

861
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,440
take 12 weeks it only takes eight weeks

862
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:48,720
and that that is possible I think those

863
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,679
things are possible but they take a lot

864
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:54,159
of work and they take a lot of effort

865
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:56,399
and you know some of these passion

866
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:57,480
projects don't pay out for a long time

867
00:31:56,398 --> 00:32:00,439
right so it's something something that

868
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,960
you do out of passion and you know these

869
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:06,278
are all fun things but I don't know that

870
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:08,798
everybody wants to smoke Haze and that's

871
00:32:06,278 --> 00:32:10,038
okay you know but I I think variety is

872
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:12,599
good too because there's a lot of us

873
00:32:10,038 --> 00:32:15,200
that do like smoking Haze or do like

874
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:18,480
smoking interesting and different unique

875
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:20,679
experiences so because I feel like tpin

876
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,278
have a lot to do with the effect and so

877
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:23,919
oh heck yeah at the end of the day I

878
00:32:22,278 --> 00:32:25,319
want to try different effects for

879
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,759
different time I like Skittles don't get

880
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:28,918
me wrong I love the taste of Skittles

881
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:30,919
Skittles is amazing but it also has a

882
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:33,240
ceiling so it only gets you so high like

883
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:36,080
for me the Skittles High it takes me up

884
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:37,638
to about here it never really like as

885
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:39,158
much as I smoke I could smoke it all day

886
00:32:37,638 --> 00:32:41,879
it never takes me but it's a great

887
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:43,799
social flavor you know you can smoke it

888
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:46,480
with everybody and most people like it

889
00:32:43,798 --> 00:32:48,798
it doesn't get them too high you know

890
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,480
and and for maybe novices it gets them

891
00:32:48,798 --> 00:32:54,079
super high or whatever but like I think

892
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,599
for people that are experienced smokers

893
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:57,359
it doesn't take them above that

894
00:32:55,599 --> 00:33:00,759
threshold whereas you take something

895
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:03,079
like some hazes and or some Durban

896
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:05,200
Poison for example you you smoke a

897
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:06,759
couple puffs it gets you here smoke a

898
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,639
couple more it gets you here and that

899
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:10,359
never ends you can keep smoking more and

900
00:33:08,638 --> 00:33:11,759
it just keeps getting you more high so

901
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:13,558
yeah and those are fun experiences I'm

902
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:15,000
like where's that we he have yeah

903
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:17,918
there's Durban Poison there's people I

904
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,240
mean uh Redbeard's got his uh red

905
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:22,360
congales and Durban Poison and those

906
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,919
those yeah there's people still doing it

907
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:25,879
um there's some people in San Francisco

908
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:27,559
some people in Santa Cruz they're harder

909
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,519
to find though

910
00:33:27,558 --> 00:33:31,678
but uh well I'm interested to find out

911
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:34,679
because a lot of these like psychedelic

912
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:37,639
sativas are Southeast Asian I feel like

913
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:39,880
the land races too and there is there is

914
00:33:37,638 --> 00:33:41,519
some I mean I think southeast Asia is

915
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,278
where we got the interex traits the

916
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,240
hermaphrodite stuff from which that's

917
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:49,240
heavily been bred into the genetics so

918
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:51,440
we have issues with hermaphrodites now

919
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,919
so but yeah people just need to stress

920
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,798
test their weed more I think the

921
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:56,399
Breeders the guys growing and the guys

922
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:58,918
putting stuff out need to do more stress

923
00:33:56,398 --> 00:34:01,678
testing right take that job like real

924
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:03,759
seriously and really like well if they

925
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:06,120
don't someone else will right at the end

926
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:08,599
of the day true what do you feel like

927
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:11,199
the stress like hardest thing to grow no

928
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:12,760
the easiest like the least stress e oh

929
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,759
the easiest the one if you want to feel

930
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:16,919
really good about yourself you girl blue

931
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,440
dream say wedding cake but yeah okay

932
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:19,878
blue Dre wedding cake is a good example

933
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,639
but I would say blue dream is the best

934
00:34:19,878 --> 00:34:25,279
example it's the apical of structure so

935
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:28,119
it has the I mean in my opinion it is

936
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:31,000
the as far as structure GRS and easy to

937
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:32,280
grow it is it's very easy to grow if you

938
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
want to feel good about yourself grow

939
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,399
Blue Dream if you want to feel bad about

940
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,398
yourself you should grow some OG cush

941
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:39,838
yeah so and OG well I mean for me back

942
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:42,239
in the day it was OG Kush it was also

943
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:45,679
Girl Scout cookies was like low

944
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:47,199
yielding hard to grow very finicky I

945
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,119
know I was like so excited to finally

946
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:51,000
get it and then the nugs were like this

947
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,079
big same thing train wreck I feel like

948
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,358
another one yeah so train wreck had like

949
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:57,760
the really like these clusters and

950
00:34:55,358 --> 00:35:00,078
really bad node spacing and

951
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,720
but Blue Dream is like this strong plant

952
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:04,240
just easy to grow you w you even if

953
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:06,279
you're not a good grower you can get

954
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:09,159
really good flower out of it it's really

955
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:11,240
really simple and straightforward I feel

956
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:13,519
like the more you push it the bigger

957
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:15,439
it'll get so what are the genetics

958
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:18,599
you've been smoking on lately I brought

959
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,519
some sunr fullterm sunr that I was super

960
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:23,240
stoked to find that my buddy grew that

961
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:26,559
was like a cross of Sunset sherber and

962
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:27,598
gelato and ice cream cake and runch and

963
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:29,799
O

964
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:33,000
nice I was like that sounds all good

965
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:37,560
yeah um I went and got some of meno dop

966
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:39,079
boy's he OG at the organic can which is

967
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:41,759
fire and I was stoked cuz it was like

968
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:43,320
$20 for eighth yeah which just felt like

969
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,920
Norm we've normalized again I'm like

970
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:50,160

nice I guess because it's a little bit

1063
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:21,839
of a different view when uh when I first

1064
00:39:20,318 --> 00:39:23,358
started working in cannabis it was all

1065
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:26,759

starting to come around and stuff and

1099
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:41,079
people in their own time to have a voice

1100
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:42,358
and to tell their story when it's time

1101
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:43,920
you know what I mean so I'm like holding

1102
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:45,679
the spot I'm doing the show every week

1103
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,000
and some so I don't make new content I'm

1104
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:49,639
sure with your your podcast here it's

1105
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,559
you know it's it's a lot to create

1106
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:54,279
content all the time and promote it and

1107
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:56,799
post it and H honor every story that

1108
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:58,560
comes on totally you know what I mean

1109
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,359
well I see us as kind of storytellers

1110
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:01,799
and we're able to get record some oral

1111
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:03,559
history like for me it's all about the

1112
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,680
oral history side of it and hopefully in

1113
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:07,039
50 years people look back and be like

1114
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:09,559
that was pretty cool these guys are

1115
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:10,960
really weird that's I love you're doing

1116
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:12,599
I mean these are great stories and

1117
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,039
there's so many angles to it when I saw

1118
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:15,559
that you were doing what you were doing

1119
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:17,159
a lot of people that I was hoping they

1120
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:19,279
might come on my show were coming on

1121
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:22,358
your show but I'm like that's great he's

1122
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:24,280
doing it like it's getting told I mean

1123
00:41:22,358 --> 00:41:26,400
and it is a community and that's kind of

1124
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:27,760
what it's about too it's not about it's

1125
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,400
not competition we're all in this

1126
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,680
together and I feel like it's just it's

1127
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:34,318
a it's a beautiful amazing thing right

1128
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:37,118
now is just it's so great the industry

1129
00:41:34,318 --> 00:41:39,159
in a lot of ways is amazing you know in

1130
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,200
a lot of ways it's also scary you know

1131
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:43,639
but that's life with everything but yeah

1132
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:46,358
to be able to record some of these

1133
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:47,838
people like uh Richard delisi yes yeah

1134
00:41:46,358 --> 00:41:50,239
you having him you need to get him on

1135
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:53,358
the show he is amazing he's he's a great

1136
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:56,439
Storyteller he's got his adventures um

1137
00:41:53,358 --> 00:41:57,639
we filmed some good stuff yeah yeah so

1138
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,679
and then both of the D'Angelo brothers

1139
00:41:57,639 --> 00:42:01,598
are characters right so yeah they

1140
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:03,719
they've got their stories too yeah it's

1141
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,680
time for the stories to be told and for

1142
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:07,318
like that torch of compassion to be held

1143
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:09,679
and I like so when I started B SES I

1144
00:42:07,318 --> 00:42:12,800
always called it like um a weekly sesh

1145
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:15,519
to inspire our Evolution right meaning

1146
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:18,200
like our Evolution from like traditional

1147
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:19,639
to what it is now whoever wants to

1148
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:22,199
participate and do what they're doing

1149
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:24,159
let's support them you know let's invite

1150
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:25,558
the ogs let's invite the new people that

1151
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:26,879
are going to bring something new to the

1152
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:29,319
table too

1153
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,640
and like let's find ways to come

1154
00:42:29,318 --> 00:42:34,880
together over this beautiful plant this

1155
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:36,199
thing we all love yeah totally well it's

1156
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,760
an amazing thing that brings us all

1157
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:40,719
together the you know people from all

1158
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:44,520
walks of life that would

1159
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:46,959
never she yes she is is amazing yeah I

1160
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:48,800
think people from all walks of life can

1161
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,318
can sit at the same table and have a

1162
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,920
great conversation about something that

1163
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:54,239
they love and you know it's something

1164
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:56,838
that unites us all and makes the world a

1165
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:58,598
better place does it BRS compassion and

1166
00:42:56,838 --> 00:43:02,400
empathy it's proven it's scientifically

1167
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:04,440
proven like we are you know we are

1168
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,079
really giving a lot to the world with

1169
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,358
this plant and by cultivating it and

1170
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:10,400
sharing it and it's that's you know we

1171
00:43:08,358 --> 00:43:12,239
don't want that to be forgotten in the

1172
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,000
in the hustle bustle of trying to

1173
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:19,078
survive in the industry or make a dime

1174
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:20,679
or get you know right somewhere yeah so

1175
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:23,160
how do you see the future of the

1176
00:43:20,679 --> 00:43:25,159
industry if you're looking five years or

1177
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:29,000
10 years into the future what do you see

1178
00:43:25,159 --> 00:43:31,318
going on I think like the thing is the

1179
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,239
economics of it right like Canada and

1180
00:43:31,318 --> 00:43:35,400
Mexico's been gearing up to the

1181
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:37,679
everybody's going to have to go legal

1182
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:39,400
yeah and right now the argument is like

1183
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:42,159
oh declassify or and I'm like

1184
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:44,358
unclassified you know I've been told by

1185
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:46,078
people from DC that like cuz my whole

1186
00:43:44,358 --> 00:43:47,519
thing is like look it's reer Madness

1187
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:50,119
it's built on a lie can they just give

1188
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:52,119
up the LIE already and like but they

1189
00:43:50,119 --> 00:43:53,800
won't so we're going to have to go with

1190
00:43:52,119 --> 00:43:56,160
this like you know starting with the

1191
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,800
classification or not but we're argue

1192
00:43:56,159 --> 00:44:00,598
we're going to reschedule instead of

1193
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:02,920
Economics of it period it's just got to

1194
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:04,240
be a commodity it's especially when

1195
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:06,599
we're competing on the North to the

1196
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:08,799
North and the South with you know Canada

1197
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:10,119
and Mexico obviously there's got to be a

1198
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,119
commodity there we've got to get

1199
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:14,079
Interstate trading going or you know

1200
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:18,079
opened up that's ridiculous it's

1201
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:20,400
happening whatever um I think like

1202
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:21,839
unfortunately like for the farmers I

1203
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,760
think that it's going to just end up

1204
00:44:21,838 --> 00:44:25,679
being in the category of every all the

1205
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,520
other AG you don't really know Farmers

1206
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:29,598
aren't Ballers you know what I mean like

1207
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:31,239
those are those days of farmers are

1208
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:32,760
farmers you can be super successful

1209
00:44:31,239 --> 00:44:35,000
whether you go Tomatoes or corn or

1210
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,480
whatever I mean if you love what you're

1211
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,559
doing I think that's the most important

1212
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,199
thing and the whole rockar thing it's

1213
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:41,599
like whatever but like at the end of the

1214
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:44,000
day if you're all about the plant the

1215
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:47,440
whole a model where we can be

1216
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,880
Farmers that is fantastic where you can

1217
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,318
actually have a job doing it regardless

1218
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,838
of everything else if you can have a job

1219
00:44:50,318 --> 00:44:54,639
doing it where you can make a successful

1220
00:44:52,838 --> 00:44:56,358
living out of yourself it all comes down

1221
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:58,400
to how hard you want to grind anyway

1222
00:44:56,358 --> 00:45:00,159
yeah yeah but I mean it's not going to

1223
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,720
be worth it's going to push once it's on

1224
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:05,239
legal it's a regular thing it's not

1225
00:45:01,719 --> 00:45:07,439
going to be worth so much and so it's

1226
00:45:05,239 --> 00:45:10,679
going to be there will still be there

1227
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:12,480
will be there will be and I think that's

1228
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:13,838
also has a lot to do with freshness you

1229
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,599
know and there's a lot to find out I

1230
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:17,039
mean and and you know there's everything

1231
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:19,000
else I mean there's all the medicinal

1232
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:21,358
things there's the raw aspect of it I

1233
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,039
think is going to be huge yeah um that

1234
00:45:21,358 --> 00:45:25,400
it's completely untapped you know what I

1235
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:27,880
mean the Cosmetics of it everything I we

1236
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:29,880
don't it's going to be integrated fully

1237
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:31,920
into our lives it's a food it's a fiber

1238
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:34,838
it's a building material you know what I

1239
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,920
mean um so it's just like we're in a

1240
00:45:34,838 --> 00:45:38,880
startup Market here in California within

1241
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:41,119
a startup Market in the country within a

1242
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,880
global startup market so the the the

1243
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:45,400
growth rates are going to just be going

1244
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:49,000
up up up everywhere forever for the next

1245
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:51,240
10 20 years who knows how long yeah yeah

1246
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,838
in all kinds of directions yeah lots of

1247
00:45:51,239 --> 00:45:54,399
jobs could be created we start doing

1248
00:45:52,838 --> 00:45:56,719
hemp creete and some of these other

1249
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:59,440
things it's like man we can start using

1250
00:45:56,719 --> 00:46:01,519
it for building materials and which are

1251
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:04,000
some of the biggest carbon wasting Pro

1252
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:05,920
you know thing issues that must be

1253
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,480
addressed you know whether people want

1254
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:10,000
to whatever I mean and peak oil was a

1255
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,358
while ago that's getting done even the

1256
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,800
Saudis are like gearing up for something

1257
00:46:12,358 --> 00:46:18,239
new you know there could be biofuel you

1258
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:19,839
know I don't know sure soil remediation

1259
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:21,598
all kinds of soil remediation you can

1260
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:23,838
Harvest it three times a year so like

1261
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:25,318
not just in like the Cannabis field or I

1262
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:26,880
mean I kind of just like let's just all

1263
00:46:25,318 --> 00:46:28,358
the same thing is for kind of the same

1264
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,079
thing it's not though guess you could

1265
00:46:28,358 --> 00:46:32,598
just but you know it's just that like

1266
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:34,839
the greater economic system that's where

1267
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:36,519
it's like we'll see you know other

1268
00:46:34,838 --> 00:46:39,759
things need to be corrected and fixed in

1269
00:46:36,519 --> 00:46:42,960
the in the in the regular economy before

1270
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:45,480
sure Full Throttle totally agree but

1271
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,960
yeah California has like I said like you

1272
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,838
know there's the Cannabis thing and then

1273
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,519
there's the greater issue I'm fascinated

1274
00:46:48,838 --> 00:46:52,239
right now I've been talking a lot about

1275
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:54,639
the um Governor's United enforcement

1276
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:56,639
task force that they've put together

1277
00:46:54,639 --> 00:46:58,799
here I think that's really interesting

1278
00:46:56,639 --> 00:47:02,400
it's like Camp part two yeah so it just

1279
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:05,640
kind of got started the end of 2021 and

1280
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:08,680
it's incorporating like all sort of uh

1281
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:11,159
the DEA federal and state and local

1282
00:47:08,679 --> 00:47:14,199
jurisdictions and also administrative

1283
00:47:11,159 --> 00:47:17,199
branches too so they're hoping to you

1284
00:47:14,199 --> 00:47:20,000
basically hammer down on fines and

1285
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:23,439
collect fines and and and um everything

1286
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:26,318
to pay for all this enforcement wow and

1287
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:29,599
I'm I I that just sounds like again Camp

1288
00:47:26,318 --> 00:47:31,358
2.0 Camp 2.0 and so I'm interested you

1289
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:33,800
know I'm kind of been following that

1290
00:47:31,358 --> 00:47:37,119
they they they they reported for their

1291
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:38,760
first year 312 million that They seized

1292
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:40,760
I also interested to find I think it's

1293
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:43,079
time for them to stop valuing the weed

1294
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:45,160
so high if they're not you know what I

1295
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:46,839
mean they're like all I'm like well how

1296
00:47:45,159 --> 00:47:47,960
many pounds was that cuz I don't know

1297
00:47:46,838 --> 00:47:51,400
are you what are you saying what are you

1298
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:52,800
trying to say 1,200 pound 7,000 a pound

1299
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:57,119
you're G to stop with those inflated

1300
00:47:52,800 --> 00:48:01,200
worths you know but it was like um

1301
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:03,318
um 91,000 plants eradicated and you know

1302
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:04,799
they do Target these like illegal grows

1303
00:48:03,318 --> 00:48:06,480
and all that but now they're starting in

1304
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:09,440
this administrative Branch there's also

1305
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:12,000
been a lot of like FBI stings where

1306
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:16,920
they're posing as inspectors and even

1307
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:19,679
posing as DCC um inspectors and they're

1308
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:22,000
actually FBI to um and getting people on

1309
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:24,759
bribery and stuff like that there's so

1310
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,880
much going on here so much enforcement

1311
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:30,680
still which I think is like a waste of

1312
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:33,200
money and it's holding the industry back

1313
00:48:30,679 --> 00:48:34,399
in in that way because it's like they're

1314
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:37,519
add they're like well you got to pay for

1315
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:41,200
this too and it's just like unfair like

1316
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:43,280
that other markets are being able to do

1317
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:45,279
so much more already and we should have

1318
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:47,920
been the leaders of it all right you

1319
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,319
know life is strange long strange trip

1320
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,838
but we are still leaders of it all

1321
00:48:49,318 --> 00:48:52,838
regardless we're 20 years ahead of

1322
00:48:50,838 --> 00:48:54,798
everybody here in California and we have

1323
00:48:52,838 --> 00:48:56,279
20 million Acres of farmland and we

1324
00:48:54,798 --> 00:48:58,159
Supply

1325
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:00,280
all the strawberries and the blueberries

1326
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:01,598
and the celeries from here to the rest

1327
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:03,559
of the country yeah I mean it's a

1328
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:05,760
beautiful amazing place we'll just see

1329
00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:08,359
what happens I guess going to be

1330
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,760
interesting yeah so if you had one piece

1331
00:49:08,358 --> 00:49:13,159
of advice for your younger self that

1332
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:16,160
started out in the Cannabis industry

1333
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:18,000
what would that one piece of advice be

1334
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:19,239
if I could do it all over again I would

1335
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,358
have become a doctor so I could

1336
00:49:19,239 --> 00:49:24,798
prescribe people with weed nice period

1337
00:49:22,358 --> 00:49:26,318
yeah yeah that's a good one cuz I want

1338
00:49:24,798 --> 00:49:28,358
to convince so many people that are on

1339
00:49:26,318 --> 00:49:30,239
the fence I want to be able to help

1340
00:49:28,358 --> 00:49:33,480
people I want to whatever and that seems

1341
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:35,039
to be like this barrier and people now

1342
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,760
that it's recreational they think it's

1343
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:38,358
just a recreation I'm like no it could

1344
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:40,200
help your stomach it could help so many

1345
00:49:38,358 --> 00:49:41,639
things not everything but I feel it's

1346
00:49:40,199 --> 00:49:44,838
medical whether you believe it is or not

1347
00:49:41,639 --> 00:49:47,239

rolled sitting there that he'd taken

1378
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:54,760
like a few hits off of cuz he was trying

1379
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:56,400
to find good skunk he was like so he was

1380

1382
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:00,480
to if you're capid donic especially or

1383
00:50:59,079 --> 00:51:01,599
whatever they're coming up to you and

1384
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,318
they're like you know you want to try

1385
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:05,680
this weed I grew this weed that weed

1386
00:51:03,318 --> 00:51:07,199
whatever so he's on the hunt for skunk

1387
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:09,279
and he and I could tell by looking at

1388
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:11,318
that pile that it was like you know

1389
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:13,160
nothing was even close to what he wanted

1390
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:14,318
cuz if you find that weed that you love

1391
00:51:13,159 --> 00:51:16,239
like that that flavor that you're

1392
00:51:14,318 --> 00:51:17,599
looking for cuz if you're a real real

1393
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:20,118
Stoner you're that tur pound right

1394
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:21,880
you're like this is the one you know

1395
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:24,599
clearly he hadn't so we smoked with him

1396
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:27,358
I smoked I had some like really like GMO

1397
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:29,519
C back cross I was like well you know

1398
00:51:27,358 --> 00:51:31,558
it's not skunk but it's like in the area

1399
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:33,559
of like Funk right so you might like

1400
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:35,119
this and I you know he's he smoked it a

1401
00:51:33,559 --> 00:51:36,720
little bit more than the rest of it but

1402
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:38,838
it wasn't what he was looking for it's

1403
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:42,358
in the right family at least I feel like

1404
00:51:38,838 --> 00:51:44,639
that yeah that gas along with the skunk

1405
00:51:42,358 --> 00:51:47,159
I thought that was interesting yeah yeah

1406
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:48,318
nice cool yeah there's it's funny

1407
00:51:47,159 --> 00:51:50,399
because there's so many people that

1408
00:51:48,318 --> 00:51:52,318
smoke weed out there but like my my big

1409
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,960
like Superstar Gaga moment was smoking

1410
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:56,000
with gar cultivator nice maybe he's like

1411
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:58,559
my favorite

1412
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,199
that's awesome and the weed matched the

1413
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:01,839
the attitude and the music that he you

1414
00:52:00,199 --> 00:52:04,558
know I mean like I said I I still

1415
00:52:01,838 --> 00:52:06,400

1416

1425
00:52:23,798 --> 00:52:28,759
over like rap a so I played battle style

1431
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:39,119

1443
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:04,440
on the radio show it's the bay s right

1444
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:07,119
it's a radio show but uh I it was always

1445
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:08,880
the blend of like R and reggae and like

1446
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:10,640
storyville like underground hip-hop

1447
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:12,318
stuff right so I kind of go funny people

1448
00:53:10,639 --> 00:53:14,679
are doing that now but you way before

1449
00:53:12,318 --> 00:53:15,960
your time yeah yeah really cool they're

1450
00:53:14,679 --> 00:53:17,480
bringing it back you know but that is

1451
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,318
the bay culture it's really cool what I

1452
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:21,920
learned about being in New York and like

1453
00:53:19,318 --> 00:53:24,199
immersing myself that much and and being

1454
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:26,880
here is like we are like one culture

1455
00:53:24,199 --> 00:53:29,759
here like everybody it's like one cool

1456
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:32,160
culture yeah yeah yeah I love the bay I

1457
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,480
love NorCal and I when I say the bay I

1458
00:53:32,159 --> 00:53:35,920
feel like the bay all the way up to

1459
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:38,240
Oregon yeah it's like still it's all

1460
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:40,680
great I I love it all and La is its own

1461
00:53:38,239 --> 00:53:42,199
thing too La exactly La San Diego it's

1462
00:53:40,679 --> 00:53:43,879
its own thing there's nothing wrong with

1463
00:53:42,199 --> 00:53:45,318
down there though I I like I like

1464
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:47,039
visiting I like visiting I have some

1465
00:53:45,318 --> 00:53:48,519
really cool friends down there I like I

1466
00:53:47,039 --> 00:53:50,039
like a lot of things about it but it's

1467
00:53:48,519 --> 00:53:53,159
not where I would necessarily want to

1468
00:53:50,039 --> 00:53:55,318
live so I just find myself gravitated

1469
00:53:53,159 --> 00:53:57,239
towards the Bay Area every time we leave

1470
00:53:55,318 --> 00:53:59,119
we end up coming back I'm coming back

1471
00:53:57,239 --> 00:54:00,639
I'm not I did a thing there I wanted to

1472
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:01,960
bring the culture there I did I've met

1473
00:54:00,639 --> 00:54:03,558
some people I've enabled some people

1474
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:05,199
that feel confident about growing I've

1475
00:54:03,559 --> 00:54:07,559
taught a lot of people how to figure out

1476
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:09,798
what the the good weed is versus

1477
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:11,480
whatever the weird stuff is it took me

1478
00:54:09,798 --> 00:54:13,280
like a lot of investigating to figure

1479
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:16,000
that out and you know took some people

1480
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:17,200
under my wing and then I'm ready to just

1481
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,480
come home because New York's going to do

1482
