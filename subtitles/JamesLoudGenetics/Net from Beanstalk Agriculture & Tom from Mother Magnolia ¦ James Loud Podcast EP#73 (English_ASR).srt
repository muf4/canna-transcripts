guys were able to make it out here uh we

13
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,239
got Emerald Cup this weekend so it's

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,920
going to be a busy weekend I'm excited

15
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,799
to see what they do with it in Oakland

16
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,359
you know that's new right it's totally

17
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,399
new it's totally mind-blowing that they

18
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:47,159
went from Santa Rosa to Oakland we went

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,600
from the hippie to the hip hop right and

20
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:51,759
and so we'll see how that works out uh

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,280
you know I mean I've had so many things

22
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:54,839
going on in my life that I'm like oh

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,520
that's not going to work and then it

24
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,680
works out so maybe it'll be fantastic

25
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,120
maybe it won't maybe it's going to be

26
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:01,439
somewhere in the middle maybe they need

27
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:03,518
to work on it you know yeah I mean I

28
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,359
think the 510 has a quite the big

29
00:01:03,518 --> 00:01:07,798
history with with cannabis to begin with

30
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:10,799
it's not yeah I mean Oakland especially

31
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:13,360
I mean yeah as far as legalization and

32
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,118
the dispensaries and the movement yeah a

33
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:16,719
lot of it started here this this is kind

34
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:19,680
of the epicenter the Bay Area is the

35
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:22,798
epicenter but I feel like the emerald

36
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:26,280
cup was more geared towards hippie

37
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,320
hippie culture humbled Harvest time

38
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,040
especially especially like in December

39
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,919
when we were judging it was like fr

40
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,320
fresh off the mountain right yeah I I

41
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,519
remember the emerald cup is really being

42
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:36,919
a celebration of the outdoor grower yeah

43
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,280
right and that really being the kind of

44
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,840
the Pinnacle of like the best outdoor

45
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,200
flower you know you're going to find it

46
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,000
all at the emerald cup totally I mean

47
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,879
and back in the day the judges they

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,680
would have a handful of entries now it's

49
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:53,718
like 150 flower entries and I it's

50
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,320
pretty wild the amount of people

51
00:01:53,718 --> 00:01:57,919
entering um and exciting I mean all

52
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:00,798
these things evolve everything evolves

53
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,560
we evolve as companies event evolve or

54
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,280
they die off so you either have to

55
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,159
evolve or you know that's it yeah I mean

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,199
I've always been curious at the judging

57
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:11,879
process when you have so many strains

58
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:14,199
you know I I can't imagine the task of

59
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:15,598
having to judge say a hundred strains

60
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:17,639
yeah you've got to have a decent amount

61
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:19,639
of time in order just like fena hunting

62
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:21,199
right so it's the same process that that

63
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,679
we do when we're going through different

64
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:24,318
genetics where we have a hundred

65
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,560
different plants that we have to test

66
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:27,159
out I'm sure I mean that's how I would

67
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,959
do it yeah and so first you got to

68
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:30,840
organize them you know you organize them

69
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,560
by smell look however you want to do it

70
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,840
and then you kind of go in and

71
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,640
especially if you're tasting them you

72
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,878
want to judge them for Taste and effect

73
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,079
because one thing is smelling and you

74
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:42,199
can do the visual and all that stuff but

75
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,159
when it comes down to it you really have

76
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:47,000
to consume it you really have to try it

77
00:02:44,158 --> 00:02:48,519
but as far as like an effect you don't

78
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,080
have a 100 days to where you can get a

79
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:51,680
fresh start every day with one to be

80
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,640
like oh yeah this one makes me feel like

81
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,959
this you can tell the strength of

82
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:56,158
something if it's stronger but there's

83
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,200
subtleties that you're going to miss

84
00:02:56,158 --> 00:02:59,400
when you have to judge that many yeah

85
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:01,439
yeah I think it's almost like there's a

86
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,799
bias to the first one that you try that

87
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,959
day for sure you that's going to be the

88
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:07,280
one that's probably going to have the

89
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,799
most lingering impact on your psyche is

90
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,280
the first one that you gravitate towards

91
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:11,719
that day yeah but then there's going to

92
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,039
be the ones that are super strong where

93
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:18,400
you smoke it you're like that's the one

94
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:20,400
that that one got yeah my B that one

95
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,000
made me feel tired or that one man I

96
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,319
feel like my heart's racing a little bit

97
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,919
after that one hit you know and I feel

98
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:28,719
like rosin judging rosin it's like

99
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:30,479
there's those subtleties are a little

100
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,878
more intense

101
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:35,039
right so with flour it's like not as

102
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:37,518
intense sometimes and it's more subtle

103
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,400
whereas rosin it's all concentrated yeah

104
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,000
yeah yeah so this there's a lot more I

105
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,400
would say uh congruity between the smell

106
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,560
and the taste in rosin when flour

107
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,480
sometimes you can have that flour that

108
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,920
smells and looks incredible purple punch

109
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:52,438
right yeah and then burn it it tastes

110
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:54,958
like paper well we were talking about

111
00:03:52,438 --> 00:03:57,479
our good friend Chris Castle and he does

112
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,199
a Donnie burger right and so his flour

113
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:02,199
is not anything that I'd be like Chris I

114
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:05,359
need some of that but the Donny Burger

115
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:08,518
rosin I'm like dude it's such an amazing

116
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,920
product you know we shared it on on the

117
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,319
reggy on the river podcast I made

118
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,280
everybody try it I was like literally

119
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:14,560
going around with the Little Dipper

120
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,639
making people try it right out of the

121
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,358
jar and everybody's like wow this stuff

122
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,040
is ridiculous and it's just it's a

123
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,839
concentration but it's different than

124
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,479
the flour like the taste is different

125
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:26,839
even though it's a concentration it's

126
00:04:25,478 --> 00:04:28,599
when you concentrate things they don't

127
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:30,359
all concentrate the same that's true

128
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,520
yeah some flavors

129
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,800
can concentrated can provide almost an

130
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:36,319
unpleasant flavor experience yeah where

131
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,800
some of them it's so faint that when you

132
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:40,038
concentrate it you get just the right

133
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,800
amount yeah and I mean I think something

134
00:04:40,038 --> 00:04:43,240
like Skittles right you concentrate it

135
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,918
and it's concentrated in the right way

136
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,879
where it's like wow you conc doesn't

137
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:50,839
matter whether it's rosin whether it's

138
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:53,279
BHO or whatever it is yeah all that

139
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:55,839
stuff it Skittles is amazing and I think

140
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:57,399
Skittles derivatives like moonbow yeah

141
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:59,239
you know you get any of those moonbows

142
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:00,839
and I think they're pretty amazing and

143
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,639
they lean heavy especially the ones that

144
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:04,638
lean heavy on the Skittles where it's

145
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,360
like candy it's got the but but it like

146
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,680
checks the boxes because Skittles really

147
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,199
doesn't yeah I think when it comes to

148
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,160
effect I think that's where a lot of

149
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:13,720
people are left Desiring more with

150
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,039
Skittles certainly as a flavor

151
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,680
experience yeah it's 10 out of 10 11 out

152
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:21,839
of 10 uhhuh um and yeah we I actually

153
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,360
hunted a uh I actually hunted a feno of

154
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:26,519
moonbo from the archive pack that he

155
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,479
released from the exx and uh buddy of

156
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:31,918
mine in Atlanta actually he found an

157
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:34,680
incredible keeper yeah um and it is like

158
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:35,918
you said it's it's very Zing but it's

159
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,240
got a little bit more complexity

160
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,279
underneath it's got a little bit of that

161
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:42,038
OG Funk probably getting it from its its

162
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:44,679
dosy roots right and it's got a lot more

163
00:05:42,038 --> 00:05:46,719
potency when people talk about Z forward

164
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:50,199
that is Z forward all the way like that

165
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,880
is very Z for but it's very complex it

166
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:53,879
has an amazing structure it checks the

167
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:55,399
boxes I got to try it yesterday Chris

168
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:58,639
gave me some when he drew it out and I

169
00:05:55,399 --> 00:06:00,758
was like Wow uh very exciting and I love

170
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,600
stuff that's not diet Skittles it's the

171
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:03,720
Skittles cross cuz some people like oh

172
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,720
everything you pull with Skittles is

173
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,720
better that's not true especially the

174
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,080
stuff that like where you're like ooh

175
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,360
because I can pick out a room where I'm

176
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:13,000
like okay that's Skittles that's not

177
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,120
Skittles that leans towards the other

178
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,199
parent you know what I mean because it's

179
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,478
usually the shitty structure you look at

180
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:19,000
the weakest plants with the shitty

181
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:21,680
structure and those lean heavy on the

182
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,279
skitt so it takes a lot of work and I

183
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,199
think archive has done a really good

184
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:30,119
job with that and they I've I've smoked

185
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,439
three or four different moonbo cuts that

186
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,959
are all like really special in different

187
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:36,639
ways you know that was the hardest hunt

188
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:38,478
we've ever done and also the easiest

189
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,400
hunt we've ever done yeah hardest

190
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:42,639
because there wasn't a lot of like bad

191
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:43,799
fenos they were all pretty good easiest

192
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,680
because the one that we ended up

193
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:50,000
selecting was just head and shoulders

194
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,759
yeah it was just it was that limey mouth

195
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,959
coating along with like the cushy

196
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,800
aftertaste and the strong effect I mean

197
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:57,079
it was really a well then it comes down

198
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,240
to the jar test when you have so many

199
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:00,318
good ones it's like which one did I

200
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,478
finish first

201
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,319
which one did you reach for which one

202
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:05,918
did you finish first which one was empty

203
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:08,439
first literally that is the gauge that

204
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:10,240
my crew uses which are emptied first

205
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:11,839
yeah every time I think that's uh I

206
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,439
think that's perfect because it's just

207
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:15,638
speaks to what you want to go back to

208
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,000
again authenticity right and you want

209
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:18,360
obviously you want product out there

210
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,918
that the customer feels the same way

211
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,560
about yeah like man I finished that if I

212
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:25,359
go back today you think they'll still

213
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,240
have more I hope so totally and then

214
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,960
there's a no it's like well there might

215
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,560
be more but we're not sharing it that's

216
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:34,159
the really good stuff yeah I find myself

217
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,240
holding back stuff at the end because I

218
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,360
like sharing it with my friends but

219
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,199
there's a certain amount I want to just

220
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,120
save for myself yeah right especially

221
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:41,919
with really good stuff and it doesn't

222
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,759
have to be new stuff sometimes it's

223
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:46,839
weird stuff I like strange you I I love

224
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:49,000
Super Silver Haze you know I think I got

225
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:50,598
some real Sour Diesel at re on the river

226
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,720
and you guys are very familiar with that

227
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:55,680
cut I'm sure and I love it I love it and

228
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,759
then like I I got some buds I gave a

229
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,840
little bit out to a couple different

230
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:00,280
friends and I saved the last for myself

231
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:02,359
hoping to get more this weekend at

232
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:04,439
Emerald cup okay because it's the real

233
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,520
cut and I haven't had real Sour Diesel

234
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:10,680
in forever yeah that's not common you

235
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:14,158
don't see that a lot in I see so I see a

236
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,120
lot of people give me flour say Sour

237
00:08:14,158 --> 00:08:17,199
Diesel because I talk about on my

238
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,918
podcast so much that and cat piss I've

239
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,079
gotten a couple different cat pisses

240
00:08:18,918 --> 00:08:22,799
that I haven't been super impressed with

241
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:26,758
lot of Sour Diesel that I'm like it

242
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,319
leans it's more of a chem 91 or a chmd

243
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:30,319
than a real Sour even though it looks

244
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,639
like sour it leans towards that really

245
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,519
burnt Tire Gas and even when you squeeze

246
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:38,080
it you don't get a lot of citrus and I I

247
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,599
want a a flower that punches me in the

248
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,599
face where like the real Sour when you

249
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,680
opened a bag of it it would like

250
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,200
literally pop you in the nose and you'd

251
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,399
be like wow that's amazing yeah I think

252
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,040
look I think there's a couple things

253
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:52,278
going on with sour one with a cut that's

254
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:54,759
as old and as popular of course it's

255
00:08:52,278 --> 00:08:58,120
going to have so many derivatives

256
00:08:54,759 --> 00:09:00,039
s1's I think it was an S1 we can debate

257
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,240
it but yeah I believe I believe it was a

258
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:04,000
bag seed from the Chev 91 I think a lot

259
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,159
of the old strains probably were you

260
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,440
know before there was a lot of actual

261
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:10,759
breeders that were you know deliberately

262
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,720
breeding you know you got some Bag seed

263
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:14,399
hey hell yeah let's pop this and I think

264
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,160
the other issue that sour presents that

265
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,679
it is such a difficult strain to

266
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:21,319
cultivate it is I mean it is one of

267
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:23,439
Skittles another one but I think sour is

268
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:26,200
more difficult than Skittles due to how

269
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,640
long it has to run I agree and you need

270
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,920
you need to maintain a perfect course

271
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:33,679
for over days yeah I mean it's not a lot

272
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:34,559
of there's not a lot of systems not

273
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:35,639
going to find that in commercial

274
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:37,000
production people are just aren't going

275
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:38,480
to have the time or Pati there's not a

276
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,720
lot of people that'll want to do it and

277
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,360
then because you start looking at

278
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,600
numbers right so the second you start

279
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,278
looking at numbers and you know you you

280
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,480
know that's it it's like it doesn't

281
00:09:46,278 --> 00:09:51,000
pencil out and unfortunately yeah you

282
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,720
need that cycle to turn at 63 days I

283
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,200
mean most of our selections are for that

284
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,759
so we can get five Cycles here Skittles

285
00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:00,399
is a 53 to 56 in my opinion it pulls the

286
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:02,919
best that you finishing a little bit

287
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,919
early got that going but if you look at

288
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:09,919
an extra month for sour that's wild yeah

289
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:12,199
you know 77 days or whatever or plus 77

290
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:14,319
plus I think to get personally I I

291
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,360
believe 11 or 11 to 12 weeks when I used

292
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,600
to go it was 11 to finish proper to let

293
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,839
it yeah to let it finish properly and it

294
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,360
still doesn't look like it's done at the

295
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,760
end you to keep going it still wants to

296
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,720
keep going you still getting white hairs

297
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:27,240
on the top a little bit and yeah and

298
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,399
then they finish pink a little bit you

299
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,120
know that's when you you've done it

300
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,440
right oh I don't think I've ever seen

301
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,440
that you get a little pink hairs on the

302
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,519
pistols well what happens is it dries it

303
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,639
has almost a it's their their the way

304
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:40,959
the the white ones dry is they'll dry

305
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:42,519
almost pinkish so when you're looking in

306
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:44,958
the back it's not like pink like bright

307
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:47,639
pink or anything it's like a a d red a

308
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:49,879
dull red yeah you get that with certain

309
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:51,320
genetics uh yeah and even the crosses

310
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:53,278
some of the crosses we made back in the

311
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:56,000
day with sour definitely had the they

312
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:58,399
did have pink pistols so really cool

313
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,600
pink pistols especially like when it was

314
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,679
like three in flower and you got a whole

315
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,879
bunch of pink pistols on the crosses

316
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:06,359
yeah those would always make the High

317
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:08,399
Times covers they look amazing and then

318
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,519
they go away right but they're really

319
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,679
cool yeah I mean I don't I can't say

320
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:13,759
I've had a good batch of sour since so I

321
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:17,479
went to college at humble State

322
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:19,958
University yeah um and yeah I think my

323
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,600
last batch of sour that made me go wow

324
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:24,958
was actually in 2013 yeah you know it's

325
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,360
and since then a lot of the stuff that's

326
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:29,838
come my way just like you've expressed

327
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,519
is a lot of like that burnt rubber and I

328
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,000
just remember the sour diesel having

329
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:37,799
such a citral citrus kind of brightness

330
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,839
to it along with the gas and it's got it

331
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:41,559
has to have that Citrus and it's it's

332
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,120
you don't get the nose burn from the gas

333
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:45,399
you get the nose burn from the Citrus

334
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:49,000
right it does have that file it's that

335
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:51,000
citrusy nose bur where it's not Haze but

336
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,559
it is Citrus you know because like that

337
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,360
Haze is a different thing Al together

338
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:57,559
it's completely different s's grapefruit

339
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,278
which is a New York City Diesel which is

340
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:01,039
completely different from Sour Diesel

341
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:04,200
also has like a citrus but it's a

342
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:07,199
grapefruit Citrus as opposed to like uh

343
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,959
lemony lime like I would say Haze Haze

344
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,639
goes in the more lime category and then

345
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:15,919
that sour was like a sweet lemon like

346
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,399
amazing like and and I remember for the

347
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:20,078
longest time there was only one sour

348
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:21,879
there wasn't multiple types there wasn't

349
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:25,559
a bunch of derivatives there wasn't a

350
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:27,519
bunch of ecsd it was just Sour Diesel

351
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:28,919
you know and then you know and I'm sure

352
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,360
over in New York and other places yeah

353
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:32,759
they like different names and stuff like

354
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,159
that and you know then we got the

355
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:38,039
weasel's diesel and the AJ's Diesel and

356
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:40,240
the you know all these different yeah

357
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:41,879
and humbled sours was all like sour

358
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,198
that's that's that's everyone just

359
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:47,799
called it sour you know we need sours

360
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:49,958
old guys we need sour old guys well yeah

361
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:51,479
and I think the name they came up with

362
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:53,278
the name sour because it soured

363
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,480
relationships not because it was Sour

364
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:58,198
smelling right so that's in my breeding

365
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,839
book yeah I I wanted to get to the

366
00:12:58,198 --> 00:13:02,559
bottom of it get as much information as

367
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:05,120
possible from my breeding book and get

368
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:06,518
the information as correct as possible

369
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,120
you know because no matter what there's

370
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:10,000
always going to be something sure

371
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,120
there's there's 115,000 words so we

372
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,879
didn't get it all perfect and I'm okay

373
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,399
with that but I feel like we did our due

374
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:17,120
diligence to try to get everything

375
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:18,679
correct you know I have where did that

376
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,078
where did that uh history come from in

377
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:21,239
terms of it souring relationships where

378
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:23,879
did where did you where did you find

379
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:27,839
that so I i' I actually talked to Greg

380
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:30,320
Kem dog so Greg who who is chem dog and

381
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,519
I talked to him and that I talked to

382
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,320
Mike peab and a couple other guys and

383
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:37,000
Mojave Richmond and started getting

384
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,920
stories from everybody and then I got on

385
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,679
a conference call and we kind of sorted

386
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:42,958
out what I had written and what should

387
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:45,120
be written also about the chemdog right

388
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:47,119
so like there's a case study my book has

389
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,839
case study so we went through got a good

390
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,639
case study on the sour uh Mac one which

391
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,920
is extremely special I'm not the biggest

392
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,720
fan of the Mac one for smoke but I

393
00:13:54,919 --> 00:14:00,278
absolutely think it is an important

394
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,600
genetic as far as Legacy and everything

395
00:14:00,278 --> 00:14:04,799
else like not legacy Market but Legacy

396
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,920
for cap and I feel like it's a special

397
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:09,799
one it it hit when it hit and it's it's

398
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:11,240
really special it's a partial triploid

399
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:13,799
right so it's really hard to breed with

400
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,959
it you know natural partial natural

401
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:18,519
triploid yeah and so really cool I mean

402
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,879
I get excited about these genetic things

403
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:21,919
and it's like as much of that stuff as

404
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:23,198
we could include in the book we did yeah

405
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:25,719
next version is going to have even more

406
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:27,439
stuff incred that explains why one has

407
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,839
always been hard to breed

408
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:33,720
with making phos did the study on that

409
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:36,160
and so yeah it's it's pretty cool yeah

410
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,879
making and then it's also an anomaly

411
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:39,919
because it's a lot of recessive stuff

412
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:43,879
going on with it if you look at the we I

413
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:47,159
got a Mac 69 from first class genetics

414
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:49,360
and from my buddy Ray and that was Haze

415
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:51,078
that was like Colombian tasted like

416
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,919
smoking old school Colombian it was

417
00:14:51,078 --> 00:14:54,198
really that's the dad in it right uhuh

418
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:57,319
yeah that's the miracle right so yeah

419
00:14:54,198 --> 00:14:59,198
completely the opposite um you know you

420
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:02,160
don't get that Haze in the Mac one it's

421
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:04,120
very soft a little bit of floral it's

422
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:05,319
nice it's it's it's nice it's not my

423
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,679
favorite thing in the world but it's

424
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:09,079
still really cool yeah I mean when that

425
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:10,799
one took off I mean that you want to

426
00:15:09,078 --> 00:15:13,599
talk about a wave like a new wave that

427
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:15,879
was a wave you know what I mean almost I

428
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,320
remember seeing capulator at Emerald cup

429
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:21,720
and there was like a line like over 100

430
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,720
feet just like Santa yep with 100 foot

431
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,199
long line for people and he spends time

432
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,000
with everybody and you know it's great

433
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:29,039
that's beautiful yeah I love seeing guys

434
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,919
in the industry that care about the

435
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:32,519
people that buy their product and you

436
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:36,159
that show love to the people that show

437
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:37,759
love to them yeah 100% yeah I've been uh

438
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:40,439
lucky enough to have a conversation with

439
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,879
Fletcher and yeah I felt like most of

440
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,519
the time we were actually I grow a lot

441
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:46,278
of other stuff in my backyard a lot of

442
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,560
citrus avocados nice and when I realized

443
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:50,600
that we spent most of the time talking

444
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:52,239
about Citrus yeah I was like I you know

445
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,040
there's a there's a certain love that

446
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,720
you need to have for plants in general

447
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:58,519
cultivation that I think you know really

448
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,720
uh makes you the best cannabis grower

449
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:03,078
period right when you can go a little

450
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,519
bit outside of just this plant that we

451
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:07,679
all really do love so much and when I

452
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,799
see like such a deep love for plants and

453
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:10,879
other breeders I'm like I think that's

454
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:13,159
that's probably why I've always

455
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:16,000
gravitated to his work so much because

456
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:18,278
for sure appreciation for flavor that

457
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,919
goes beyond cannabis and the magic of

458
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:21,600
what plants can do well and I think

459
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:23,838
there's you got to have a drive to keep

460
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,399
on improving right because I I think a

461
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,880
lot of people they they let learn how to

462
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:28,399
grow and then they just stop at a

463
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,159
certain point and like that's that's

464
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,318
what they do they found their way and

465
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:34,360
that's that's the end of it's the guys

466
00:16:32,318 --> 00:16:36,120
who are like how can I make this better

467
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,919
and they've been doing it for 20 years

468
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,318
still like how can I make it better

469
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:40,759
those are the best guys out there you

470
00:16:39,318 --> 00:16:43,120
know and same thing with breeders it's

471
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:45,639
like the guys who haven't figured it all

472
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,360
out and are willing to experiment and

473
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:49,839
and still have passion about it because

474
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,079
you know you get beat up a lot in this

475
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,839
industry so you got to have passion that

476
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:55,679
goes beyond money you know it's like cuz

477
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,480
there's other things you can do to make

478
00:16:55,679 --> 00:17:00,559
money out there but a lot of us this is

479
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,879
what we meant to do you know nothing

480
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:04,279
more than this and it's it's what we

481
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:06,078
love doing it's what we love talking

482
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:08,558
about it we love love everything about

483
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:09,879
it we eat sleep and breathe it and you

484
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:11,480
know it's like I have random

485
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,480
conversations with people at airports

486
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,640
about cannabis and you know we start

487
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,120
talking about stuff and next thing we're

488
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,439
talking about flower we're talking about

489
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,479
this or we're talking about rosin and

490
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:22,160
it's like you can tell kind of Who's Who

491
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,199
and you know who's who's doing what I

492
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,120
mean absolutely not everybody has the

493
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:28,600
look but you can kind of tell yeah I

494
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:29,918
mean I look or the smell I was in I was

495
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:31,759
actually in nursing school before I

496
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,679
jumped into the industry oh wow and I

497
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:36,519
had so much guilt about just this wealth

498
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:39,400
of cannabis knowledge that I had you

499
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:42,359
know um I've been smoking since I was 15

500
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:46,120
16 yeah um I started growing when I

501
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:47,839
moved up to humbal um and I just I just

502
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:49,399
loved it you know I loved it I was

503
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:51,599
talking to Tom a little about earlier

504
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,200
The Strain made me fall in love with

505
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:54,839
cannabis was blueberry I remember my

506
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,840
first batch I I got a blue was Oregon

507
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:58,918
blue R was it DJ show it was it was

508
00:17:56,839 --> 00:18:01,439
coming up from Humble I don't know what

509
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:04,080
the name was I mean I was only 16 17 at

510
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,320
the time um and it was like the first

511
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:08,439
non-generic smelling cannabis that I had

512
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:10,158
gotten and I just remember being like

513
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,679
why does it smell like this what did

514
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:12,880
they do to make it smell like this and

515
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,600
that was like the moment where I was

516
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:18,000
like I want to know everything yeah

517
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:19,798
about this plant and you know such a

518
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,599
magical smell you know it's a strain

519
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:23,400
that will always have a special place in

520
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:25,158
my heart for that reason so what was the

521
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,600
guilt what's what's the guilt so the

522
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:29,280
guilt was that like I was in nursing

523
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:30,959
school man and I was just like I like

524
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:32,599
you can do so much more with your life

525
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,120
it wasn't no it wasn't that it was that

526
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:37,000
like I have all this knowledge about

527
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:39,678
strains where they came from who bred

528
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,720
them like I cared so much yeah but I was

529
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,360
like I'm holding on to all this

530
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,679
information that's not going to do

531
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:47,719
anything for me not being the torch

532
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,640
Bearer for all that information is not

533
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,440
just like why do I care so much about

534
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,480
something that's not not part of the

535
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,038
career that I'm going into you know what

536
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,798
I mean and it was just like it was just

537
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:59,359
I just carried all this like guilt for

538
00:18:57,798 --> 00:19:02,240
all this like I couldn't talk about this

539
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:04,119
to the people in my program like you

540
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,960
know what I mean like this was still

541
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:07,678
very

542
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,360
much a place where yeah I wouldn't talk

543
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,400
about smoking I wouldn't talk about can

544
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:12,918
it's all I wanted to talk about right

545
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,320
but you know I was around these people

546
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:15,840
where I was like I can't talk about it

547
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,519
ever you know what I mean and there

548
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,038
might even come a day where I I'm going

549
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:22,558
to get tested and all this stuff so it

550
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:24,440
was a really that part was really tricky

551
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:27,399
and then I just kind of slipped into the

552
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:29,320
industry and I just I dropped out it was

553
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,679
actually right during Co when I Dro it

554
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:34,480
was in in March I finished that semester

555
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:36,360
and I said you know Co was really good

556
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,000
for cannabis it was really I mean I was

557
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:40,599
this every time someone says Co I'm like

558
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,759
Co was actually really good yeah it was

559
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:44,359
great if you weren't making money drink

560
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:45,720
Co you were doing something wrong

561
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:48,558
something was like you shouldn't be

562
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,960
doing cannabis because I feel like all

563
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:52,599
my friends really killed it durink co we

564
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,640
had our biggest year yet yeah I had my

565
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:57,158
biggest year of my life yeah

566
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,720
100% out smoking weed I thought it was

567
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:00,799
going to be one of the worst years but

568
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,200
was one of the best years and and it's

569
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:03,918
funny that's another one where it's like

570
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,159
it looks bad and then you get through it

571
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,360
and you're like wow that was amazing

572
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,080
well I mean look at how many people

573
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:12,038
absolutely lost everything during Co and

574
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:14,960
you know dispensaries were essential

575
00:20:12,038 --> 00:20:16,599
businesses you had liquor stores Canabis

576
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,319
Shops and and grocery stores that were

577
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:20,759
open during during Co yeah and

578
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:23,279
everyone's at home everyone's at home to

579
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:25,319
do they smoking drinking you know hang

580
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:28,678
col their checks you know doing that

581
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:29,519
remote work and uh yeah Co was great so

582
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:31,440
it's interesting that you would have

583
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:34,158
made that switch during Co yeah I mean

584
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,798
it just it was it was you know I kind of

585
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,240
I had a little I had a little Instagram

586
00:20:35,798 --> 00:20:40,079
page where I was I started growing at

587
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,759
home again and that's always been my

588
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:45,720
love right my love has always been um so

589
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:48,599
I have a minor in chemistry and the lab

590
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:52,079
work right the the importance of doing a

591
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:54,759
small experiment with highly

592
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:56,359
controllable um inputs in order to

593
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:59,038
expand that to a larger thing was

594
00:20:56,359 --> 00:21:01,399
something that I always loved and so I I

595
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:03,480
like to keep my growing small scale for

596
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:07,360
that reason you know easy to manage easy

597
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:10,000
to turn uh easy to know what's changing

598
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:11,519
and what isn't and that's when beanock

599
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,278
had reached out to me and they were like

600
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:15,720
hey we love your page you know do you

601
00:21:13,278 --> 00:21:18,440
want to grow with a granular style

602
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:21,679
fertilizer and I was like

603
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:23,679
no a word no I have a minor in chemistry

604
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,440
I'm pretty sure I can mix nutrients fine

605
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,798
like I don't I don't need a granular

606
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,798
style fertilizer it's another one of

607
00:21:27,798 --> 00:21:30,400
those things that I think is

608
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:32,240
counterintuitive to a lot of people

609
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,840
right it is especially in this industry

610
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,359
in this industry people are like no I

611
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:37,439
need to do all these things and

612
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:39,158
sometimes it's a lot more simple yeah so

613
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,038
as you well know you've been working

614
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:43,919
with beanock for a while right yeah I

615
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:45,839
think that uh we I think we got turned

616
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:48,480
on you guys through Nelson I think he

617
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:51,439
was the the gateway drug there um he

618
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:54,079
said first Hits free and that was it um

619
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,720
so yeah it was about 5 years ago um that

620
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:58,599
and you know my team looked at me like

621
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,798
are you [ __ ] crazy nobody was uh on

622
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:01,839
Bard with the idea at all but you know I

623
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:04,200
you know you were mentioning a moment

624
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:06,359
ago you know the idea of just sort of

625
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,960
that Relentless pursuit of refining

626
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:10,959
things and testing and and and you know

627
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,200
that's good but we can do it better

628
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,640
right that works but maybe we can do it

629
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,759
cheaper that works but maybe we can you

630
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:20,240
know create a hybrid model and that's

631
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:21,839
that's essentially what we did I mean we

632
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,880
uh we start you know we were we've grown

633
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:25,879
in soil forever soil has been you know

634
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,039
our our medium and it's it's what we're

635
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,320
you know it's what we it's the hill

636
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:32,519
we'll die on yeah but it's all you know

637
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:34,839
organic inputs um top dresses compost

638
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:36,200
teas and and when I looked at my you

639
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:37,678
know lead grower and I was like Hey

640
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,798
we're going to try some beanock he's

641
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,960
like what I was like yeah let's just do

642
00:22:39,798 --> 00:22:43,119
some experiments we'll start small and

643
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,159
we'll just see where it goes yeah so

644
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:47,000
we're all about just you know testing

645
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:51,080
retesting testing retesting and seeing

646
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,679
what works and uh and beanock um it was

647
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:55,798
it was a big surprise to everybody big

648
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:57,679
surprise to everybody and you know we've

649
00:22:55,798 --> 00:23:00,720
we've tried about every configuration

650
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,159
with bean stock with our organic inputs

651
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:06,240
and we've you know we've landed on a

652
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:07,320
hybrid model that um that just works

653
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,240
yeah it's amazing when you find

654
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:11,000
something that works especially

655
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,480
something that like people like how the

656
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
heck did that happen yeah maybe we

657
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,640
should rewind and talk a little bit

658
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,919
about what the product is for those

659
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,799
who've never heard of it maybe I think

660
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:21,640
that' be great so yeah so so what

661
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:23,918
beanock is it's a it's a granular style

662
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:26,120
fertilizer um that was specifically

663
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,640
formulated to be used with cannabis and

664
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:30,359
the idea came from a very simple premise

665
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,200
you look at horiculture outside of

666
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:34,839
cannabis and granular style fertilizers

667
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:38,640
are dominant yeah not by a little but by

668
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:40,599
a lot right they the majority of uh

669
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,200
large Horticultural applications are

670
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:45,158
using like a grainless especially in the

671
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:47,519
cut flow industry yeah and so from

672
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:49,360
inception our Founders were you know

673
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:52,079
like okay well if this can work for

674
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:55,158
other plants how can we make it work for

675
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:57,480
cannabis um and so we use a cating that

676
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:59,559
was initially developed by NASA to be

677
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,880
used on the ISS

678
00:23:59,558 --> 00:24:03,359
um but what is special about the coating

679
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,919
and that makes our product different to

680
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:10,319
other granular style fertilizers is that

681
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:11,880
it is activated by irrigation events so

682
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:14,839
the coating is composed of a bunch of

683
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:17,278
micro micropores that open up when the

684
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:19,519
plant is watered um it seems like a

685
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:20,679
simple change but in actuality in

686
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:22,599
practice it actually makes a big

687
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:24,519
difference you're growing Outdoors

688
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:25,759
you're having hot days that means that

689
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:27,240
your plants are going to be drinking

690
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:29,319
more our fertilizer is going to be

691
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,159
releasing more a lot of traditional

692
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:34,000
granular style fertilizers on the market

693
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:37,039
they offer a like a polyurethane coating

694
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,720
or a polyethylene microplastic coating

695
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:41,200
and it dissolves you're kind of locked

696
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,200
into a daily payload and then when the

697
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,360
heat gets to a certain point it'll just

698
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,159
break down right fertility dump and

699
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:49,879
roast all your plants um so we needed

700
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,520
something a little bit more high-tech

701
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,880
that's how we found the coating

702
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:54,879
eventually we had to play with

703
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,960
formulations it started out as an

704
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,840
all-in-one when we realized that that

705
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,720
wasn't going to work we separate ated

706
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:04,240
our product into four lines or four

707
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:06,360
products two lines we have our Bloom

708
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,038
line which is composed of three products

709
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:10,199
it's our absolute flower that's the

710
00:25:08,038 --> 00:25:12,480
flagship product has all your Macros and

711
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,080
micros and we have a k boost which is

712
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,960
pretty simple it's just potassium

713
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:17,639
magnesium and sulfur and we have our

714
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,679
calcium fortify which is just calcium

715
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:22,440
nitrate nice those three together make

716
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,840
up our Bloom mix um it's really easy to

717
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,720
use that's what you'll see here in these

718
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:28,359
little pouches is those three products

719
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:30,079
premixed this is for this is a product

720
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:32,079
that we made for the hom grower someone

721
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:33,480
who's just growing a couple plants you

722
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:35,439
take one of those rip it open throw it

723
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:37,640
in a 5 gallon pot it'll give you two

724
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,919
weeks of Edge and up to 10 weeks of

725
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:42,038
flour with one dose nice and simple and

726
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,759
then our other product is an all-in-one

727
00:25:42,038 --> 00:25:46,038
product but it's only for mothers and

728
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:49,440
Nursery stock just for your veg plants

729
00:25:46,038 --> 00:25:52,398
really easy to use 25 grams per gallon

730
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:55,200
um and it's meant to be used with that

731
00:25:52,398 --> 00:25:57,079
dosage the 25 gam per gallon dosage is

732
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,240
mainly for Cocoa core or Pete Moss

733
00:25:57,079 --> 00:26:00,240
something that's very lightly amended

734
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:08,519
Amed Tom he our in a way that's

735
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:10,759
very not married to synthetics he's not

736
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:12,240
married to Organics yeah um and he has a

737
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:13,960
really unique use case where he's not

738
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,319
using it at full strength or even close

739
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:19,440
to full strength but that's fine right

740
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:22,119
because as a grower myself you know the

741
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,038
biggest my thing I care about the most

742
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:26,278
is am I helping other Growers am I

743
00:26:24,038 --> 00:26:28,359
helping other people be successful you

744
00:26:26,278 --> 00:26:30,200
know the fact that people's livelihood

745
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:31,678
are going to be staked on you know the

746
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,360
product that I'm selling isn't lost on

747
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,080
me sure that's actually something means

748
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:37,199
a lot to me and so to have the

749
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:39,480
opportunity if someone like Tom whose

750
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,200
team has been so creative in their

751
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,640
application of the product and share

752
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,038
that with other people I think is is

753
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,200
really exciting for me yeah it's really

754
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:49,679
cool yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so

755
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,319
how long has beanock been around oh man

756
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:54,080
so it's been around for it's been around

757
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:56,000
for a while I think we're going on 7

758
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:58,599
years now it originally had a different

759
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,440
name and had a completely different set

760
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:05,079
of owners initially um and that's where

761
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,600
the current owner and they pitched it to

762
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:08,798
the current owner and they said hey you

763
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:12,240
know this is a product you want to be

764
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:15,960
involved um he's not a cannabis guy yeah

765
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,839
but he seemed interesting enough um yeah

766
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,840
this looks interesting you know like saw

767
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:21,798
the potential saw the potential worked

768
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:24,558
with a couple consultants in the

769
00:27:21,798 --> 00:27:27,158
industry um and the Consultants kind of

770
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:30,839
help reformulate the product and get it

771
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:32,679
into the state that it's now um and that

772
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:35,240
was the Inception was I believe seven

773
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:37,200
years ago um and the new team has been

774
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:40,240
running with it for about five years and

775
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,200
I jumped on board in 2022 was when I

776
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,558
jumped on board nice like I said they

777
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,600
reached out to me via Instagram yeah I

778
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:49,200
initially was pretty stuck up you know

779
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:50,759
like I don't need I don't need granules

780
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,960
to grow my cannabis I know what I'm

781
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:57,000
doing they kept kind of bugging me uh

782
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:58,640
Nelson actually offered me some flour I

783
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,038
went up to Santa Rosa got some of the

784
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:04,799
flower and I was like hey this is this

785
00:28:02,038 --> 00:28:07,480
is better than I was expecting yeah um

786
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:09,440
and then's pretty convincing he you know

787
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,880
he I think if you if you'll talk to him

788
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,519
about his conversations with me yeah

789
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,880
he's never had an easy time convincing

790
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:18,200
me right I think that's that's part of

791
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:20,760
our relationship is that I've never I

792
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:23,840
look I'm a very data driven person sure

793
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:25,359
um my formal education has led me to be

794
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:26,759
just like a very very evidence-driven

795
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:28,278
person that's how I like to make my

796
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:31,000
decisions

797
00:28:28,278 --> 00:28:33,720
um and when I tried the flower you know

798
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,398
to be totally honest it was a lot

799
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,960
harsher than anything that I would call

800
00:28:35,398 --> 00:28:41,439
acceptable right but he was like Hey Hey

801
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:43,278
I pulled this at 56 days like I didn't

802
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,720
like I didn't even attempt to like flush

803
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:46,558
it this was like a quick and dirty feno

804
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,240
hunt and I was like well that checks out

805
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:51,678
it definitely just tastes like it's very

806
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,000
high in nitrogen you know what I mean um

807
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:56,720
but it was enough to be like I wonder

808
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:59,480
what I could do with this so I did it

809
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,200
and my first batch you know my regular

810
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:04,038
clients hey did you do something

811
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,399
different this time it's really good and

812
00:29:04,038 --> 00:29:08,278
my ego was so shot you know what I mean

813
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:10,479
to think my first time growing with

814
00:29:08,278 --> 00:29:13,839
these granules was the least work I had

815
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:16,319
ever done and my customers were stoked

816
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:18,158
you know and I was just like oh my God

817
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:20,319
like what you know I really was

818
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,519
expecting to hear something else I

819
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:24,678
really wasn't expecting right to get all

820
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:26,798
this praise and then the wheel started

821
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:28,559
turning and I said yeah you know what I

822
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:29,960
think I'm I'm I'm going to keep rocking

823
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:32,918
with this product I want to see how far

824
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:34,759
I can push it and that turned into a job

825
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:36,038
opportunity and that's when I dropped

826
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:38,440
out of nursing school and I was like you

827
00:29:36,038 --> 00:29:40,759
know I'd be I'd be silly to not take the

828
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:43,120
opportunity to go work for we're still

829
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:46,000
very much a smartup startup we're still

830
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:49,079
pretty small company yeah and I'm from

831
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,398
the bay area right company too right we

832
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:55,319
are we are um in a sense that a lot of a

833
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:58,518
lot of our R&amp;D was in Santa Rosa but

834
00:29:55,319 --> 00:30:00,519
everything is stored in Florida like our

835
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:03,319
major Warehouse is in Florida all of our

836
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:04,759
operations are in Florida but um you

837
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:07,158
know a lot of our research and

838
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:09,519
development did happen right here in in

839
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:11,679
the Bay Area so or Santa Rose is close

840
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:13,240
enough to the Bay Area but yeah yeah it

841
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,278
feels like the Bay Area to me even

842
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:17,120
though it's a little North but yeah yeah

843
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:18,798
yeah yeah for sure so yeah it's been

844
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:20,000
it's been a great run with them so far I

845
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:22,519
mean it's a product that I really

846
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,880
believe in um you know Tom and I were

847
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:28,038
talking earlier about you know a lot of

848
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:30,320
individuals approach to cannabis and how

849
00:30:28,038 --> 00:30:32,640
dogmatic some individuals can be but we

850
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:34,759
really feel that there's there's so many

851
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,000
ways you know to cultivate and to

852
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:39,879
cultivate highquality product sure I

853
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,398
just want to have a solution that works

854
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:44,559
for some people and works well right I

855
00:30:42,398 --> 00:30:46,439
don't believe that there is one

856
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:48,558
fertilizer that solves everyone's

857
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:51,080
problem no if there was everyone would

858
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:53,079
produce the same exact thing or there

859
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:55,000
would only be one company and and it's

860
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:57,720
not that it's not the case and I think

861
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,759
there's also different demands right as

862
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:02,600
far far as what customers want 100% and

863
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:03,839
what people are willing to pay and

864
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:05,079
there's so yeah there's different price

865
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:07,278
points for everybody and there's

866
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:09,119
different quality products and what one

867
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:10,599
person considers quality is different

868
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:13,319
than what another person and different

869
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:14,759
markets too like Oregon as opposed to

870
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:17,599
Los Angeles I mean I think those are two

871
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:20,119
different markets um Instagram has a

872
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:22,359
huge oh my go impact unfortunately I

873
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:24,158
think some of it's bad too like people

874
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:25,599
want it to look a certain way and

875
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,278
sometimes they're like well that's not

876
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:29,119
good CU it doesn't look right and

877
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:31,319
sometimes the ugly weed is the best weed

878
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:32,719
100% magazine weed and all of a sudden

879
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:34,918
it's like where's that

880
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,960
flavor some of those ugly ducklings can

881
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:40,320
just be absolutely packed yeah so for

882
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:42,038
sure wild I feel like the best batches

883
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:44,720
of cannabis I've ever had have never

884
00:31:42,038 --> 00:31:47,720
been the ultra dense it's always like a

885
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,720
little bit spaced out a little bit you

886
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:52,639
know nothing that would indicate an

887
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:54,519
unhealthy plant sure um but yeah it's

888
00:31:52,638 --> 00:31:56,439
definitely but not hard ball never the

889
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:58,480
hard ball has never for flavor

890
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,960
especially yeah yeah yeah

891
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,159
well everything those bracks get pushed

892
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:04,319
together and everything's so tight and

893
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:06,240
then you know I I just feel like it

894
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:08,240
takes away from the turps yeah takes

895
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,638
away from the flavor profile yeah you

896
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,120
know I think there's even you know

897
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:14,158
speaking of flavor I think there's a lot

898
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:18,678
to be looked at in that regard right how

899
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:21,159
the physical structure of the plant um

900
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:23,200
leads to a better combustion and

901
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:26,039
therefore a better flavor experience

902
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,960
right I mean how much lipids are present

903
00:32:26,038 --> 00:32:32,200
in a strain and how the combustion of

904
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,200
those lipids can create an unpleasant or

905
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,399
a pleasant exper like there's still so

906
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,639
much there's so much that we need to Fig

907
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:40,398
we all talk about TPS where's the talk

908
00:32:38,638 --> 00:32:42,398
about Esters oh yeah you know what I

909
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:44,079
mean well we can talk about THS we can

910
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:47,239
talk about I mean I guess the new term

911
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:49,359
is flavorant yes so yeah the abstracts

912
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:51,638
tech they they released a bunch of white

913
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:52,918
papers on that you know I think it's

914
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:55,678
really cool and they're breaking down

915
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:57,399
the different flavorant and and files

916
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:59,720
and how they break break down and it's

917
00:32:57,398 --> 00:33:01,719
like it's great when companies start

918
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,360
going after that information is

919
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,639
flavorant a technical term now that's

920
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:08,000
being used it is now yeah not that I've

921
00:33:05,638 --> 00:33:10,359
heard I've never heard that term yeah so

922
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,319
so abstract Tech yeah I mean I think uh

923
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:14,759
I reposted some stuff that they've

924
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:16,558
they've had but I think this falls under

925
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:19,079
the category of THS right which are

926
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:21,678
smaller molecules than tur sufur based

927
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:23,879
compound compound y exactly sulfur based

928
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:27,080
compounds right and so and that's what

929
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:29,440
gives the skunk its skunky smell and the

930
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:31,519
gas it's gas smell and you know some of

931
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,480
the like ammonia I'm sure that's where

932
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:36,200
the ammonia comes from y that's going be

933
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:38,480
nitrate based but but yeah even the

934
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:41,038
Citrus not all of it comes from tpin

935
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,599
right so like they have there's a good

936
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:45,359
explanation much better than I can

937
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:46,879
explain right now but like uh yeah we'll

938
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:48,638
post it up on the screen so everybody

939
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,278
can check it out but it's really

940
00:33:48,638 --> 00:33:51,879
interesting and I love when companies

941
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:54,159
are just trying to take it to that next

942
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:55,799
level and you know it's with with

943
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,278
research and development you go in a

944
00:33:55,798 --> 00:33:58,519
direction and you hope to get a result

945
00:33:57,278 --> 00:33:59,919
and sometimes you don't get the result

946
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:01,839
you're looking for and you have to take

947
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:04,360
a step back and that's okay I mean

948
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:07,798
that's the beauty ofar you know I was

949
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:11,039
seeing the thing on Dyson uh he he made

950
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:12,960
I think 5,000 inferior copies before he

951
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:14,838
made his first vacuum right his real the

952
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,358
real one that that everybody he was

953
00:34:14,838 --> 00:34:19,039
hanging from a nail just before he broke

954
00:34:16,358 --> 00:34:20,398
through yeah like mortgage's house like

955
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:22,358
then all of a sudden he he cracked the

956
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:23,918
Cod right and and that's sometimes

957
00:34:22,358 --> 00:34:27,319
that's what it takes it just takes not

958
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:29,158
giving up falling down getting back up

959
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,760
uh you know as many times as it takes

960
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:33,720
and it's like it's a mindset too yeah I

961
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,520
mean I think part of the mindset is

962
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:37,559
knowing that just because your

963
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:39,719
experiment didn't prove what it's set

964
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:41,599
out to prove doesn't mean that it was a

965
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:44,199
failure right that's the mindset right

966
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:46,039
as did you learn something 100% then

967
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:48,960
it's not a failure right then now you

968
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:52,079
just have more Direction on where to go

969
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,960
next time well yeah and I think a lot of

970
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,200
data collection is data points that you

971
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:58,000
can compare so like the more data points

972
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:59,598
you have the more you can understand

973
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,679
something whether it's a cult of our and

974
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:04,200
you want to know how it performs under

975
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:06,319
this type of circumstance uh in this

976
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:08,279
environment you know the the more

977
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,240
information you have the better you can

978
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:13,480
make decisions yeah your educated guest

979
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:15,639
becomes that much more educated for sure

980
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:18,119
I think a lot of this hinges on data

981
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:20,440
collection disciplined data collection

982
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:23,358
organized data collection yeah and being

983
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:25,280
able to make an observation off of that

984
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:27,319
because at the end of the day as a

985
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:30,200
scientist what you're trying to do is

986
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:32,640
make observation in the most calculated

987
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:34,239
informed way possible right um and so

988
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:37,358
like seeing what you're doing out you

989
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:40,118
know out here with 57 data points per

990
00:35:37,358 --> 00:35:42,000
seedling James that's so cool yeah but I

991
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:44,320
think that's what's necessary to move

992
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,358
everything forward and to get as much

993
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,880
data as possible you know and then as

994
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:52,799
far as for breeding the more data you

995
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:54,800
have the better you can make decisions

996
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,680
um and then over multiple Generations

997
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,000
when we're doing inbreeding right and

998
00:35:56,679 --> 00:36:02,879
then we know we're looking for right and

999
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:05,079
it's stuff that I I guess I I I'm going

1000
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,760
to be able to Train everybody to to

1001
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:08,400
understand everything that's that's the

1002
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:10,400
Hope right right now I'm doing a lot of

1003
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,280
it but uh you know we're working with

1004
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,760
phenome one uh from phenome networks

1005
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,160
it's a software program and they have

1006
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,599
photop which you'll be able to take your

1007
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:20,838
iPad out in the field and you'll be able

1008
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:22,079
to go through those 50 data points not

1009
00:36:20,838 --> 00:36:23,400
all of them but like because some of

1010
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,960
them are like we're measuring the plant

1011
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,920
how fast it grows at week one and

1012
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,280
measuring it you know stuff like that is

1013
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,880
that sof is that the software that's

1014
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:32,400
going to be available or is available it

1015
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:34,358
is available now it's not cheap but it

1016
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,280
is amazing especially for breeding and

1017
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:38,239
then you us field that's what we use

1018
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:40,960
here yeah and also we're a hub so we

1019
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:42,719
have other locations and we're going to

1020
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:45,679
be taking those locations collecting

1021
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:46,879
data how it performs in one cultivar so

1022
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:49,318
then we look at how it performs in

1023
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,039
different places also one seed crop so

1024
00:36:49,318 --> 00:36:54,279
we look at the whole seed crop rather

1025
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:55,920
than just one phenotype so you can do a

1026
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:58,160
whole bunch of really interesting stuff

1027
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:01,119
you know especially I I do flower so

1028
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:03,879
you're not keeping any of those alive in

1029
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:05,680
Clone form or tissue culture as of yet

1030
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:08,559
so we need to get the data on the whole

1031
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:10,118
field right or the whole room right and

1032
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:13,119
then we can we can look at it and then

1033
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:15,480
we can get averages oh man for your

1034
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:17,400
typical feno hunts what how many

1035
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,318
cultivars are you working and or how

1036
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:22,358
many you know different fenos you you

1037
00:37:19,318 --> 00:37:24,838
doing at any given time it really

1038
00:37:22,358 --> 00:37:28,199
depends uh on on what we're doing

1039
00:37:24,838 --> 00:37:31,199
whether it's you know I mean I think

1040
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:32,879
I like to go through a hundred sometimes

1041
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:34,838
but I if I know the line really well I

1042
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,160
don't need a 100 I know that I if I find

1043
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:38,318
20 I'm going to find what I'm looking

1044
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:39,879
for in some of the lines that I work and

1045
00:37:38,318 --> 00:37:43,759
some of the things that we do I don't

1046
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:45,480
know and so in those instances you know

1047
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,280
and is is it going to be for a field

1048
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,358
application am I trying to sell seeds of

1049
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,240
this or am I trying to sell a a

1050
00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:53,559
phenotype right because if I'm trying to

1051
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:55,279
sell a clone of it I don't keep that

1052
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:56,559
seed start alive I don't even feno hunt

1053
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,119
that I get rid of it completely it's

1054
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:00,159
like if it's stuff that we plan on

1055
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:02,358
licensing what we do is we get rid of

1056
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:04,559
that clone start completely right and I

1057
00:38:02,358 --> 00:38:06,078
clone it and then we grow the Clone out

1058
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:07,960
and we start our pheno hunt from that

1059
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,160
point because there's no point in

1060
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,559
looking at something that you're not

1061
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:13,598
going to get in my opinion you know it's

1062
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:15,639
like let's just get away we save time we

1063
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,079
save money and now we're starting with

1064
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:18,400
something that gives us an actual

1065
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:20,839
picture of what the end product is going

1066
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,240
to look like I think that's so important

1067
00:38:20,838 --> 00:38:25,559
those little steps but now if I was

1068
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:28,358
going to take and sell 30,000 seeds to a

1069
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:30,039
farmer of that right I femin seeds that

1070
00:38:28,358 --> 00:38:31,799
I really like I need to know what

1071
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:33,358
happens in the field we can't just throw

1072
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,440
out those seed starts we need to grow

1073
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:37,159
them out and see what they do outside

1074
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,800
right and so growing it indoors doesn't

1075
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:41,199
really matter right because we want to

1076
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,039
know inner sex expression what that's

1077
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:46,118
the big one right like it does doesn't

1078
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:47,920
cause a much Herm if I sell 30,000 seeds

1079
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:49,559
how many Herms do we get what what is

1080
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,400
the percentage or you know what I mean

1081
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:53,599
or if you you know we can't hunt that

1082
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,318
big let's say we do 100 do we get one

1083
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:57,640
out of 100 do we get two out of 100 do

1084
00:38:55,318 --> 00:39:00,039
we get zero you know but the more more

1085
00:38:57,639 --> 00:39:01,400
you work with especially at scale the

1086
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:03,920
better picture you get of what's going

1087
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:05,559
to happen but from climate to climate

1088
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,200
you can have two completely different

1089
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:09,838
results what what is there a a certain

1090
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:11,480
percentage of Herms that you feel is

1091
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:14,039
acceptable when you're talking about

1092
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,719
that large a denominator absolutely so

1093
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:18,599
like with autof flowers I feel like one

1094
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:21,639
in a thousand is very acceptable um you

1095
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:24,359
know and then one one in a 2,000 or

1096
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:26,960
3,000 you might find a full-blown male

1097
00:39:24,358 --> 00:39:30,119
in there right but it also depends on

1098
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:32,880
the envir if you have like if you have

1099
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:34,720
soil that's not properly amended and

1100
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:38,079
that that we have or area that's

1101
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:40,318
extremely hot or extremely cold outdoor

1102
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:41,680
cultivation specifically specifically

1103
00:39:40,318 --> 00:39:43,719
you know but like and that that's where

1104
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:45,519
you the Herm is I mean obviously people

1105
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:47,399
aren't growing a thousand seeds indoors

1106
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:48,920
typically they're going to do clone yeah

1107
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,160
right but outdoor where people do grow

1108
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:52,838
from seed I think especially with

1109
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:56,039
Autoflower like one in a thousand's very

1110
00:39:52,838 --> 00:39:58,519
acceptable uh but then the more stress

1111
00:39:56,039 --> 00:40:00,159
type scenarios are going to cause more

1112
00:39:58,519 --> 00:40:02,880
Herms so you're going to get more inner

1113
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:04,879
sex expression the you know you stress

1114
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,079
the plant out and you're going to cause

1115
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:10,318
whe whether it's heat whether it's

1116
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:12,000
fluctuations uh whether it's nutrition

1117
00:40:10,318 --> 00:40:14,679
you know there's so many variables that

1118
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,838
can cause it uh and then same thing with

1119
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:19,078
photo periods I mean the thing is is

1120
00:40:16,838 --> 00:40:21,440
like feminized people think a lot of

1121
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:24,119
times like well feminized have more of a

1122
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:27,039
chance of inner sex expressions for

1123
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:28,720
hermaphrodites and I find that not to be

1124
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:32,239
the case Cas in most situations I think

1125
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:34,279
they it can be bred in or bred out uh

1126
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:35,879
it's it's patience and sometimes I will

1127
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,720
release stuff in seed form that has

1128
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:40,920
interex traits I talk about it all the

1129
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:43,318
time uh Mike from exotic because I was

1130
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:45,440
very ad a lot of exotic gear yeah and so

1131
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:47,440
I was very adamant about not selling

1132
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:50,200
anything that had any INX Expressions

1133
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:52,440
tell I talked to Mike and Mike convinced

1134
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:54,639
me otherwise he's like well out of all

1135
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:57,800
the stuff you've popped yeah have you

1136
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:59,279
kept anything that some of

1137
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,839
Express and he's like some of the best

1138
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:04,280
stuff out there has interex expression

1139
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:06,960
Herms absolutely and if you have 10

1140
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:08,880
seeds and two of them Herm but eight of

1141
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,519
them don't yeah and you find the winner

1142
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,119
in that eight who cares as long as you

1143
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:14,318
let you know I feel like for me it's

1144
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:16,680
like awareness letting people know sure

1145
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:18,199
absolutely absolutely we run uh a bunch

1146
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:19,879
of his stuff and some of our favorite

1147
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:21,519
cuts of his they they do Herm

1148
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:23,079
periodically and we just accept it

1149
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:25,639
because it's so fire dude there's some

1150
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:27,440
stuff his especially oh yeah rainbow

1151
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:29,598
cakes is one of our favorites and it

1152
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,240
just a Herms so his his red runs I

1153
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:33,280
haven't had any problems with Herms but

1154
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:34,679
his red runs is something special so I

1155
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,160
really like the red pop right like I

1156
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:37,719
like the red pop that then the smoke was

1157
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:40,440
a little bit of a let down just like a

1158
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:42,439
purple punch M purple punch is a little

1159
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:45,119
disappointing to me like I I love the

1160
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:47,760
way it grows I love the way it smells

1161
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:50,440
smells extract is fine it's it's not bad

1162
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,839
it's not amazing but it's not it's not

1163
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:55,639
bad yeah but then you go to smoke a

1164
00:41:52,838 --> 00:41:56,920
joint of it and you light it up it just

1165
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:59,679
it doesn't taste like anything tast like

1166
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:02,519
paper yeah exactly you get like the hay

1167
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:04,399
taste and it's like might as well smoke

1168
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:06,239
tobacco something like that you know I

1169
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,200
mean that's how I feel about I'm like I

1170
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:11,279
just I get more enjoyment out of tobacco

1171
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:14,759
than I do out of smoking purple punch um

1172
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,160
but that red pop it has the all the

1173
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:19,640
beauty that you need it gets that runs

1174
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:22,598
in there with so so the red pop is sorry

1175
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:24,239
the red pop is like a so it tastes like

1176
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:25,760
Cherry Cola is that the one that the

1177
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:27,598
popping bottles is from is that or is

1178
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,599
that different I'm not sure bottles is

1179
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:31,240
one that we're just you know hunting

1180
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:32,960
right now just I I don't it I don't keep

1181
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:34,519
all the crosses in my brain like you do

1182
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,720
like I don't have that encyclopedia but

1183
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:36,719
popping bottles is one of the new ones I

1184
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:38,719
was wondering if that's one of yeah he

1185
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:40,879
has some really good stuff and I yeah

1186
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:42,679
code red so we're running we've got

1187
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,318
we're harvesting code red got to be

1188
00:42:42,679 --> 00:42:46,318
really it's got be right's got to be in

1189
00:42:44,318 --> 00:42:47,920
that red pop was good but it was it's

1190
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:50,199
like it's like I say like all these

1191
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:53,599
things whether it's purple punch or

1192
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:55,239
Oreos or whatever it is these are all

1193
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:56,800
one like apple fritters is another one

1194
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:59,959
for me but they're all one step away

1195
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,920
from amazing you know or or two steps or

1196
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:03,679
whatever and it doesn't flavor component

1197
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,838
it could be it's just missing one thing

1198
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:07,039
right staining kind of you might need to

1199
00:43:05,838 --> 00:43:08,440
cross it to something and then go

1200
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:10,960
through the selection process and find a

1201
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:12,200
winner and sometimes it's that easy

1202
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,400
sometimes it's not that's what's so

1203
00:43:12,199 --> 00:43:14,519
frustrating about feno hunting is you

1204
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,480
got the boxes that you need to have

1205
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:19,159
checked yield potency flavor you know

1206
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,240
how do they grow all those boxes need to

1207
00:43:19,159 --> 00:43:21,759
be checked if you're going to fold it

1208
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:22,799
into a program and it's so frustrating

1209
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,960
when you get to that Finish Line it's

1210
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:28,720
like all the Box are checked but

1211
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:31,519
one yeah or you go to the end and you're

1212
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:32,919
like the one you're like this is the one

1213
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:34,880
and then everybody goes to smoke it and

1214
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:37,079
they're like that's not the

1215
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:39,800
one and it happens all the I would say

1216
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:41,318
it happens more than it doesn't happen

1217
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,960
where like the ones that on the plant

1218
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:45,920
you're like oh we got the winner we got

1219
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,639
the new new latest and greatest height

1220
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,838
this is going to be the one and it's and

1221
00:43:47,639 --> 00:43:50,440
once you cure it up you're like wait

1222
00:43:48,838 --> 00:43:51,719
what happened where was all that flavor

1223
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:53,559
that we had there where did it go what

1224
00:43:51,719 --> 00:43:55,558
happened or sometimes the look even

1225
00:43:53,559 --> 00:43:57,240
you're like how does it look like this

1226
00:43:55,559 --> 00:43:59,839
when it look like that on the plant

1227
00:43:57,239 --> 00:44:02,399
seriously seriously yeah yeah I mean

1228
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:04,639
there genetic math right it's like it's

1229
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:08,318
like trying to predict the Plinko right

1230
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:10,879
it's seriously it's like it's well it

1231
00:44:08,318 --> 00:44:13,000
just takes time and patience and I mean

1232
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:15,519
the the breeding at it's the long game

1233
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,280
right it's the long game and it's it's

1234
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:18,759
all patience especially the feno hunting

1235
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,160
because anybody can make seeds right

1236
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:23,880
that's not the hard part the hard part

1237
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:25,799
It's a Grind it's a year at least Forum

1238
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:27,400
of year do right to do it right to get

1239
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,640
to get something into production us it's

1240
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,480
a year that's what we always think about

1241
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:32,279
when we get something going about a year

1242
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,000
yeah yeah yeah for sure well then we get

1243
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:37,119
everything in TC so we have it backed up

1244
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,760
in TC so that our n impressive out

1245
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:41,160
that's just so impressive yeah I got a

1246
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:43,520
good partner he's really solid with TC

1247
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:45,799
and he does mirror stem TC which is

1248
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:47,079
different than most companies do Nole

1249
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,760
and I feel like when we're pulling it

1250
00:44:47,079 --> 00:44:50,680
out of mirr stem I'm very confident that

1251
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:52,319
it's clean and we're not going to have

1252
00:44:50,679 --> 00:44:55,199
something come back when we look when

1253
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:57,759
you look at at at tissue culture as a a

1254
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:59,399
great solution for that one of the the

1255
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,000
you know we haven't moved into that you

1256
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,838
know yet and and and I feel like we're

1257
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,239
late to the party on that what's the

1258
00:45:02,838 --> 00:45:06,358
what what are we looking at in terms of

1259
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:09,838
cost when it comes to actually making

1260
00:45:06,358 --> 00:45:11,440
that part of your sop at a farm a

1261
00:45:09,838 --> 00:45:14,039
commercial scale I mean I think you can

1262
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:16,000
build a lab for less than

1263
00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:19,159
$100,000 right and then you're looking

1264
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,000
at an employee skilled employee you need

1265
00:45:19,159 --> 00:45:22,920
a skilled employee depending on where

1266
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,679
you live is what's going to dictate that

1267
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:27,639
if you have somebody like Justin we can

1268
00:45:24,679 --> 00:45:30,199
hire a tech that's

1269
00:45:27,639 --> 00:45:32,679
an hour in the area maybe less up there

1270
00:45:30,199 --> 00:45:34,759
but if you if you have a a Justin or

1271
00:45:32,679 --> 00:45:37,199
someone that's on that level you know

1272
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:40,200
those guys can can range anywhere from

1273
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:42,039
100 to whatever so so let me understand

1274
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:43,000
sort of the two levels here one is what

1275
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:45,639
you're talking about is actually

1276
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,599
building out a a room at your facility

1277
00:45:45,639 --> 00:45:49,358
that ultimately is a designated TC room

1278
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:51,599
correct you need a lot of specialized

1279
00:45:49,358 --> 00:45:53,239
equipment right so and then what about

1280
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:55,599
subbing that out is there is there a

1281
00:45:53,239 --> 00:45:57,000
concept there where we clean genetics we

1282
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:58,920
we take like let's say you have stuff

1283
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,559
coming in and and let's say you pop it

1284
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,079
from seed here's the beauty of that

1285
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:04,000
where you're feno hunting it yourself

1286
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:05,800
yeah you pop it from seed you keep it

1287
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,199
clean you keep it in a pretty sterile

1288
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:10,480
environment as sterile as you can uh we

1289
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:12,519
can do nodle on that right and then we

1290
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:15,280
can put it in Mir stem as well so you

1291
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:17,000
can get it back right away in Nole uh

1292
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:20,200
and then it goes through marem and then

1293
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:23,838
Banking and that costs any you know I

1294
00:46:20,199 --> 00:46:25,799
mean we Char 5500 for genetic typically

1295
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:27,519
per genetic yeah per genetic that's

1296
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:30,240
that's the thing is is like you build up

1297
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:32,159
your library of your proprietary stuff

1298
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:33,838
yeah and then anytime you need it out

1299
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:35,558
you get a clean copy you don't have to

1300
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:37,279
worry about it and that's and so that's

1301
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:39,800
the main upside is that you've got a

1302
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,400
clean copy that's banked that ultimately

1303
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:43,720
you can call on whenever you need it I

1304
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:45,079
mean is that really it and then it takes

1305
00:46:43,719 --> 00:46:46,480
a few months to get out of culture if

1306
00:46:45,079 --> 00:46:49,680
it's in mistem you know I mean we're

1307
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:51,679
we're storing stuff um but you can also

1308
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:54,000
just have like a small lab that doesn't

1309
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:56,279
cost $100,000 you could have a small

1310
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,039
place where you can basically have your

1311
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,760
own stuff coming out of culture where

1312
00:46:58,039 --> 00:47:02,759
you can do a lot of that stuff

1313
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:04,079
yourself um you know I think the mirem

1314
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:06,960
part is hard because I don't know

1315
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:09,680
anybody else that Does it Like We Do It

1316
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:11,880
um you know we're blessed to to have

1317
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:13,159
this as a you know a solution there's a

1318
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:15,119
lot of people that say they do that's

1319
00:47:13,159 --> 00:47:16,719
the thing is like there's other people

1320
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:19,800
in the industry that are like I do this

1321
00:47:16,719 --> 00:47:21,358
this and this show me your coas show me

1322
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:23,880
your test results from before with

1323
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:26,199
hoplon and hop Lon clean after a number

1324
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:28,160
of years yeah every three months let me

1325
00:47:26,199 --> 00:47:30,838
see it after cleaned it every 3 months

1326
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:33,118
for for let me show yeah I can show you

1327
00:47:30,838 --> 00:47:36,599
guys ours it's like Justin can show you

1328
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:39,599
3 months 6 months 9 months 12 months 18

1329
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:40,559
months after with clean results you know

1330
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:42,720
is that something that is part of your

1331
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:44,319
Sops is it a testing every three months

1332
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:46,399
he is costing yeah he's testing every

1333
00:47:44,318 --> 00:47:48,880
three months and so that part and then

1334
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:51,318
just to clean I mean the cleaning cost

1335
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,838
you know our cost to actually do it is

1336
00:47:51,318 --> 00:47:55,119
is expensive you know you figure all the

1337
00:47:52,838 --> 00:47:58,039
man hours that it takes you know the

1338
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:59,680
media all the all the time and effort

1339
00:47:58,039 --> 00:48:02,318
that goes into it it's not cheap to do

1340
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:04,118
it and there's nobody else really doing

1341
00:48:02,318 --> 00:48:05,358
the the solution correct that I know of

1342
00:48:04,119 --> 00:48:06,800
yeah that doesn't mean they don't exist

1343
00:48:05,358 --> 00:48:09,279
I just don't know yeah yeah no one of

1344
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:11,400
the tricky Parts as I understand it is

1345
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:14,720
you can do a good enough job where the

1346
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:17,880
viral load is so low that it won't test

1347
00:48:14,719 --> 00:48:19,719
right for a while but but a after a

1348
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:21,880
given amount of time that viral load is

1349
00:48:19,719 --> 00:48:23,239
going to come back up right and so from

1350
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:25,519
my understanding the way that Justin

1351
00:48:23,239 --> 00:48:27,598
does it like there is no viral load no

1352
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:30,358
he's taking UND different iated cells

1353
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:33,318
right so he's taking cluster like on

1354
00:48:30,358 --> 00:48:34,838
syst yeah it's not the vascular right

1355
00:48:33,318 --> 00:48:36,199
it's beyond the vascular system he's

1356
00:48:34,838 --> 00:48:38,119
taking that undifferentiated cells

1357
00:48:36,199 --> 00:48:41,159
growing the plant from on a cellular

1358
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:43,519
level right and then it's not coming

1359
00:48:41,159 --> 00:48:45,039
back and the thing is is like conception

1360
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:47,960
I really like I'm friends with those

1361
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:49,679
guys over conception I I got a lot I'm

1362
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:51,159
friends with everybody I like everybody

1363
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:53,318
there's nobody maybe people don't like

1364
00:48:51,159 --> 00:48:54,598
me but I like everybody pretty much and

1365
00:48:53,318 --> 00:48:56,000
conception I think they're doing a

1366
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:57,760
really good job but they don't they

1367
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,079
don't [ __ ] with h you know it's like if

1368
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:02,160
it has hop PL they don't want to mess

1369
00:48:59,079 --> 00:49:04,079
with it right it's just not they wantan

1370
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:05,440
theyve seen they they've done RNG they

1371
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:07,960
don't even try to clean it if has hop

1372
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,920
Lon they don't want it right so they

1373
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:11,400
basically won't put in the system

1374
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,400
because I believe they've had it come

1375
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,519
back right and and that's problem like

1376
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:18,280
why would we waste their time why would

1377
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:20,079
they waste their time and energy and you

1378
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:22,160
know I think they're they're they're a

1379
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:24,798
good company yeah so I think right now

1380
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:27,078
in the TC space there's still uh just a

1381
00:49:24,798 --> 00:49:29,000
general lack of Education as to what's

1382
00:49:27,079 --> 00:49:30,640
actually happening and that's why a lot

1383
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,039
of people don't understand the

1384
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:33,960
differentiation between the different

1385
00:49:32,039 --> 00:49:35,679
levels of TC a lot of people don't

1386
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:37,960
really understand how much skill is

1387
00:49:35,679 --> 00:49:40,919
involved in doing it appropriately how

1388
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:42,920
much actual physical skill if you think

1389
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:45,159
you can do mirror stem at home you're

1390
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:46,798
wrong that that doesn't happen right but

1391
00:49:45,159 --> 00:49:47,960
a lot of people do a lot of people are

1392
00:49:46,798 --> 00:49:49,599
like I'm going to go take this class

1393
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:51,400
over this weekend or this week and I'm G

1394
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:52,880
to pay whatever the amount of money is

1395
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,720
and I'm going to learn how to do Miron

1396
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:56,920
and it's just not the case it's a lot

1397
00:49:54,719 --> 00:49:58,759
harder I think I I'm one of those guys

1398
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:01,358
who's like if he can do it I can do it I

1399
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:03,319
I typically I'm like that and so Justin

1400
00:50:01,358 --> 00:50:04,880
we were in Seattle at House of cvar he

1401
00:50:03,318 --> 00:50:08,039
was doing some stuff up there with my

1402
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:11,119
partners up there and uh they have a TC

1403
00:50:08,039 --> 00:50:12,239
lab and they're amazing and uh Justin's

1404
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,000
like well you want to learn how to do

1405
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:15,679
mirror stem I'm like yeah let's do it

1406
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,599
I'd love to learn and so they got me

1407
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:20,480
under the hood and I realize for one

1408
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:21,838
thing that I'm my hands are too shaky

1409
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,079
right for one thing I drink a lot of

1410
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:26,159
coffee I don't have as steady of a hand

1411
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:28,200
as I would like especially for stuff

1412
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:29,159
like that cuz looking under a microscope

1413
00:50:28,199 --> 00:50:30,879
it doesn't look like my hands are

1414
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:32,598
shaking at all but like you get it under

1415
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,079
a microscope and there's just a little

1416
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:38,559
bit and and it's a lot more complex and

1417
00:50:35,079 --> 00:50:41,359
I mean wow these guys surgical surgical

1418
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:43,040
right surgical on a molecular level

1419
00:50:41,358 --> 00:50:47,719
right so not only is it surgical but

1420
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:49,279
it's on the smallest of scale right so

1421
00:50:47,719 --> 00:50:50,798
it's real interesting because that

1422
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,599
sounds like we're just around the corner

1423
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:55,679
from the robot arm going in there and

1424
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:57,640
doing that automating that process where

1425
00:50:55,679 --> 00:51:01,118
a ton of money in we have a Rob we have

1426
00:50:57,639 --> 00:51:03,039
a robot arm here yeah called J no no no

1427
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:05,680
we actually have a robot arm wait

1428
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:08,318
awesome but uh but yeah so wow but yeah

1429
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:09,919
but it's not for that but it's for TC

1430
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:11,679
it's for TC but it's not for the mirror

1431
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,519
stem it's it helps mirror stem excisions

1432
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:15,798
you still have to do it all yourself but

1433
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:18,159
it transfers right so it'll transfer the

1434
00:51:15,798 --> 00:51:19,798
vessels so you're not contaminating so

1435
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:21,480
and it speeds up productivity because

1436
00:51:19,798 --> 00:51:24,199
you're not touching the actual vessels

1437
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:25,880
that they're going in gotcha wow wow wow

1438
00:51:24,199 --> 00:51:28,279
but yeah I mean tissue culture and then

1439
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:29,559
a lot of people just they don't fully

1440
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,640
understand tissue culture and what it is

1441
00:51:29,559 --> 00:51:33,359
and they're like well I could do that

1442
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:35,159
and I thought the same thing and I you

1443
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:38,358
know most people don't know what sterile

1444
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:40,039
means no even working under a the

1445
00:51:38,358 --> 00:51:41,318
differentiation between disinfecting and

1446
00:51:40,039 --> 00:51:43,079
sterile I don't think most people could

1447
00:51:41,318 --> 00:51:45,679
talk through that no and another one is

1448
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:48,760
like people don't even know they think

1449
00:51:45,679 --> 00:51:50,798
91% alcohol is better than 70 and that's

1450
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:52,280
the biggest you know confus most people

1451
00:51:50,798 --> 00:51:54,039
are like oh I want that because it's

1452
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:56,040
probably it's going to clean better the

1453
00:51:54,039 --> 00:51:58,519
truth is it's great for your bongs the

1454
00:51:56,039 --> 00:52:00,679
90% is great for your bongs it's great

1455
00:51:58,519 --> 00:52:02,039
for soaking scissors like if you're

1456
00:52:00,679 --> 00:52:03,239
cleaning your scissors off but for

1457
00:52:02,039 --> 00:52:05,960
sterilizing

1458
00:52:03,239 --> 00:52:07,919
surfaces uh 70% is better because the

1459
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:09,559
contact time so you put it on there you

1460
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,280
want a longer contact time because

1461
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:12,400
that's going to kill more things except

1462
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,440
for hop plon you don't want to use it

1463
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,639
for alcohol alcohol or alcohol for hop L

1464
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:19,079
it doesn't work it actually stabilizes

1465
00:52:16,639 --> 00:52:20,639
the Vero what yeah so it's the exact

1466
00:52:19,079 --> 00:52:22,280
opposite makes it easier to transfer

1467
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:24,798
because of how it interacts with the

1468
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:26,519
coating of the of the actual virus right

1469
00:52:24,798 --> 00:52:28,880
kind of coagulates them and makes it

1470
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:31,280
easier it's completely you think alcohol

1471
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:33,559
and then you're just broke my brain yeah

1472
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,079
all right you need specialized wow yeah

1473
00:52:33,559 --> 00:52:37,680
bleach

1474
00:52:35,079 --> 00:52:40,559
bleach

1475
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:42,519
oers yeah so it's it's pretty wild and I

1476
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:44,440
think so much of this stuff is

1477
00:52:42,519 --> 00:52:47,000
counterintuitive whether it's breeding

1478
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:48,798
or whether it's like viruses and viroids

1479
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,798
like we think we understand it and it's

1480
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:52,599
like you know you know enough to make

1481
00:52:50,798 --> 00:52:54,239
yourself dangerous but then you're

1482
00:52:52,599 --> 00:52:55,680
dangerous and you're spreading the virus

1483
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:57,039
right like that that happens all the

1484
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:58,798
time with companies it's like oh we

1485
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:00,798
figured out we're just going to soak all

1486
00:52:58,798 --> 00:53:01,920
the scissors in alcohol in between cuts

1487
00:53:00,798 --> 00:53:03,920
and everything and it's like no that

1488
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:06,200
doesn't that doesn't do it but it sounds

1489
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,680
like it would but it doesn't I mean yeah

1490
00:53:06,199 --> 00:53:09,679
I think there's a lot of Dunning Krueger

1491
00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:11,558
still in this kind of where you know a

1492
00:53:09,679 --> 00:53:14,598
lot of people don't know how much they

1493
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:16,680
don't know right um and they they learn

1494
00:53:14,599 --> 00:53:19,000
a tiny little bit and they're like oh

1495
00:53:16,679 --> 00:53:21,239
easy it's just a little pathogen I just

1496
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,960
got to soak my I just got to soak my

1497
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:25,519
scissors I mean it wasn't even that it

1498
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,960
was like a a year ago at an event I'm

1499
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:29,239
not going to name the company

1500
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,760
oh yeah we have our new um cloning gel

1501
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:32,199
cool thing about this gel it's got

1502
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:34,000
alcohol in it so you don't have to clean

1503
00:53:32,199 --> 00:53:36,039
your

1504
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,760
scissors you can just go ahead and dip

1505
00:53:36,039 --> 00:53:39,239
all the cups all the cuts right in this

1506
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,160
one bottle you don't have to worry

1507
00:53:39,239 --> 00:53:41,679
because the alcohol is going to make

1508
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:44,719
sure that it's perfect and I'm like

1509
00:53:41,679 --> 00:53:47,759
please please don't ever say that to any

1510
00:53:44,719 --> 00:53:51,199
customer you know yeah so I mean there's

1511
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:53,480
still a just a giant lapse in education

1512
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:55,639
yeah um you know I've always kind of

1513
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:58,519
felt in a weird place in this industry

1514
00:53:55,639 --> 00:54:00,239
because I do have a formal education and

1515
00:53:58,519 --> 00:54:02,280
I know a lot of people don't and I've

1516
00:54:00,239 --> 00:54:05,358
never been one to hold that against

1517
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:07,839
someone right I'm firm believer there's

1518
00:54:05,358 --> 00:54:10,279
a lot of different types of intelligence

1519
00:54:07,838 --> 00:54:12,279
right and that books smarts is only one

1520
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:13,880
small part of being like an intelligent

1521
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:16,720
human being right there's emotional

1522
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:18,559
intelligence kinesthetic intelligence

1523
00:54:16,719 --> 00:54:21,838
Street intelligence Street intelligence

1524
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:24,160
absolutely yeah know Common Sense born

1525
00:54:21,838 --> 00:54:26,920
with like a natural common sense but um

1526
00:54:24,159 --> 00:54:29,639
I do look forward to this industry

1527
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:32,318
becoming a little bit more data driven

1528
00:54:29,639 --> 00:54:34,039
and making decisions based on evidence

1529
00:54:32,318 --> 00:54:36,440
so when I see individuals like yourself

1530
00:54:34,039 --> 00:54:39,318
like taking actual steps to make that a

1531
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:41,559
reality like I'm so grateful because I

1532
00:54:39,318 --> 00:54:43,519
know that a lot of people are going to

1533
00:54:41,559 --> 00:54:45,400
take that information run with it and

1534
00:54:43,519 --> 00:54:47,519
make this industry better for everyone

1535
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:49,200
involved well I think we're all Pig

1536
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:51,039
piggybacking on each other like we're

1537
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:52,598
standing on the shoulders of giants

1538
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:55,159
especially in the breeding world like

1539
00:54:52,599 --> 00:54:57,318
this stuff was done in this the the

1540
00:54:55,159 --> 00:54:59,598
early stuff was done in 60s and 70s for

1541
00:54:57,318 --> 00:55:00,920
modern cannabis you know I mean land

1542
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:03,760
raise stuff has been done for hundreds

1543
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:05,519
of years all over the world and then we

1544
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:07,319
hybridized this stuff in California in

1545
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:09,440
the 60s and 70s and we're really

1546
00:55:07,318 --> 00:55:12,000
piggybacking on those guys that were

1547
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:15,280
like let's take this cross it with this

1548
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,440
we got this and then you know I feel

1549
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:19,240
like real breeding was done back then to

1550
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,639
a degree and I think it's starting to be

1551
00:55:19,239 --> 00:55:22,358
done again there's people out there that

1552
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:23,440
are doing a really good job at it and

1553
00:55:22,358 --> 00:55:24,880
then there's a lot of people that are

1554
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:26,960
just like let's just cross this with

1555
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:28,920
this a lot of time

1556
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,039
this and it's like that's just the same

1557
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,400
thing you're just in breeding and you

1558
00:55:30,039 --> 00:55:32,920
don't understand you're in breeding who

1559
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:34,200
are some of your current uh favorite

1560
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:36,599
breeders that are doing it out there

1561
00:55:34,199 --> 00:55:40,318
that doing it the way you know Jackson

1562
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:45,280
is probably one of my favorites uh mean

1563
00:55:40,318 --> 00:55:47,400
jeene um you know uh my my buddy Nick

1564
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:49,280
Nick stomberg I think he's doing some

1565
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:52,200
really cool stuff yeah yeah he's great

1566
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:54,359
he's what's it what's the the he's

1567
00:55:52,199 --> 00:55:55,919
people don't even know who he is right

1568
00:55:54,358 --> 00:55:57,759
and he's one of those guys who's just

1569
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,680
doing and doing it right and doing a lot

1570
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,440
of testing he's one of the guys I look

1571
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:03,078
up to I think at one point he might have

1572
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,838
looked up to me and now I'm the guy

1573
00:56:03,079 --> 00:56:07,079
looking up to him like dude this guy's

1574
00:56:04,838 --> 00:56:11,318
doing it uh Fletch I think he's doing a

1575
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:14,440
great job Mike is doing a great job um

1576
00:56:11,318 --> 00:56:15,798
you know I think there's there's a bunch

1577
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:18,119
of people doing it right and then

1578
00:56:15,798 --> 00:56:21,038
there's kind of everybody else and I

1579
00:56:18,119 --> 00:56:23,760
mean I just I think going back to some

1580
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:25,480
of the land race is not a bad way to go

1581
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:28,520
I'm doing some experiments with land

1582
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:30,920
race genetics um taking a step back but

1583
00:56:28,519 --> 00:56:32,880
also just thoroughly testing everything

1584
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:35,079
I think that's super important and pheno

1585
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:36,599
really doing phenoh Huns you know I mean

1586
00:56:35,079 --> 00:56:39,720
it's not just about making seeds and

1587
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:41,760
about hype um although understanding

1588
00:56:39,719 --> 00:56:43,399
what's in that pack in that cross yeah

1589
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,480
and understanding your L one way to

1590
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:47,160
understand it yeah I mean I think you

1591
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:50,159
need to have like a six-month plan a

1592
00:56:47,159 --> 00:56:53,199
oneyear plan a fiveyear plan you know

1593
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:55,318
and and mine a lot of what I'm doing is

1594
00:56:53,199 --> 00:56:58,078
kind of Legacy stuff now I see like the

1595
00:56:55,318 --> 00:57:00,440
end in the distant future I mean I don't

1596
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:02,160
see it tomorrow but I know that like I

1597
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:04,358
only have so much time left to do all

1598
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:05,519
this stuff I got my book out and so I

1599
00:57:04,358 --> 00:57:07,358
think that was a step in the right

1600
00:57:05,519 --> 00:57:10,280
direction and some of the breeding stuff

1601
00:57:07,358 --> 00:57:12,440
I want to do is you know it's a 10year

1602
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:14,480
project this stuff is like literally

1603
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:15,798
it's a 10-year project to do some of the

1604
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:18,159
exciting stuff that I want to do and I

1605
00:57:15,798 --> 00:57:20,519
don't share all of that with everybody I

1606
00:57:18,159 --> 00:57:23,558
think there's some stuff that I keep for

1607
00:57:20,519 --> 00:57:26,639
myself but uh yeah and it's

1608
00:57:23,559 --> 00:57:28,519
like I I like you know so fire he's

1609
00:57:26,639 --> 00:57:29,960
doing some really good stuff too I think

1610
00:57:28,519 --> 00:57:32,519
you know him and Mike are pretty tight

1611
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:34,079
mhm uh but I like a lot of their work

1612
00:57:32,519 --> 00:57:35,119
are you familiar with the guys over

1613
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:37,160
you're talking about land race the guys

1614
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:38,920
that were at a seeds that doing the okay

1615
00:57:37,159 --> 00:57:40,159
a seeds I love those guys those guys

1616
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:42,159
were I featured them some of their

1617
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:43,759
photos in my book I'm stoked so we're

1618
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:46,719
just about to start feno hunting a

1619
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:48,480
zamalia some Cali China I can't remember

1620
00:57:46,719 --> 00:57:50,879
exactly but the whole idea is right so

1621
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:53,639
land race great but for for commercial

1622
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:55,599
cultivation we can't wait 11 12 weeks we

1623
00:57:53,639 --> 00:57:57,960
need something that's it so they've got

1624
00:57:55,599 --> 00:58:00,039
so their whole gag is we've got land

1625
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:00,960
race for you guys to run we've crossed

1626
00:58:00,039 --> 00:58:02,799
it with these things they're going to

1627
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:04,318
help it finish in N9 weeks so we're just

1628
00:58:02,798 --> 00:58:06,038
about to embark on that so I'm I'm I'm

1629
00:58:04,318 --> 00:58:09,079
hyped to hear that you're you're I like

1630
00:58:06,039 --> 00:58:11,880
Ace I I like Khalifa you know it's like

1631
00:58:09,079 --> 00:58:13,760
my my book was written by myself and 22

1632
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:16,000
other people contributed information

1633
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:18,359
right so like it wasn't just me it's a a

1634
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,760
group effort and yeah I always like

1635
00:58:18,358 --> 00:58:22,960
group efforts I like it I feel like

1636
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:24,559
winning with a group of people is so

1637
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,880
much more fun than just standing there

1638
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:28,680
winning by yourself I don't eating alone

1639
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:30,480
I'm not like one of those guys who

1640
00:58:28,679 --> 00:58:32,118
enjoys going to some fancy dinner by

1641
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:34,519
myself I'd rather be with my friends and

1642
00:58:32,119 --> 00:58:36,240
celebrating with my friends it um you

1643
00:58:34,519 --> 00:58:38,920
know and the book is a testament to that

1644
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:40,318
it's like I could have never written

1645
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:42,639
some of that stuff that's in my book on

1646
00:58:40,318 --> 00:58:43,358
tissue culture there's a whole chapter

1647
00:58:42,639 --> 00:58:46,038
uh

1648
00:58:43,358 --> 00:58:48,038
Justin's uh partner Matt from apical

1649
00:58:46,039 --> 00:58:51,079
biotech he wrote the chapter on tissue

1650
00:58:48,039 --> 00:58:54,200
culture Dale Hunt wrote the chapter on

1651
00:58:51,079 --> 00:58:55,400
IP and protecting your plant you know I

1652
00:58:54,199 --> 00:58:57,719
think that's super important

1653
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:59,599
intellectual property and plant

1654
00:58:57,719 --> 00:59:01,439
protection is so important people need

1655
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:02,880
to at least understand it you might not

1656
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:05,400
need to do it as a breeder but it's

1657
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:07,240
great to understand what intellectual

1658
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:09,200
property actually is or whether you're

1659
00:59:07,239 --> 00:59:10,639
creating something that's novel you know

1660
00:59:09,199 --> 00:59:12,279
or whether you're just trying to steal

1661
00:59:10,639 --> 00:59:14,759
somebody's because that's that's

1662
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:16,240
happened too you know it's like M

1663
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:19,000
Richmond he's one of my friends with his

1664
00:59:16,239 --> 00:59:20,959
sage like someone else tried to patent

1665
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,679
his Sage you know and it's like that

1666
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,639
kind of stuff is going to happen with

1667
00:59:22,679 --> 00:59:27,679
companies but you know what do you do in

1668
00:59:24,639 --> 00:59:28,879
that type of a situation M I don't think

1669
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:31,318
that there's a lot

1670
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:33,760
of protections right now you know with

1671
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:36,000
it no but there will be because it's

1672
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:38,319
it's already in a right so like we are

1673
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,280
going to become another a commodity just

1674
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:41,838
like everything else I think we're at

1675
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:43,599
the stage where it's pretty normalized

1676
00:59:41,838 --> 00:59:46,519
you look at Oregon cannabis is pretty

1677
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:48,838
normalized up there I think 100% more so

1678
00:59:46,519 --> 00:59:50,798
than it is here and it's only going to

1679
00:59:48,838 --> 00:59:52,519
grow bigger bigger bigger the the

1680
00:59:50,798 --> 00:59:54,559
movement's gotten stronger and stronger

1681
00:59:52,519 --> 00:59:56,519
to the point where it's not going away

1682
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:59,200
we have our two presid presidential

1683
00:59:56,519 --> 01:00:00,798
candidates that are both kind of you

1684
00:59:59,199 --> 01:00:03,159
know leading on to believe that they're

1685
01:00:00,798 --> 01:00:06,358
going to decriminalize it completely on

1686
01:00:03,159 --> 01:00:08,719
a federal level uh so I feel like if

1687
01:00:06,358 --> 01:00:10,440
they're talking about it it's really you

1688
01:00:08,719 --> 01:00:13,919
know it's gaining you you got the whole

1689
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:15,798
rescheduling you know we but baby steps

1690
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:17,720
baby exactly I'm okay with that we're

1691
01:00:15,798 --> 01:00:19,798
not going backwards we're not that's the

1692
01:00:17,719 --> 01:00:21,239
thing it is going to take some we might

1693
01:00:19,798 --> 01:00:22,519
we might but I don't see us going

1694
01:00:21,239 --> 01:00:23,798
backwards in that I mean I see other

1695
01:00:22,519 --> 01:00:26,719
countries maybe going backwards like

1696
01:00:23,798 --> 01:00:28,480
Thailand oh which is silly but it's it's

1697
01:00:26,719 --> 01:00:30,798
like they went too crazy and then now

1698
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:33,318
they're like take it back a little bit

1699
01:00:30,798 --> 01:00:35,038
but I see it on a global scale you look

1700
01:00:33,318 --> 01:00:39,239
at Portugal you look at Germany you look

1701
01:00:35,039 --> 01:00:42,280
at Uruguay columia Canada Mexico is even

1702
01:00:39,239 --> 01:00:43,879
making Leaps and Bounds um St Vincent

1703
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:46,280
which is Medical in the Caribbean

1704
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:48,358
Trinidad which is fully decriminalized

1705
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:51,319
there's so many places Australia is

1706
01:00:48,358 --> 01:00:53,838
medical you know we just get enough

1707
01:00:51,318 --> 01:00:55,318
people to understand that it's not bad

1708
01:00:53,838 --> 01:00:56,880
that it makes the world a better place

1709
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:58,920
that's it and then we get everybody on

1710
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:00,400
board and that's where the magic happens

1711
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:02,358
right yeah well there's still a lot of

1712
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,960
deprogramming that we are and it might

1713
01:01:02,358 --> 01:01:05,798
take Generations right it took

1714
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:08,240
generations to get here yes

1715
01:01:05,798 --> 01:01:09,960
unfortunately yeah yeah there's yeah

1716
01:01:08,239 --> 01:01:12,159
like I said the Deep the deprogramming

1717
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:14,559
that needs to occur in the general

1718
01:01:12,159 --> 01:01:16,118
population when it comes to cannabis

1719
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:18,000
well an acceptance an acceptance of

1720
01:01:16,119 --> 01:01:19,480
allowing people to do what they want to

1721
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,559
do that's not hurting other people

1722
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:23,000
that's not a bad thing right like the

1723
01:01:21,559 --> 01:01:24,640
end of the day it's not causing lung

1724
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,000
cancer like cigarettes it's not causing

1725
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:29,480
liver cancer like alcohol we might have

1726
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:31,119
some psychosis that goes along with it

1727
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:32,960
there might be some things but it's not

1728
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:34,280
as bad as either one of those two things

1729
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:35,400
yeah I mean when you compare to alcohol

1730
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:37,640
it's just it's not even in the same

1731
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:40,798
galaxy in terms of the harm right yeah I

1732
01:01:37,639 --> 01:01:43,400
mean I I would compare it to I mean

1733
01:01:40,798 --> 01:01:46,639
compared to almost any recreational drug

1734
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:48,358
I mean it's it's safety in comparison is

1735
01:01:46,639 --> 01:01:51,239
yeah well the the only thing that's

1736
01:01:48,358 --> 01:01:54,159
safer I think that's illegal is

1737
01:01:51,239 --> 01:01:58,318
mushrooms psychedelics right so they're

1738
01:01:54,159 --> 01:01:58,318
saying that it's safer the for

1739
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:03,599
pis for overd I think well no I mean you

1740
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:05,719
could moments that I wouldn't get behind

1741
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:08,119
the wheel after taking some mushrooms

1742
01:02:05,719 --> 01:02:09,639
but I have no problem driving on for

1743
01:02:08,119 --> 01:02:12,880
sure you shouldn't be driving on it but

1744
01:02:09,639 --> 01:02:17,278
I think as far as like safy I'm

1745
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:19,358
just long term yeah yeah I he sure but

1746
01:02:17,278 --> 01:02:21,039
yeah this they need to decriminalize

1747
01:02:19,358 --> 01:02:23,440
psychedelics too I think that's just

1748
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:25,079
silly I think they they actually are

1749
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,400
beneficial and can make the world a

1750
01:02:25,079 --> 01:02:28,119
better place

1751
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:30,079
with their whole psychedelic program I

1752
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:32,119
think that there's a lot that's

1753
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:33,119
happening I think that was John Hopkins

1754
01:02:32,119 --> 01:02:35,000
that I was actually referencing that

1755
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:36,559
you're right absolutely but with MDMA

1756
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,838
and with psilocybin I think both of

1757
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:39,079
those are starting to actually become

1758
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:40,480
more widely accepted for their

1759
01:02:39,079 --> 01:02:43,359
therapeutic effects helping people get

1760
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:46,240
over traumas andely they just they just

1761
01:02:43,358 --> 01:02:47,598
announced a ban on therapeutic MDMA I

1762
01:02:46,239 --> 01:02:49,759
don't know if you heard about that did

1763
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:51,920
they they said more studies need to be

1764
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:53,400
done that's good that's good so they

1765
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:56,079
didn't yeah

1766
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:57,440
they that was yeah they didn't complet

1767
01:02:56,079 --> 01:03:00,039
Kash they just said more studies need to

1768
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:02,000
be that's good that's good that's

1769
01:03:00,039 --> 01:03:03,880
understandable and respectable yeah yeah

1770
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,760
yeah for sure I mean I never thought I'd

1771
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:08,960
see this push in my lifetime you know um

1772
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:10,880
I agree with you I I I do think

1773
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:14,519
psychedelics can make the world a better

1774
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:17,039
place uh I have had such a crazy

1775
01:03:14,519 --> 01:03:19,000
attitude shift Within Myself right from

1776
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:20,400
looking at myself in my younger days

1777
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:23,760
always blaming the world nothing was

1778
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:25,519
ever my fault always angry sore loser

1779
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:27,278
you just had an experience that made me

1780
01:03:25,519 --> 01:03:29,838
you know know feel the love of the earth

1781
01:03:27,278 --> 01:03:31,159
and realize hey man there's there's a

1782
01:03:29,838 --> 01:03:33,000
better way to approach life there's a

1783
01:03:31,159 --> 01:03:34,558
more positive way to approach life and

1784
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,400
seeing like what kind of impact that had

1785
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:39,079
on myself made me really want to have

1786
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:41,559
other people have like a

1787
01:03:39,079 --> 01:03:43,240
similar I I guess it's not for everyone

1788
01:03:41,559 --> 01:03:45,039
you it's not for everybody but I got to

1789
01:03:43,239 --> 01:03:47,358
experience it from a young age but I I

1790
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:48,880
believe that like sometimes we go

1791
01:03:47,358 --> 01:03:51,278
through life and all these things that

1792
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:52,920
we experience put a filter over us true

1793
01:03:51,278 --> 01:03:55,838
right so we see the world a certain way

1794
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:57,440
with all these filters stacked on us to

1795
01:03:55,838 --> 01:03:58,838
lift those filters back and kind of see

1796
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:01,960
the world how it really

1797
01:03:58,838 --> 01:04:05,440
is um you know it's a beautiful amazing

1798
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:07,599
thing and I think stress stress is just

1799
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:10,200
such a killer and sometimes if you can

1800
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:12,400
do you use some form of a psychedelic or

1801
01:04:10,199 --> 01:04:13,919
even cannabis to get over these

1802
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:15,880
stressful things and realize that

1803
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:18,039
they're not as bad as we want to make

1804
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:19,680
them it's a perspective sh it's a

1805
01:04:18,039 --> 01:04:21,839
perspective what's always amazed me

1806
01:04:19,679 --> 01:04:24,159
right is the power that it has to impart

1807
01:04:21,838 --> 01:04:26,679
empathy on people right and I think you

1808
01:04:24,159 --> 01:04:28,318
know as three consumers of cannabis I

1809
01:04:26,679 --> 01:04:30,000
think we all probably feel that if the

1810
01:04:28,318 --> 01:04:31,519
world was a more empathetic place it

1811
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,679
would be a better place no there's no

1812
01:04:31,519 --> 01:04:35,960
question and I think that that for me is

1813
01:04:33,679 --> 01:04:38,318
something that I I can't wait to learn

1814
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:40,358
more about why does that happen yeah you

1815
01:04:38,318 --> 01:04:42,759
know I have my theory which is I think

1816
01:04:40,358 --> 01:04:45,400
that like naturally when you consume a

1817
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:47,119
psychedelic you have such a deeper

1818
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:48,599
appreciation for the natural world in

1819
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:50,838
your life and I think that's just where

1820
01:04:48,599 --> 01:04:54,160
it comes from I think we are all so

1821
01:04:50,838 --> 01:04:56,199
disconnected right you know from what

1822
01:04:54,159 --> 01:05:00,159
makes being alive so special

1823
01:04:56,199 --> 01:05:03,239
you know that being forced to kind of

1824
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:05,480
appreciate just pretty colors or how

1825
01:05:03,239 --> 01:05:07,639
many people empathy right empathy also

1826
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:09,079
CU because we look at the world from our

1827
01:05:07,639 --> 01:05:10,920
perspective and we don't realize that

1828
01:05:09,079 --> 01:05:12,559
everybody has their own view of the

1829
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:14,358
world they're looking at their own lens

1830
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:16,079
right they've experienced things

1831
01:05:14,358 --> 01:05:17,798
differently so everybody has a different

1832
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:19,200
perspective and that's where empathy

1833
01:05:17,798 --> 01:05:21,000
comes in when you realize that there's

1834
01:05:19,199 --> 01:05:24,480
other perspectives than your own that's

1835
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:26,400
yeah that's a good point and uh yeah I

1836
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:28,240
I'm excited to see more research coming

1837
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:31,039
out the stigma being broken I mean

1838
01:05:28,239 --> 01:05:34,118
that's one we're still I mean the stigma

1839
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:36,319
on hallucina genics is still I think

1840
01:05:34,119 --> 01:05:38,559
pretty strong because even amongst my

1841
01:05:36,318 --> 01:05:39,759
contemporaries there's still a lot of

1842
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:41,400
there's a lot of people that I've been

1843
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:42,920
able to convince you know but there's

1844
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:45,440
still a lot of people that are just like

1845
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:48,278
deathly scared you know and like I don't

1846
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:50,599
I don't I don't want to jump off a hotel

1847
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:52,039
balcony it's like that's not that's not

1848
01:05:50,599 --> 01:05:54,880
necessarily what's going to happen I

1849
01:05:52,039 --> 01:05:56,559
think fear is a good thing it absolutely

1850
01:05:54,880 --> 01:06:00,880
you should go

1851
01:05:56,559 --> 01:06:02,680
all willy-nilly for sure yeah yeah but I

1852
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:04,960
think we're moving in a good direction

1853
01:06:02,679 --> 01:06:07,000
absolutely so let's talk about Oregon

1854
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:09,000
because you're from Eugene I love Eugene

1855
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,880
my friend Sunny's from Eugene OR he

1856
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:13,400
lives up in Eugene right now I've gone

1857
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:16,278
to been going to Eugene for a long time

1858
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:18,680
I love the the food scene up in Eugene

1859
01:06:16,278 --> 01:06:22,278
uh the breweries up in Eugene food

1860
01:06:18,679 --> 01:06:24,239
trucks too yeah yeah I mean you guys yep

1861
01:06:22,278 --> 01:06:26,960
I think Portland has us beat on the food

1862
01:06:24,239 --> 01:06:28,199
scene but they do but you guys have some

1863
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:30,278
really cool stuff I've had some really

1864
01:06:28,199 --> 01:06:31,558
good experiences up there yeah Portland

1865
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:33,719
definitely I mean I was born in Portland

1866
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:35,079
I love yeah same thing with the beer

1867
01:06:33,719 --> 01:06:36,639
scene it's good in Portland you guys

1868
01:06:35,079 --> 01:06:39,200
have your own thing down in Eugene

1869
01:06:36,639 --> 01:06:41,558
though and I it's it's a slower way of

1870
01:06:39,199 --> 01:06:44,118
life the people that live in Eugene

1871
01:06:41,559 --> 01:06:46,640
pretty much love living in eug like I

1872
01:06:44,119 --> 01:06:48,720
was in SoCal for almost 30 years I went

1873
01:06:46,639 --> 01:06:51,038
down to UCLA and and when we moved up to

1874
01:06:48,719 --> 01:06:52,519
Oregon to the to the farm you know 32

1875
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:54,200
Acres out in the middle of Farmland it

1876
01:06:52,519 --> 01:06:56,599
was just like I literally felt like I

1877
01:06:54,199 --> 01:06:58,759
had landed in Paradise like just it's

1878
01:06:56,599 --> 01:07:01,000
just it's beautiful up there it's magic

1879
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:02,278
nice yeah yeah organ's beautiful so how

1880
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:06,278
did you get your start in the Cannabis

1881
01:07:02,278 --> 01:07:08,920
industry well so I was down in LA and uh

1882
01:07:06,278 --> 01:07:11,278
you know I mean I I started growing at

1883
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:13,519
UCLA in in closet like a lot of a lot of

1884
01:07:11,278 --> 01:07:15,519
guys in college did and U lot of people

1885
01:07:13,519 --> 01:07:17,239
on the show did actually yeah so

1886
01:07:15,519 --> 01:07:19,798
two-bedroom apartment we had two closets

1887
01:07:17,239 --> 01:07:22,719
you know veg and flower it was perfect

1888
01:07:19,798 --> 01:07:25,719
um but my buddy's dad had uh started a

1889
01:07:22,719 --> 01:07:27,519
hydrarm and uh so he you know he hooked

1890
01:07:25,719 --> 01:07:29,598
us up with some gear and and from that

1891
01:07:27,519 --> 01:07:31,358
moment I was kind of hooked in terms of

1892
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:32,920
that magic of taking something you know

1893
01:07:31,358 --> 01:07:34,719
like a little clone and then turning it

1894
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:37,278
into finished flower it was just it was

1895
01:07:34,719 --> 01:07:39,759
incredible but I've I've been you know

1896
01:07:37,278 --> 01:07:42,400
involved in in cultivation my whole life

1897
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:44,559
my parents always had like vegetable

1898
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:47,000
gardens and and Orchards and it was

1899
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:49,278
always something that I just LED doing

1900
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:51,400
so i' had been down at in in La running

1901
01:07:49,278 --> 01:07:53,519
a landscape construction company for

1902
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:56,519
almost 20 years and so again involved

1903
01:07:53,519 --> 01:07:59,599
with plants nurseries cultivation

1904
01:07:56,519 --> 01:08:01,880
and um the opportunity came for us to

1905
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:03,838
move up to Oregon in 2015 and that

1906
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:06,760
summer that we moved up there measur 91

1907
01:08:03,838 --> 01:08:09,639
had just passed and so it was you know

1908
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:11,559
it was now a a legal Prospect to

1909
01:08:09,639 --> 01:08:14,038
actually you know really develop a solid

1910
01:08:11,559 --> 01:08:15,720
business so my wife's an attorney and

1911
01:08:14,039 --> 01:08:17,560
she thought well you know if we can

1912
01:08:15,719 --> 01:08:19,039
actually do this legal beagle then let's

1913
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:20,359
let's push into this let's take all of

1914
01:08:19,039 --> 01:08:22,119
your background let's take all of your

1915
01:08:20,359 --> 01:08:24,520
experience and let's actually let's

1916
01:08:22,119 --> 01:08:26,759
let's do it and the farm was was kind of

1917
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:28,719
falling apart I mean you know the the

1918
01:08:26,759 --> 01:08:31,279
farm was was you know it had been in the

1919
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:33,520
family for a number of years and was not

1920
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:35,960
doing well it was not a sustainable

1921
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:38,319
model financially so at the end of the

1922
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:41,000
day you know all my years in running

1923
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:42,239
businesses like you have a great

1924
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,520
business but if it doesn't pencil it

1925
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:46,238
doesn't pencil it's not sustainable so

1926
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:49,080
we wanted first and foremost to create a

1927
01:08:46,238 --> 01:08:50,599
sustainable model and save the farm and

1928
01:08:49,079 --> 01:08:52,439
create something that felt like we could

1929
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:55,440
actually build something meaningful

1930
01:08:52,439 --> 01:08:58,719
there so 2015 we started doing the build

1931
01:08:55,439 --> 01:09:00,599
build out um and it was just me and and

1932
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:02,880
and one other guy my my my best buddy

1933
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:04,520
from from NorCal um who came up and and

1934
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:07,199
helped me get everything

1935
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:09,080
going and we started with one veg room

1936
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:12,479
and one flower room and that was it it

1937
01:09:09,079 --> 01:09:14,759
was just very humble beginnings and we

1938
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:16,559
started with one cut we had one Cult of

1939
01:09:14,759 --> 01:09:18,520
our that we launched the entire farm

1940
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:21,239
with and that was alpha blue so one of

1941
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:24,679
so his his good buddy in NorCal had had

1942
01:09:21,238 --> 01:09:26,119
uh uh been breeding and had uh alpha

1943
01:09:24,679 --> 01:09:27,798
blue which is New York City Diesel cross

1944
01:09:26,119 --> 01:09:29,599
with blue dream and we started and so we

1945
01:09:27,798 --> 01:09:31,198
say that the farm is the you know sort

1946
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:33,159
of the house at Alpha built so alpha

1947
01:09:31,198 --> 01:09:34,960
blue is our longest running cultivar

1948
01:09:33,158 --> 01:09:36,318
it's our you know still to this day one

1949
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:38,679
of our most popular

1950
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:40,679
cultivars um it's funny I've never

1951
01:09:38,679 --> 01:09:43,520
smoked it but I can imagine exactly what

1952
01:09:40,679 --> 01:09:47,039
it tastes like yeah it it it is just

1953
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:49,279
that Berry forward flavor that's just

1954
01:09:47,039 --> 01:09:51,479
yeah yeah it's it's fantastic you get

1955
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:53,199
the you well so blue dream has an

1956
01:09:51,479 --> 01:09:55,639
amazing structure it's like the apical

1957
01:09:53,198 --> 01:09:57,319
of structures right as far as grows

1958
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:59,320
really well it's super vigorous the root

1959
01:09:57,319 --> 01:10:01,399
system is just amazing with it we always

1960
01:09:59,319 --> 01:10:04,158
talked about putting OG Kush plants and

1961
01:10:01,399 --> 01:10:06,439
grafting them onto Blue Dream right so

1962
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:08,238
this conversation from 15 years ago or

1963
01:10:06,439 --> 01:10:10,919
something like that because OG was so

1964
01:10:08,238 --> 01:10:12,799
finicky but like the so basically the

1965
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:15,960
New York City Diesel that's a great

1966
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:17,880
fruit great fruit like citrusy it's got

1967
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:20,640
a nose bur to it too yeah and but it

1968
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:23,719
grows really big it might be a little

1969
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:25,400
less dense than blue dream but those two

1970
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:27,439
profiles seem like they would marry

1971
01:10:25,399 --> 01:10:29,039
really was killer so then he ended up

1972
01:10:27,439 --> 01:10:30,839
Crossing alpha blue with a bunch of

1973
01:10:29,039 --> 01:10:32,439
other crosses that we launched uh we we

1974
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:34,640
folded into the program he crossed it

1975
01:10:32,439 --> 01:10:36,919
with Granddaddy Purple he crossed it

1976
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:39,600
with the DJ Short Blueberry so we had

1977
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:41,880
you know we had our you know our whole

1978
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:44,480
lineup was sort of founded on alpha blue

1979
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:46,600
in in the early days um and then from

1980
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:48,919
there it was just literally just one

1981
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:50,760
room at a time each Harvest paid for the

1982
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:52,640
next upgrade paid for the next paid for

1983
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:55,840
the next and we just iterated from there

1984
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:57,000
so um I I feel like

1985
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:58,880
a little bit of the competitive

1986
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:01,198
Advantage early days was just that I was

1987
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:03,560
focused on developing a sustainable

1988
01:11:01,198 --> 01:11:05,879
business not just growing great weed and

1989
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:09,320
I you know and sort of for me like

1990
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:12,039
cultivation if you look at the at

1991
01:11:09,319 --> 01:11:13,519
the the definition of cultivation right

1992
01:11:12,039 --> 01:11:15,279
the first definition you find is of

1993
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:18,400
course around plants and cultivating

1994
01:11:15,279 --> 01:11:20,759
things but the second definition is

1995
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:24,000
skill acquisition or acquiring knowledge

1996
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:26,119
or qualities right and so the fusion for

1997
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,560
me for my entire life is been

1998
01:11:26,119 --> 01:11:30,679
cultivating right whether it's been

1999
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:32,560
music or sports or you know whatever

2000
01:11:30,679 --> 01:11:34,480
it's cultivating and it's cultivating

2001
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:37,679
something at the highest possible level

2002
01:11:34,479 --> 01:11:39,238
that you can right so for me a lot of

2003
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:41,199
the driver was just like if we're going

2004
01:11:39,238 --> 01:11:42,678
to do this we're going to run cultivars

2005
01:11:41,198 --> 01:11:44,399
that nobody else has we're going to do

2006
01:11:42,679 --> 01:11:47,880
it in a way that nobody else is doing it

2007
01:11:44,399 --> 01:11:49,479
and nobody had LEDs at the time in 2015

2008
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:51,560
fluence was just emerging with their

2009
01:11:49,479 --> 01:11:54,959
LEDs so I hated the purples right the

2010
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:57,120
blur PES terrible right fluence came out

2011
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:59,600
with amazing light people were scared to

2012
01:11:57,119 --> 01:12:01,479
use it for sure so so Jerry one of the

2013
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:03,039
founders of fluence flew out to Oregon

2014
01:12:01,479 --> 01:12:05,399
he was making a few stops trying to get

2015
01:12:03,039 --> 01:12:07,880
people on board for this Tech and he

2016
01:12:05,399 --> 01:12:09,439
showed up plugged in the first light and

2017
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:11,400
it blew me away it was not the the

2018
01:12:09,439 --> 01:12:15,238
purple party lights it was an actual

2019
01:12:11,399 --> 01:12:17,039
legit like powerful fixture yeah and at

2020
01:12:15,238 --> 01:12:18,000
the time you know I I I I talked to a

2021
01:12:17,039 --> 01:12:20,319
few people about it they're like you're

2022
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:22,359
[ __ ] crazy like Ells are not ready

2023
01:12:20,319 --> 01:12:23,719
for prime time you're going to be you

2024
01:12:22,359 --> 01:12:26,158
know like are you going to get three lbs

2025
01:12:23,719 --> 01:12:27,920
of light like you know was that

2026
01:12:26,158 --> 01:12:29,879
so far ahead of their time because

2027
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:31,920
everybody was scared to go there I was I

2028
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:34,840
was like done with LEDs at that point

2029
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:36,840
yeah I'd seen so many my friends yeah so

2030
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:38,480
many of my friends grew with those and

2031
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:40,000
would you know have always really proud

2032
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:41,158
of what they've grown right or what

2033
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,198
they're growing and they want to bring

2034
01:12:41,158 --> 01:12:44,599
you over their spot and it's like you

2035
01:12:43,198 --> 01:12:48,799
got to be kidding me this looks like

2036
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:51,679
[ __ ] it it's ter like just the yield and

2037
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:54,360
may 500 ppfd like it was like nothing

2038
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:55,960
density it was like yeah it's so so that

2039
01:12:54,359 --> 01:12:57,839
was it I mean we really were just like

2040
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:59,359
focused on on really trying to do

2041
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:00,880
something different and I felt like with

2042
01:12:59,359 --> 01:13:02,679
the LEDs we were going to Define

2043
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:04,199
ourselves in a different way and we

2044
01:13:02,679 --> 01:13:05,880
weren't going to be running hydro which

2045
01:13:04,198 --> 01:13:07,638
is again totally fine I have nothing

2046
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:10,159
against coco or Hydro but I was a focus

2047
01:13:07,639 --> 01:13:12,679
on soil and LEDs and that was that was

2048
01:13:10,158 --> 01:13:14,920
how I wanted to to run the program yeah

2049
01:13:12,679 --> 01:13:16,960
um and that's what we've been doing for

2050
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:20,199
almost 10 years now um have you tried

2051
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:23,158
under canopy yet so so there's there's

2052
01:13:20,198 --> 01:13:24,879
two things that that uh you know you can

2053
01:13:23,158 --> 01:13:26,519
sort of never have enough of in life

2054
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:28,199
well there's I guess several things but

2055
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:31,080
but one of them are in in indoor

2056
01:13:28,198 --> 01:13:33,359
cultivation are amps yeah right so you

2057
01:13:31,079 --> 01:13:35,039
you run out of amps it turns out like

2058
01:13:33,359 --> 01:13:37,439
you just like no matter how many amps

2059
01:13:35,039 --> 01:13:41,079
you think you need double it right and

2060
01:13:37,439 --> 01:13:43,719
so we have you know multiple multiple

2061
01:13:41,079 --> 01:13:46,279
600 amp drops and we just ended up you

2062
01:13:43,719 --> 01:13:48,760
know going through it as just quick as

2063
01:13:46,279 --> 01:13:51,359
you possibly could y so under canopy

2064
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:53,400
lighting from a from an amp perspective

2065
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:55,158
and from a logistical perspective to

2066
01:13:53,399 --> 01:13:56,759
outfit every one of our seven flowers

2067
01:13:55,158 --> 01:13:58,679
rooms with under canopy lighting it's

2068
01:13:56,760 --> 01:14:02,280
just like I literally don't have the

2069
01:13:58,679 --> 01:14:04,399
power to run that wow um but the idea of

2070
01:14:02,279 --> 01:14:05,960
actually setting up under canopy

2071
01:14:04,399 --> 01:14:08,119
lighting I I know people are having

2072
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:10,198
great success with that um it's just not

2073
01:14:08,119 --> 01:14:12,920
something that we have have embarked on

2074
01:14:10,198 --> 01:14:14,119
um I feel like you know maybe the return

2075
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:15,319
is there I don't know what the I don't

2076
01:14:14,119 --> 01:14:17,719
know what the numbers say in terms of

2077
01:14:15,319 --> 01:14:19,599
the return on inv get one and see what

2078
01:14:17,719 --> 01:14:22,039
happens you know I feel like and and the

2079
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:23,800
only and and the only reason we haven't

2080
01:14:22,039 --> 01:14:26,319
it's sort of like you just need to try

2081
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:28,560
heroin one time to see what happens like

2082
01:14:26,319 --> 01:14:30,679
I don't actually want to try it one time

2083
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:30,679
to

2084
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:35,319
see so so that's been the mindset with a

2085
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:38,760
lot of the stuff that we've done is like

2086
01:14:35,319 --> 01:14:41,158
if it works yeah like let's run biob Biz

2087
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:43,239
right well great that's going to cost $8

2088
01:14:41,158 --> 01:14:44,799
million a month to run a commercial

2089
01:14:43,238 --> 01:14:46,000
facility on bobiz I don't even want to

2090
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:47,279
see what the results are going to be

2091
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,679
because I just it's just not going to

2092
01:14:47,279 --> 01:14:51,519
pencil right so it's it's been tough for

2093
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:53,520
me to get on the under canopy lighting

2094
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:55,880
train just because I don't have the amps

2095
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:58,480
uh or the appetite to try to to to to

2096
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:59,960
manage that but I'm sure that there are

2097
01:14:58,479 --> 01:15:03,000
cats that are using it and it's working

2098
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:04,600
well and it probably does pencil yeah um

2099
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:08,000
we have such we've got six different

2100
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:11,400
pre-roll lines in our lineup and so uh

2101
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:13,039
we love bbds like so so a lot of that

2102
01:15:11,399 --> 01:15:14,359
lower stuff that just doesn't develop

2103
01:15:13,039 --> 01:15:15,880
because I don't have the under canopy

2104
01:15:14,359 --> 01:15:17,519
lighting or the the the ppfd down

2105
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:19,840
there's just too low for those lower

2106
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:22,280
nugs to develop fine they have nice TPS

2107
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:24,199
I got no issue with that you know I need

2108
01:15:22,279 --> 01:15:25,800
those bbds right we're always chasing

2109
01:15:24,198 --> 01:15:29,799
more bbds to continue to feed those

2110
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:31,520
pre-roll lines um so yeah I mean so are

2111
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:33,119
you grading yours with the screen and

2112
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:36,320
then separating them like that or how do

2113
01:15:33,119 --> 01:15:38,559
you guys do yeah yeah uh exactly so

2114
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:39,880
again every trim cycle every Cult of our

2115
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:41,480
slightly different we've got certain

2116
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:42,840
strains like our grease cookies that

2117
01:15:41,479 --> 01:15:44,158
that we found in our in our in our

2118
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:45,319
monkey berries hunt so we run a

2119
01:15:44,158 --> 01:15:47,238
strawberries and cream and a grease

2120
01:15:45,319 --> 01:15:49,158
cookies and that grease cookies we can

2121
01:15:47,238 --> 01:15:51,799
we can practically trim every single nug

2122
01:15:49,158 --> 01:15:53,879
on that just because it's so dense um

2123
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:55,600
we're definitely big in defoliation so

2124
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:58,960
we we try to you know we do a week three

2125
01:15:55,600 --> 01:16:00,159
and a week six def um so we we we want

2126
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:01,639
to make sure that we're getting that

2127
01:16:00,158 --> 01:16:03,000
good penetration down there but you know

2128
01:16:01,639 --> 01:16:08,199
with with what we get out of the fluence

2129
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:09,600
fixtures um we're averaging 12 1300 ppfd

2130
01:16:08,198 --> 01:16:12,158
across the tops of the canopy and we're

2131
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:14,280
getting good penetration there so yeah

2132
01:16:12,158 --> 01:16:16,319
yeah yeah uh so yeah it's just been it's

2133
01:16:14,279 --> 01:16:18,960
just been a process of of iterating and

2134
01:16:16,319 --> 01:16:22,279
evolving and chasing always I mean it

2135
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:25,039
drives my team nuts uh but I'm just

2136
01:16:22,279 --> 01:16:26,719
literally relentlessly experimenting

2137
01:16:25,039 --> 01:16:28,920
just constantly trying new things and

2138
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:30,198
seeing how we can improve and that's how

2139
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:31,560
we that's how we got onto the beant

2140
01:16:30,198 --> 01:16:33,960
stock Trin is because I felt like there

2141
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:35,600
was a way to get fertility to go with

2142
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:36,880
the biology that we knew is critical and

2143
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:38,639
with all the compost tees and some of

2144
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:40,319
the different uh the photop

2145
01:16:38,639 --> 01:16:43,719
photosynthesis plus we're a big fan of

2146
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:45,880
that Armory we run Armory um and so

2147
01:16:43,719 --> 01:16:48,039
we're we're big into ensuring that all

2148
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:50,480
the fungal bacterial load in that soil

2149
01:16:48,039 --> 01:16:52,399
is optimized to cycle those nutrients

2150
01:16:50,479 --> 01:16:54,279
right but I knew that the fertility side

2151
01:16:52,399 --> 01:16:55,960
of things could be more efficient and

2152
01:16:54,279 --> 01:16:57,319
potentially more cost effective and

2153
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:59,239
that's and that's why we've been

2154
01:16:57,319 --> 01:17:02,238
experimenting with beanock now for for 5

2155
01:16:59,238 --> 01:17:05,678
years um yeah and and we went through a

2156
01:17:02,238 --> 01:17:07,000
phase where we started it at 100% um and

2157
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:08,600
one of the big challenges and I would

2158
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:12,238
say to anyone who's interested in trying

2159
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:13,480
the bean stock 110% try it but be

2160
01:17:12,238 --> 01:17:15,198
mindful of a couple things if you're

2161
01:17:13,479 --> 01:17:16,439
running in soil in the same way that

2162
01:17:15,198 --> 01:17:17,960
you're talking about the tissue culture

2163
01:17:16,439 --> 01:17:20,879
testing every three months as part of

2164
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:22,639
that sop you have to soil test every

2165
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:24,600
single round that gets loaded into our

2166
01:17:22,639 --> 01:17:26,520
rooms we run a soil test with Logan Labs

2167
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:30,440
it's bucks why would you not want to

2168
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:32,120
know every single time what the the the

2169
01:17:30,439 --> 01:17:34,000
the composition of your soil is yeah

2170
01:17:32,119 --> 01:17:36,439
Logan laugh is great love Logan Labs

2171
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:38,560
yeah totally right so shout out Logan

2172
01:17:36,439 --> 01:17:41,719
Labs I I think that I think that part of

2173
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:44,000
our process was understanding you know

2174
01:17:41,719 --> 01:17:45,520
what our bulk soil was was like cycle to

2175
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,639
cycle how could we continue to stoke

2176
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:48,880
that fertility and how can we do it in a

2177
01:17:47,639 --> 01:17:50,319
way that makes sense and when we first

2178
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:51,880
started running the the bean stock we

2179
01:17:50,319 --> 01:17:53,799
were running it at 100% we were running

2180
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:56,840
all the lines the fortify the KOST the

2181
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:59,279
absolute flower running basis and veg

2182
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:01,079
and we weren't minding the store with

2183
01:17:59,279 --> 01:18:02,840
regular soil testing we saw our salinity

2184
01:18:01,079 --> 01:18:04,679
start to climb as soon as we as soon as

2185
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:06,159
we noticed it we were like oh [ __ ] like

2186
01:18:04,679 --> 01:18:08,359
the salinity is a bit out of whack and

2187
01:18:06,158 --> 01:18:10,279
so you have to be mindful of soil

2188
01:18:08,359 --> 01:18:11,799
testing and and monitoring salinity

2189
01:18:10,279 --> 01:18:13,119
levels monitoring everything but but

2190
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:15,719
certainly when you're running a

2191
01:18:13,119 --> 01:18:17,519
salt-based a mineral based uh uh input

2192
01:18:15,719 --> 01:18:19,158
like that you do need to be you need to

2193
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:21,480
you know keep an eye on that right you

2194
01:18:19,158 --> 01:18:22,759
do reuse your soil right we do yeah we

2195
01:18:21,479 --> 01:18:24,919
exactly exactly yeah if you're not

2196
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:27,679
reusing your soil it's not a big deal EX

2197
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:29,279
if you're reusing your so again that

2198
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:30,920
pencil is better for us so we've got a

2199
01:18:29,279 --> 01:18:32,679
bulk vendor up there that I mean we at

2200
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:35,279
this point we've got over 100 yards of

2201
01:18:32,679 --> 01:18:38,039
soil on the farm and and we just mix 15

2202
01:18:35,279 --> 01:18:40,439
yard batches at a time we re amend uh

2203
01:18:38,039 --> 01:18:42,519
with dry amendments uh we bring more

2204
01:18:40,439 --> 01:18:44,519
bioch chart of the party etc etc so

2205
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:46,080
we're constantly cycling that soil so we

2206
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:47,199
are testing and testing and testing to

2207
01:18:46,079 --> 01:18:48,479
make sure that the composition of that

2208
01:18:47,198 --> 01:18:50,678
soil is what we really are looking for

2209
01:18:48,479 --> 01:18:52,359
when we load in a room so when we

2210
01:18:50,679 --> 01:18:54,000
started working with beanock we we we

2211
01:18:52,359 --> 01:18:55,519
ran the RX that they they had laid out

2212
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,960
for us and it worked I mean we saw it

2213
01:18:55,520 --> 01:19:00,560
just absolutely heroic yields just cycle

2214
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:03,399
after cycle the yields were absolutely

2215
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:05,080
through the roof and one of one of uh

2216
01:19:03,399 --> 01:19:10,279
you know my my current Garden manager

2217
01:19:05,079 --> 01:19:13,679
shout out Morgan um is uh you know one

2218
01:19:10,279 --> 01:19:15,519
of the you know pickiest [ __ ]

2219
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:17,760
when it comes to flavor of smoke and

2220
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:21,520
he's all about running [ __ ] in an

2221
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:25,199
organic soil medium like that's it no

2222
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:26,840
salts and and and when we started you

2223
01:19:25,198 --> 01:19:29,519
know experiment with the beanock we kind

2224
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:32,199
of lost him yeah he just was no longer

2225
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:34,480
passionate about the grow he just lost

2226
01:19:32,198 --> 01:19:36,039
his his Mojo and it was really

2227
01:19:34,479 --> 01:19:38,678
disheartening for me and it was really

2228
01:19:36,039 --> 01:19:40,760
frustrating to see that he had no longer

2229
01:19:38,679 --> 01:19:42,600
really you know committed in the way

2230
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:44,440
that he was before when it was just

2231
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:47,239
compost teas and dry amendments that we

2232
01:19:44,439 --> 01:19:48,799
were scratching in every round and so we

2233
01:19:47,238 --> 01:19:50,879
started doing the Pepsi challenge every

2234
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:52,000
single Harvest every single cultiv our

2235
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:55,000
yeah

2236
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:57,399
and which one did he end up picking over

2237
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:59,279
and over again the one run with beans

2238
01:19:57,399 --> 01:20:00,879
wow and so all of a sudden he's like wow

2239
01:19:59,279 --> 01:20:03,039
so a hybrid model actually is kind of

2240
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:04,880
interesting and so that is what

2241
01:20:03,039 --> 01:20:07,158
ultimately sold him and that is what

2242
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:08,800
sells anyone when it comes to

2243
01:20:07,158 --> 01:20:10,279
experimenting you have to see it for

2244
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:12,600
yourself you have to try it for yourself

2245
01:20:10,279 --> 01:20:14,399
you have to then taste it and you have

2246
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:15,679
to see does this meet my standard does

2247
01:20:14,399 --> 01:20:16,879
because on paper it can look completely

2248
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:18,920
different where you're like okay well

2249
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:21,920
this or you have a the mindset that it

2250
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:23,679
has to be 100% organic and I only want

2251
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:26,000
an organic product I don't want anything

2252
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:27,399
else because the best the plants don't

2253
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,880
[ __ ] care I'm just going to tell you

2254
01:20:27,399 --> 01:20:32,599
right now they need what they need and

2255
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:33,679
if if if what they need is not there go

2256
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:36,280
ahead and let me know how your garden

2257
01:20:33,679 --> 01:20:38,039
looks right so part of it for us is the

2258
01:20:36,279 --> 01:20:39,399
way that we think about being stock so

2259
01:20:38,039 --> 01:20:43,079
what we started doing is we started

2260
01:20:39,399 --> 01:20:44,158
doing a a 33% a 66% and 100% dosing and

2261
01:20:43,079 --> 01:20:45,600
we just started playing around with it

2262
01:20:44,158 --> 01:20:48,000
we started running just absolute flour

2263
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:49,920
we started running absolute flour with

2264
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,039
uh with with K boost we started running

2265
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:53,719
every conceivable combination we could

2266
01:20:52,039 --> 01:20:56,479
at every conceivable dosing that we

2267
01:20:53,719 --> 01:20:58,679
could and and what we found is this

2268
01:20:56,479 --> 01:21:01,279
hybrid model represents essentially a

2269
01:20:58,679 --> 01:21:03,560
perfect insurance policy for an organic

2270
01:21:01,279 --> 01:21:05,238
soil-based approach make sure that the

2271
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:07,199
fertility is there make sure that the

2272
01:21:05,238 --> 01:21:09,359
biology is there if the plants need it

2273
01:21:07,198 --> 01:21:13,079
it's there if they don't need it cool

2274
01:21:09,359 --> 01:21:14,880
but our our our by far best Harvest and

2275
01:21:13,079 --> 01:21:16,479
it's you know cultivar to cultivar

2276
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:18,679
you're going to find differences sure

2277
01:21:16,479 --> 01:21:22,039
but for the most part our sweet spot is

2278
01:21:18,679 --> 01:21:24,639
basically a half dose of that RX in the

2279
01:21:22,039 --> 01:21:27,960
absolute flour that is that's the home

2280
01:21:24,639 --> 01:21:29,400
run for us when we run flour yeah um we

2281
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:31,520
there are certain Cult of ours that love

2282
01:21:29,399 --> 01:21:34,119
that extra potassium and so the K boost

2283
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:35,280
really does play a great role and some

2284
01:21:34,119 --> 01:21:37,119
are heavy feeders some are lighter

2285
01:21:35,279 --> 01:21:38,319
feeders and and so you talked about we

2286
01:21:37,119 --> 01:21:40,920
talked about a moment ago that it takes

2287
01:21:38,319 --> 01:21:42,479
about a year to feno hunt talk about

2288
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:44,279
getting to know a so once you found that

2289
01:21:42,479 --> 01:21:46,839
feno you're all excited about it cool go

2290
01:21:44,279 --> 01:21:50,519
ahead and factor in another year to dial

2291
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:52,840
or more or more or more to then go okay

2292
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:55,480
so more light less light more food less

2293
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:57,600
food whatever the case is and that PL

2294
01:21:55,479 --> 01:22:00,359
changes in that first year it changes a

2295
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:02,320
little bit right and it's going to

2296
01:22:00,359 --> 01:22:03,920
settle out somewhere between the the

2297
01:22:02,319 --> 01:22:05,719
first year and the second year to where

2298
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:08,039
it has that same expression every time

2299
01:22:05,719 --> 01:22:09,840
you grow it yeah because so yeah between

2300
01:22:08,039 --> 01:22:11,800
the the first colonal generation second

2301
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:13,400
colonal third fourth there can be

2302
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:15,800
changes sometimes it's subtle sometimes

2303
01:22:13,399 --> 01:22:18,119
it's drastic uh the most drastic is from

2304
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:19,800
seed to that first colal generation but

2305
01:22:18,119 --> 01:22:21,840
for sure from the first colonal to the

2306
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:24,920
fourth colonal it can it can change

2307
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:26,279
slightly over time too so yeah yeah yeah

2308
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:28,399
I I just think that you know at the end

2309
01:22:26,279 --> 01:22:29,800
of the day um you know everyone wants

2310
01:22:28,399 --> 01:22:31,000
heavy yields I don't think anyone would

2311
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:32,800
say no I don't want heavy yields

2312
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,520
everyone wants flavor right everyone

2313
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:38,639
wants those TPS in there everyone wants

2314
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:39,480
that potency right um and so you know

2315
01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:42,760
the

2316
01:22:39,479 --> 01:22:45,158
beanock fertilizer represents a really

2317
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:47,800
really effective way to ensure that your

2318
01:22:45,158 --> 01:22:49,479
fertility program is on point we're

2319
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:52,199
we're managing in our busy Seas we're

2320
01:22:49,479 --> 01:22:54,198
managing somewhere around 7,000 plants

2321
01:22:52,198 --> 01:22:55,359
right which you know for some grows that

2322
01:22:54,198 --> 01:22:56,719
might

2323
01:22:55,359 --> 01:22:59,599
for other people that might sound like a

2324
01:22:56,719 --> 01:23:02,000
huge number for us it's daunting as [ __ ]

2325
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:04,360
because you can't have you know 50

2326
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:06,039
people on staff managing those those

2327
01:23:04,359 --> 01:23:08,799
plants and expect to have your margins

2328
01:23:06,039 --> 01:23:11,399
make sense right so you're running as

2329
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:12,880
lean a team as you possibly can in order

2330
01:23:11,399 --> 01:23:15,399
to you know make sure that everything's

2331
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:17,679
being taken care of but the the the

2332
01:23:15,399 --> 01:23:19,198
fertility program that you run has to

2333
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:21,319
pencil and it's got to be something that

2334
01:23:19,198 --> 01:23:25,000
from a labor perspective is extremely

2335
01:23:21,319 --> 01:23:28,359
efficient right so the the you know we

2336
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:31,198
we we ran uh be stock for quite a while

2337
01:23:28,359 --> 01:23:34,319
and and and then we we stopped to see if

2338
01:23:31,198 --> 01:23:37,119
like okay if we actually were just you

2339
01:23:34,319 --> 01:23:39,119
know redoubled our efforts with you know

2340
01:23:37,119 --> 01:23:40,960
top dressing and dry amendments and we

2341
01:23:39,119 --> 01:23:42,880
redoubled our efforts on this organic

2342
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:45,359
approach maybe we can pull it off and it

2343
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:47,520
was just it's just so hard you're just

2344
01:23:45,359 --> 01:23:49,158
trying to land a you know like a rocket

2345
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:51,000
on a fraction when you're when you're

2346
01:23:49,158 --> 01:23:52,519
running that program at commercial scale

2347
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:55,600
with that many plants that many moving

2348
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:57,600
Parts it's just to damn hard in my

2349
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:59,400
opinion yeah everyone's got their own

2350
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:02,360
take on it but when you're looking for

2351
01:23:59,399 --> 01:24:04,599
something that ultimately works and

2352
01:24:02,359 --> 01:24:07,439
pencils and works for your

2353
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:09,199
team the beanock is the way that we have

2354
01:24:07,439 --> 01:24:10,960
found and we call it our hybrid model

2355
01:24:09,198 --> 01:24:14,158
right it's the mother mag hybrid model

2356
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:16,239
and it's running really great soil

2357
01:24:14,158 --> 01:24:19,479
that's absolutely loaded with you know

2358
01:24:16,238 --> 01:24:22,198
fungal and bacterial uh dominent uh uh

2359
01:24:19,479 --> 01:24:23,399
biology and then you just the fertility

2360
01:24:22,198 --> 01:24:26,399
is taken care of we don't stress about

2361
01:24:23,399 --> 01:24:28,879
it yeah it just works so that's that's

2362
01:24:26,399 --> 01:24:30,719
been our story with it nice yeah yeah I

2363
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:32,679
wanted to add that uh Tom is actually

2364
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:34,198
currently doing a lot of work on YouTube

2365
01:24:32,679 --> 01:24:36,880
on his own personal Channel kind of

2366
01:24:34,198 --> 01:24:39,799
taking people through how he actually

2367
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:41,840
uses the product right so if anyone

2368
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:44,600
after the podcast is interested into

2369
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:47,639
delving into a more

2370
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:50,159
granular pun maybe intended

2371
01:24:47,639 --> 01:24:51,719
there no I appreciate that so yeah the

2372
01:24:50,158 --> 01:24:53,559
mother Magnolia cultivation YouTube

2373
01:24:51,719 --> 01:24:56,079
channel is brand new we've only got I

2374
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:58,080
think about 12 videos out but part of it

2375
01:24:56,079 --> 01:24:59,479
is just the The Passion of talking about

2376
01:24:58,079 --> 01:25:02,359
you know these different things that we

2377
01:24:59,479 --> 01:25:04,039
work on from uh these different products

2378
01:25:02,359 --> 01:25:05,399
to you know lighting all the different

2379
01:25:04,039 --> 01:25:07,960
things that go into cultivation but

2380
01:25:05,399 --> 01:25:09,960
we're trying to we're trying to to find

2381
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:13,158
a sweet spot where this you know the the

2382
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:14,480
Nexus of of of of cultivation you know

2383
01:25:13,158 --> 01:25:16,839
really is something that people can

2384
01:25:14,479 --> 01:25:17,799
connect with because I I I firmly

2385
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:19,520
believe that you know we're all

2386
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:21,079
cultivating you know cool things in our

2387
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:22,920
lives everyone's you know got their

2388
01:25:21,079 --> 01:25:24,359
thing that they're cultivating right

2389
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:27,000
that that that list is is almost

2390
01:25:24,359 --> 01:25:29,519
Limitless relationships relationships

2391
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:31,719
creativity cooking whatever health and

2392
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:33,719
wellness like there's so much that goes

2393
01:25:31,719 --> 01:25:36,000
into you know a day-to-day you know

2394
01:25:33,719 --> 01:25:39,158
cultivation program and we we want to

2395
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:40,600
ultimately use actual cultivation as a

2396
01:25:39,158 --> 01:25:42,559
place for people to understand that that

2397
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:45,520
mindfulness that intentionality that

2398
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:47,440
Focus that discipline that Relentless

2399
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:49,520
persistence through the resistance that

2400
01:25:47,439 --> 01:25:52,678
you get when you're trying to cultivate

2401
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:54,639
actual plants where bugs are trying to

2402
01:25:52,679 --> 01:25:56,440
you know hijack your crops and all of

2403
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:59,319
the different challenges that go into it

2404
01:25:56,439 --> 01:26:01,000
is a direct correlate to to life and

2405
01:25:59,319 --> 01:26:03,840
everything you're trying to actually

2406
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:05,960
work on in your life and if you can use

2407
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:08,760
a garden as a place to work on those

2408
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:10,279
different skills they are transferable

2409
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:13,840
skills

2410
01:26:10,279 --> 01:26:16,960
100% I agree I agree and as far as like

2411
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:18,760
the industry yeah I mean what's your

2412
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:20,880
opinion on going to school to learn how

2413
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:21,880
to grow I mean I think so this is a

2414
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:24,319
tough one because we've talked about it

2415
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:25,400
with other people and I as a chef yeah

2416
01:26:24,319 --> 01:26:26,679
went to culinary school but I don't

2417
01:26:25,399 --> 01:26:30,439
think other people should go to culinary

2418
01:26:26,679 --> 01:26:33,679
school and I feel like cuz cooking is a

2419
01:26:30,439 --> 01:26:37,359
mentorship yeah skill kit to learn how

2420
01:26:33,679 --> 01:26:39,600
to cook in K it's a it's it's a mentor

2421
01:26:37,359 --> 01:26:41,158
type the best experience is a mentor

2422
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:42,280
type experience where you have where

2423
01:26:41,158 --> 01:26:43,839
you've learned from somebody who's

2424
01:26:42,279 --> 01:26:46,079
learned from somebody else and put their

2425
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:48,360
own touches on it transmission direct

2426
01:26:46,079 --> 01:26:50,399
transmission I believe that the the

2427
01:26:48,359 --> 01:26:53,399
garden is the same thing I feel like the

2428
01:26:50,399 --> 01:26:55,158
best way is to go work as a water boy or

2429
01:26:53,399 --> 01:26:57,599
whatever it is you want to get out there

2430
01:26:55,158 --> 01:27:00,000
you want to learn go grow at home go go

2431
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:01,639
work for somebody go water their plants

2432
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,118
if they like you they'll teach you some

2433
01:27:01,639 --> 01:27:06,159
stuff totally if they don't like you

2434
01:27:03,118 --> 01:27:08,839
they'll fire you but but uh I think that

2435
01:27:06,158 --> 01:27:10,519
that again that hybrid model is exactly

2436
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:12,719
it do it yourself go dig it out of the

2437
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:14,440
dirt yourself figure it out right and

2438
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:15,800
then where you're if you're really

2439
01:27:14,439 --> 01:27:18,279
passionate about it and you really want

2440
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:20,880
to pursue it further 100% you got to get

2441
01:27:18,279 --> 01:27:22,960
tucked under somebody's wing and you got

2442
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:24,679
to you got to Shadow and you got to just

2443
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:26,520
you know be in those trenches and

2444
01:27:24,679 --> 01:27:28,480
understand all of the different nuances

2445
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:31,480
that go into it because it's you know at

2446
01:27:28,479 --> 01:27:33,959
the end of the day um you know again

2447
01:27:31,479 --> 01:27:37,799
just my opinion I think that cultivation

2448
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:40,560
um is a really really challenging uh uh

2449
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:42,119
thing to do at a very high level yeah I

2450
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:44,039
think it's really challenging to do at a

2451
01:27:42,118 --> 01:27:46,118
very high level it's it's not that tough

2452
01:27:44,039 --> 01:27:47,639
to just grow plants you know whether

2453
01:27:46,118 --> 01:27:51,279
it's but at a high level with

2454
01:27:47,639 --> 01:27:52,440
consistency with consistency scale scale

2455
01:27:51,279 --> 01:27:54,880
with multiple

2456
01:27:52,439 --> 01:27:56,198
employees so for the typical hom grower

2457
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:57,880
though who's just ultimately hey I just

2458
01:27:56,198 --> 01:27:59,960
want to do three or four plants whatever

2459
01:27:57,880 --> 01:28:03,359
maybe just a couple that in and of

2460
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:05,118
itself is not a a just a giveaway that

2461
01:28:03,359 --> 01:28:07,479
and of itself will have a lot of

2462
01:28:05,118 --> 01:28:09,319
challenges I think something like this

2463
01:28:07,479 --> 01:28:12,519
is absolutely a killer solution for the

2464
01:28:09,319 --> 01:28:14,960
hom grower who simp

2465
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:16,840
Simplicity a lot of times if you start

2466
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:19,279
simple you're going to have good results

2467
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:22,079
if you try to over complicated it true

2468
01:28:19,279 --> 01:28:24,118
you know that's where you go for sure

2469
01:28:22,079 --> 01:28:26,639
and there's there's going to be some

2470
01:28:24,118 --> 01:28:29,399
some core sort of you know major through

2471
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:31,880
lines whether it's for hom grow or at

2472
01:28:29,399 --> 01:28:34,079
scale but I think that ultimately you

2473
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:37,279
just have to be in the trenches you have

2474
01:28:34,079 --> 01:28:39,359
to actually do it day in and day out

2475
01:28:37,279 --> 01:28:41,960
like any skill like anything right

2476
01:28:39,359 --> 01:28:44,158
cooking learning guitar if you really

2477
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:46,000
want to take it to a really elevated

2478
01:28:44,158 --> 01:28:48,719
level where you want to cultivate that

2479
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:51,439
skill it takes a lot of effort it takes

2480
01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:52,679
a lot of up does it just does or just

2481
01:28:51,439 --> 01:28:54,960
you know and then if you want to be

2482
01:28:52,679 --> 01:28:57,079
great yeah if you want to be great it

2483
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:58,840
takes a lot more right so what I'm

2484
01:28:57,079 --> 01:29:01,279
hoping for our YouTube channel is that

2485
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:03,400
we can sort of throw you know our iron

2486
01:29:01,279 --> 01:29:06,359
in the fire give our perspective about

2487
01:29:03,399 --> 01:29:09,198
what cultivating you know our our style

2488
01:29:06,359 --> 01:29:11,479
of cultivation in Oregon on our farm how

2489
01:29:09,198 --> 01:29:13,439
we run it yeah hoping that we can

2490
01:29:11,479 --> 01:29:14,799
actually learn from other people that

2491
01:29:13,439 --> 01:29:16,759
actually come into that community that

2492
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:18,079
have comments already just in the first

2493
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:19,960
you know three four weeks of posting

2494
01:29:18,079 --> 01:29:22,359
videos we've gotten great comments and

2495
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:24,158
great feedback from people I'm like damn

2496
01:29:22,359 --> 01:29:26,079
that's another way of doing it yeah

2497
01:29:24,158 --> 01:29:28,479
absolutely there's so many different

2498
01:29:26,079 --> 01:29:30,679
paths to that Mountaintop I'm hoping

2499
01:29:28,479 --> 01:29:32,158
that by actually just sharing what we've

2500
01:29:30,679 --> 01:29:34,760
learned over the last 10 years of

2501
01:29:32,158 --> 01:29:36,839
cultivating cannabis at scale I'm hoping

2502
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:38,320
that we're going to learn more as we

2503
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:40,199
actually share that information that

2504
01:29:38,319 --> 01:29:41,639
becomes sort of this great feedback loop

2505
01:29:40,198 --> 01:29:43,000
where we can share what we've learned

2506
01:29:41,639 --> 01:29:45,639
and then we can learn from other people

2507
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:47,238
that are saying you know this is how I

2508
01:29:45,639 --> 01:29:49,039
do it this is what works for us so

2509
01:29:47,238 --> 01:29:51,319
beautiful right now and the community

2510
01:29:49,039 --> 01:29:53,719
aspect as well is 100% that's it I mean

2511
01:29:51,319 --> 01:29:55,799
I think that's at the end of the day the

2512
01:29:53,719 --> 01:29:57,719
e system up in Oregon it's super super

2513
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:59,639
tight-knit and there are some phenomenal

2514
01:29:57,719 --> 01:30:01,359
Growers up there I have to give my you

2515
01:29:59,639 --> 01:30:03,279
have different genetics up there too you

2516
01:30:01,359 --> 01:30:04,799
know you have completely different gen I

2517
01:30:03,279 --> 01:30:06,198
I go to the dispenser I see all kinds of

2518
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:08,520
stuff that we don't see in the Bay Area

2519
01:30:06,198 --> 01:30:10,279
we see more sativa you know they're

2520
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:11,679
definitely more sativa and more stuff

2521
01:30:10,279 --> 01:30:13,960
that's you know I think there's more

2522
01:30:11,679 --> 01:30:17,440
diversity up there but there's always

2523
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:19,480
been I feel like we back in 1997 I grew

2524
01:30:17,439 --> 01:30:21,319
the organ blueberry it wasn't DJ shorts

2525
01:30:19,479 --> 01:30:23,279
it was these spear plants that grew

2526
01:30:21,319 --> 01:30:24,840
really tall there's a three blueberries

2527
01:30:23,279 --> 01:30:26,439
that I know there's Oregon blueberry

2528
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:28,560
there's the DJ Short Blueberry which was

2529
01:30:26,439 --> 01:30:31,439
a short planty right and then there was

2530
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:32,960
a one that was from Canada the Canada

2531
01:30:31,439 --> 01:30:34,399
blueberry right which my friend just

2532
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:36,639
gave me some of which was good and

2533
01:30:34,399 --> 01:30:38,799
that's why our blueberry short stack is

2534
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:41,239
currently on ice and not in our lineup

2535
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:43,400
yeah because the plant structure yeah

2536
01:30:41,238 --> 01:30:46,039
was such a [ __ ] to deal with you

2537
01:30:43,399 --> 01:30:48,079
know in production and the yields were

2538
01:30:46,039 --> 01:30:50,359
just not great the flower it's some of

2539
01:30:48,079 --> 01:30:52,840
the absolute best flower that we have

2540
01:30:50,359 --> 01:30:54,599
ever grown full stop and people

2541
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:55,560
absolutely hit us up on regular basis

2542
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:57,119
like when are you going to bring back

2543
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:59,199
the blueberry there's a few cultivar

2544
01:30:57,118 --> 01:31:01,158
like that just go blueberry muffin it'll

2545
01:30:59,198 --> 01:31:03,879
work that's a good one it yields

2546
01:31:01,158 --> 01:31:06,279
finishes quick those seeds are pretty

2547
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:08,719
homogenous I'm not sure but I I we the

2548
01:31:06,279 --> 01:31:10,759
cut the cut the Clone is great so again

2549
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:11,960
then this is why company this is why we

2550
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:14,280
wouldn't do that is because there's

2551
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:16,560
blueberry muffin out there like I like

2552
01:31:14,279 --> 01:31:18,559
it I like your model so then it's like

2553
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:20,320
from our perspective it's a strain game

2554
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:21,679
as a producer up in Oregon it's such a

2555
01:31:20,319 --> 01:31:24,399
competitive market and there's people

2556
01:31:21,679 --> 01:31:26,079
that are doing it at such a high level

2557
01:31:24,399 --> 01:31:27,679
that we don't want to be growing

2558
01:31:26,079 --> 01:31:29,600
something that somebody else has we

2559
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:31,560
don't want to have to have so yours are

2560
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:35,440
all exclusive pretty much you either

2561
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:37,320
pheno hunted them or pretty much there's

2562
01:31:35,439 --> 01:31:40,319
clearly going to be some overlap you're

2563
01:31:37,319 --> 01:31:43,679
not growing Jagger no no and and so like

2564
01:31:40,319 --> 01:31:45,719
the Exotic stuff like we we feel like we

2565
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:48,118
were early to the Exotic party and that

2566
01:31:45,719 --> 01:31:49,480
other Growers started seeing our exotic

2567
01:31:48,118 --> 01:31:50,880
gear that was that we were you know

2568
01:31:49,479 --> 01:31:52,799
posting on Instagram and putting out in

2569
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:54,719
the shops and then people start then we

2570
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:56,199
started seeing exotic slowly start you

2571
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:57,960
know percolating through the ecosystem

2572
01:31:56,198 --> 01:32:00,799
up there I could be completely wrong I'm

2573
01:31:57,960 --> 01:32:02,520
not what whatever but the point is that

2574
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:05,719
you have to be really careful and at

2575
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:06,800
some point if you've got a a strain that

2576
01:32:05,719 --> 01:32:07,880
that that you're loving and that's

2577
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:09,159
working really well and then all of a

2578
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:11,079
sudden two three other people start

2579
01:32:09,158 --> 01:32:12,359
running it that's probably time to go

2580
01:32:11,079 --> 01:32:16,000
ahead and retire that and move on to

2581
01:32:12,359 --> 01:32:17,960
something new um it's it's it's just uh

2582
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:20,840
it's a really competitive market up in

2583
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:23,158
Oregon I don't know the the SoCal Market

2584
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:24,639
uh the California Market R Lemon Cherry

2585
01:32:23,158 --> 01:32:28,679
gelato

2586
01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:31,199
got it yeah yeah I mean runs sorry runs

2587
01:32:28,679 --> 01:32:33,719
called 10 different things it still runs

2588
01:32:31,198 --> 01:32:35,359
Lemon Cherry G called 10 20 30 different

2589
01:32:33,719 --> 01:32:37,639
things it's still the same my phone I

2590
01:32:35,359 --> 01:32:39,880
just course yeah so I just I I I went

2591
01:32:37,639 --> 01:32:41,239
ahead I wanted to just you know have a

2592
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:44,480
quick you know rundown of some of the

2593
01:32:41,238 --> 01:32:46,000
genetics my brain does not function the

2594
01:32:44,479 --> 01:32:47,519
way that yours does when it comes to

2595
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:49,158
genetics and keeping all the different

2596
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:50,800
strain names and it's kind of the guilt

2597
01:32:49,158 --> 01:32:53,039
that I was talking about earlier I can't

2598
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:54,520
[ __ ] do it I love it so much I can't

2599
01:32:53,039 --> 01:32:57,158
not keep

2600
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:59,960
so back in the 90s in Oregon we got

2601
01:32:57,158 --> 01:33:03,559
stuff from Eugene we got the dog we got

2602
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:05,840
the fourway dog well I never got the dog

2603
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:09,159
[ __ ] but we had the dog which was chem

2604
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:11,279
dog right we got it as D AWG was from

2605
01:33:09,158 --> 01:33:15,799
for they they renamed it because it's

2606
01:33:11,279 --> 01:33:17,599
really dog but we had the Trinity which

2607
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:19,840
was pretty amazing there was the

2608
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:21,920
four-way there was the corn and there

2609
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:23,279
was the snow not the snow cap we just

2610
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:25,039
got it was the snow it was very

2611
01:33:23,279 --> 01:33:26,679
different but those were the organ

2612
01:33:25,039 --> 01:33:29,359
genetics that I remember that came down

2613
01:33:26,679 --> 01:33:31,158
that just blew my mind like that's when

2614
01:33:29,359 --> 01:33:32,559
I was like organ has the genetics they

2615
01:33:31,158 --> 01:33:34,439
have the stuff because we had good stuff

2616
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:36,280
in the bay bay area too obviously I mean

2617
01:33:34,439 --> 01:33:38,960
the bay area has been an epicenter for a

2618
01:33:36,279 --> 01:33:41,158
long time but or's done it yeah I've

2619
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:42,560
been getting genetics from from the 90s

2620
01:33:41,158 --> 01:33:45,118
it's almost like all the way back then

2621
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:48,560
Bay Area was like a cultural epicenter

2622
01:33:45,118 --> 01:33:49,559
and we were kind of hijacking a lot from

2623
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:53,039
the

2624
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:55,639
pnw it almost like from from a genetic

2625
01:33:53,039 --> 01:33:57,880
perspective genetic perspective like I I

2626
01:33:55,639 --> 01:34:00,079
felt like a lot of it I think Santa Cruz

2627
01:33:57,880 --> 01:34:02,118
was like a big epicenter right and I

2628
01:34:00,079 --> 01:34:03,399
think humble also like I think there's a

2629
01:34:02,118 --> 01:34:06,158
lot of people that never got credit for

2630
01:34:03,399 --> 01:34:07,479
their amazing work in Humble especially

2631
01:34:06,158 --> 01:34:10,279
like the farmers up there I mean there

2632
01:34:07,479 --> 01:34:13,198
was so many farmers doing it and then

2633
01:34:10,279 --> 01:34:15,960
you know we've had guys talking about

2634
01:34:13,198 --> 01:34:18,960
generation after Generation Um obsolete

2635
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:20,399
you know it's like he's uh I don't know

2636
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:23,800
if you're familiar with obsolete Allen

2637
01:34:20,399 --> 01:34:25,439
from obsolete he is obsolete but anyway

2638
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:27,279
you know Farmers going generation to

2639
01:34:25,439 --> 01:34:28,799
generation they'd select their best

2640
01:34:27,279 --> 01:34:29,840
plant and they they'd basically

2641
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:31,279
pollinate it and those would be the

2642
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:33,480
seeds for the next year almost like

2643
01:34:31,279 --> 01:34:35,238
heirloom tomatoes huh I mean it's it's

2644
01:34:33,479 --> 01:34:37,359
the same concept they would do it like

2645
01:34:35,238 --> 01:34:39,319
like an a model right before we had

2646
01:34:37,359 --> 01:34:40,839
before they had clones even if they were

2647
01:34:39,319 --> 01:34:42,719
clone that that was how they brought the

2648
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:44,960
genetics and kept them alive and get

2649
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:46,880
next season's crop ready some of the

2650
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:48,480
most amazing stuff interesting you know

2651
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:49,920
and there was bag seeds and then there

2652
01:34:48,479 --> 01:34:51,479
was all kinds of stuff so there was a

2653
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:53,760
lot of things going on there was a lot

2654
01:34:51,479 --> 01:34:55,238
of factors and the Europeans also did a

2655
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:58,199
lot of interesting breeding as well

2656
01:34:55,238 --> 01:35:00,359
Strain Hunters strain yeah I mean not

2657
01:34:58,198 --> 01:35:02,000
just Strain Hunters the guys but yeah

2658
01:35:00,359 --> 01:35:04,559
Strain Hunters going all over the world

2659
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:06,000
you know Ben droners Arian Ross Cam and

2660
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:07,320
those guys killing it over at Greenhouse

2661
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:10,079
Seed Company I'm good friends with those

2662
01:35:07,319 --> 01:35:12,279
guys but uh you know it's like early

2663
01:35:10,079 --> 01:35:14,118
days of Sensei seeds those guys did they

2664
01:35:12,279 --> 01:35:17,000
amazing adventures all over Simon from

2665
01:35:14,118 --> 01:35:19,079
serious seeds he did amazing work he's

2666
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:21,279
like a true F1 breeder what a life they

2667
01:35:19,079 --> 01:35:23,679
must have lived man dude I mean just

2668
01:35:21,279 --> 01:35:26,359
really interesting stories and amazing

2669
01:35:23,679 --> 01:35:29,560
gentics and like to take land race

2670
01:35:26,359 --> 01:35:31,399
genetics and get AK-47 out of it it's

2671
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:33,560
like most people they they couldn't even

2672
01:35:31,399 --> 01:35:35,638
fathom what it would take to do that and

2673
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:36,960
I think a lot of people it's so far over

2674
01:35:35,639 --> 01:35:38,079
their head they would really need to

2675
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:40,118
understand what happens with land race

2676
01:35:38,079 --> 01:35:42,399
genetics and how hard it is to breed

2677
01:35:40,118 --> 01:35:44,759
with this genetics unable and then you

2678
01:35:42,399 --> 01:35:47,279
throw stuff that's like yeah I mean just

2679
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:48,760
wild that you would never use and the

2680
01:35:47,279 --> 01:35:50,759
amount of space it would take to do

2681
01:35:48,760 --> 01:35:52,079
something properly yeah yeah I think

2682
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:53,639
that's the thing that's just so you know

2683
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:55,800
so daunting when you when you look at

2684
01:35:53,639 --> 01:35:57,719
even pheno hunting regardless I mean

2685
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:59,239
breeding is probably like pheno hunting

2686
01:35:57,719 --> 01:36:00,600
on steroids in terms of the difficulty

2687
01:35:59,238 --> 01:36:02,118
right in terms of actually achieving

2688
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:03,760
what you're trying to achieve and the

2689
01:36:02,118 --> 01:36:05,759
time that it takes well a lot of times

2690
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:07,760
you have a direction and you're going

2691
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:09,159
this way and you end up over here but at

2692
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:11,039
least you're making forward progress

2693
01:36:09,158 --> 01:36:12,319
right I just you know it's just I I

2694
01:36:11,039 --> 01:36:14,600
think that a lot of it is just you know

2695
01:36:12,319 --> 01:36:16,880
people just don't want to spend the time

2696
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:18,800
because it's just so challenging it's

2697
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:20,920
it's it's it's expensive both in time

2698
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:23,000
and money and then with no promise that

2699
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:24,600
you're actually going to get what you're

2700
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,960
basically opening baseball card pack

2701
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:27,679
that's that's basically it so why not

2702
01:36:25,960 --> 01:36:29,359
just you know get some cuts and and

2703
01:36:27,679 --> 01:36:31,560
let's move on that's why it's you start

2704
01:36:29,359 --> 01:36:33,439
to see the you know the homogeneous

2705
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:35,080
layout of of of strain starts to emerge

2706
01:36:33,439 --> 01:36:36,198
and you get the purple punch everywhere

2707
01:36:35,079 --> 01:36:38,760
yeah I mean I think that's going to work

2708
01:36:36,198 --> 01:36:40,118
for some you get Jack you start breeding

2709
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:42,360
stuff and you cross and stuff and then

2710
01:36:40,118 --> 01:36:43,920
you end up with Jack like like not and

2711
01:36:42,359 --> 01:36:46,238
not the good quality of Jack we use that

2712
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:48,158
as a reference but it's like the you

2713
01:36:46,238 --> 01:36:50,519
know it all come Adam dun actually said

2714
01:36:48,158 --> 01:36:52,158
that originally but like you overbreed

2715
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:55,520
stuff you end up with Jack right like it

2716
01:36:52,158 --> 01:36:57,839
all comes back to that TP lyine and that

2717
01:36:55,520 --> 01:37:00,719
that Prof like the haze profile a little

2718
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:02,480
bit the lmon especially that pops out

2719
01:37:00,719 --> 01:37:05,760
and it's super dominant and not

2720
01:37:02,479 --> 01:37:07,319
recessive and will eat up any cool

2721
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:10,079
profile you cross it with anything and

2722
01:37:07,319 --> 01:37:11,759
it ends up with that eventually and yeah

2723
01:37:10,079 --> 01:37:13,079
I mean trying to I think you know going

2724
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:15,400
back to what you're talking about is you

2725
01:37:13,079 --> 01:37:16,439
know hunting land race right trying to I

2726
01:37:15,399 --> 01:37:18,679
guess what we're really trying to do

2727
01:37:16,439 --> 01:37:21,158
there is we're trying to find a new

2728
01:37:18,679 --> 01:37:23,840
color a new flavor that's maybe just

2729
01:37:21,158 --> 01:37:25,719
been hidden I need a magenta right yeah

2730
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:28,679
you know yeah I need

2731
01:37:25,719 --> 01:37:30,480
some whe right and so that's an

2732
01:37:28,679 --> 01:37:33,039
interesting way of looking at it just

2733
01:37:30,479 --> 01:37:35,559
trying to find that new something that's

2734
01:37:33,039 --> 01:37:38,279
that's never and I get excited about you

2735
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:39,880
know the most craziest things uh fried

2736
01:37:38,279 --> 01:37:41,399
chicken I want Fried Chicken turps you

2737
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:42,960
know like that excites me though when

2738
01:37:41,399 --> 01:37:45,799
we're going through squeezy we're like

2739
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:48,118
whoa we smell this or we smell that or

2740
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:49,760
translate right like we get the Belgian

2741
01:37:48,118 --> 01:37:51,839
waffles they smell like Belgian waffles

2742
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:52,960
and maple syrup yeah you know and

2743
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:55,159
sometimes it doesn't translate to the

2744
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:57,279
smoke but on the plant it's really cool

2745
01:37:55,158 --> 01:38:00,598
yeah no our current top turp is pot

2746
01:37:57,279 --> 01:38:03,000
roast ni in our snow skunk it's by far

2747
01:38:00,599 --> 01:38:05,279
the favorite smoke on on the farm and it

2748
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:07,520
just smells like straight up pot roast

2749
01:38:05,279 --> 01:38:08,880
like that's what it smells like yeah you

2750
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:11,000
open a bag and it's like that's your

2751
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:13,000
denty Moore that you had as a kid or

2752
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:16,760
whatever it's crazy you should name it

2753
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:19,000
auu a it's actually a great name that is

2754
01:38:16,760 --> 01:38:20,719
a good name yeah it's it's funny you

2755
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:22,760
might be stealing that that's good

2756
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:24,560
that's good yeah yeah I mean certain

2757
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:26,560
things and people get excited about

2758
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:28,440
certain things so you know in in the Bay

2759
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:30,080
Area and in La I think a lot of it's

2760
01:38:28,439 --> 01:38:32,759
like it's got to be purple candy gas to

2761
01:38:30,079 --> 01:38:34,639
check the boxes right if it's not candy

2762
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:37,440
and it's not purple in this market you

2763
01:38:34,639 --> 01:38:39,199
can have gas you know gas is good but

2764
01:38:37,439 --> 01:38:41,079
you got to have the candy it's almost

2765
01:38:39,198 --> 01:38:43,118
like the evolution of the purple

2766
01:38:41,079 --> 01:38:45,198
movement you know it's like purple never

2767
01:38:43,118 --> 01:38:46,799
went away it just turned into candy gas

2768
01:38:45,198 --> 01:38:48,238
that's what it feels like to me oh it

2769
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:50,520
went away for a minute it was like you

2770
01:38:48,238 --> 01:38:54,000
couldn't sell GDP to save your life like

2771
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:58,480
20 years ago 15 years ago let see it

2772
01:38:54,000 --> 01:39:01,560
years right say 2010 is more the GDP

2773
01:38:58,479 --> 01:39:04,279
kind of went down GDP yeah maybe 2008

2774
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:05,760
but GDP was on top you you know the guys

2775
01:39:04,279 --> 01:39:07,800
like Luke scarmazzo he's been on the

2776
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:10,599
podcast it's like he built his career

2777
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:12,239
his dispensary was built on GDP Jimmy

2778
01:39:10,599 --> 01:39:13,319
Meyers is the guy he was on the podcast

2779
01:39:12,238 --> 01:39:15,319
he's the one who brought GDP to the

2780
01:39:13,319 --> 01:39:16,519
market right he's the one who got it he

2781
01:39:15,319 --> 01:39:18,719
didn't breed it but he's the one who

2782
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:20,560
brought it and got it named and it was

2783
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:21,840
hot hot but then there was a point where

2784
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:24,320
like you couldn't sell it to save your

2785
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:26,599
life yeah and then with cookies has

2786
01:39:24,319 --> 01:39:28,840
started making a come super rare to find

2787
01:39:26,599 --> 01:39:31,079
GDP in the Oregon Market it's just here

2788
01:39:28,840 --> 01:39:32,960
too now it's just not there we have a

2789
01:39:31,079 --> 01:39:34,880
GDP that's crossed with our alpha blue

2790
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:37,000
that we call Sangria Kush nobody wants

2791
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:39,599
to grow real GDP though it takes a long

2792
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:41,840
time to veg it's a short plant so so the

2793
01:39:39,599 --> 01:39:44,239
reason why this the the reason why our

2794
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:45,880
Sanga Kush is on the is is again on Ice

2795
01:39:44,238 --> 01:39:48,118
we are going to bring her back in a

2796
01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:50,199
cycle is just because she's such a fussy

2797
01:39:48,118 --> 01:39:52,759
[ __ ] she's just a nightmare to work

2798
01:39:50,198 --> 01:39:55,719
with but the a flower that comes off of

2799
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:58,079
her is absolutely stunning absolutely

2800
01:39:55,719 --> 01:40:00,279
stunning she uh you know checks the

2801
01:39:58,079 --> 01:40:03,198
potency box the turps on her is just

2802
01:40:00,279 --> 01:40:05,118
that loud Berry just blast it's

2803
01:40:03,198 --> 01:40:06,678
unbelievable right unbelievable and

2804
01:40:05,118 --> 01:40:08,639
she's been gone now from our lineup for

2805
01:40:06,679 --> 01:40:10,520
over a year and we were just recently at

2806
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:12,319
a at a at a big nectar party event

2807

it's the magic of that granddaddy purple

2816
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:34,560
that that that really is GDP is pretty

2817
01:40:32,439 --> 01:40:37,118
special yeah the flavor don't try to

2818
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:40,080
tell me that GDP is not in cookies right

2819
01:40:37,118 --> 01:40:42,960
so that's oh so you Cherry Pie Cherry

01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:49,439
so yeah cherry pie Herms a little bit

2822
01:40:46,118 --> 01:40:51,198
GDP Herms a little bit um only one I

2823
01:40:49,439 --> 01:40:54,000
grew was urk I

2824
01:40:51,198 --> 01:40:55,638
thinkest had experience with with the

2825
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:57,800
GDP

2826
01:40:55,639 --> 01:41:00,159
herming I had most the experience with

2827
01:40:57,800 --> 01:41:01,840
growing yeah I mean I did I had actually

2828
01:41:00,158 --> 01:41:04,679
I take that back I had a story where I

2829
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:07,560
got seeds from some guy and I learned

2830
01:41:04,679 --> 01:41:09,279
early on that uh you need to pheno hunt

2831
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:12,039
every batch of seeds you get from people

2832
01:41:09,279 --> 01:41:14,198
because the first batch no issues second

2833
01:41:12,039 --> 01:41:15,760
batch and up you know and we sold them

2834
01:41:14,198 --> 01:41:17,719
under our brand and I learned that you

2835
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:19,400
make your own seeds you don't sell seeds

2836
01:41:17,719 --> 01:41:23,439
under your brand that other people have

2837
01:41:19,399 --> 01:41:25,039
made because yeah it was just access see

2838
01:41:23,439 --> 01:41:28,519
good you know I'm glad it happened so

2839
01:41:25,039 --> 01:41:30,599
early on with my brand because if it

2840
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:31,760
hadn't happened who knows down the road

2841
01:41:30,599 --> 01:41:33,560
what would have happened but it made it

2842
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:36,360
could have bit you bad yeah and I

2843
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:40,560
understood and and you know that

2844
01:41:36,359 --> 01:41:42,359
was 14 years ago right what I I had a or

2845
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:44,560
13 years ago but it was a it was a

2846
01:41:42,359 --> 01:41:45,759
wakeup call and it was like okay yeah

2847
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:47,480
this is how you do things the right way

2848
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:49,400
and you got to test everything right so

2849
01:41:47,479 --> 01:41:51,039
you test everything you test your own

2850
01:41:49,399 --> 01:41:52,399
stuff you test other people's stuff if

2851
01:41:51,039 --> 01:41:53,920
you're going to use it if you're going

2852
01:41:52,399 --> 01:41:55,679
to breed with it you want to test it

2853
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:57,239
before you don't just get a cut and

2854
01:41:55,679 --> 01:41:59,079
breed with it and then sell the seeds

2855
01:41:57,238 --> 01:42:01,319
you got to make sure to test it I mean

2856
01:41:59,079 --> 01:42:02,960
we make 300 outcrosses a year basically

2857
01:42:01,319 --> 01:42:05,039
every year like sometimes more sometimes

2858
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:07,279
a little bit less but we only release a

2859
01:42:05,039 --> 01:42:08,599
small portion of those to get tested now

2860
01:42:07,279 --> 01:42:09,880
sometimes they have intersex trades

2861
01:42:08,599 --> 01:42:11,279
sometimes they have some weird stuff

2862
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:13,118
going on but but at least you can tell

2863
01:42:11,279 --> 01:42:14,920
people at least you can tell people and

2864
01:42:13,118 --> 01:42:16,319
you have honest feedback you know I mean

2865
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:18,520
I think that's super important I mean

2866
01:42:16,319 --> 01:42:21,158
there's plenty of myself included if you

2867
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:24,080
told me hey look this pack of seeds it's

2868
01:42:21,158 --> 01:42:27,439
got some fire in it but there's

2869
01:42:24,079 --> 01:42:29,519
also I'm gonna go for that pack that's

2870
01:42:27,439 --> 01:42:31,399
who I am but some guys aren't and some

2871
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:32,960
guys are like I only buy rags and it's

2872
01:42:31,399 --> 01:42:34,839
like that's okay that's you you there's

2873
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:36,719
no problem with only buying rags and I

2874
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:38,400
you know and as as long as there's

2875
01:42:36,719 --> 01:42:39,800
disclosure on that seed pack I think

2876
01:42:38,399 --> 01:42:41,799
that's all fair I think it's fair game

2877
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:44,199
right where you're like hey bag seed or

2878
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:46,719
whatever it is go find it cuz there's

2879
01:42:44,198 --> 01:42:48,519
maybe a a golden ticket in there yeah

2880
01:42:46,719 --> 01:42:50,679
that's fair game I think it's when it's

2881
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:51,920
it's presented as something that's not

2882
01:42:50,679 --> 01:42:53,359
that they get that's where the heartburn

2883
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:55,800
kicks in oh there something yeah it's

2884
01:42:53,359 --> 01:42:57,679
like espe when you're spending $200 you

2885
01:42:55,800 --> 01:43:01,599
know for oh it's crazy what seeds can go

2886
01:42:57,679 --> 01:43:04,039
for these days yeah Leo from a ficado he

2887
01:43:01,599 --> 01:43:06,719
sells his seeds for whatever 200 bucks a

2888
01:43:04,039 --> 01:43:08,599
pack and you know he's one of the best

2889
01:43:06,719 --> 01:43:11,719
breeders I know to he's also a friend

2890
01:43:08,599 --> 01:43:14,840
and great breeder but uh it's funny

2891
01:43:11,719 --> 01:43:18,439
because like his seeds go for $2500 on

2892
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:20,440
the the secondary Market what yeah yeah

2893
01:43:18,439 --> 01:43:22,719
once once like a seed pack is found to

2894
01:43:20,439 --> 01:43:25,118
be like a fire pack and then there's no

2895
01:43:22,719 --> 01:43:25,118
more

2896
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:33,319
crosses for a while were going crazy

2897
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:35,119
before sense before SE junkie switched

2898
01:43:33,319 --> 01:43:37,039
over some of his old packs were going

2899
01:43:35,118 --> 01:43:39,439
crazy because people just the original

2900
01:43:37,039 --> 01:43:40,960
Rainbow belts once those sold out and it

2901
01:43:39,439 --> 01:43:43,079

2913
01:44:07,079 --> 01:44:11,118
the 20 that's that's the that's the one

2914
01:44:09,319 --> 01:44:14,079
that Fletcher Used to breed with I'm not

2915
01:44:11,118 --> 01:44:16,079
sure no I think I've had the 2.0 so I've

2916
01:44:14,079 --> 01:44:18,519
had two rainbow belts fenos that were

2917
01:44:16,079 --> 01:44:23,479
crazy one was one that I found but it

2918
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:25,040
was an awful plant it was so good yeah

2919
01:44:23,479 --> 01:44:26,559
but it was just I mean sometimes I

2920
01:44:25,039 --> 01:44:28,519
regret not keeping the plant just

2921
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:31,199
because it tasted so incredible but

2922
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:33,960
we're talking about it gave 25% of the

2923
01:44:31,198 --> 01:44:35,559
yield of the next lowest plant yeah you

2924
01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:37,439
know it was just kind of like what am I

2925
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:38,520
going to do with it was incredible and

2926
01:44:37,439 --> 01:44:40,158
what do you do with something like that

2927
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:41,599
I'll tell you you breed with it right

2928
01:44:40,158 --> 01:44:43,439
you breed with it so anything you got

2929
01:44:41,599 --> 01:44:44,920
something like that where it's special

2930
01:44:43,439 --> 01:44:46,079
where it's like those trips are amazing

2931
01:44:44,920 --> 01:44:47,760
you don't grow that like that's

2932
01:44:46,079 --> 01:44:49,519
something especially if it doesn't hm

2933
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:52,119
out that's something you breed with

2934
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:54,599
because those things just those those

2935
01:44:52,118 --> 01:44:56,198
are very rare right and even though it

2936
01:44:54,599 --> 01:44:57,960
doesn't yield a lot if it has that

2937
01:44:56,198 --> 01:44:59,719
amazing expression you can still turn

2938
01:44:57,960 --> 01:45:01,158
that into something down the road and so

2939
01:44:59,719 --> 01:45:03,319
a lot of times people like nope it

2940
01:45:01,158 --> 01:45:04,879
doesn't yield well it's like did you

2941
01:45:03,319 --> 01:45:06,198
smoke it and it was amazing maybe you

2942
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:08,159
should have kept it for breeding you

2943
01:45:06,198 --> 01:45:09,638
know at least that's that's how I think

2944
01:45:08,158 --> 01:45:12,079
for sure if you find anyone who is

2945
01:45:09,639 --> 01:45:15,960
growing the rainbow belts 20 yeah uh I

2946
01:45:12,079 --> 01:45:18,719
love it it's not as uh I would say high

2947
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:20,520
high note trebly as uh Skittles right

2948
01:45:18,719 --> 01:45:22,118

2949
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:24,800
like a sweet sweet violin it's a little

2950

milk and cream in there and some funk

2952
01:45:27,399 --> 01:45:31,638
not as funky as the the moonbow we were

2953
01:45:29,118 --> 01:45:33,399
talking about and it's nice and potent

2954
01:45:31,639 --> 01:45:36,639

beanock actually showing you how he uses

2980
01:46:29,359 --> 01:46:33,598
it and for us we just think it's so

2981
01:46:31,399 --> 01:46:36,519
valuable to show people how it's being

2982
01:46:33,599 --> 01:46:38,480
used at scale um and for Tom to be

01:47:14,319 --> 01:47:18,399
party with nectar they had I think four

3001
01:47:17,039 --> 01:47:19,920
locations when we first started

3002
01:47:18,399 --> 01:47:23,439
delivering to them in

3003
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:25,880
2016 and it's a quick uh short story

3004
01:47:23,439 --> 01:47:27,638
here that we had uh same breeder who did

3005
01:47:25,880 --> 01:47:30,520
the alpha blue yeah and who did that

3006
01:47:27,639 --> 01:47:33,400
sangria Kush had gotten us a cut that he

3007
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:36,320
called sour lime mhm super triny

3008
01:47:33,399 --> 01:47:38,839
dominant cut it had the white in it it

3009
01:47:36,319 --> 01:47:42,079
was just a phenomenal

3010
01:47:38,840 --> 01:47:44,360
cultivar and he was getting rid of it

3011
01:47:42,079 --> 01:47:46,880
was like you know do what you can with

3012
01:47:44,359 --> 01:47:49,639
this um and so we ran

3013
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:52,840
it and it was uh you know we sent it off

3014
01:47:49,639 --> 01:47:54,679
for testing definitely was exciting dur

3015
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:57,520
during the first grow of the first table

3016
01:47:54,679 --> 01:47:59,079
of it and on uh Saturday at 7:00 my

3017
01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:00,679
phone rings and it's the director of the

3018
01:47:59,079 --> 01:48:02,319
lab that did the testing and he's like

3019
01:48:00,679 --> 01:48:04,079
yeah we got an issue with that that sour

3020
01:48:02,319 --> 01:48:06,799
line that we tested I was like [ __ ] what

3021
01:48:04,079 --> 01:48:08,198
happened did we fail for something like

3022
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:11,560
dude I don't know how to tell you this

3023
01:48:08,198 --> 01:48:13,799
but uh it came back at 30% and at the

3024
01:48:11,560 --> 01:48:15,320
time 30% was like a unicorn now it's a

3025
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:18,520
[ __ ] joke because testing has gotten

3026
01:48:15,319 --> 01:48:20,000
so perverted yeah ex but but at the time

3027
01:48:18,520 --> 01:48:22,440
they had they hadn't had like maybe they

3028
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:23,279
had another 30% inflated yeah it there

3029
01:48:22,439 --> 01:48:25,439
was

3030
01:48:23,279 --> 01:48:27,559
it super rare it was an absolute Rarity

3031
01:48:25,439 --> 01:48:29,598
and so we had I had reached out to the

3032
01:48:27,560 --> 01:48:32,080
team at nectar and IID said because we

3033
01:48:29,599 --> 01:48:34,960
we had the super strong lime profile I

3034
01:48:32,079 --> 01:48:37,519
mean like like Sprite with a couple of

3035
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:39,560
slices of lime in it bright that loud

3036
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:41,480
yeah and I and I said hey guys would you

3037
01:48:39,560 --> 01:48:43,440
guys be interested in having exclusivity

3038
01:48:41,479 --> 01:48:44,799
on this lime that we're cutting instead

3039
01:48:43,439 --> 01:48:46,399
of calling it sour lime we'll call it

3040
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:50,480
nectar lime and it'll be exclusive to

3041
01:48:46,399 --> 01:48:52,960
you guys and they said yes so I show up

3042
01:48:50,479 --> 01:48:55,799
with 30% lime that like smelled like

3043
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:57,880
fresh lime and it like that cemented our

3044
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:59,639
our position in you know center field

3045
01:48:57,880 --> 01:49:01,039
for them as as one of the producers that

3046
01:48:59,639 --> 01:49:03,000
was going to be stocking their shelves

3047
01:49:01,039 --> 01:49:04,399
nice and we haven't dropped a ball since

3048
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:06,479
and we've been one of their you know

3049
01:49:04,399 --> 01:49:09,319
their main go-tos for that entire time

3050
01:49:06,479 --> 01:49:11,399
and so nectar is where you know every

3051
01:49:09,319 --> 01:49:13,238
every week we're at nectar on Tuesdays

3052
01:49:11,399 --> 01:49:15,879
and Fridays dropping you know product

3053
01:49:13,238 --> 01:49:18,158
off and they always have a really good

3054
01:49:15,880 --> 01:49:20,000
lineup they have good fresh product is

3055
01:49:18,158 --> 01:49:21,158
such a big challenge right so and here

3056
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:23,359
here's here's one of the filters that

3057
01:49:21,158 --> 01:49:25,000
nectar that that nectar imposed and when

3058
01:49:23,359 --> 01:49:26,158
they first imposed this it was really

3059
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,920
daunting and it was really an

3060
01:49:26,158 --> 01:49:30,519
intimidating filter that they put on it

3061
01:49:27,920 --> 01:49:33,480
but but once we sort of adapted to it it

3062
01:49:30,520 --> 01:49:36,360
made perfect sense the from the test

3063
01:49:33,479 --> 01:49:38,479
state for indoor flour they do not want

3064
01:49:36,359 --> 01:49:41,960
anything coming into their uh their

3065
01:49:38,479 --> 01:49:46,000
intake at their wholesale after 30 days

3066
01:49:41,960 --> 01:49:47,198
for for for uh from that test date right

3067
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:49,079
and at first that just felt really

3068
01:49:47,198 --> 01:49:51,158
daunting but what they were ensuring was

3069
01:49:49,079 --> 01:49:53,800
that that top shelf flower that indoor

3070
01:49:51,158 --> 01:49:56,238
flower was going to actually be fresh

3071
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:58,079
and really really high quality yeah it's

3072
01:49:56,238 --> 01:49:59,158
such a problem in the California Market

3073
01:49:58,079 --> 01:50:01,039
I think some of the because everything's

3074
01:49:59,158 --> 01:50:02,799
prepacked here right yeah and it's like

3075
01:50:01,039 --> 01:50:04,719
the stuff it's prepacked and the big

3076
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:07,199
problem is is like you might get stuff

3077
01:50:04,719 --> 01:50:08,960
that's four or five months old you get

3078
01:50:07,198 --> 01:50:10,238
excited about a brand and you get some

3079
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:12,039
good flour one time and the next time

3080
01:50:10,238 --> 01:50:13,919
you get it it's four or five months old

3081
01:50:12,039 --> 01:50:16,198
exactly so nectar's done a really good

3082
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:18,920
job establishing that level of freshness

3083
01:50:16,198 --> 01:50:20,359
on the shelves aming um so you know

3084
01:50:18,920 --> 01:50:23,920
anytime anyone rolls through through

3085
01:50:20,359 --> 01:50:25,519
Oregon just there's 45 locations now wow

3086
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:28,000
so nectar's in southern Oregon they're

3087
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:29,480
in eastern Oregon they're in obviously

3088
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:31,599
the majority of their dispensaries are

3089
01:50:29,479 --> 01:50:33,559
in Portland but uh they're all over the

3090
01:50:31,599 --> 01:50:35,760
state so any nectar dispensary that you

3091
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:38,239
roll through in Oregon will have mother

3092
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:41,520
Magnolia flour and our complete lineup

3093
01:50:38,238 --> 01:50:42,799
of pre-rolls so um by all means that's

3094
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:45,800
that's that's the place to check it out

3095
