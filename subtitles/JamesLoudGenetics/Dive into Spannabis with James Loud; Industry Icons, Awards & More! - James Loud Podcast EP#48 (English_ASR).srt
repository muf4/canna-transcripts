00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:58,000
life was be a revolutionary and I feel

169
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,320
like you're in that same boat absolutely

170
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,519
I was born with it it's coming from

171
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,480
social justice everything has a lens of

172
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:06,600
how can this be better more Equitable

173
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,278
and add to a a more beautiful world and

174
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,440
it doesn't just have to be cannabis it

175
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:11,759
can be outside of even psychedelics like

176
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,160
there's so much healing that needs to

177
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,600
happen internally and externally with

178
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:16,799
our Earth and with our planet with our

179
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,200
bodies that you know plant medicine has

180
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,359
so many different Realms where you can

181
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,278
be a revolutionary and have

182
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,200
revolutionary change totally and we need

183
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:25,000
more women in the industry Amen brother

184
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,640
I mean I think there are a lot of women

185
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,360
but we need more yes there's not many in

186
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:29,838
ownership or decision-making positions

187
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,278
that's what we find is that there's when

188
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,680
you see the statistics of women in the

189
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:35,439
industry a lot of times they're Junior

190
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:37,639
positions they labor um base but they're

191
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,839
not really influencing change and really

192
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:41,559
adding their Brilliance and knowledge to

193
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,480
the pool cuz you know this thing's been

194
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:45,078
cultivated by women and Indigenous

195
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,959
people for thousands of years wasn't

196
00:09:45,078 --> 00:09:47,958
always a a

197
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,879
colonialism a lot of women behind the

198
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,278
scenes don't get credit agreed and so

199
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:07,159
that's going to change yeah absolutely

200
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:09,439
and some women don't really even need

201
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:12,480
the acknowledgement right or like the

202
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,040
prestige but just even just equal pay

203
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,959
you know the way the the the facts that

204
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:17,838
we you know we do the same jobs as men

205
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:19,199
and we got different titles things like

206
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,440
that where it's like even the women who

207
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,240
are like I don't even need the Kudos

208
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,200
just like don't pay me 60 cents on the

209
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,799
dollar and let me actually sit in on a

210
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,800
board meeting and give my ideas for some

211
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:32,120
people that's enough you know it's just

212
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:34,120
it's it's about B respect is respect is

213
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,560
so important though for everybody that

214
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,799
just goes without saying yeah and we

215
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:37,919
want to welcome more women in and make

216
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:39,359
sure you know it's like come in the

217
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:41,159
water's fine like it's oh you can

218
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,919
succeed here you can be safe especially

219
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:45,120
here yes you know with this plant the

220
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:48,199
plant is so special and it just means so

221
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:51,078
much to you all the people in this room

222
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,600
all the people that have got to bring us

223
00:10:51,078 --> 00:10:54,599
to the point where we're at in our lives

224
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,480
I mean it's just Collective effort it

225
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,240
really is yeah I've never seen another

226
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,759
industry where people rely on and

227
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,519
support and up lift each other even in a

228
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:04,480
competitor sense yeah there's a little

229
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:06,159
bit of ego but at the same time healthy

230
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,079
it's like healthy competion yeah no one

231
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:09,278
wants to see anyone do poorly you might

232
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:10,838
get a little jealous if they're doing

233
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:12,360
well but you'll still go to their events

234
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:14,320
you'll still support them if they need

235
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,839
it that's how it is the clubs here in

236
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,240
Barcelona when one gets R and the other

237
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,800
ones go and support them that we know

238
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,680
that we need each other we got to lift

239
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:22,199
each other up yeah absolutely and that's

240
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:23,759
the beauty of the industry and there's a

241

it it has been elevated for the last few

373
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,318
years you know everywhere you see better

374
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:38,000
strains at the different uh uh clubs and

375
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:39,719

00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:47,319
was was some of the best I spoke some

379
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:49,000
great Skittles and Strain Hunters I mean

380
00:16:47,318 --> 00:16:51,399
I've tried Skittles over the years in

381
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,078
Barcelona I love that flavor uh but this

382
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:54,559
year they added that amongst about three

383
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:56,758
or four other trads that I really like

384
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:58,359
from them but uh that one really really

385
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:01,519
really really good you know so and

386
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:03,039
prices much lower this year in Barcelona

387
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,078
on everything on everything than they

388
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:06,959
were few years ago so definitely a place

389
00:17:05,078 --> 00:17:08,599
to visit you know for those who have de

390
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,558
right how do you feel about the energy

391
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:14,639
this year man I thought uh yesterday

392
00:17:11,558 --> 00:17:17,000
would be you know way more crowded than

393
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,520
uh than it was in a few years before and

394
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,038
it was just we still got a little space

395
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:24,199
to move and today at least is a little

396
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:25,838
more relaxed Friday was bet Friday was I

397
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:27,679
think this year the most busiest which

398
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:29,839
is not regular for span right usually

399
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,919
it's Saturday right but Friday was I

400
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:33,759
mean most of uh my friends gave out all

401
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,840
their sample stuff and stuff and so on

402
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:37,960
on Friday so Friday was definitely busy

403
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:39,879
this year right but uh everybody so you

404
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,160

405
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,360
usual they they take things to the

406
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,880
highest level in terms of uh uh

407
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:47,159

408
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,520

from genetics and he's a contributor to

577
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:22,798
this book this book uh wouldn't be what

578
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,919
it was without people like Aladin we

579
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:27,918
have two I think over 22 contributors

589
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:49,319
lot of great players and and you ask a

590
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:51,200
lot of very relevant questions on it too

591
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:52,720
so I wanted to talk to you about this

592
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,919
book and I wanted to ask you a few

593
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,079
questions about it sure so what made you

594
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:58,759
want to write it and is it is you told

595
00:25:57,079 --> 00:26:00,960
me well we we we had a little

596
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:02,919
conversation before and you were telling

597
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,319
me that you wrote a book before but you

598
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:07,720
didn't publish it I wrote five five

599
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:09,480
times I've wrote drafts of this thing

600
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:13,038
all right we even pre-sold copies on

601
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:15,038
Amazon in 2019 but the first round of

602
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:17,640
editing by an editor I wasn't super

603
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:19,200
excited about and it wasn't his fault I

604
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,799
I was learning how to write for one

605
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,600
thing right and these things kind of

606
00:26:21,798 --> 00:26:26,200
happened but that's what makes things

607
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:27,719
great is when you fail you get back up

608
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,080
you do it over and over if you want to

609
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,399
do something bad enough you can do

610
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:34,439
anything I'm so convinced especially

611
00:26:31,398 --> 00:26:36,158
with cannabis it'll guide you the the

612
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,600
plant will guide you the plant helps if

613
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,679
you listen the plant will tell you what

614
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:42,398
to do and I feel like I've done that my

615
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:44,120
whole life and I've been through a lot

616
00:26:42,398 --> 00:26:46,599
of failures and I feel like that's

617
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:48,759
what's made me stronger and better than

618
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:50,678
I was before and I don't take it too

619
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:52,519
personal you know I know that you make

620
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:53,720
mistakes you just get up and do it again

621
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:56,079
if you do it the right way and you turn

622
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,558
on to repeat the same mistakes but

623
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:59,079
breathing I love breathing you love

624
00:26:57,558 --> 00:27:01,119
breathing too I love it man you know and

625
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:02,558
it's so great to be able to talk with

626
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:04,119
other people about genetics and about

627
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:05,720
the plant and how it benefits their life

628
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:07,398
and there's so many benefits to this

629
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:09,240
plant and we're just scratching the

630
00:27:07,398 --> 00:27:11,359
surface of it even scientists don't know

631
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,720
about it they just know a little bit

632
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:15,319
about it for now like they're still

633
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,159
learning a whole lot totally and how

634
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:18,759
long have you been writing this book for

635
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:20,840
if you take everything into account uh I

636
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:22,720
mean 5 years and I brought probably

637
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:25,240
hundreds of thousands the words to get

638
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,278
100,000 words in let's and so I mean the

639
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,759
first version was I think 30,000 words

640
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:30,519
and this is 100,000 wow that's a lot

641
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:32,200
more yeah and we got really high-end

642
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:33,639
photos and if I had released that first

643
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,038
book I would have really been

644
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,720
disappointed with myself the rest of my

645
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:39,960
life I okay I know but this is something

646
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:43,038
that I feel you know this does the

647
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:46,558
subject Justice in my opinion right and

648
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:48,319
it's evolving so fast that I feel like

649
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:50,200
even though I wrote this book and I try

650
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:52,678
to stay current there's some stuff like

651
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,720
dou hloy breeding that like I'm talking

652
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:56,399
about it in the past not in the past in

653
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,798
the future it's actually something

654
00:27:56,398 --> 00:28:00,239
that's being done right now by a lot of

655
00:27:57,798 --> 00:28:01,720
people right so it's already information

656
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,000
is becoming obsolete that's why so you

657
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,399
think you're going to have to update it

658
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,159
yeah every two years I'm going to update

659
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:07,719
it and I think at least through right

660
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,640
now until it's more stable cuz we're

661
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,640
learning so much and I want to share

662
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:13,559
with the home girls I appreciate the H

663
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,200
girls those people are the biggest fans

664
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:16,798
of us and the biggest supporters are the

665
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,798
people that grow the plants in their

666
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:20,599
houses and their backyards you know the

667
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:22,519
guys that have a few plants and those

668
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:24,719
are those are all real fans so who who

669
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:26,278
is this book for home goers or this is

670
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,079
for everybody you want to learn about

671
00:28:26,278 --> 00:28:31,200
breeding it's an indepth dive into what

672
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:32,599
breeding is there's case studies on

673
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,960
different genetics you want to make

674
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:36,439
femin it's all in the book and that that

675
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,720
was the biggest thing so for

676
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,120
me I had to go to so many different

677
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,558
places for the information I wanted it

678
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:43,359
to be accessible to anybody that wants

679
00:28:41,558 --> 00:28:45,398
to learn how to breed and then Angela

680
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:47,319
helped me put it together and make it

681
00:28:45,398 --> 00:28:48,959
really easy for people to read yeah it

682
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:50,960
was very easy to work with her she's

683
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,519
awesome yeah she's so great and then in

684
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,360
the back there's like a grossery but you

685
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:56,440
can go there's QR codes so you can go

686
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:59,079
through the QR codes in the book there's

687
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:00,640
a the glossery terms oh actually if you

688
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:02,879
want to learn how to pronounce these

689
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,640
gloss I have a section you go to the

690
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,480
website and it has me pronouncing the

691
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,679
words so going into into the industry

692
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,880
without as scientific a background as

693
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:14,080
some other people yes pronouncing words

694
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:16,399
can be difficult so it's nice to have

695
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:20,119
somebody that can tell you it's theity

696
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:22,000
and not yite you know I for example but

697
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:24,278
and why write a reading block cuz

698
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,119
there's already a few you know marijuana

699
00:29:24,278 --> 00:29:28,880
botney but it's old it's very old that's

700
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:31,439
from 1980 and then so green wrote a book

701
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,919
25 years ago the Cannabis breeders Bible

702
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,480
yeah and I feel like those are outdated

703
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:38,360
they're good books for their times like

704
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,919
you were saying before yeah and for

705
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:41,678
their time they were great books and I

706
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:43,679
have so much respect for both Greg green

707
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,559
and Rob Clark for writing about breeding

708
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,640
or I feel like we need a modern update

709
00:29:45,558 --> 00:29:49,519
of the the breeding world and kind of

710
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,159
what we're doing and there's a lot of

711
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:52,480
misinformation so if you can get rid of

712
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:54,440
the misinformation cut through all the

713
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,558
[ __ ] and bu all in one place people

714
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,159
are going to benefit and it's going to

715
00:29:55,558 --> 00:29:59,278
make the world a better place and it's

716
00:29:57,159 --> 00:30:00,600
much easier to reach than marijuana bney

717
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:02,798
marijuana bodney was like a little

718
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:04,879
tricky you know some parts of it and

719
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:06,440
this is like it's an easy read so so

720
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,840
you've read the B what do you think yeah

721
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,360
well I haven't read the whole thing I

722
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:12,480
read maybe about half of it cuz I I was

723
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:15,599
you know contributing to it a little bit

724
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,079
and I had to write it but read it and

725
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:18,798
what what I think I love it because you

726
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:21,000
didn't just talk about breeding you

727
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:23,200
talked about land races as well yeah and

728
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,079
you talked about like many other aspects

729
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,360
of like cannabis growing so it's it all

730
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:30,639
like comes together it's not just breing

731
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:33,119
it's like growing all you talk about the

732
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,360
Seas the sea quality right and the

733
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:37,959
different strains cultivars and the land

734
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:39,558
races and all that yeah the proper turns

735
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,319
well and then I had people like you

736
00:30:39,558 --> 00:30:43,038
reading the book and reviewing it and

737
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:45,918
keeping it real bro like I don't know

738
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:47,919
about that and I got that from Reggie

739
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:50,440
Gardino I got from you I got it from a

740
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,080
couple Mojave Richmond where they were

741
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,840
like do you really mean this and you're

742
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:56,798
saying this or do you mean that and that

743
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:58,519
tour really makes for me it's like okay

744
00:30:56,798 --> 00:31:00,278
now these guys will help me make my book

745
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:02,720
better so how many people did you

746
00:31:00,278 --> 00:31:04,919
collaborate with and oh if we talk about

747
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,319
everybody there there were 22 people and

748
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:07,759
you know we had an editor we had someone

749
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:10,079
to do the layout we had two graphics

750
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:12,519
people two photographers all right you

751
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:14,918

00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:19,159
property and Matt Schneider did a tissue

754
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:21,558
culture chapter and there's just so many

755
00:31:19,159 --> 00:31:23,559
people that contributed a bunch the guy

756
00:31:21,558 --> 00:31:26,119
right here this is Lance he's from gr

757
00:31:23,558 --> 00:31:28,839
bags yeah what's up man how's it going

758
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:31,439
it ni JJ actually from from Grove BS

759
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:33,959
helped me write the BR uh the section

760
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,278
that's about drawing and caring and so

761
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,720
we have a lot of really detailed

762
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:39,599
information so it's a it's a DP effort

763
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:41,399
and it's a beautiful thing I love it I

764
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:43,678
love being part of things that are so

765
00:31:41,398 --> 00:31:46,079
much bigger than myself I feel like you

766
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:48,278
know and I feel like that's why we're

767
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:50,558
here is to be be part of a machine part

768
00:31:48,278 --> 00:31:52,839
of things that to improve the world and

769
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:54,599
do better things and things have come a

770
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:56,398
long way you know like 10 years ago

771
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:58,158
everything was different like you said

772
00:31:56,398 --> 00:31:59,719
right like autoflowers for example they

773
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,480
were not nearly as good as they are

774
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,440
today and there's so many things that we

775
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:05,599
haven't been able to improve yeah so

776
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,038
yeah and how long have we been a to

777
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:10,638
breeding I've been here breeding for a

778
00:32:08,038 --> 00:32:13,319
long time now I was messing around in

779
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:17,158
the early 2000s but I got serious in the

780
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:20,240
late 200 like 8 n

781
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:23,039
10 and so we won our first Cup in

782
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,960
2012 but I was breeding more for I

783
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:26,158
wanted my own version of this or my own

784
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,278
version of that and now I have a lot of

785
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:30,600
different goals obviously I do a lot of

786
00:32:28,278 --> 00:32:33,638
white labeling for other companies make

787
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:36,079
I make a bunch of genetics for yeah

788
00:32:33,638 --> 00:32:37,519
handful of big companies and they like

789
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:39,480
the quality of it they like the quality

790
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,679
and the consistency and you know it's

791
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:43,360
like when you can have consistent

792
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:45,080
results that's what countes with

793
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:46,558
breathing you know it's like it's super

794
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:49,158
important so yeah speaking of that what

795
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:51,480
do you think about Paul in talking orus

796
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:53,440
stabilizing lines and breing I think

797
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,919
they both have their own place and I

798
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,679
don't I think there's a lot of egos

799
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:58,120
involved with this and people should

800
00:32:56,679 --> 00:32:59,200
worry about what they're doing and as

801
00:32:58,119 --> 00:33:01,398
much about what other people are doing

802
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,720
long transparent about it

803
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:05,158
long you know if you have interex treats

804
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,679
you should tell people you have interex

805
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:08,440
treats if there's her aphrodites you

806
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:10,278
should tell people that's so important

807
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:12,200
right and if there's a bunch of

808
00:33:10,278 --> 00:33:13,519
diversity that's a good thing too I mean

809
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,159
there's nothing wrong with that and some

810
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:18,159
people want stabilized and other people

811
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:19,480
want the new hpe have one absolutely and

812
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,559
they're both good things all right for

813
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:24,319
the right person so it's just like you

814
00:33:21,558 --> 00:33:25,720
like banana and I like chocolate chps

815
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:29,480

really excited about is I've just

921
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:49,359
released a strain called Filipino Queen

922
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:51,800
which is a Filipino land race cross to

923
00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:53,920
my strain km baly Cooks which I

924
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:57,039
previously won I think it was third

925
00:37:53,920 --> 00:38:00,039

race I I dubbed her love sick uh and

930
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:16,640
when you cut her she bleeds red she's so

931
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:19,559
rich in anos silins that she bleeds red

932
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:23,318
and what I'm finding is that she adds so

00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:57,760
genetics in a bunch of people's Gardians

1016
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,800
right now so you started out as a writer

1017
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,880
for High Times loving weed yes I mean

1018
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:03,519
obviously you still love weed but that's

1019
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:05,960
where you got your start was with high

1020
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:08,679
times then you kind of you did the seed

1021
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:11,000
brokering thing for a while and hustle

1022
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:13,519
you were the guy to go to for rare and

1023
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Elite genetics uh more than

1024
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:18,559
anybody and uh then you started doing

1025
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,760
breeding which you're doing now and

1026
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:22,639
hustling and hustling and hustling and

1027
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:25,880
you're in New York yes I'm back in New

1028
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:27,759
York full time now nice how is it it's

1029
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,280
culture shock it's uh definitely

1030
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,839
something that I didn't think was going

1031
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,079
to happen like the way it is but I'm

1032
00:42:30,838 --> 00:42:33,239
going to take advantage of whatever's

1033
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,480
happening right now because if it's not

1034
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:36,598
me it's going to be somebody else making

1035
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,358
that money so I might as well be what

1036
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:40,440
it's a nice time to be back in New York

1037
00:42:38,358 --> 00:42:42,000

1041
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,079
every like it's pretty cool like people

00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:15,760
growing everywhere you know we can e

1103
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,679

come in a couple months yeah the best

1108
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:27,800
time to come because the glass houses

1109
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,920
are empty now because we grow between

1110
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:32,920
October and March yeah cuz now gets

1111
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:34,960
really odd so I don't want to grow in a

1112
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:38,039
really really OD season you know so we

1113
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:39,679
preow our plants again a few months wow

1114
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:41,318
and then when they're ready in September

1115
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:43,639
we put them in again you know yeah so

1116
00:45:41,318 --> 00:45:46,679
you what up two hours a year yeah we do

1117
00:45:43,639 --> 00:45:49,078
two Harvest a year then when we cut down

1118
00:45:46,679 --> 00:45:50,679
we make new moms and we build up the old

1119
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:55,000
base in the north as you can see there's

1120
00:45:50,679 --> 00:45:57,480
19 glass houses and then we go to the 32

1121
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,079
po houses starting September

1122
