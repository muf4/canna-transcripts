63
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:33,280
and actually seen some

64
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:35,159
in ADV even though he wasn't there I've

65
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,640
seen him and had experiences with him

66
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:39,199
outside of this existence which is wild

67
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:40,759
because I can't say that with a lot of

68
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,359
about a lot of people there's a handful

69
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:45,598
of them and uh yeah spiritual guide or

70
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,080
whatever s's always there looking over

71
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:50,598
us so yeah the spiritual experience that

72
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:54,319
I did have with him was extremely

73
00:02:50,598 --> 00:02:56,598
life-changing and helped me um just be

74
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:57,560
extra sure of my path and and and part

75
00:02:56,598 --> 00:03:00,119
of the reason I'm sitting here right now

76
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,719
to be honest yeah so yeah so you're a

77
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,400
lover of Amsterdam uh Barcelona you're a

78
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,719
world traveler you've been to Thailand

79
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,319
I've seen you in Thailand on Instagram

80
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,519
at least I've never been to Thailand I

81
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:12,238
plan on going this year no way yeah I'm

82
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:14,360
super excited I'm going to check out

83
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,480
some genetics and stuff like that that

84
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,799
are growing over there I think this fall

85
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,639
dope so our mutual friend Arion was a

86
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:22,360
big motivational factor for me when I

87
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:25,639
went there it was also part of the

88
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:28,239
reason I was in Amsterdam yeah um my

89
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:30,119
father passed away he had a license in

90
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,719
Denmark and I was kind of there trying

91
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,000
to put together the pieces after he

92
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:36,878
suddenly passed away at his facility got

93
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,519
crushed and um that was part of also the

94
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:39,719
spiritual guidance through CA I kind of

95
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:41,280
got into a dead end where I didn't know

96
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:43,438
where to go with the whole situation

97
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,719
yeah and uh Arian gave me the suggestion

98
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:47,878
to go to Thailand and to go check it out

99
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:49,199
and that there's lots of opportunity

100
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:52,280
there and this and that and he kind of

101
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:55,000
gave me you know a push to go yeah and

102
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,158
so I went like a month later and I had

103
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
an amazing time I got to check out their

104
00:03:57,158 --> 00:04:00,438
facility and got to get super motivated

105
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,479
by what him industri doing watching

106
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:04,400
their team just execute on just a high

107
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,560
level the partners who they partnered

108
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,120
with just the whole thing is just like a

109
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,079
dream come true and just see the spark

110
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,759
in Arian and I've known him for I want

111
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:16,040
to say six to eight years yeah and I've

112
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,959
never in my whole time knowing him seen

113
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,799
any sort of spark in him like I've seen

114
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:21,759
with this whole Thailand thing he really

115
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:23,239
it's a really cool passion project and

116
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,800
it's got him so motivated you can see

117
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,960
him when he does his presentations and

118
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,280
everything and it's everything you can

119
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:31,439
see him at spanis I I love it because uh

120
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,319
when I first met him he was excited and

121
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:36,478
he did some fun stuff you know but then

122
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:38,399
Franco passed and with the passing of

123
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:40,359
Franco I think there was a lot of

124
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:43,120
sadness not just with Arian but within

125
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:46,160
the industry uh but especially Arian

126
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,759
losing his best friend and somebody who

127
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,199
was his like the yin and yang balance to

128
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:53,879
him and

129
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,919
finding where you belong in the world

130
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:58,478
after something like that happens you

131
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:00,240
know takes some time and like I mean

132
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:01,959
it's pretty amazing

133
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,720
with Thailand you know from going to the

134
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:05,918
Congo and all the stuff they've done in

135
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,240
their career but now Reinventing

136
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:11,120
themselves in Thailand on another level

137
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,759
I mean it's pretty it's pretty amazing

138
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,120
watching from from this you know the the

139
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,400
cheap seats watching them on Instagram

140
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,680
and seeing the stuff they're doing the

141
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:21,679
new Strain Hunters and I mean they're

142
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,038
they're so passionate about cannabis

143
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,319
dust is just he's great he's super

144
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:27,879
passionate as well they love the plant

145
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,240
and I feel like they're just super

146
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:31,959
passionate about what they're doing yeah

147
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,400
the and just the level that they do

148
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:36,560
things and they showed that kind of in

149
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:37,918
the Congo with the the the how many you

150
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,959
know like the amount count the feno

151
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:41,918
Hunts they did and in this industry of

152
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:43,719
genetics as we both know your

153
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:44,879
credibility comes from Big feno hunts

154
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,400
you're not going to get any credibility

155
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:48,719
doing a three seed feno hun and finding

156
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:51,239
a winner no or bag seat or whatever you

157
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,639
know you got a 100 you know 20 plus is

158
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,199
kind of like 30 plus is kind of like the

159
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:58,879
minimum and and he's out here doing

160
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,400
10,000 3,000 minimum per per strain so I

161
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,079
mean I think that's little extreme

162
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:03,918
person I think it's great and you're

163
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,918
really finding outliers and stuff like

164
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:08,038
that in there I mean I prefer smaller

165
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:09,318
funo hunts three is not enough three

166
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:12,279
three doesn't tell you anything about

167
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:13,598
your genetics right 10 it really might

168
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:16,279
tell you if it's worth looking through

169
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:19,000
more right you know but me I mean I

170
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:21,478
think like that 20 to 50 range is really

171
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,120
good uh you know some some genetics it's

172
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:24,399
worth going through 100 and some you

173
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,478
know you're going to find kind of what

174
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:28,120
you're looking for in a smaller amount

175
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:30,279
but uh you know when you have the space

176
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,240
and you have the money that is the way

177
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:34,399
to do it is doing larger hunts and you

178
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,720
can do several genetics when you're

179
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,839
doing them that size and you know I

180
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,120
think there's there's gold in those uh

181
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:42,758
those hunts the team is extra important

182
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,280
too the team that they have established

183
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:48,400
down there is is is really Next Level

184
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:50,079
and to be able to keep all those still

185
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,799
alive while they grow through their

186
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:54,918
whole life cycle is another huge

187
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,560
undertaking and and I think if not the

188
00:06:54,918 --> 00:06:57,799
biggest undertaking in the whole process

189
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,199
if you're going to do that big of a fena

190
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,240
hunt right so it's my hat to them and

191
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:04,759
their whole team for even attempting the

192
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,439
process and then now executing on such a

193
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:08,479
high level it's really really cool to

194
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:10,079
see and just even witness the whole

195
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:12,680
situation really cool been to watch the

196
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:15,079
last couple years totally well when when

197
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:18,680
you see your friend's success it's

198
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:21,719
always amazing you know at the the level

199
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,918
they can do it on is just it's pretty

200
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,440
mind-blowing um and when it's your

201
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:26,878
friends being successful it's even

202
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,199
better you know I love watching my

203
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:31,199
friends succeed and my friends kick ass

204
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,319
and you know especially taking stuff to

205
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,919
a new level and it requires commitment

206
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:37,240
and dedication and you know we talk

207
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:38,758
about being business owners getting

208
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,960
kicked to the nuts every day and waking

209
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:44,120
up and smiling about it I mean it's

210
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:46,478
really you know I think we were meant to

211
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,800
do something on this plane of existence

212
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:51,478
on on this planet and I feel like

213
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,759
working with cannabis is where I belong

214
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:57,560
where you belong where Aran and

215
00:07:53,759 --> 00:08:01,199
Greenhouse belong and and dust and dust

216
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:03,720
and and Mr X we got Oscar Crush dud his

217
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,038
photography and all the guys over there

218
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,599
I mean they have a I've been holding

219
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:08,240
back saying this whole time the number

220
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:10,279
one word is team and what they have

221
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,439
created what Arian has created is a team

222
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:13,279
and he really knows how to pump

223
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:14,879
everybody up and make them feel special

224
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:16,198
yeah and that's another huge thing I

225
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,319
learned from s on the whole experience

226
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:19,759
with the buo is like all you have on

227
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,680
this world is the opportunity to make

228
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,720
people feel special and and how you make

229
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,158
people feel is all that matters you know

230
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,759
and aran's good at making people feel

231
00:08:25,158 --> 00:08:29,240
special and his team feels special

232
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:30,800
working for him so that's why he gets

233
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,879
with gets out of them it's really cool

234
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,560
to just watch and be a part of it it

235
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:36,080
just feels super special even being

236
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:40,359
there the time I have it's been really

237
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:42,639
cool totally yeah it's funny because so

238
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,639
being in this industry you're able to

239
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:46,519
observe different leadership styles and

240
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:49,759
and and different companies and

241
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:52,639
different people and you know it's it's

242
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:54,439
funny the people that I've I've been

243
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:57,319
exposed to and that have mentored me

244
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,160
like Arian and a handful of other people

245
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,320
that I feel like have told me the truth

246
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:04,078
even when I didn't want to hear it you

247
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,760
know and then there's the the ego and

248
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:08,199
losing the ego is so important and I

249
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:09,480
feel like that also happens when you get

250
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,160
a little bit older the second you start

251
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,879
getting in your like late 30s early 40s

252
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:16,360
you really start losing your ego and

253
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:19,519
quitting quit you quit caring what other

254
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,399
people think as much and also you become

255
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,159
a good Storyteller along the way because

256
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:25,679
to become a good Storyteller some people

257
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:27,399
are great from the G but after you've

258
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:29,879
been through enough experiences then you

259
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:31,559
can really start telling your story and

260
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:33,480
uh I think that's an important part of

261
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:35,759
the Cannabis history of the oral history

262
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,200
of cannabis like the show and stuff that

263
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:39,919
we're doing I feel like the Cannabis

264
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,800
history is just so important to the

265
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:44,078
world that we live in and to the Next

266
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:46,159
Generation and the generation after that

267
00:09:44,078 --> 00:09:47,759
and so on and so forth down the line

268
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:49,639
because we've got all these

269
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:51,319
revolutionaries and people changing the

270
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:53,600
game and it's great being able to tell

271
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:56,278
stories about them that's documented

272
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,600
couldn't agree more yeah um and Arian

273
00:09:56,278 --> 00:10:00,360
and S are couple great examples of that

274
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,159
totally their ation what they've lived

275
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:06,360

00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:02,599
more popular have you much uh experience

303
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:05,439
with like Congo or Malawi gold sure I've

304
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:08,560
smoked it's so funny cuz like the Durban

305
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:11,560
the Congo and the Malawi are all very uh

306
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:14,518
sacred to me I smoked some red Congo

307
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:17,799
from gold leaf on one of the future

308
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:20,560
cannabis projects episodes with

309
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:22,000
Marlin uh and I'm never doing that again

310
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:24,719
we got too high on the air there's a

311
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,600
handful of times all squirly and like

312
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,399
well it was so the red Congo and the

313
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,519
Malo and the Durban all have different

314
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:33,360
effects right like sure you might say

315
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,759
they taste similar but to me they don't

316
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,519
but but they're all they're all similar

317
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:40,519
because they're kind of you know they're

318
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,600
they're land racy I guess Airy but like

319
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:44,480
the flavor on them is different and the

320
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,360
effect is extremely different I couldn't

321
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,440
agree more dude that red Congo makes me

322
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,680
giggle and laugh and like I just have

323
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,920
amazing time on it but like Marlin and I

324
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:54,319
we do these things where we get too

325
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:56,399
[ __ ] up whether it's weed or mushrooms

326
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,959
or whatever and then we just laugh and

327
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,720
every time I looked at him he he would

328
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:01,119
laugh and every time he he looked back

329
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,320
at me I would laugh and then I try not

330
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,720
to laugh and then I can't hold it

331
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,920
anymore and I'm [ __ ] laughing

332
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,240
bursting out yeah where the Durban just

333
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:12,679
kicks your ass I feel like the Durban is

334
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:14,600
super strong and uh more

335
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:17,278
introspective you say it's more like of

336
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:20,120
a OG buzz like a gas Buzz or is it still

337
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:22,399
in that sativa realm as the other two um

338
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,480
I I would say there's more sedative

339
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,958
characteristics of it it is super strong

340
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,360
der for me and same thing maloi is

341
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:31,719
really strong too and but maloi is like

342
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,199
line hallucinogenic interesting U and

343
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,759
Durban can be too in extremes like if

344
00:12:34,198 --> 00:12:38,120
you make bang with it where you know

345
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:39,958
like the the milk where you infuse it

346
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,560
into the milk like fat or whatever and

347
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:44,599
then inest it like MCT oil type thing

348
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:46,799
you can do MCT oil but bang is actually

349
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,560
like uh milk that's been infused with it

350
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,559
and you drink it okay and yeah it's like

351
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:53,399
a

352
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:55,518
Indian tradition and it's super strong

353
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:57,559
and potent and it hits you pretty quick

354
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,959
but like those psychedelic ones they

355
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:04,000
really you really feel the effects of

356
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:07,239
them I had a and I thought when I was

357
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
first making my brand like 2016 yeah um

358
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,240
Congo is a popular thing going on around

359
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,919
and we finally had that was also when

360
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,680
bhos first came around we actually had

361
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:17,078
some really nice extract of Congo and

362
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:19,799
because it was such a low yielder and

363
00:13:17,078 --> 00:13:21,000
such a long flowering plant there wasn't

364
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,759
much of the extract around it was like

365
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,759
really rare and so I had some and I

366
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:26,120
remember excited I was and what I did is

367
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:27,439
I started my day with it for a few days

368
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,440
in a row but I couldn't get anything

369
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,040
done in the morning I was so

370
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,320
scatterbrained I could like my regular

371
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:34,159
routine I could not get anything done

372
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,560
and I had to sit there and realize what

373
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:37,519
the difference was that I was doing and

374
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:39,159
it was this extract and I just couldn't

375
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,679
do a dab of Congo in the morning I was

376
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:42,559
going to do it as my morning coffee with

377
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:43,679
sativa sure but it ended up ruining my

378
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:44,838
whole morning where I couldn't even do

379
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,638
anything I had to wait till the buzz

380
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:49,360
wore off to even like I could have like

381
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:51,360
drawn or maybe done a sport or done

382
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,519
something but as soon as I had to apply

383
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,879
myself I could not I could not apply

384
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,480
myself I couldn't focus on anything I

385
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:58,159
don't think I mean Durban same thing I

386
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,680
don't think I can apply myself it's it's

387
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:03,319
super strong I wouldn't say that Durban

388
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:05,198
is like OG necessarily but it doesn't

389
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,360
have a ceiling so the more you smoke the

390
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:10,439
higher you get there is no ceiling to

391
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:13,120
how high you can get a lot of these

392
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,639
modern genetics that people are creating

393
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,560
they have ceilings you know and it's

394
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,680
like you can smoke them and you only get

395
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:19,119
so high and then you smoke them

396
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:22,120
throughout the day you never get higher

397
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:26,240
than right here whereas like Durban and

398
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:28,240
Malo and Congo and Colombian you smoke

399
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,399
some real [ __ ] Colombian dud like the

400
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,159
real Colombian genetics that stuff does

401
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,958
not have a ceiling you just keep getting

402
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:35,559
higher and higher the more you smoke and

403
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:37,599
it's like there's no limit to how high

404
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:39,439
you can get from that stuff oh yeah so

405
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,759
do we line one up now uh we can

406
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,839
definitely do that this is branded you

great for a commercial

417
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:11,599
pre-roll um I believe it's Greenhouse

418
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:14,159
grown uh it's got a lot of

419
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:17,920
flavor got a

420
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:17,919
unique well it's very

421
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:28,399
runy it's okay yeah I get a little like

422
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:31,240
in the almost like uh sour taste in my

423
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:35,278
mhm my palette yeah I got don't know if

424
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,278
it's that's like the the NES or what

425
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:43,000
but oh it's living soil

426
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,159
organic it's okay I don't I don't love

427
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,480
the turps but the buzz I'm liking I'm

428
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:48,399
liking what I'm liking the buzz that I'm

429
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:53,000
getting from it getting some actual like

430
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:54,559
hey Buzz I don't I wouldn't like I'm not

431
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,919
like enjoying the turps personally it's

432
00:15:54,559 --> 00:16:00,399
not my so you what like so let's talk

433
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:02,318
about TS so you're super picky but you

434
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,198
smoke a lot of xtract too so you're all

435
00:16:02,318 --> 00:16:06,479
about turbs I'm definitely a flower guy

436
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:08,758
like I'm I'm been flower guy since I was

437
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,519
16 we smoked a bunch of joints in I'm

438
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:13,360
definitely a flower guy um and I've

439
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:15,759
evolved into the extract uh scene now I

440
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,480
there was a period in the early 2000s

441
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,360
before hash or before bubble hash was

442
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,959
like really super popular yeah where we

443
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,039
were washing in Vancouver and making ice

444
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:24,879
hash and but we didn't know what the

445
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:27,278
hell were doing right

446
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:28,120
um there wasn't a lot of knowledge on it

447
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,399
and I think everybody was kind of

448
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,679
learning as they go and I think that's a

449
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:34,519
lot what hash church was was people

450
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:37,799
sharing their experiences learning and

451
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:40,318
then that was able to elevate it hash

452
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:41,879
Church yeah is huge Community yeah um

453
00:16:40,318 --> 00:16:43,958
one of the most important communities

454
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:46,958
for the hash movement tip my hat to him

455
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:48,599
for that big time Mark killing it to

456
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:51,318
this day still killing it yeah yeah for

457
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,560
sure for sure but yeah the profiles that

458
00:16:51,318 --> 00:16:56,599
I do like are like I love gelados I love

459
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:59,078
runs um but for me like I really like

460
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,519
that like clean taste so that not

461
00:16:59,078 --> 00:17:02,638
getting affected by like that almost

462
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:04,120
like nutrient do you want it floral do

463
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,640
you want it gassy do you want a little

464
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:08,438
bit floral a little bit gassy I don't

465
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,319
mind I don't so like personally like my

466
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:11,480
favorite profiles I like to smoke

467
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:12,519
different stuff throughout the day like

468
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,720
I like to start in the morning with a

469
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:15,918
nice Z and then I'll move into like

470
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,000
something that's a little bit more

471
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,319
fruity um how do you feel about the

472
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,318
effects of Z you like I feel like it's a

473
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:25,078
good it's not it's up but not too upy

474
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:27,480
you know it doesn't get me you still get

475
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:28,678
high from it yeah exactly but it's not

476
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,120
like it's I feel like it's one of those

477
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:31,440
ones with the ceiling like you can still

478
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:33,719
get high but it doesn't take you over

479
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,840
the top it's it's a clean high you can

480
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,720
keep smoking it too and it's not like I

481
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:39,319
don't know it's still tasty I like still

482
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,400
all the way down to the roach exactly

483
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:44,599
exactly um and and yeah you can get sick

484
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,559
as you get sick of anything for sure and

485
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:47,199
that's my whole thing like I like

486
00:17:45,558 --> 00:17:48,319
smoking a different joint every joint I

487
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,400
smoke throughout the day I feel like I

488
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:52,079
never really got sick of Sour Diesel we

489
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,519
had a lot of Sour Diesel that's the only

490
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:56,678
thing I would say though cat piss and

491
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:58,279
the sour diesel are the two things that

492
00:17:56,679 --> 00:17:59,519
we go back that I don't think I ever get

493
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:01,158
sick of those I feel like a lot of that

494
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:02,879
would have to do whoever grew that for

495
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:04,640
you and like I bet you if you got that

496
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,440
same gr who always grew that fire batch

497
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,960
as some other strains too I bet you'd

498
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:11,200
maybe have same connection to that too

499
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,640
cuz I feel like most strains unless you

500
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,480
really have like a negative adverse

501
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,840
effect to it are awesome if grown

502
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,960
correctly um and that's just my

503
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:21,158
experience and and so when that's why I

504
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,000
also like having a lot of different

505
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:24,559
varieties because I feel like they all

506
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,720
send you in a different direction and I

507
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:28,119
kind of apply for a different function

508
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,279
throughout the day right whether it's

509
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:31,000
going up for lunch whether it's playing

510
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:32,918
a sport whether it's watching a movie

511
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,599
playing a video game I like smoking

512
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:36,000
different stuff for everything or the

513
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:37,119
same few things for the same few things

514
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I'm the same way and I'm always trying

515
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:40,319
new stuff because I like I like the new

516
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,440
experience of being able to find

517
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:43,639
something that I've never seen before or

518
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,759
I'm always waiting for that lottery

519
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,640
ticket you know what I mean where you're

520
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:48,079
like oh what the [ __ ] is that that new

521
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,840
have you tried the new toad Venom it's

522
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:53,720
pretty nice I've not tried weed toad

523
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:55,158
Venom yeah it's called yeah exactly go

524
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,960
yeah no that maybe that's why I like it

525
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:59,559
so much I don't know but no it's a new

526
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,038
one out I forget the group but it's like

527
00:18:59,558 --> 00:19:02,678
the hot new thing in New York when I was

528
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:04,960
there everybody's on it and the hash

529
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:06,880
from it's super fire too it's a z Blend

530
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,640
or a z cross I'm pretty sure yeah not

531
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,760
diet Skittles by the way no no diet Z

532
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,480
right it's not diet Z well it probably

533
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:14,759
is Diet on the Z end of it because it's

534
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,919
obviously diluted sure but like no it's

535
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:19,519
not like whatever yeah I'm okay with

536
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,720
stuff where it's diluted but it's

537
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:23,679
complex this I just don't like a lighter

538
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,120
Skittles it's not as turpy which is a

539
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,200
lot of the stuff though a lot of the

540
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:29,479
Skittles crosses the Skittles s1's a lot

541
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,120
of those

542
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,519
end up being not as turpy as Skittles

543
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:34,759
and I feel like why would you have

544
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:36,720
something why would you want to grow

545
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:38,038
something that's not as good as the

546
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,640
maybe has a little better structure or

547
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:41,720
whatever but Sour Diesel is like this

548
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,240
too I find Sour Diesel crosses I find

549
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,000
the original sour the real Sour

550
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:48,798
absolutely the real Sour they're never

551
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,440
on that level as the original sour no

552
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:54,440
there's only a handful of them I think

553
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:57,320
you know my partner and I back in the

554
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,919
day um did some Sour back crosses and

555
00:19:57,319 --> 00:20:00,839
stuff like that and we were doing I

556
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:03,799
think we were doing really good work but

557
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:06,798
JJ from top dog is doing it aish a has

558
00:20:03,798 --> 00:20:08,400
SAU crosses Karma's got some SAU crosses

559
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:10,079
like just out the gate those three guys

560
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,200
are all doing some good sour work some

561
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:14,678
of the best in the game yeah yeah for

562
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,319
sure but a lot of sour like sour Sour's

563
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:18,559
tough to work with as a cross sour

564
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:19,960
structure the recessive traits coming

565
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:21,678
through in whatever you're trying to get

566
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,798
it's like what are you shooting for

567
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,400
right and I think that's maybe a lot of

568
00:20:23,798 --> 00:20:28,879
what's happening is maybe they're not

569
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,960
searching for the real original sour

570
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,039
traits or I don't know but I haven't

571
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,640
found many you probably got to go

572
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:35,158
through a lot more too I would say that

573
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,400
that was the thing with us back in the

574
00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:39,880
day was being able to go through a lot

575
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:42,080
and you know it's like then selecting

576
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,240
and finding ones that are really sour

577
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:46,079
where it does Justice to the sour I

578
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,960
think that like there's fire crosses for

579
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:50,158
sure but I'm just saying it's not like

580
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,759
the sour you know like that sour was so

581
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,880
special and I think a lot of the Z

582
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:54,440
crosses are doing the same thing you

583
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,640
know when you when you see the Z name on

584
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,240
the jar you see the sour name on the jar

585
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,159
you have a certain expectation attached

586
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,558
to it and then that's probably what's

587
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,320
not being bad for the longest time OG

588
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:05,558
was like that you have like some OG

589
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:07,158
cross that was just not quite great and

590
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:08,918
there was no OG seeds for the longest

591
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:11,440
time you couldn't get real OG you get

592
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:12,919
like OG Widow OG critical from the guys

593
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,679
in Europe or whatever and it was like

594
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:16,840
nothing like the OG that we liked and

595
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:18,640
then there's the variant of like region

596
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:20,319
to region of the OG like you know what I

597
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,960
mean there's definitely different

598
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:23,399
there's a lemon one that I find out

599
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,558
there there more gassy ones there's

600
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,080
definitely a few yeah there's definitely

601
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:28,879
more piny and there's more citrusy ones

602
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:31,839
and more earthy ones and they have ones

603
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,919
that lean directions all three of those

604
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:36,278
directions and I like all three of those

605
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,278
I do like Pine though for sure I do like

606
00:21:36,278 --> 00:21:40,679
the the original one hey the original

607
00:21:38,278 --> 00:21:43,839
one the original it was Piney and the

608
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:47,038
sfv had like Pine and it was lemon and

609
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:48,720
Pine in Earth Canada so a lot of what I

610
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:50,119
going on a second information when I ask

611
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,919
questions to people who I really look up

612
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:54,278
to and respect and that's kind of what

613
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:57,840
I've got from most of the people is that

614
00:21:54,278 --> 00:22:00,839
the original OG was a piny gassy so good

615
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:02,439
um fire pine cones chunky pine cones

616
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:04,399
dude it would grow pine cones like not

617
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,240
that great in node spacing but like

618
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,759
amazing buds that [ __ ] you smoke

619
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:12,200
those down to the roach it was gassy all

620
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:14,119
the way down Brian from vital and jaw

621
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,159
Mikey W they got some good ones then

622
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:19,519
there's some other guys can't think of

623
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:22,720
the brand right now but they're in h

624
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:25,440
Selenas living soil we're in we're in us

625
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:29,319
or in the world is the best OG from and

626
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,960
still so there's it's a multi answer a

627
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:33,038
question but like the best so if we go

628
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,480
down into La yeah I feel like if you

629
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:37,960
wanted the best OG like La was where you

630
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,558
go to get OG then if you wanted to go

631
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,798
get cookies like this is like 10 years

632
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:44,000
ago but if you wanted cookies you came

633
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:45,558
up to the Bay cookies sherbet gelato

634
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,079
right all that stuff got pumped out of

635
00:22:45,558 --> 00:22:49,399
the bay um before that it was blue dream

636
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:51,439
when blue dream was [ __ ] cool that

637
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,919
was coming out of the Bay right that was

638
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,278
the original hype stram New York so we

639
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,640
talk about New York and New York had the

640
00:22:55,278 --> 00:23:00,480
sour but came from California to New

641
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:02,278
York interesting right but then there's

642
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,278
an interesting thing that happened in

643
00:23:02,278 --> 00:23:05,480
the late 90s early 2000s we got these

644
00:23:04,278 --> 00:23:07,960
beaster

645
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,679
strains we got the Canadian be I know

646
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,440
anything about those yeah so that that

647
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:14,000
was like before your time right no that

648
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,200
was my that was your day yeah so we got

649
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,919
the beers I had to bring it up on the

650
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:22,319
show yeah we got the beers and so they

651
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:24,919
would come down to the bay and they were

652
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:27,519
like a football that was a pound was

653
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:29,799
this big and a pound should be this big

654
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:33,079
okay so you maybe got the beers then

655
00:23:29,798 --> 00:23:34,558
yeah all the stuff pretty dense a step

656
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:36,359
further never mind I didn't see them at

657
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:39,558
that step i' seen them before then yeah

658
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:42,798
so I mean this was like 97 to

659
00:23:39,558 --> 00:23:44,399
200 you know 4 2005 probably maybe a

660
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:47,480
little before that but okay there was

661
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:50,480
this period where the beers the BC Bud

662
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:53,079
took over uh a lot of this stuff and it

663
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,798
was it was interesting as far as like

664
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:56,918
that there were bigger numbers of stuff

665
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:59,240
so you could get a hundred of this or

666
00:23:56,919 --> 00:24:01,640
whatever uh but

667
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,679
a lot of stuff they ran 03 to it so it

668
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,759
didn't smell and so there was like a hay

669
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,759
smell to it some of the stuff looked

670
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:09,558
really good but it was also compressed

671
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:11,000
right so there's the orange crush I

672
00:24:09,558 --> 00:24:12,918
remember we had really good orange crush

673
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,119
and some other a bunch of other genetics

674
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:18,278
do you remember the names of them

675
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:21,519
so let's see cuz I remember the names I

676
00:24:18,278 --> 00:24:23,278
can after I jog so Jamaican was like the

677
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:26,879
main one it was the Jamaican big bud it

678
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:29,759
was just these big huge donkey like lime

679
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:32,440
green and their bud like they were 12 in

680
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:34,000
buds though yeah I remember seeing bus

681
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:37,000
they didn't smoke worth of [ __ ] like

682
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
they were just they were horrible smoke

683
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,720
they looked amazing bag of Peel through

684
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,640
the roof and they smell kind of like hey

685
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,798
like they didn't really have much smell

686
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,600
and a lot of the buyers were approving

687
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:48,918
the packs without actually opening the

688
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:51,278
bags so you'd bring like a 20 pack and

689
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:53,840
they'd be in sleeves yeah back sleeves

690
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:56,398
and they would just look and they'd see

691
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:57,798
the big long donks in the lime green as

692
00:24:56,398 --> 00:24:59,839
long as they were like the right trim

693
00:24:57,798 --> 00:25:01,679
and they were like great look they just

694
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:03,119
would approve them well a lot of times

695
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,798
you'd have to go up to Seattle or

696
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:07,398
wherever they were going to get them and

697
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:09,278
you'd have to go into a garage and of

698
00:25:07,398 --> 00:25:11,079
somebody's house typically and you pull

699
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:12,720
in and there's a bunch of packs and

700
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:14,158
you're actually going through some of

701
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,000
them opening them up to find the right

702
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,320
ones then you got to go on look to find

703
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,640
the rest if you're going for 200 you

704
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:20,839
don't have time to open every single one

705
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,320
of them so what You' do is you would

706
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:24,558
basically look for specific ones you'd

707
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:26,480
open it you'd remember what it looks

708
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:27,798
like and you try it hopefully you picked

709
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,759
all the ones that look like that if

710
00:25:27,798 --> 00:25:34,038
you're good you hit it 100% if you were

711
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:35,519
bad you hit it a lot less but yeah you

712
00:25:34,038 --> 00:25:37,000
were going for the 100% because there

713
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:39,119
could be mixed ones in there that just

714
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,119
had no smell to them some of them didn't

715
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:43,038
even look good right you know but like

716
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:45,319
because it was all mixed

717
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:47,359
together but yeah wild interesting

718
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:51,240
talking someone on either end of it um I

719
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:52,839
definitely was only a part of like like

720
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:55,120
the rounding it up so I don't know what

721
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:57,720
they did beyond that but I definitely

722
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:59,439
was uh Juicy Fruit came down from Canada

723
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,919
so this the same strain so Jamaican

724
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,519
juicy fruit is the same thing just

725
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:06,278
renamed okay so that's the same strain

726
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:08,558
the same from what I from what I was

727
00:26:06,278 --> 00:26:10,839
taught as a as a young lad um and then

728
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:13,720
there was Louie which is Lui Legends of

729
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:15,519
ultimate indicia it was Sugar Shack they

730
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,278
tasted like smell like carrots kind of a

731
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:18,639
little bit red hair some other strains

732
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:20,960
were just like the hash plant back in

733
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,200
the day was a little bit higher end and

734
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,759
the lizard was another pheno of that the

735
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,720
jir um God Bud was another really

736
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:31,798
popular godd I remember Shish is another

737
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:34,919
one for sure and then there's uh

738
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:36,599
Hawaiian the Hawaiian big buds M and a

739
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:38,440
couple others blueberry and a couple

740
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:39,439
others were around too blueberry yeah

741
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,679
it's funny because there's a few

742
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,038
different blueberries on the mar

743
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:44,679
grapefruit yeah you like s grapefruit

744
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:46,839
you ever tried s's grapefruit New York

745
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:49,919
City Diesel no that one's pretty special

746
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:51,879
tooa I don't know it [ __ ] it it yields

747
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,038
like crazy it's a huge plant and it's

748
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:55,720
super grapefruit like it is grapefruit

749
00:26:54,038 --> 00:26:57,000
chps it is the most grapefruit out of

750
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,038
anything I've tried over the years maybe

751
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,240
that cuz like a lot of the grapefruit

752
00:26:58,038 --> 00:27:01,240
pack we were getting were from the

753
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:03,038
Vietnamese people and there's a really

754
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,240
good chance that they just got seeds or

755
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:07,240
whatever that it was so gra fruit like

756
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,880
they had this and it was like orange

757
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,798
hair like super orange hairs little golf

758
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,720
balls up to like the size of an orange

759
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:14,359
well yeah the buds would stack really

760
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:18,200
really good you get big I mean even

761
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:19,759
indoor you got chunky big colas okay so

762
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,000
see a green these guys used to just yeah

763
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:24,319
totally small plants and like flip them

764
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,359
yeah like they used to get a room and

765
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:28,200
like the the Gorilla growing they would

766
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:30,319
do in Canada was like you have your room

767
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,880
whatever the dimensions were that would

768
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:33,879
be the your bed and they would just make

769
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,640
one big bed the whole room yeah and they

770
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,200
would just put the seeds or Cuts all in

771
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,480
the room and they would just grow and

772
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,000
they were just wrecking houses and

773
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,200
that's why growing gave such a bad name

774
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,759
in BC because these guys were literally

775
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,159
like ruining houses totally yeah when it

776
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:48,158
was all grown in houses back in the day

777
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,360
just like it was here in California I

778
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,480
mean I guess there was maybe a handful

779
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:53,479
of people that figured out how to get

780
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:57,558
scale but right most people and stuff

781
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:59,440
yeah bunkers warehouses early days uh

782
00:27:57,558 --> 00:28:01,319
but yeah grown in houses so how did you

783
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,519
start getting or when did you get into

784
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:06,918
cultivation I was uh

785
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:09,159
18 well for a while I was a kid like not

786
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:10,480
even 16 I was doing seeds in my backyard

787
00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:12,919
lived in the highlands which was kind of

788
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,480
a rural area and I never successfully

789
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:16,759
flowered anything out they always died

790
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,919
before I could but I was like a kid and

791
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:20,440
I was already playing around and then

792
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:23,080
when I was 18 19 I started working at

793
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:25,840
the shipyard yeah and my dad was kind of

794
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:27,839
like a legendary biker in the area so

795
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:29,678
all the guys at theard knew who I was

796
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:31,319
nice so this one guy that I guess looked

797
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,320
up to my dad's stuff was like took me in

798
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:35,599
he's like yo come I'll show you how to

799
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:37,038
grow up my place blah blah blah blah and

800
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:38,839
I got him some genetics and that was

801
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:40,278
actually the first place I washed at and

802
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:42,839
I was like yo I want to make hash out of

803
00:28:40,278 --> 00:28:44,759
your Smalls and your and your trim and

804
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:46,319
he's like okay and that was the first

805
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:48,079
hash I ever made was his and I was

806
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:50,639
working at the shipyard and I would just

807
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:53,079
go by there and water before people

808
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,480
started selling trim or after way before

809
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:56,759
this is

810
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,640
19989 so I remember those years too

811
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:00,240
because people did not sell trim like

812
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,880
you you could get it for free a lot of

813
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,919
times it be fan leaves mixed you get

814
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:06,080
free till 2005 you get free yeah I mean

815
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,880
and a lot of it like my friends trimmed

816
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:10,599
wet not all of them but for the most

817
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:12,278
part we trimmed wet right and then I was

818
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:13,719
like I need to buy a chest freezer and

819
00:29:12,278 --> 00:29:15,359
that's when we used to make bubble hat

820
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:18,640
and I get the free it'd be mixed in with

821
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:20,639
the fan leaves but it was still really

822
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,440
good and it was fresh frozen you know so

823
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:26,880
we froze it we whipped it in a freaking

824
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,960
paint mixer I didn't so I did that when

825
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,880
I decided I was going commercial with it

826
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,600
but like when we started out it was a 5

827
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,600
gallon bucket okay pre-bubble bag you

828
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:38,319
stir with a wooden spoon in ice who

829
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:40,079
you're kind of and and then you pour

830
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:42,079
yeah you use a red Solo cup and this is

831
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:44,319
my buddy Luke taught me this way back in

832
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:46,798
the day you use the Red Solo Cup to

833
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:48,558
scoop the ice out right okay and then

834
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:50,480
any plant material ice you scoop it out

835
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:52,240
and then till you keep scooping it down

836
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,360
and then you pour the very end so the

837
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,038
hash gets poured over to silk screen we

838
00:29:54,359 --> 00:30:00,558
used to dry it on the silk screen this

839
00:29:56,038 --> 00:30:02,278
is 90 damn 798 maybe this is pre-bubble

840
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:03,839
bags they're before yeah we got Bubble

841
00:30:02,278 --> 00:30:06,359
Bags shortly after that you get the idea

842
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:09,558
from Europe like from no he got it from

843
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:11,959
some hippies up in in uh Sonoma I

844
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:15,599
believe cool uh he had a spot in

845
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:17,840
ocidental or whatever and but they uh

846
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:19,639
yeah and so pretty [ __ ] amazing

847
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:21,599
though we were smoking badass hash it

848
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,720
was super amazing bubble hash that

849
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:25,959
really bubbled because you weren't

850
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,319
agitating it hard right and you you

851
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:30,038
being super gentle and you're doing the

852
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:31,798
paddle Tech where is we were like

853
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:33,558
grabbing paint mixer or drywall mud

854
00:30:31,798 --> 00:30:35,158
mixers and we went straight to the

855
00:30:33,558 --> 00:30:36,798
industrial cuz I already knew I had

856
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:38,640
multiple people with huge garbage bags

857
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:40,278
full of the product and like it was

858
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,880
going bad in the garbage bags and so we

859
00:30:40,278 --> 00:30:43,159
had to do it right away I didn't even we

860
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,919
didn't even think about freezing it at

861
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:46,799
first we just left it in the garage in

862
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:47,840
the garbage bags it wasn't until later

863
00:30:46,798 --> 00:30:49,759
we're like why don't we freeze this

864
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:51,319
stuff like yeah oh yeah and it wasn't

865
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:52,839
until later and it works okay with dry

866
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:56,798
PL material but the Frozen is where it's

867
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:58,480
at for sure especially TPS uh I got so

868
00:30:56,798 --> 00:31:00,558
we were doing that we were getting free

869
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,679
and I had a big Oak Tree in my backyard

870
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:04,079
mhm and so we had lines that went over

871
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:06,399
the oak tree so I could do three bubble

872
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:08,519
bags at a time with pulley on them right

873
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:10,119
right and so we did the pulley system

874
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:11,399
where you could tie it down so it would

875
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:12,638
pull it up and it would drain where you

876
00:31:11,398 --> 00:31:14,678
didn't have to break your back because

877
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:16,079
we were doing the big 20 gallons there's

878
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:18,159
a tech you can do where you don't have

879
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:19,918
to break your back but but this was we

880
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,480
didn't know anything to figure out so we

881
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,200
bought it's so funny cuz we were so far

882
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,480
ahead of our time in some ways we had

883
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,880
bought a washing machine thinking dude

884
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,240
wouldn't it be great to be able to use a

885
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,320
washing machine now it's just is like

886
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,558
kind of the it became the standard and

887
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:33,879
this was 20 years before it became the

888
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:35,119
standard yeah you're you're ahead of

889
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,080
your time with the paddle and you're

890
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:37,959
ahead of your time with the washing

891
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:39,119
machine yeah my buddy who yeah we tried

892
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,519
we actually tried using a washing

893
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:42,319
machine we brought it over we [ __ ]

894
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:43,880
didn't figure out how to make it work

895
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:45,918
had we done that maybe the mash bag

896
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,480
wasn't on the idea exactly we would have

897
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:49,960
been revolutionaries had we done that

898
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:52,399
properly and you never know hey man you

899
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:54,759
were you were like this close bunch of

900
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:56,079
Stoners yeah and then uh but it's all

901
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:57,480
about the passion right like why are you

902
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:58,480
doing that cuz you and you made some

903
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,159
fire

904
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,679
you forever to do it yeah all that stuff

905
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:04,679
is super fun and exciting and you feel

906
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:07,159
like you're uh creating something new or

907
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:09,159
inventing stuff there's there's some

908
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:11,960
excitement that I get from exp yeah

909
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:13,919
exactly like your Uncharted territories

910
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:15,919
Christopher Columbus exactly right I

911
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:17,360
mean he's not the best example but no

912
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:18,559
but you're like an inventor like you

913
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:20,918
know what I mean exactly you're Albert

914
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:22,879
Einstein Einstein's a great example

915
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:26,120
Thomas Edison Albert Einstein you know

916
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:28,360
like weed light bulbs totally but uh

917
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:31,719
yeah and then BHL we started doing be B

918
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:33,599
early 2000s before they had dab rcks

919
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:35,079
right and so we were blasting B was the

920
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:37,719
first B blast you ever did and I'll tell

921
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:40,398
you mine so we had a table and we had

922
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:43,399
slots in the table I the first was just

923
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:44,918
uh tubes PVC tubes with with ones and

924
00:32:43,398 --> 00:32:45,959
then my buddy came over the same guy who

925
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:47,919
actually taught me how to make bubble

926
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,399
has came over and was like dude we're

927
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:52,038
gonna we're gonna do this it's open

928
00:32:49,398 --> 00:32:54,558
blasting right and we did in uh four

929
00:32:52,038 --> 00:32:56,038
tubes in each after bubble right yeah

930
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:58,158
this is so after this is yours after

931
00:32:56,038 --> 00:33:00,158
bubble but you know there I guess people

932
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,840
started doing it probably in '98 K from

933
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,559
triome Technologies wrote a paper on it

934
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:05,558
in '98 right okay we started doing it

935
00:33:03,558 --> 00:33:09,038
over 2000s I didn't know him back then

936
00:33:05,558 --> 00:33:11,519
but we had a table it had four PVC tubes

937
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:13,839
in it and each PVC tube would get two

938
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:15,440
cans of butane and we would take it had

939
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:17,599
three holes on one side one hole on the

940
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:20,038
other we'd have a [ __ ] coffee filter

941
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:22,398
that was cut that it would go through

942
00:33:20,038 --> 00:33:24,798
and we would pack it down with plant

943
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:28,158
material buds whatever we you know I

944
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:29,918
mean but you would [ __ ] pump so you

945
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,960
have two at a time so you go here you do

946
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:33,799
these you go these ones you go these

947
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,200
ones and then after you get to all four

948
00:33:33,798 --> 00:33:36,599
you go back to the beginning you try one

949
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,440
more time because it goes you get like

950
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:40,480
one little blast out of it then you jump

951
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:43,558
onto the second can and you do those

952
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,880
same thing and we go into Pyrex dish

953
00:33:43,558 --> 00:33:48,678
with the double burner it was like a

954
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:51,039
camp uh griddle that we used on the

955
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:54,159
bottom like a flame one what's that not

956
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:56,158
a flame one [ __ ] you electric electric

957
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:58,519
griddle and so the electric griddle

958
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:00,639
would work as a double burner cuz

959
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:03,720
the water in it and whatever uh below

960
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:05,240
the Pyrex yep and we the water and the

961
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:07,759
water be hot and it would warm up the

962
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:09,559
utan so would bubble very slowly warm up

963
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:11,480
the butane and it would burn the butane

964
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:13,239
off and you'd be left with the butter

965
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,719
that you whip at the end you know we

966
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:17,598
yeah I think that was like prey shatter

967
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:19,918
that was the original was the butter and

968
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,359
uh on like a Pyrex Square dish correct

969
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:23,759
the same thing we had and you would get

970
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:25,639
slabs that you would peel off and it was

971
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,240
super turpy and the funny thing is my

972
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:28,760
buddy came back cuz I was like man that

973
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:31,078
stuff's so toxic and gross I can't

974
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:33,599
believe we use PVC we probably poisoned

975
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:36,440
ourselves and all our friends and and

976
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:39,879
then he came back in 2015 had gotten

977
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:41,800
these tests run on it there was no zero

978
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:43,759
well no he been he made a batch and then

979
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:46,839
wanted to test it with the same Tech and

980
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,599
I was like PVC bro I you can't smoke PVC

981
00:34:46,838 --> 00:34:51,320
bro that's hella bad and I could talk

982
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:53,960
[ __ ] about it he came at me with a COA

983
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:57,119
where he had every possible test run and

984
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:59,039
all these things zero butane and so he's

985
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,280
like told you so and I'm like I don't

986
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:03,000
know but like definitely plastic PVC is

987
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,280
not the way to blast people that do that

988
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,760
that's not a good idea now we know

989
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:08,240
better for sure for sure for sure not we

990
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:11,040
smoked a lot of it

991
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:12,919
though yeah I uh I didn't smoke too much

992
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:13,960
of that and I didn't I didn't want to

993
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,000
share the tech CU I was worried about

994
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,800
people blowing themselves up but my

995
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,358
first experience was just on my patio on

996
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,039
my deck my condo and we used a turkey

997
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:22,759
Bas here at the grocery store they had

998
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:24,759
like a metal turkey Bas or like kind of

999
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:27,000
a high quality one and then used a hose

1000
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:28,960
clamp with a with the coffee filter on

1001
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,519
the bottom end and then we just put the

1002
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,159
thing right just pack the turkey baser

1003
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:34,679
full of the flowers and then and then

1004
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:36,000
just put the butane on the top end and

1005
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:37,759
it passed through all the butane and it

1006
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,159
would leak into the Pyrex of the coffee

1007
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,440
filter gravity would go through it all

1008
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:43,078
and then you have your liquid in there

1009
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,880
and then you just put it in the seems

1010
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:47,400
like hella work yeah probably but but

1011
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,000
again it was like small batch just like

1012
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,200
trying to make some oil for Dabs at the

1013
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,679
time you know and and it's just

1014
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:53,118
experimenting it was just like it's

1015
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:55,679
pretty ingenious though I feel like

1016
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:57,960
that's I mean that's you know that's the

1017
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:59,639
it's way better than PVC right right

1018
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,720
right right you know in the same in the

1019
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:03,239
same note you it's a lot of work it

1020
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:04,679
seems like it was actually really easy

1021
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:06,318
just pack the thing put the host clamp

1022
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:08,118
in coffee filter and the host clamp held

1023
00:36:06,318 --> 00:36:09,880
the coffee filter and then the butane in

1024
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:11,680
the top right where it usually squirts

1025
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,838
out and it would just pass through right

1026
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:15,559
and it would drip into the the bowl the

1027
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:17,400
BS in hot water just like you did same

1028
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:19,318
thing with the whipping same thing dude

1029
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:22,240
that stuff is great and it was turpy and

1030
00:36:19,318 --> 00:36:23,559
it was good I mean for being a 1.0

1031
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:25,959
version of something that's now turned

1032
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:27,199
into my was always racing doing it

1033
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,639
though I didn't like the fact that the

1034
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:30,358
gases and everything I was definitely

1035
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:32,519
always on edge doing it so I always wore

1036
00:36:30,358 --> 00:36:34,838
a mask when I was doing I always I there

1037
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:36,719
was people that that blew themselves up

1038
00:36:34,838 --> 00:36:38,519
shortly after we started and I was like

1039
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:40,879
I want to blow myself up like that when

1040
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:42,079
I got given the tack I was given it with

1041
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,200
a lot of warning and I just didn't want

1042
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:45,079
to I didn't want to live with sharing it

1043
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:46,519
with someone and them having something

1044
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:48,599
to do with them so I just like left it

1045
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:50,719
there and and then over the next years

1046
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:51,800
it obviously evolved to what it did um

1047
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:53,598
but I kind of just stuck with bubble

1048
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,680
hash at that point how did you smoke it

1049
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:56,760
when you first started doing did you

1050
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:59,159
smoke it on coal where you you heat the

1051
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:02,240
coal up and then use a straw or no I

1052
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:05,559
think we either put it in were we

1053
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:07,358
dabbing then I think we're almost

1054
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:09,799
dabbing like back then we were smoking

1055
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:12,000
our bubble hash in a RAR bong from

1056
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:14,000
Germany and we Ed these angle bowls and

1057
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
they would be smoked on a screen so

1058
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,719
maybe we would put like the oil on Ash

1059
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,079
and then use a hemp Wick and light it

1060
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:22,439
yeah maybe that or we would just like

1061
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:24,200
mix it in our joints I think we might

1062
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:27,960
have a titanium nail by this point I'm

1063
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:30,118
not 100% sure I'm not sure exact 2004

1064
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:32,920
yeah it it was a while after that that I

1065
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:34,599
I think it was like maybe 2005 or six

1066
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,760
that I remember da RS maybe it was a

1067
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:38,200
little after that even but titanium

1068
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,560
nails were the first I don't think we

1069
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:41,960
were I was I don't think I was quite

1070
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:45,078
using a titanium nail then but but I

1071
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:47,079
knew people who were and and I wasn't I

1072
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:49,119
wasn't about it with the the quality of

1073
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:50,760
the just knowing the butane everything I

1074
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,720
wasn't like I was just sus with it I

1075
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,040
just didn't totally totally trust it

1076
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:55,519
yeah I didn't know what it was so I was

1077
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:57,599
like I'm like I knew it got me really

1078
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:59,280
high though I knew that for sure so but

1079
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,240
I was definitely I'm like we don't know

1080
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,480
what we're doing here we don't know what

1081
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:03,479
heavy metals are left in this and I

1082
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,119
don't trust it so I'm going to I came

1083
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,960
from the world of hot knives Right Where

1084
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:08,640
You me to dude the hot knives you know

1085
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,119
maybe that's what we did that's probably

1086
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:12,318
what we did we probably hot knifed it

1087
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:13,720
the hot knives were the way I think I

1088
00:38:12,318 --> 00:38:15,119
remember the bubble has wooden Hot Knife

1089
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:17,159
had burn off before you could get a real

1090
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:18,800
hit because it was too liquidy I'm not

1091
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:21,279
sure we always did the old school like

1092
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,359
Moroccan style but like some old classic

1093
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,240
has that they made in Humble we could we

1094
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:26,838
could hit the hot knives and just get

1095
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:28,719
wrecked yeah I was hot knifing right up

1096
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:30,440
until dabbing now obviously it was doing

1097
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:32,078
it way less but like whenever like there

1098
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:34,318
was that person that just wanted to get

1099
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,760
like the extra high we bust them out and

1100
00:38:34,318 --> 00:38:38,358
be like okay you know the flowers just

1101
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,560
aren't doing it or you want to go to

1102
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:42,159
that place let's do this exactly exactly

1103
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:44,679
and and we do it but like it was like

1104
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:47,078
once a year maybe you know gravity bongs

1105
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:48,279
you guys gravity bongs too yeah and we I

1106
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:49,400
was talking to a guy today he's like

1107
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,400
those gravity bongs doing now those

1108
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,400
aren't gravity bongs like the real

1109
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,480
gravity bongs have a have a valve and

1110
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,318
they have water in them and when it's

1111
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:57,679
time to do it you that water goes down

1112
00:38:55,318 --> 00:38:59,559
and that toe gets SL like slammed in you

1113
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:01,440
hold the thing up and then yeah yeah and

1114
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:03,799
like that's the real gravity bong I'm

1115
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,200
like okay you tap people out people

1116
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,480
would never want to smoke again after

1117
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:07,598
that if they did their first time they

1118
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,400
probably wouldn't want to smoke again a

1119
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:11,039
lot of people and and it's interesting

1120
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,240
how like that was like fun for us back

1121
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:15,039
in the day but if you really think about

1122
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:17,159
it it's not the way you want you want

1123
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:19,239
people to but that goes into the

1124
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:21,199
Explorer part of ourselves you know that

1125
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:24,159
you know the guy who wants to try or go

1126
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:26,199
on the adventure of different methods

1127
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:28,199
you know it's like some of these guys

1128
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:30,118
smoke out of apples and watermelons and

1129
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,679
whatever else to go to that you know

1130
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:34,079
they want to go through those phases and

1131
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:36,719
it's like for me that was fun when I was

1132
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:38,480
younger though even bongs like I still

1133
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:40,399
smoke a bong but not all the time but

1134
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,960
like I have a bong ready to go I still

1135
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,639
enjoy the bongers but I don't enjoy the

1136
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,639
seven-footers or the four-footers

1137
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:46,838
anymore even it's like a little I think

1138
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:49,440
I'm more referring to like beginner

1139
00:39:46,838 --> 00:39:51,639
smokers who get uh deterred from smoking

1140
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,559
by people who kind of mess them up with

1141
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:55,239
too strong of a dose that's kind of what

1142
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:57,880
I'm eating yeah for sure and then and

1143
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:59,759
then they they could be potentially

1144
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,680
uh consuming a substance that could make

1145
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,400
their every day or every week life

1146
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:04,838
better but they're so scared of it that

1147
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,240
they can't even they won't even try it

1148
00:40:04,838 --> 00:40:07,759
and I I know we know all know people

1149
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:10,159
like this and that's something I think

1150
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,400
we should all try not to do so much yeah

1151
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:12,838
a lot of times we do it unintentionally

1152
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,880
like with these slurpers and these dabs

1153
00:40:12,838 --> 00:40:17,199
now are pretty potent and I think a lot

1154
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,880
of yeah for sure there's a lot of potent

1155
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:20,838
ways to smoke now like for if you're a

1156
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,280
real smoker there's ways to get there

1157
00:40:20,838 --> 00:40:25,000
and and very

1158
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:27,680
easily uh but I I like the fact that

1159
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,318
there's mild Edibles that people were

1160
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:31,719
taking small doses of you know cuz we

1161
00:40:30,318 --> 00:40:33,318
didn't measure anything back in the day

1162
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:36,159
we're like how much [ __ ] can we put in

1163
00:40:33,318 --> 00:40:38,719
this Brownie and I wouldn't do Edibles

1164
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:40,759
for time because of how what we did to

1165
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:43,838
each other and it wasn't until there was

1166
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:46,480
actually milligrams on items and and I

1167
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:48,679
like very cautiously tried them and then

1168
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,679
I built a confidence for it that yeah I

1169
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:52,399
was scared from Edibles completely just

1170
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:54,440
from what we' done to each other in the

1171
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:57,358
in the early 2000s totally where you're

1172
00:40:54,440 --> 00:41:00,000
tripping for a day it's like literally

1173
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:02,078
what happens yeah seriously going to

1174
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,679
regy on the river eating a whole dude

1175
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:06,000
whole one whole brownie that was

1176
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:08,919
probably like a 500 or 700 milligram

1177
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,519
brownie than having like trippy

1178
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,800
experience yeah some people like that

1179
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:15,079
some people don't some people can't

1180
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,760
handle it I think a huge part of it is a

1181
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:18,519
fight ORF flight response I think and if

1182
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:20,040
you try to fight a buzz that's already

1183
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:22,318
going to happen you got to kind of ride

1184
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:23,960
it out and so once you accept it in your

1185
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:25,920
head and you can just enjoy the Buzz for

1186
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,039
what it is then it's dope but if you're

1187
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,039
sitting there trying to fight something

1188
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:30,599
that you can't beat it's going to be a

1189
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:32,838
long journey it's going to be a struggle

1190
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:34,880
be a struggle yeah I think there's a lot

1191
00:41:32,838 --> 00:41:37,759
of life lessons from stuff like that

1192
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:40,400
that relate to everything fair fair fair

1193
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,760
you know I think yeah accepting

1194
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,200
accepting everything especially when

1195
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,680
you're tripping dude like you definitely

1196
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:48,279

there and met so many really great

1208
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,960
people especially like hash makers and

1209
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:14,200
Growers and just like the level of

1210
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:15,720
passion because of like the hardships of

1211
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:19,358
where they came from because of how

1212
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:21,118
illegal it was is is really always cool

1213

world I find the most passionate awesome

1215
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,119
people come from the hardest uh most

1216
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:29,759
illegal places a lot of times totally

1217
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:32,559
not always from Humble somewhere so free

1218
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,920
you know you know s from right yeah kind

1219
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:36,720
of Florida or New York or New York he

1220
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:39,800
still got the accent actually yeah yeah

1221
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:41,919
yeah Ed Ed Rosenthal New York he's

1222
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,839
another New Yorker okay the most

1223
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,159
stubborn guys AR from New York

1224
00:42:43,838 --> 00:42:47,318
interesting because they've had to deal

1225
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:50,039
with a lot I guess or maybe and it's a

1226
00:42:47,318 --> 00:42:52,199
huge City a lot of attitude I loved it

1227
00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:54,599
it was so cool yeah I think it's great

1228
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:57,318
that so much flare legalization has

1229
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:59,200
really happened over there and I feel

1230
00:42:57,318 --> 00:43:01,679
like they're doing it right very much

1231
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:03,558
agree you know from back in the day

1232
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:06,519
where they could uh stop and search you

1233
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:08,800
for no reason at all right what what an

1234
00:43:06,519 --> 00:43:11,480
evolution yeah being from the west coast

1235
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:14,000
of Canada New York has always been the

1236
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:16,039
top buyer for product they've always

1237
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,679
paid more than anybody there's yeah you

1238
00:43:16,039 --> 00:43:19,079
knew if you were tapped into the buyer

1239
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:20,838
circles there was always one guy that

1240
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:23,400
knew a New York buyer and they would pay

1241
00:43:20,838 --> 00:43:24,719
more than anybody else and the way it

1242
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:27,480
worked when the beaser days were going

1243
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:29,399
on is La saw or whatever the West Coast

1244
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:32,519
saw most of the gear yeah and New York

1245
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:35,119
saw like another level of gear and then

1246
00:43:32,519 --> 00:43:36,559
Toronto would see like whatever was left

1247
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,280
over just because the dollar right it's

1248
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:39,960
just straight up and eventually as the

1249
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,079
beers slowed down a lot of that was

1250
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,440
trying to be pushed to New York but I

1251
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:43,920
don't think they took a lot of it

1252
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:46,200
somebody went to Chicago from what I

1253
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,800
know and a lot of it started just go

1254
00:43:46,199 --> 00:43:50,919
east to Toronto and like further east

1255
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,280
yeah across Canada right because the

1256
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:54,039
people are still growing all this large

1257
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,000
amount of volume and like what the [ __ ]

1258
00:43:54,039 --> 00:43:58,558
we going to do with it you know what I

1259
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,280
mean so Toronto went from like not like

1260
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:01,800
getting like those juicies and stuff

1261
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:04,040
like that and not really knowing what

1262
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:07,079
good flour was to being some of the most

1263
00:44:04,039 --> 00:44:08,759
picky people around because they slowly

1264
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:10,960
but surely as The Bard tightened they

1265
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:14,200
started getting all the gear yeah and

1266
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,599
and and now they they get it all and and

1267
00:44:14,199 --> 00:44:17,399
and they you have producers growing

1268
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:19,559
really good flour now too for sure for

1269
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:21,119
sure and I'd say Toronto gets like a

1270
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:22,319
huge portion of like the best flower

1271
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:25,838
that's grown in Canada because they have

1272
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:27,159
the biggest uh uh population in buying

1273
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:29,799
power they make more money there than

1274
00:44:27,159 --> 00:44:31,318
anywhere in Canada so on and so forth so

1275
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:33,200
yeah yeah we were talking about Skittles

1276
00:44:31,318 --> 00:44:35,519
earlier what else are you guys getting

1277
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:37,960
up there genetics wise that's

1278
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:40,400
amazing so there's not a lot of real

1279
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:43,440
Skittles in Canada like I can count on

1280
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:46,920
one hand same here the amount of people

1281
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:49,519
that I would um can reach out and know

1282
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:52,400
that they're sending me real Z and and

1283
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:55,039
even I'd say half those five aren't even

1284
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:57,240
the original cut they're like a a z a

1285
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:58,838
oneoff z Cross or something or very Z

1286
00:44:57,239 --> 00:45:02,078
leaning cross you know what I mean

1287
00:44:58,838 --> 00:45:03,318
rainbow belts 2.0 or whatever exactly

1288
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,039
yeah and a lot of the belts that I'm

1289
00:45:03,318 --> 00:45:07,800
finding in Canada aren't very Z leaning

1290
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:09,000
at all because a lot of them um either

1291
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,440
didn't know what to hunt for when they

1292
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,199
hunted it right because they don't

1293
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:13,599
they've never seen the real Z so how do

1294
00:45:12,199 --> 00:45:15,558
you know what to hunt for you know go

1295
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:18,160
for looks

1296
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:21,319
then or if it's a grower probably

1297
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:22,719
biomass right totally so whereas you

1298
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:24,039
want the candy but then the candy one

1299
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:25,838
doesn't have a good structure and so

1300
00:45:24,039 --> 00:45:28,199
anytime you breed with Skittles they

1301
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:30,759
breed towards the structure anything

1302
00:45:28,199 --> 00:45:32,000
that's going to be real Skitty goes hand

1303
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:34,440
in hand with

1304
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,559
the the structure that's not quite as

1305
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:39,880
nice it's not yeah it's a little looser

1306
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:42,160
uh you the tricomes don't form up on it

1307
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:43,480
quite as good and as a fenal Hunter it's

1308
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:45,480
a lot of the characteristics you're not

1309
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,679
going to look for except for the profile

1310
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,280
that one is if you're going for the

1311
00:45:46,679 --> 00:45:50,199
Skittles you have to look yeah it's

1312
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:51,400
about the profile that's more than

1313
00:45:50,199 --> 00:45:52,960
anything because it's not about the

1314
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:56,480
looks it's not about the Vigor it's not

1315
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:58,199
about a lot of stuff but uh you know

1316
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:01,599
finding something in the middle or that

1317
00:45:58,199 --> 00:46:03,118
blends good with moonbo moonbo from

1318
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,359
archive that that one's fire that's why

1319
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:06,960
the belts was what it was right yeah

1320
00:46:04,358 --> 00:46:09,239
exactly so um and I I'm fortunate enough

1321
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:12,880
to have that cut interesting story how I

1322
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:14,118
got it um during Co someone from New

1323
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,760
Mexico said they're going to send it to

1324
00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:18,000
me and I was kind of like yeah right and

1325
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:20,119
then I don't know where it showed up and

1326
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,239
then I had to mail him something back

1327
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:23,640
but I couldn't really get to the post

1328
00:46:21,239 --> 00:46:25,679
office in Eno because anyway it's co

1329
00:46:23,639 --> 00:46:27,118
stuff and blah blah blah I end up

1330
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:29,000
getting him some seeds eventually but

1331
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:32,000
yeah I have a I have a good rainbow

1332
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:35,519
belts cut ni um from a saw dude that

1333
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,639
sent it from New Mexico and the Z I uh

1334
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:40,599
had to get back myself in another in

1335
00:46:37,639 --> 00:46:42,879
other ways yeah and um but I have both

1336
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:43,800
those cuts and and I really like I

1337
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,160
really like both of them they're

1338
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:48,039
probably two of my favorite strains we

1339
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:49,440
have nice and a big part of that is cuz

1340
00:46:48,039 --> 00:46:50,960
during when I went to Amsterdam last

1341
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,920
year I didn't do much hunting I had a

1342
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,559
new grower kind of take over my facility

1343
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:57,000
so I was just kind of happy with my 30

1344
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:59,000
to 40 cultivars keeping them alive mhm

1345
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,318
versus trying to like cross them and log

1346
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,838
a whole fenal hunt right so um I'm a

1347
00:47:02,318 --> 00:47:06,159
little bit behind on a lot of my hunting

1348
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:07,558
right now um but this year this last

1349
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:09,078
year all the seeds we made I gave a

1350
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:10,760
bunch away in Thailand and we're doing a

1351
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:15,000
huge hunt now so we're back on it this

1352
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:16,160
year but uh I took a a year off and it's

1353
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,318
what I realized is I actually kind of

1354
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:20,078
feel two years behind yeah because I

1355
00:47:18,318 --> 00:47:22,239
felt the year behind that I didn't hunt

1356
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:23,960
but then it takes another you to hunt

1357
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:26,519
yeah so I actually felt two years behind

1358
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:28,199
so um the lesson here is don't ever stop

1359
00:47:26,519 --> 00:47:30,119
hunting don't ever stop hunting you got

1360
00:47:28,199 --> 00:47:31,239
to keep it going for sure yeah otherwise

1361
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:33,200
you're going to rely on other people's

1362
00:47:31,239 --> 00:47:34,519
stuff so when did you start breeding

1363
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:36,879
because you've been making seeds for a

1364
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:42,599
while now

1365
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:44,960
so I think 90 99 wow 99 we started uh in

1366
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:46,640
2015 I started to go to Emerald cup and

1367
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,400
bring I saw there was a void in Canada

1368
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:51,078
of like lack of genetics from all my

1369
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,760
Growers and I could I felt like we had

1370
00:47:51,079 --> 00:47:54,599
the quality of Growers seeing how long

1371
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:56,240
we've been doing this for what we were

1372
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:59,318
lacking was the genetics so I took it

1373
00:47:56,239 --> 00:48:01,318
upon myself to go to Emerald cup and

1374
00:47:59,318 --> 00:48:03,119
first go to different dispensaries and

1375
00:48:01,318 --> 00:48:04,679
figure out what genetics I wanted yeah

1376
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:06,280
and then figure out who bred those

1377
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:08,000
genetics and then I made my list and

1378
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:10,240
went to Emerald and I bought the

1379
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,239
genetics directly from said breeders

1380
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:16,759
sure um it was symbiotic it was Oni

1381
00:48:13,239 --> 00:48:19,118
exotic uh canado yeah um those were the

1382
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:22,000
first people I saw probably some other

1383
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:24,680
I'm forgetting too yeah and capill as

1384
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,800
well anyway and so I started hunting and

1385
00:48:24,679 --> 00:48:27,759
then I get different results from

1386
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:29,200
different breeders yeah and as I you

1387
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,760
know got the results I liked I started

1388
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:33,679
go more to those breeders and um and

1389
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,800
then the next year also I started to

1390
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:36,799
realize that everybody was kind of on

1391
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,280
the hash train I was watching like the

1392
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,200
Breeders and people with the brands when

1393
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,400
they would meet up with each other

1394
00:48:40,199 --> 00:48:44,039
they'd all have these jars in their

1395
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:45,559
pocket and these jars were Rin and that

1396
00:48:44,039 --> 00:48:47,558
was when I could that when I was like

1397
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:49,000
okay this is what all the owners of you

1398
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:50,400
know this is the next wave I could see

1399
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,559
that the rosin was the next wave because

1400
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,440
it's just the way that I just see it and

1401
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:56,839
so I rosin happened real quick I went

1402
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:58,079
home I made that cold room yeah and I

1403
00:48:56,838 --> 00:49:00,119
had a partner back when I was doing this

1404
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:01,680
Temple Kix thing he said that rosin

1405
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:04,358
wasn't going to become anything because

1406
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:06,798
that the parchment was going to leave uh

1407
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:08,798
material in the thing and just going to

1408
00:49:06,798 --> 00:49:10,440
wait for time until that gets found out

1409
00:49:08,798 --> 00:49:12,159
and so I was like oh really I was like

1410
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:14,358
okay and so I kind of believed what he

1411
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:16,879
said for a little bit but then as I went

1412
00:49:14,358 --> 00:49:20,119
to spannabis that year I met Matt and

1413
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:22,680
Joel from sasquash at strain Hunter club

1414
00:49:20,119 --> 00:49:24,798
and uh they showed me the whole process

1415
00:49:22,679 --> 00:49:26,440
and 3 months later I had a new sasquash

1416
00:49:24,798 --> 00:49:28,079
in Vancouver and I was one of the first

1417
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:29,318
people when a few people that I knew

1418
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:31,039
that knew how to press didn't have their

1419
00:49:29,318 --> 00:49:32,480
own presses mhm and they also didn't

1420
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:33,679
have their own material so what I was do

1421
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,920
I just had these guys that knew how to

1422
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:38,519
press come over and do pressing yeah for

1423
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:40,280
basically for us like I would give them

1424
00:49:38,519 --> 00:49:41,480
the the oil for pressing I'd give them a

1425
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:44,000
percentage of doing it and I had all

1426
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:44,960
this extra biomass to press flower rosin

1427
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,280
so they would just come over and they

1428
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,559
would press and they'd get some and I'd

1429
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:50,040
get some and it was just extra biomass

1430
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:51,839
anyway like Smalls or like stuff that I

1431
00:49:50,039 --> 00:49:55,440
didn't need right or like just product

1432
00:49:51,838 --> 00:49:57,519
that wasn't selling and so from there I

1433
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,358
saw the hash rosin being the wave and I

1434
00:49:57,519 --> 00:50:01,559
just got into it I then my first thing I

1435
00:49:59,358 --> 00:50:03,639
did was enter Masters rosin I built a

1436
00:50:01,559 --> 00:50:05,880
cold room in like November and I entered

1437
00:50:03,639 --> 00:50:09,239
Masters in March oh wow and I got fourth

1438
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:10,798
place and that was like the the huge

1439
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:12,879
that's where I met like Frosty and

1440
00:50:10,798 --> 00:50:14,280
Lorenzo and I already met Lorenzo you

1441
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,599
before but that's where like competing

1442
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,040
with them and being at the events at

1443
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:18,760
Masters and being at the dinners and

1444
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:20,119
just being part of the whole process

1445
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:22,280
right was where you really build these

1446
00:50:20,119 --> 00:50:24,119
relationships that are just like

1447
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:27,480
legendary you know and so now here we

1448
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:28,960
are um six years l

1449
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:31,240
and I'm going to go visit Frosty this

1450
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,838
week up in up in Humbolt and and I don't

1451
00:50:31,239 --> 00:50:34,199
know it's just so cool like full circle

1452
00:50:32,838 --> 00:50:35,639
the whole experience and the whole

1453
00:50:34,199 --> 00:50:38,399
journey it's really cool this community

1454
00:50:35,639 --> 00:50:41,358
is really amazing and they're exclusive

1455
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,960
in some ways inclusive in other ways and

1456
00:50:41,358 --> 00:50:44,598
I love the inclusive part where

1457
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:47,880
everybody's part of a bigger community

1458
00:50:44,599 --> 00:50:50,720
and then you know there are exclusive

1459
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:52,798
areas of the community as well and with

1460
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:54,759
genetics people with really good flower

1461
00:50:52,798 --> 00:50:57,679
and then people without that's very

1462
00:50:54,760 --> 00:51:00,400
exclusive still at the very top that

1463
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:03,358
absolutely. 1% not even the 1% but the

1464
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,960
0.1% of the flower and the people that

1465
00:51:03,358 --> 00:51:07,440
everybody knows each other on that level

1466
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:11,079
too I think pretty much or knows you

1467
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:13,240
through somebody else 100% 100% so and I

1468
00:51:11,079 --> 00:51:15,640
like that part I like I like a very good

1469
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:16,879
point smoking the best flour possible

1470
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:18,879
and I feel like most people don't even

1471
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:21,880
get to appreciate the flour that we get

1472
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:24,160
to see on a regular basis and so it's

1473
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:27,079
always something special absolutely no I

1474
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:28,920
feel absolutely blessed to be to have

1475
00:51:27,079 --> 00:51:30,440
smoked the flour and gain the experience

1476
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:32,519
that I have like even just this past

1477
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:35,880
mass of rosin in New York you got people

1478
00:51:32,519 --> 00:51:37,199
from all over the East Coast um with all

1479
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:39,559
their different pallets and their

1480
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:41,000
different stories and backgrounds and

1481
00:51:39,559 --> 00:51:42,200
some of them are from C and some of them

1482
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,639
are not and some of them have been there

1483
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:46,798
the whole L and it's just really cool to

1484
00:51:43,639 --> 00:51:48,759
see their journey and what they hunt and

1485
00:51:46,798 --> 00:51:50,798
why they hunt it and and just the whole

1486
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:51,799
experience is really cool to see all the

1487
00:51:50,798 --> 00:51:53,639
different walks of life and that's why

1488
00:51:51,798 --> 00:51:55,599
spannabis is so important too you got

1489
00:51:53,639 --> 00:51:57,719

1502
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:24,440

00:52:26,639 --> 00:52:30,318
curtains back and people are showing

1506
00:52:28,639 --> 00:52:33,879
each other who they really are and we're

1507
00:52:30,318 --> 00:52:35,759
able to do it on a a legal level that

1508
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:37,720
was never possible before and it's so

1509

every country over there right Chile uh

1525
00:53:14,519 --> 00:53:16,880
they're in the other count so we can

1526
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:18,079
mention them because they're in Spain

1527
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:22,358
right it's not like they're doing it in

1528
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:24,640
Brazil yeah so um but yeah and and it's

1529
00:53:22,358 --> 00:53:27,719
just that passion that comes from places

1530
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:30,039
of adversity yeah and and struggle and

1531
00:53:27,719 --> 00:53:31,318
it's always the the brightest shining

1532
00:53:30,039 --> 00:53:32,759
star yeah I mean those guys in the

1533
00:53:31,318 --> 00:53:35,639
Caribbean are really passionate about

1534
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:36,960
what they do oh yeah uh yeah I got to go

1535
00:53:35,639 --> 00:53:38,358
there with Marlin a while back it was

1536
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,880
which which which place in the St

1537
00:53:38,358 --> 00:53:42,519
Vincent we went over to St Vincent and

1538
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:45,240
visited with the Cannabis Authority and

1539
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:47,119
we gave a lecture on genetics and pollen

1540
00:53:45,239 --> 00:53:48,558
mitigation was part of my like lecture

1541
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:50,160
to them because they're on island and

1542
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,480
it's like I want to explain that that

1543
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:53,558
was the first thing I looked at when I

1544
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:55,960
got off the plane is such a small island

1545
00:53:53,559 --> 00:53:59,880
that like pollen Jamaica it's a big

1546
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:01,519
problem for sure and so yeah first we we

1547
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:03,400
talked to the Cannabis Authority we said

1548
00:54:01,519 --> 00:54:04,838
we're going to be back to get a license

1549
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:06,880
and that still hasn't happen but it's

1550
00:54:04,838 --> 00:54:08,960
still something we would love to do in

1551
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,640
the future I think I made a bunch of

1552
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,400
banana crosses actually to go

1553
00:54:10,639 --> 00:54:14,598
specifically to St Vincent that are

1554
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:16,798
regular seeds Okay and feminized seeds

1555
00:54:14,599 --> 00:54:20,680
that I wanted to give out to everybody

1556
00:54:16,798 --> 00:54:23,039
um so we did legally import seeds into

1557
00:54:20,679 --> 00:54:25,919
St Vincent in

1558
00:54:23,039 --> 00:54:27,558
2019 okay so and it just hasn't really

1559
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,240
evolved in anything much since then or I

1560
00:54:27,559 --> 00:54:31,280
think they're doing it they're doing it

1561
00:54:29,239 --> 00:54:33,679
it hasn't evolved with me they're still

1562
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:35,480
there pushing forward and I'm they've

1563
00:54:33,679 --> 00:54:37,358
gone through their struggles just like

1564
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:39,358
Jamaica and just like are they medically

1565
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:40,920
legal or where they medical right now

1566
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:43,759
yeah it's feel better when it's like

1567
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:46,000
that like as soon as the wreck comes in

1568
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:48,040
you get these corporate people and and

1569
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,760
it it becomes a whole different ball

1570
00:54:48,039 --> 00:54:52,838
game um at least medical you can have it

1571
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:54,799
for the right reasons for the most part

1572
00:54:52,838 --> 00:54:57,558
dude the Canadians keep [ __ ] it up

1573
00:54:54,798 --> 00:54:59,199
they go what do we [ __ ] it up this time

1574
00:54:57,559 --> 00:55:01,839
they go no it's the LPS that are going

1575
00:54:59,199 --> 00:55:05,159
into places and taking over and doing a

1576
00:55:01,838 --> 00:55:06,798
bad job you know and I think we bad name

1577
00:55:05,159 --> 00:55:09,639
on they're putting a bad name on the

1578
00:55:06,798 --> 00:55:11,679
whole industry for taking public money

1579
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:14,118
and and losing people's hard-earned

1580
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:16,318
money and like that's like literally the

1581
00:55:14,119 --> 00:55:19,200
bottom line and then these CEOs and

1582
00:55:16,318 --> 00:55:21,440
these Executives get a payout after for

1583
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:23,719
tanking these companies and and and

1584
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:27,039
basically lying like I don't understand

1585
00:55:23,719 --> 00:55:28,759
corporate business enough maybe but um

1586
00:55:27,039 --> 00:55:31,039
that's from my vantage point what I see

1587
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:32,200
time and time and time again and like

1588
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:34,280
they don't care about the plant they

1589
00:55:32,199 --> 00:55:36,239
don't care about the end consumer

1590
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:38,519
obviously care about their shareholders

1591
00:55:36,239 --> 00:55:40,519
right but they more care about uh trying

1592
00:55:38,519 --> 00:55:42,798
to raise shareholders than actually like

1593
00:55:40,519 --> 00:55:45,239
maintain the business and which they've

1594
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:46,679
bought into right so it's just pump and

1595
00:55:45,239 --> 00:55:48,000
dump is basically what it is in most

1596
00:55:46,679 --> 00:55:49,279
Parts yeah and that model is not good

1597
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,599
for business it's definitely not good

1598
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:53,000
for small

1599
00:55:50,599 --> 00:55:54,440
business the race to the bottom is real

1600
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,679
in the United States you know and that's

1601
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:57,920
the other side it's like either pump and

1602
00:55:55,679 --> 00:55:59,598
dump or long-term race to the bottom to

1603
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:02,159
gain market share it seems like one of

1604
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:04,400
the other um and both of those models

1605
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:06,558
aren't really good for they hurt small

1606
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:08,039
business more than anything yeah and and

1607
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:09,559
I'm all about small business because I'm

1608
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:11,280
a small business person and that's what

1609
00:56:09,559 --> 00:56:13,720
was so dope about Emerald cup and what's

1610
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,920
so dopable spannabis is all the

1611
00:56:13,719 --> 00:56:16,679
especially Emerald cup I would say more

1612
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:18,960
than spannabis because Emerald cup was

1613
00:56:16,679 --> 00:56:21,919
like back in the day not now but like in

1614
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:24,639
20156 it was so cool to see all the

1615
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:26,079
small Ma and PAW businesses and so many

1616
00:56:24,639 --> 00:56:28,358
of them got run out in the last 5 to 10

1617
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:29,599
years and it's really sad for I'm sure

1618
00:56:28,358 --> 00:56:31,078
everybody around here that knows it more

1619
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:32,720
than me like sad for me just some

1620
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:33,920
Canadian come down and see this but I

1621
00:56:32,719 --> 00:56:36,480
don't have to live at first town like a

1622
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:39,480
lot of people here but man it's like I I

1623
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:41,318
can I just empathize as much as possible

1624
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:43,199
it's just crazy the whole dynamic

1625
00:56:41,318 --> 00:56:46,318
because it was so awesome before like it

1626
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:47,919
was so the chalice and early Emerald I

1627
00:56:46,318 --> 00:56:50,519
think a lot of breeders had distinctly

1628
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:52,079
different seed lines too you know what I

1629
00:56:50,519 --> 00:56:53,920
mean like I think they weren't all

1630
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:56,240
breeding the same thing there was a lot

1631
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:58,119
of diversity within the different SE

1632
00:56:56,239 --> 00:57:01,479
companies TGA if you wanted some sort of

1633
00:56:58,119 --> 00:57:04,200
like fruit or really sweet stuff TGA had

1634
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:06,599
some really crazy sweet stuff who's TGA

1635
00:57:04,199 --> 00:57:09,118
the the green Avengers that was subcool

1636
00:57:06,599 --> 00:57:11,480
okay right right so subcool and Miss

1637
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:13,280
Jill back in the day it was it was all

1638
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:15,480
the homies dude Heavenly days from

1639
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:18,119
Canada row want to shout him out he was

1640
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:20,400
really really close to subcool nice yeah

1641
00:57:18,119 --> 00:57:24,240
so there there was sunny cha there was

1642
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:26,798
was uh Ray Odie okay ray from homegrown

1643
00:57:24,239 --> 00:57:29,358
natural wonders and then s Shane from

1644
00:57:26,798 --> 00:57:32,400
Sun Chiba there was Pat and there was

1645
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:33,880
all these amazing guys um those are the

1646
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,200
guys that I'm pretty good friends with

1647
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:39,318
oh that uh yeah they they were breeding

1648
00:57:36,199 --> 00:57:41,798
and dude that they they emerged out of

1649
00:57:39,318 --> 00:57:43,759
you know the subcool era where like sub

1650
00:57:41,798 --> 00:57:46,159
was they were releasing some bomb [ __ ]

1651
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:48,960
they were releasing some W you know

1652
00:57:46,159 --> 00:57:51,038
Cherry Cola type [ __ ] stuff and there

1653
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:53,199
I remember one back pushing the

1654
00:57:51,039 --> 00:57:54,440
boundaries on Flavor what you could get

1655
00:57:53,199 --> 00:57:56,159
and you know it's like CU we go through

1656
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:58,200
these eras there was Tangi was popular

1657
00:57:56,159 --> 00:58:00,960
for a while that was the number one

1658
00:57:58,199 --> 00:58:03,159
Tangi for like this weird pH and the

1659
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:04,960
judges yeah Blue Dream had its day I

1660
00:58:03,159 --> 00:58:07,000
think blue dream when it was popular was

1661
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:08,199
super popular and people people loved

1662
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,119
growing it and then it looked so

1663
00:58:08,199 --> 00:58:11,078
beautiful people loved smoking it and it

1664
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:13,280
just it's one of those ones that got

1665
00:58:11,079 --> 00:58:15,599
burned out the Clones got blown out

1666
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:18,400
everywhere Lally everywh everyone wanted

1667
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:19,798
to grow it it was easy to grow even if

1668
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,599
you're a bad grower you could get two

1669
00:58:19,798 --> 00:58:23,159
pounds a light what other strangs did

1670
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:26,359
subcool and them put out other than the

1671
00:58:23,159 --> 00:58:27,798
cola one do you remember some like that

1672
00:58:26,358 --> 00:58:29,880
was really

1673
00:58:27,798 --> 00:58:34,280
orangey you know there was the Doctor

1674
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:36,079
Who that that raided U homeo natural

1675
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:38,280
wonders I don't remember but that was a

1676
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:40,359
good one the Doctor Who and then he made

1677
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:42,519
a purple high-u and it was like a feno

1678
00:58:40,358 --> 00:58:45,159
that was like it tasted like grape highw

1679
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:46,400
candy fire and my buddies in Washington

1680
00:58:45,159 --> 00:58:47,798
actually had the cut and they grew it

1681
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,920
out and gave me some of the flour and

1682
00:58:47,798 --> 00:58:51,358
it's like it's so funny when you don't

1683
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:53,280
smoke something for 10 years or

1684
00:58:51,358 --> 00:58:54,719
something like that eight years and then

1685
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,920
you go back and you smoke it again and

1686
00:58:54,719 --> 00:58:59,078
it's just reminiscent it

1687
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:02,079
brings you right back that real and you

1688
00:58:59,079 --> 00:59:04,318
know that it's the like you identify

1689
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:06,119
that as exactly what you smoked that

1690
00:59:04,318 --> 00:59:08,798
profile and it's like some of those

1691
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:10,240
things are just so nostalgic skunks like

1692
00:59:08,798 --> 00:59:12,920
back in the day I still haven't seen

1693
00:59:10,239 --> 00:59:14,558
skunk I think uh I'm trying to get

1694
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:16,720
somebody with the skunk that claims that

1695
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:17,640
they have the real skunk on the show and

1696
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:18,919
they're going to bring it and we're

1697
00:59:17,639 --> 00:59:20,879
going to smoke it and I'm going to tell

1698
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:22,440
everybody how it's either the real skunk

1699
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,358
or it's not the real skunk I mean I'm

1700
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:27,880
super excited about that so the thing is

1701
00:59:24,358 --> 00:59:29,318
is with these genetics and these claims

1702
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:32,079
I'm not going to doubt anybody but show

1703
00:59:29,318 --> 00:59:33,920
me the flower show me the proof 100% And

1704
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:35,519
I want cat piss I want the real cat piss

1705
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,960
I know what the cat piss that's another

1706
00:59:35,519 --> 00:59:40,440
one because like cat piss is like a very

1707
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:42,720
distinct Aroma Bubblegum's mine bubble

1708
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:44,960
gum's yours bubble gum was amazing the

1709
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:46,719
real Juicy Fruit the real like flavorful

1710
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:49,079
Juicy Fruit there was a juicy fruit that

1711
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:50,719
was going around and it was Top Shelf it

1712
00:59:49,079 --> 00:59:54,318
tasted like Juicy Fruit bubble gun what

1713
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:57,358
it look like um so it was like bat buds

1714
00:59:54,318 --> 01:00:00,159
lime green bat buds Li Li green but like

1715
00:59:57,358 --> 01:00:02,440
oval oblong buds but they were chunky

1716
01:00:00,159 --> 01:00:05,118
like not like small no this one was like

1717
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:07,280
huge buds like a a half PB ziplock is

1718
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:08,440
what we use in Canada yeah a QP would

1719
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,119
fit in there you couldn't fit a whole

1720
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:12,920
half pound in there they were just so

1721
01:00:10,119 --> 01:00:15,119
big juicy it was so easy to trim they

1722
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:18,039
were just like big fingers of just like

1723
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:19,519
it looked so it was very easy to trim it

1724
01:00:18,039 --> 01:00:21,400
was pretty special I'd saved some seeds

1725
01:00:19,519 --> 01:00:23,119
and pop seeds of it and even the seeds

1726
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:26,079
kind of gave that juicy fruit this a

1727
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:29,798
Vancouver Island thing Vancouver Island

1728
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:32,559
nice back in the late like 98 was the

1729
01:00:29,798 --> 01:00:35,759
probably the early 2000 the last I ever

1730
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:38,400
saw it was 01 yeah that we we lost a lot

1731
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:40,480
of stuff back in the day that was super

1732
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:43,039
special and unique and you know we

1733
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:45,880
didn't we didn't save clones as as long

1734
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:47,920
and sometimes we didn't know I believe

1735
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:49,599
that hop Lon existed back then and we

1736
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:51,559
just didn't know what it was and it was

1737
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:52,960
you and far between but I remember like

1738
01:00:51,559 --> 01:00:54,960
some of the genetics where you'd buy it

1739
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:57,039
in the first like year these guys were

1740
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:58,960
putting it out it would be ridiculous

1741
01:00:57,039 --> 01:01:02,039
and then all of a sudden it went down in

1742
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:03,798
quality I the bubblegum did the same

1743
01:01:02,039 --> 01:01:05,240
thing did the exact same I honestly

1744
01:01:03,798 --> 01:01:06,838
think that it's been around a lot longer

1745
01:01:05,239 --> 01:01:08,159
than we've thought it was and they just

1746
01:01:06,838 --> 01:01:10,679
said it was weak moms is what they

1747
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:12,358
woulded dude we had we we we took weak

1748
01:01:10,679 --> 01:01:14,879
clones or we [ __ ] up when they were

1749
01:01:12,358 --> 01:01:17,279
moms and passed it down and like I

1750
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,798
honestly think coplon could be alive a

1751
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:21,519
lot longer than we had given it credit

1752
01:01:18,798 --> 01:01:23,400
for very Val Mak sense super it

1753
01:01:21,519 --> 01:01:24,559
decimates gross it makes sense to what

1754
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:26,920
happened in that strain and probably

1755
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:28,720
many others that were just diesel right

1756
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:31,559
yeah so many others right and so many

1757
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:32,639
others where it's like they dut out and

1758
01:01:31,559 --> 01:01:34,760
we didn't I didn't even understand

1759
01:01:32,639 --> 01:01:37,038
dutting diseases back then we just we

1760
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:38,599
weren't that scientific and now you can

1761
01:01:37,039 --> 01:01:41,319
test for it there's so many different

1762
01:01:38,599 --> 01:01:44,119
ways there's some really good labs and

1763
01:01:41,318 --> 01:01:45,599
there's some not so good lab I'm I'm

1764
01:01:44,119 --> 01:01:47,640
really excited to start working with a

1765
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:50,000
lab in Canada called High North and I'm

1766
01:01:47,639 --> 01:01:53,000
also working with a hopefully LP moving

1767
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:56,119
forward and uh there's going to be a lot

1768
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:58,880
of data collecting on like the outdoor

1769
01:01:56,119 --> 01:02:02,798
indoor LED versus HPS and different

1770
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:04,039
mediums super soil versus uh living soil

1771
01:02:02,798 --> 01:02:05,679
and so you're trialing all this stuff

1772
01:02:04,039 --> 01:02:07,960
and collecting data yeah and then the

1773
01:02:05,679 --> 01:02:10,239
hash and then the hash from all this so

1774
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:12,199
that's like what I'm working towards

1775
01:02:10,239 --> 01:02:14,239
hopefully with the group in the next

1776
01:02:12,199 --> 01:02:15,798
like one to three years well you're

1777
01:02:14,239 --> 01:02:16,959
talking to the right group right now I

1778
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:18,159
know that's a part of why we're going to

1779
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:20,119
talk about after it's so funny because

1780
01:02:18,159 --> 01:02:22,798
we use data to track software we're

1781
01:02:20,119 --> 01:02:25,079
using phenome one and that's from

1782
01:02:22,798 --> 01:02:26,599
phenome networks that are Israel and

1783
01:02:25,079 --> 01:02:29,000
basically makes sense this is the

1784
01:02:26,599 --> 01:02:31,039
perfect plug for them too uh but yeah so

1785
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:33,599
we basically use it for our inventory

1786
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:35,720
system where we create genetics right

1787
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:37,400
and then so we inventory stuff we create

1788
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:38,480
crosses with it and then we do variety

1789
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:41,200
testing where you put it out in

1790
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:44,278
different regions and different climates

1791
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:47,759
and we collect several data points we're

1792
01:02:44,278 --> 01:02:51,079
so we're looking at originally like uh

1793
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:53,278
53 and then it was 63 and now it's about

1794
01:02:51,079 --> 01:02:55,079
72 different data points that we'd like

1795
01:02:53,278 --> 01:02:57,880
to collect for each plant how often do

1796
01:02:55,079 --> 01:02:59,318
you collect those data points so and is

1797
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:00,519
it certain ones at different times

1798
01:02:59,318 --> 01:03:02,519
there's yeah in the beginning there's

1799
01:03:00,519 --> 01:03:04,400
one that basically you measure growth

1800
01:03:02,519 --> 01:03:05,719
and like we're actually getting tape

1801
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:08,920
measure out there doing it like you

1802
01:03:05,719 --> 01:03:11,038
would in a yeah um but measuring growth

1803
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:15,079
uh and then weighing the plants whole

1804
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:17,000
weighing the plants dry and wet and so

1805
01:03:15,079 --> 01:03:19,599
being able to give that information also

1806
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:21,519
weighing the main Cola what that yields

1807
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:24,519
I think that's a super important piece

1808
01:03:21,519 --> 01:03:26,400
of information and we're also doing this

1809
01:03:24,519 --> 01:03:28,559
in indoor and two environments with the

1810
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:31,160
same genetics uh that are commercial

1811
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:32,839
environments so we can compare you know

1812
01:03:31,159 --> 01:03:34,838
everything with coas at the end as well

1813
01:03:32,838 --> 01:03:38,480
so we put get coas we can go okay this

1814
01:03:34,838 --> 01:03:41,278
genetic works best here here and here or

1815
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:42,480
it only works best here and other things

1816
01:03:41,278 --> 01:03:43,920
are better so you can really start

1817
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:46,599
identifying your lines is kind of what

1818
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,838
we're really looking at I got hunts

1819
01:03:46,599 --> 01:03:49,960
going on all over the world right now I

1820
01:03:47,838 --> 01:03:51,239
probably I don't know if this would

1821
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:52,358
apply with what I got going on but I'm

1822
01:03:51,239 --> 01:03:54,118
going to definitely ask you some more

1823
01:03:52,358 --> 01:03:56,278
questions after the podcast because yeah

1824
01:03:54,119 --> 01:03:59,400
I got probably like had two different

1825
01:03:56,278 --> 01:04:01,679
spots in Thailand that are hunting um

1826
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:03,920
and then some spots in Spain and some

1827
01:04:01,679 --> 01:04:05,519
spots all over the world right now so

1828
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:07,159
and then a few in BC is obviously as

1829
01:04:05,519 --> 01:04:09,318
well so and like some are greenhouse

1830
01:04:07,159 --> 01:04:10,759
some are outdoor some are indoor LED

1831
01:04:09,318 --> 01:04:12,920
some are HPS so it's kind of all over

1832
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:15,839
the map some are rock wol some are most

1833
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:18,000
Are soil and living soil right um but

1834
01:04:15,838 --> 01:04:19,759
yeah I'm I want to to have some sort of

1835
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,880
data tool to pull them all into one

1836
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:23,000
thing would be good right now I use a

1837
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:25,240
thing called one note I mostly use that

1838
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,960
with my washing though I'm not using

1839
01:04:25,239 --> 01:04:29,719
much as much data collecting as I should

1840
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:31,519
be after reading your book yeah um on

1841
01:04:29,719 --> 01:04:32,719
the just all the different fenos and

1842
01:04:31,519 --> 01:04:34,679
just all the different data points I'm

1843
01:04:32,719 --> 01:04:37,679
not doing nearly enough I'm mostly

1844
01:04:34,679 --> 01:04:38,838
hunting on profiles personally um

1845
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:41,000
because that's what I've hunted in the

1846
01:04:38,838 --> 01:04:42,679
past um but moving forward is I start

1847
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,318
crossing the profiles I like with other

1848
01:04:42,679 --> 01:04:47,278
profiles I like I'm going to definitely

1849
01:04:44,318 --> 01:04:49,519
want to get more into

1850
01:04:47,278 --> 01:04:50,838
theu takes years to get to there though

1851
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:52,679
right well yeah the first year you don't

1852
01:04:50,838 --> 01:04:54,400
get a ton I mean you get good stuff but

1853
01:04:52,679 --> 01:04:56,278
it's really that like the second year

1854
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:58,960
the third year it it count pounds over

1855
01:04:56,278 --> 01:05:01,079
time right and what you get into it or

1856
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:03,480
what you put into it you get out of it

1857
01:05:01,079 --> 01:05:05,519
makes sense and uh so the more data you

1858
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:08,240
have and the more like dude you start re

1859
01:05:05,519 --> 01:05:09,960
seeing Trends and you really see what is

1860
01:05:08,239 --> 01:05:11,479
dominant as far as traits once you're

1861
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:12,838
using the same thing over and over

1862
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:14,599
through multiple lines and you pick your

1863
01:05:12,838 --> 01:05:17,119
matches better moving forward you waste

1864
01:05:14,599 --> 01:05:19,039
less time it you're wasting less time

1865
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:21,720
right and I think the potential for this

1866
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:24,278
software is that they have uh AI

1867
01:05:21,719 --> 01:05:26,318
algorithms that they can do uh like

1868
01:05:24,278 --> 01:05:28,079
predict type stuff predict predictive

1869
01:05:26,318 --> 01:05:29,318
modeling right so like you can do

1870
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:31,400
predictive modeling if you have a

1871
01:05:29,318 --> 01:05:33,038
starting point and a finish where you

1872
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:34,278
where you want to see the plant go or

1873
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:35,799
where you you know what kind of traits

1874
01:05:34,278 --> 01:05:37,960
you're looking for breeding for specific

1875
01:05:35,798 --> 01:05:42,000
traits they can do predictive modeling

1876
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:43,440
now wow crazy my mind is blowing dude

1877
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,318
it's it's so amazing because really

1878
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:48,720
breeding for specific goals for you know

1879
01:05:46,318 --> 01:05:50,119
regions and climates right once you find

1880
01:05:48,719 --> 01:05:51,879
your traits that you want like your

1881
01:05:50,119 --> 01:05:53,079
profiles and then you go to the trades

1882
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:54,760
once yeah once you look at where you

1883
01:05:53,079 --> 01:05:56,079
want the plant to go and then testing

1884
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:57,400
stuff in those regions and then being

1885
01:05:56,079 --> 01:05:59,318
able to push the plant in those

1886
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:03,760
directions I have a question for you um

1887
01:05:59,318 --> 01:06:07,318
as a hash maker um washability and like

1888
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:09,400
How likely is when you cross things that

1889
01:06:07,318 --> 01:06:10,838
do wash with things that don't wash yeah

1890
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:12,960
what How likely do those traits pass

1891
01:06:10,838 --> 01:06:14,480
over and and unlikely what's your

1892
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:16,358
thoughts I'm working on that right now

1893
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:18,199
to be honest uh we have a bunch of

1894
01:06:16,358 --> 01:06:20,960
washers that we're going to be testing

1895
01:06:18,199 --> 01:06:23,519
and then Crossing them to genetics to

1896
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:24,599
find new varieties but so we have 10

1897
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:26,239
tents right you're in the process of

1898
01:06:24,599 --> 01:06:27,880
figuring that out right now dude that's

1899
01:06:26,239 --> 01:06:29,358
absolutely one of the things that we're

1900
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:32,838
trying to figure out I'm working with

1901
01:06:29,358 --> 01:06:34,679
Jason huto from House of cvar and we're

1902
01:06:32,838 --> 01:06:36,119
doing this really freaking cool washer

1903
01:06:34,679 --> 01:06:39,199
project that we're going to be testing

1904
01:06:36,119 --> 01:06:41,400
this stuff and also breeding Autos that

1905
01:06:39,199 --> 01:06:44,679
wash that's a big part of what we're

1906
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:46,639
doing Mak sense yeah I think the time is

1907
01:06:44,679 --> 01:06:47,879
now for that all that stuff especially

1908
01:06:46,639 --> 01:06:49,639
here in the west coast where we got a

1909
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:53,278
limited especially up north where we

1910
01:06:49,639 --> 01:06:55,879
have limited uh summer yeah yeah I mean

1911
01:06:53,278 --> 01:06:57,519
great climates over here and then is

1912
01:06:55,880 --> 01:07:00,680
definitely on everyone's

1913
01:06:57,519 --> 01:07:02,440
radar uh yeah it's a big thing it is it

1914
01:07:00,679 --> 01:07:04,719
is the waves coming and with devices

1915
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:06,599
like the puffco it's only going to help

1916
01:07:04,719 --> 01:07:08,038
break the stigma moving forward and that

1917
01:07:06,599 --> 01:07:10,359
was Franco's main thing and that's what

1918
01:07:08,039 --> 01:07:12,400
we're all here to help do is push

1919
01:07:10,358 --> 01:07:14,920
Franco's uh agenda moving forward was

1920
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:17,119
help break the stigma yeah and uh it's

1921
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:19,039
helpful for all of us and especially for

1922
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:21,960
the people that uh want to get into it

1923
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:23,480
you know right that's uh how a lot of

1924
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:25,760
people don't want to smoke because

1925
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:28,440
they're afraid of the way they'll be the

1926
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:30,720
light they'll be cast under and uh

1927
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:32,519
torches weren't good for that exactly

1928
01:07:30,719 --> 01:07:35,000
exactly so as we break the stigma

1929
01:07:32,519 --> 01:07:36,559
there'll be less of this right yeah I

1930
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,400
mean all these new ways to smoke is

1931
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:41,119
great consuming is great you know the

1932
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:43,079
the Rosen carts now right I think the

1933
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:44,358
Rosen carts are amazing I think abely

1934
01:07:43,079 --> 01:07:46,240
absolutely when you're getting the

1935
01:07:44,358 --> 01:07:48,199
flavor and the pull and you know I don't

1936
01:07:46,239 --> 01:07:50,358
like the two gam cards it's got to be

1937
01:07:48,199 --> 01:07:51,879
like I would I would mind I wouldn't

1938
01:07:50,358 --> 01:07:54,239
mind if they had half gram cards

1939
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:56,440
actually they do for sure in Canada they

1940
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:58,639
do for they probably do here yeah yeah I

1941
01:07:56,440 --> 01:08:00,200
mean my friends always give me cards you

1942
01:07:58,639 --> 01:08:01,838
that's because like there's they last

1943
01:08:00,199 --> 01:08:04,000
too long because no because the flavor

1944
01:08:01,838 --> 01:08:05,798
isn't good after the first half gram or

1945
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,159
gotta gotcha so especially it heats up

1946
01:08:05,798 --> 01:08:10,679
over and over oxidization yeah and like

1947
01:08:08,159 --> 01:08:12,920
dude like I heard about five gr pens now

1948
01:08:10,679 --> 01:08:15,000
it's like why rosin Vape already has to

1949
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:16,279
be heated unlike dla dla doesn't have to

1950
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,479
be heated it's already gone through its

1951
01:08:16,279 --> 01:08:20,600
process but but rosin has to be heated

1952
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:23,599
to get into that viscous state in most

1953
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:24,920
cultiv cases right so that's probably

1954
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,440
also contributing factor as to why the

1955
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:28,000
shelf life wouldn't be as long as

1956
01:08:26,439 --> 01:08:31,439
because sure the product's got to be

1957
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:33,279
kind of heated up to even be in a vape

1958
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:35,318
yeah white Thorn Rose is a new one I had

1959
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:37,480
in a rosin cart not too long ago and

1960
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:39,798
it's purple XJ comes out it's purple

1961
01:08:37,479 --> 01:08:41,798
rosin okay yeah but it's like flower

1962
01:08:39,798 --> 01:08:43,719
petals in silon right in the in the

1963
01:08:41,798 --> 01:08:45,158
triome head I just saw a picture today

1964
01:08:43,719 --> 01:08:48,239
at this place I was at and they showed

1965
01:08:45,158 --> 01:08:51,679
that trop cookies is usually the The

1966
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:54,959
Strain the cultivar that uh is the cause

1967
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:56,279
of the nylin in the triome head for sure

1968
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:59,198
I don't know if you what's your opinion

1969
01:08:56,279 --> 01:09:00,640
on that Cho Cherry uh so I got super

1970
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:03,358
sick of it because it's like a harsh

1971
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:04,640
Citrus flavor but that's the same type

1972
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:06,079
of thing that gets people's attention

1973
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:07,759
like if you look back to Mimosa which

1974
01:09:06,079 --> 01:09:10,719
was a super popular one for time for

1975
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:13,039
sure um it was a popular one that we had

1976
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:14,920
it's got that same sort of uh flare to

1977
01:09:13,039 --> 01:09:16,719
it um for me like I said I was I was

1978
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:19,640
done with chop cookies but like it just

1979
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:22,759
W ego as it's blended with the Z and

1980
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:24,798
also like the trop cookies offensiveness

1981
01:09:22,759 --> 01:09:25,960
is kind of dumbed down a little bit and

1982
01:09:24,798 --> 01:09:27,519
then the Z

1983
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:29,319
it comes up and so they kind of balance

1984
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:31,440
out a little bit so it gives you that

1985
01:09:29,319 --> 01:09:35,359
like wow factor but without like the

1986
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:36,519
super harshness so um I like it for sure

1987
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:37,838
and that's the super boof I'm talking

1988
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:39,880
about the one that Tricom tortoise has

1989
01:09:37,838 --> 01:09:41,679
been winning Super boo yeah yeah that's

1990
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:43,079
a weird one for me for me too like At

1991
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:44,960
first I was like well chop cookies but

1992
01:09:43,079 --> 01:09:46,519
then as I got into I was like okay I see

1993
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:48,560
why it's getting people attention I see

1994
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:51,080
why it's winning and the purple adds

1995
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:52,798
another visual aspect of it that like

1996
01:09:51,079 --> 01:09:55,000
just gives it another Mark you know

1997
01:09:52,798 --> 01:09:57,439
people want to buy purple stuff that

1998
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:59,760
super is the super yielder too I don't

1999
01:09:57,439 --> 01:10:02,399
know next level as far as yield yeah

2000
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:05,440
like four pounds per oh wow on the

2001
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:08,039
flower side on a 4x4 yeah hell yeah nice

2002
01:10:05,439 --> 01:10:09,238
four per light yeah I mean I think could

2003
01:10:08,039 --> 01:10:10,800
throw some favin in there you probably

2004
01:10:09,238 --> 01:10:12,399
get five there you go is that the under

2005
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:13,760
lighting the under canopy lighting yeah

2006
01:10:12,399 --> 01:10:16,119
are are you doing that I'm all about

2007
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:17,360
under canopy I've seen my friends crush

2008
01:10:16,119 --> 01:10:19,760
it with the under canopy what's the

2009
01:10:17,359 --> 01:10:23,238
percentages you're seen 25% that's like

2010
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:24,440
the average uh even like 15% one of my

2011
01:10:23,238 --> 01:10:27,039
friends but like yeah I mean I heard

2012
01:10:24,439 --> 01:10:28,639
about 50% I think in green houses is

2013
01:10:27,039 --> 01:10:30,679
where it's going to be like really a

2014
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:31,840
game changer there won't because dude

2015
01:10:30,679 --> 01:10:33,199
there's so many Smalls you get rid of

2016
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:34,760
your Smalls in the greenhouse now we're

2017
01:10:33,198 --> 01:10:36,678
talking about better Urban if you have

2018
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:37,960
good color as well but I'm trying to

2019
01:10:36,679 --> 01:10:40,600
understand why the greenh houses does is

2020
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:42,079
that it's because like ppfd and that's

2021
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:43,480
because the sun's moving like this so

2022
01:10:42,079 --> 01:10:45,600
it's not getting consistent light all

2023
01:10:43,479 --> 01:10:47,439
the time where a breakthrough glass or

2024
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:49,280
plastic or whatever too so like that

2025
01:10:47,439 --> 01:10:52,198
you're not getting the full ppfd of the

2026
01:10:49,279 --> 01:10:53,639
sun makes sense okay right and then uh I

2027
01:10:52,198 --> 01:10:56,158
think because the sun is should better

2028
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:58,079
but well you do get sun plus the under

2029
01:10:56,158 --> 01:10:59,559
canopy right okay now you're bumping

2030
01:10:58,079 --> 01:11:00,920
your probably your supplementary

2031
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:02,719
Lighting in there will also have a big

2032
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:04,960
factor to how much the percentage gain

2033
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:07,760
is I bet right right

2034
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:09,520
absolutely so I think uh yeah and

2035
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:10,920
they're they're inexpensive the underc

2036
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:11,840
lights are inexpensive I'm going to get

2037
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:14,199
them for

2038
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:16,880
sure from what I've seen from the data

2039
01:11:14,198 --> 01:11:18,639
like I know Guin I know a guy yeah there

2040
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:19,760
you go it's not going to be well I guess

2041
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:21,360
it will be good because a lot of times

2042
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:22,360
we wash the Smalls and now the smalls

2043
01:11:21,359 --> 01:11:23,519
are going to be too good you're not

2044
01:11:22,359 --> 01:11:25,839
going to want to wash them so I don't

2045
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:27,440
know so the thing is is like I haven't

2046
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:30,039
proven this myself but Smalls going down

2047
01:11:27,439 --> 01:11:31,198
to 5% or less yeah I mean that's great

2048
01:11:30,039 --> 01:11:33,000
cuz you just put them at the base of the

2049
01:11:31,198 --> 01:11:34,559
plant right so like you don't have to

2050
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:37,158
thin your canopy out all that stuff

2051
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:39,159
grows out in a nice chunky purple buds

2052
01:11:37,158 --> 01:11:40,719
if it's purple wheat normally it's green

2053
01:11:39,158 --> 01:11:43,079
with that stuff it gets the the light

2054
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:44,520
spectrum is really good for flower

2055
01:11:43,079 --> 01:11:46,479
purple yeah they have the red in there

2056
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:48,480
yeah my LEDs do that it's all about that

2057
01:11:46,479 --> 01:11:51,119
red yeah what's the LED company that you

2058
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:53,119
choose uh we're using science right now

2059
01:11:51,119 --> 01:11:54,679
we we have the Dragon alpha adjustable

2060
01:11:53,119 --> 01:11:56,880
spectrums nice I think they're really

2061
01:11:54,679 --> 01:12:00,239
cool they're easy easy to work with the

2062
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:02,480
the app that you use is simple great uh

2063
01:12:00,238 --> 01:12:04,119
yeah what about yourself I I had a k

2064
01:12:02,479 --> 01:12:05,759
company called Alias they've treated us

2065
01:12:04,119 --> 01:12:07,679
very well pretty sure they're just using

2066
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:08,880
the Samsung dials like everybody else

2067
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:11,279
yeah but they're good people and they've

2068
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:13,880
treated us very well good guys got to

2069
01:12:11,279 --> 01:12:15,279
love that Samsung yeah exactly it's

2070
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:17,119
pretty much across the board most of the

2071
01:12:15,279 --> 01:12:21,359
LEDs that are good have the Samsung

2082
01:12:43,079 --> 01:12:48,479

invited to the Caribbean cup uh there

2085
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:54,639
there's two cups over there that are

2086
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,600
happening and I'm super excited about

2087
01:12:54,639 --> 01:12:58,400
both of them Caribbean's a great place

2088
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:59,719
to go hell yeah of course of course you

2089
01:12:58,399 --> 01:13:01,960
can't go wrong in the Caribbean it's

2090
01:12:59,719 --> 01:13:04,000
just people are happy there too it's

2091
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:06,158
like so happy yeah I I haven't been in a

2092
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,439
while so to go there part of the reason

2093
01:13:06,158 --> 01:13:08,839
I don't go to the Caribbean is because

2094
01:13:07,439 --> 01:13:11,158
usually they're not very weed friendly

2095
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:12,840
places other than Jamaica but I've been

2096
01:13:11,158 --> 01:13:14,238
to Jamaica so many times I need to like

2097
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:16,039
go to other places Jamaica's great

2098
01:13:14,238 --> 01:13:17,718
though it's good lot of Americans down

2099
01:13:16,039 --> 01:13:20,359
but with Thailand the way legalization

2100
01:13:17,719 --> 01:13:23,679
is bro like it's it's unreal the food

2101
01:13:20,359 --> 01:13:25,920
there is so good it's cheap it and

2102
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:28,000
there's beaches and it's like yeah and

2103
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:29,520
and the weed's getting better so at

2104
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,279
first it was like a lot of import and

2105
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:33,320
super expensive but now there's some

2106
01:13:31,279 --> 01:13:35,759
good local grows and if you can in and

2107
01:13:33,319 --> 01:13:37,840
you can there's a rosin scene now and

2108
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:39,719
it's all it's all there now um

2109
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:41,719
Thailand's definitely high on my list as

2110
01:13:39,719 --> 01:13:43,520
far as places I want to be spending time

2111
01:13:41,719 --> 01:13:45,880
unless they like hardcore change the

2112
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:49,520
laws there's nowhere else in the world

2113
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:51,520
where someone like myself can be still

2114
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:53,360
be yourself well yeah because like I

2115
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:55,480
brokered for time and like you know

2116
01:13:53,359 --> 01:13:57,439
obviously like I could do that Canada

2117
01:13:55,479 --> 01:13:59,399
but I have to do it on like the lp side

2118
01:13:57,439 --> 01:14:00,879
of things and it's and that means I got

2119
01:13:59,399 --> 01:14:02,559
to work with all these suits that I just

2120
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:04,679
like they're just like so hard to work

2121
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:06,320
with they're just lying every step of

2122
01:14:04,679 --> 01:14:08,359
the way like there's no transparency in

2123
01:14:06,319 --> 01:14:09,799
what they're talking about at all right

2124
01:14:08,359 --> 01:14:11,238
so I like when someone tells me

2125
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:13,279
something them actually being what they

2126
01:14:11,238 --> 01:14:15,799
say not some other smoking mirror stuff

2127
01:14:13,279 --> 01:14:17,960
so yeah um I guess it's possible at

2128
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:19,719
every level but uh just with the amount

2129
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:21,920
of shops and the amount of grows and the

2130
01:14:19,719 --> 01:14:23,439
amount of like just everything that's

2131
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:24,880
going on Thailand there's just for

2132
01:14:23,439 --> 01:14:26,559
someone there's just more opportunity

2133
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:27,840
there there really is and I don't I

2134
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:29,600
don't see anywhere else in the world

2135
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:31,800
there's that much opportunity unless

2136
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:32,960
they change the laws yeah just with the

2137
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:34,760
amount of people the amount of tourists

2138
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:37,359
that come through there right and if you

2139
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:40,079
draw I think it's like a 200 mile uh

2140
01:14:37,359 --> 01:14:42,880
radius around Thailand has more

2141
01:14:40,079 --> 01:14:46,000
population from a 2hour flight than

2142
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:47,159
anywhere else in the world wow and so

2143
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,840
that's why they have so many tourists

2144
01:14:47,158 --> 01:14:50,879
there it's like it's like easy to fly to

2145
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:54,199
from all these different countries from

2146
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:56,000
Japan from wherever even Russia and and

2147
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:57,719
then India too nice let's not forget

2148
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,399
about India it's pretty big population

2149
01:14:57,719 --> 01:15:02,679
there huge yeah so I got a bunch of land

2150
01:15:00,399 --> 01:15:04,119
race seeds just recently from Fritz you

2151
01:15:02,679 --> 01:15:05,440
met Fritz probably I think I did it

2152
01:15:04,119 --> 01:15:07,719
sounds really familiar he is the strain

2153
01:15:05,439 --> 01:15:09,359
Hunter man he's a he's yeah he goes

2154
01:15:07,719 --> 01:15:11,600
around and collecting he collects seeds

2155
01:15:09,359 --> 01:15:13,279
from everywhere okay and does his thing

2156
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:15,199
and so we're working on some projects

2157
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:17,279
together where are they from Thailand or

2158
01:15:15,198 --> 01:15:20,079
uh they are from Southeast Asia okay

2159
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:22,719
they are from like La India from the

2160
01:15:20,079 --> 01:15:24,600
Kush mountains okay he has like some

2161
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:27,239
yeah some like Charis when you going to

2162
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:28,719
start them we popping them as we speak

2163
01:15:27,238 --> 01:15:30,039
and did you have to do anything crazy to

2164
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:31,198
pop them did you have to like add that

2165
01:15:30,039 --> 01:15:33,840
other what was that solution I was

2166
01:15:31,198 --> 01:15:35,238
learning yeah you didn't have to use ga3

2167
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:37,639
for that these ones are these aren't

2168
01:15:35,238 --> 01:15:39,479
these are good okay uh but yeah embryo

2169
01:15:37,639 --> 01:15:41,239
rescue you can do the embryo rescue

2170
01:15:39,479 --> 01:15:43,559
that's the reading on that book if yours

2171

thanks for the support man appreciate it

2173
01:15:45,238 --> 01:15:50,158
dude yeah the book's been an adventure

2174
01:15:47,639 --> 01:15:52,560
uh we just went live on Amazon yesterday

2175
01:15:50,158 --> 01:15:55,238
oh there's a ton to learn in there for

2176
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:56,639
every level of everything in the indust

2177
01:15:55,238 --> 01:15:58,198
there's a lot to learn in that book we

2178
01:15:56,639 --> 01:15:59,760
tried to make it something for everybody

2179
01:15:58,198 --> 01:16:02,039
and I feel like it's in depth enough to

2180
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:04,440
where everybody can benefit in some way

2181
01:16:02,039 --> 01:16:05,920
and it's a collective effort makes sense

2182
01:16:04,439 --> 01:16:07,719
you know so it wasn't just me it was a

2183
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:09,119
bunch of other people as well I like the

2184
01:16:07,719 --> 01:16:11,239
case studies too the case studies are

2185
01:16:09,119 --> 01:16:12,559
super cool yeah I try to keep it real

2186
01:16:11,238 --> 01:16:14,158
with the case studies you know what I

2187
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:16,120
mean and get the real story from the

2188
01:16:14,158 --> 01:16:17,719
real people and I I wrote things it's

2189
01:16:16,119 --> 01:16:19,800
funny because with the case studies some

2190
01:16:17,719 --> 01:16:21,279
of them I wrote a certain way and then I

2191
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:23,119
sent them to the people and they were

2192
01:16:21,279 --> 01:16:26,000
like no that's not what happened and I'm

2193
01:16:23,119 --> 01:16:27,679
like good to know like okay so this is

2194
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:31,198
what I had heard and this is what the

2195
01:16:27,679 --> 01:16:33,119
truth is and so so when you wrote it you

2196
01:16:31,198 --> 01:16:35,559
did their version rendition all the each

2197
01:16:33,119 --> 01:16:37,198
one well from The Source I got as close

2198
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:39,719
to the source as I could I mean this

2199
01:16:37,198 --> 01:16:42,158
Sour Diesel we talk about Sour Diesel

2200
01:16:39,719 --> 01:16:43,840
yes there's a lot of like the piff like

2201
01:16:42,158 --> 01:16:45,839
for sure I was and then the people when

2202
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:48,920
they talk about it like you they are so

2203
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:50,719
certain like there's no there's no area

2204
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:52,600
of uncertainty when they tell the story

2205
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:55,158
so how do you yeah and I got a version

2206
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:56,800
maybe someone's got a different version

2207
01:16:55,158 --> 01:16:59,638
his close to source and

2208
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:02,360
verified um because even with stories

2209
01:16:59,639 --> 01:17:04,400
over times stories tend to change I had

2210
01:17:02,359 --> 01:17:06,920
a good P story from a from a real New

2211
01:17:04,399 --> 01:17:08,279
Yorker a new New Yorker when I was in uh

2212
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:11,158
yeah when I was in New York it was

2213
01:17:08,279 --> 01:17:12,960
really I really like the piff like cough

2214
01:17:11,158 --> 01:17:15,839
too the piff that I saw was like these

2215
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:18,279
little pinky little like like almost

2216
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:21,159
like turd looking Kix just Kix that are

2217
01:17:18,279 --> 01:17:23,238
like exactly and and it was just it was

2218
01:17:21,158 --> 01:17:25,879
hazy for sure it was just a haze like a

2219
01:17:23,238 --> 01:17:27,879
typical Haze nothing nothing too

2220
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:30,159
so the P that I've had is like a haze

2221
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:32,520
but it's more mellow of a turp and not

2222
01:17:30,158 --> 01:17:33,960
more of it doesn't burn your nose sharp

2223
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:36,120
it was like that it was just like that

2224
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:37,679
it was it was was more mellow Haze no

2225
01:17:36,119 --> 01:17:40,198
didn't it wasn't like Congo or like one

2226
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:42,199
of no no no it was it was the high is

2227
01:17:40,198 --> 01:17:43,759
more chill for it too the CU V was

2228
01:17:42,198 --> 01:17:45,399
Stronger but I like the piff I actually

2229
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:46,639
like the flavor on the piff it's another

2230
01:17:45,399 --> 01:17:48,439
one you can smoke it down to the roach

2231
01:17:46,639 --> 01:17:51,400
if it's really good and it's got

2232
01:17:48,439 --> 01:17:54,000
that nice it's it it definitely is

2233
01:17:51,399 --> 01:17:56,359
uplifting and I feel like the high is

2234
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,000
really clean for me I feel like uh it

2235
01:17:56,359 --> 01:18:00,158
opens my eyes up it doesn't [ __ ]

2236
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,840
tighten my eyes down I feel like I could

2237
01:18:00,158 --> 01:18:03,079
see that like a nice daytime buzz and I

2238
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:05,079
can see that's why New Yorkers like it

2239
01:18:03,079 --> 01:18:07,000
too they they got to kind of be alert in

2240
01:18:05,079 --> 01:18:08,439
New York you can't just be coach lock

2241

vengeance after you know yeah it's

2256
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:40,560
pretty cool to see yeah it's nice to see

2257
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:42,760
people reinvent themselves and and crush

2258
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:45,080
it so it's really cool for sure man

2259
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:47,000
there's there's a bunch of fighters in

2260
01:18:45,079 --> 01:18:48,559
this industry you know who aren't going

2261
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,679
down no matter what and it's like that's

2262
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:52,920
the best thing and sometimes it's just

2263
01:18:50,679 --> 01:18:55,399
putting one foot in front of the other

2264
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:56,800
you know instead of giving up hope no a

2265
01:18:55,399 --> 01:18:58,599
lot of I mean there's times where it's

2266
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:59,639
easy to Sprint and it's easy to run

2267
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:01,079
there's other times where you're walking

2268
01:18:59,639 --> 01:19:03,239
up the mountain and it seems like the

2269
01:19:01,079 --> 01:19:04,519
mountain is so far away the top of the

2270
01:19:03,238 --> 01:19:05,879
mountain and you just got to put one

2271
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:08,520
foot in front of the other until you get

2272
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:09,800
over the [ __ ] hump and I think life

2273
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:11,679
is all about that you know what I mean

2274
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:14,360
and just getting up and showing up for

2275
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:16,560
yourself tomorrow is a new day uhhuh and

2276
01:19:14,359 --> 01:19:18,759
if it's not a good one today well no try

2277
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:20,920
to see sometimes you just got to show up

2278
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:22,840
for yourself absolutely that's number

2279
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:26,480
one it's number one self-care is is

2280
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:29,000
everything and uh on uh on a spiritual

2281
01:19:26,479 --> 01:19:31,479
level and on on a physical level I think

2282
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:33,439
and it's really difficult in this day

2283
01:19:31,479 --> 01:19:35,479
and age with the distractions we have on

2284
01:19:33,439 --> 01:19:36,919
our social media oh yeah even be any

2285
01:19:35,479 --> 01:19:39,399
sort of in touch with your spiritual

2286
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:40,840
level whatsoever getting outside there's

2287
01:19:39,399 --> 01:19:43,000
all kinds of important [ __ ] like I think

2288
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:45,679
it's just obvious for me but it's like

2289
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:47,520
going outside you know I've been so busy

2290
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:49,319
I had a hard time mowing the lawn like

2291
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:51,560
because I've been so busy fin I just

2292
01:19:49,319 --> 01:19:53,559
went home at 6:30 and went out and M my

2293
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:55,480
lawn it and it felt so good after it

2294
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:58,520
felt really good after like it's funny

2295
01:19:55,479 --> 01:20:01,119
cuz uh super blessed to not have a lawn

2296
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:02,960
but also to live in super nature area

2297
01:20:01,119 --> 01:20:05,238
nice I I'm just joking cuz I don't have

2298
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:06,719
to mow it but I wouldn't mind a lawn but

2299
01:20:05,238 --> 01:20:09,158
kind of the where we live is not really

2300
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:11,439
like lawn territory I guess it could but

2301
01:20:09,158 --> 01:20:14,519
it's more like Rocky and like kind of

2302
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:15,559
like trees and Forest but yeah I'm and I

2303
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:18,000
have the beach across the road and

2304
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:19,440
that's where I go around myself and try

2305
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,520
to take my shoes off and walk on the

2306
01:20:19,439 --> 01:20:23,519
freezing cold sand and toino do you ever

2307
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:26,040
do sungazing have you done sungazing I

2308
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:28,639
do it every morning hly so when I was in

2309
01:20:26,039 --> 01:20:30,960
Thailand every morning I wake up and I

2310
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:33,199
and I watch the sun come up over the

2311
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:34,639
horizon cold plunging yeah I do that too

2312
01:20:33,198 --> 01:20:36,599
for sure yeah that's what's up I don't

2313
01:20:34,639 --> 01:20:39,079
do it enough cuz like when I'm traveling

2314
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:41,880
and like to have it and and honestly

2315
01:20:39,079 --> 01:20:43,920
when I'm at home I I have one but I I I

2316
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:45,920
wimp out a lot so I do like a lot of

2317
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:47,319
cold showers and it's kind of like a

2318
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:49,039
process of like it's so much easier than

2319
01:20:47,319 --> 01:20:51,519
a cold shower for me I don't like cold

2320
01:20:49,039 --> 01:20:53,119
showers there's a part I know you mean I

2321
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:54,679
like the dip boom getting it over like a

2322
01:20:53,119 --> 01:20:55,760
bandaid I'm in and then I'm numb right

2323
01:20:54,679 --> 01:20:58,279
right and then you think about it for

2324
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:59,560
about 30 seconds and just breathe you're

2325
01:20:58,279 --> 01:21:01,000
just breathing through it and then you

2326
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:02,159
get numb and you don't what's your time

2327
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,198
that you like to do a cold punch six

2328
01:21:02,158 --> 01:21:06,079
minutes six minutes I'm about five so

2329
01:21:04,198 --> 01:21:08,158
yeah and well so I don't do as cold as I

2330
01:21:06,079 --> 01:21:11,600
used to I used to do 37 degrees and now

2331
01:21:08,158 --> 01:21:14,079
I do like 50 okay okay 50 is just fine I

2332
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:15,880
could go I could do 37 but I feel like

2333
01:21:14,079 --> 01:21:17,079
50 is good and I get out of there and I

2334
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:19,800
feel super

2335
01:21:17,079 --> 01:21:22,000
refreshed um and I don't take forever to

2336
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:24,199
warm if I go 37 de for 5 minutes it

2337
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,600
takes me a lot longer to warm up and

2338
01:21:24,198 --> 01:21:29,519
it's not that big of a deal but I feel

2339
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:32,639
like I I get the real benefit at 50°

2340
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:34,840
like 50 Dees for 6 minutes I feel

2341
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:37,079
amazing and I get that dopamine kick for

2342
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:38,880
all day love it I love it do you do do

2343
01:21:37,079 --> 01:21:40,639
you in conjunction with sauna as well or

2344
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:42,199
do you do separate I do I've been doing

2345
01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:45,319
the sauna as much lately but yeah the

2346
01:21:42,198 --> 01:21:49,158
sauna pronounced Finnish and I am

2347
01:21:45,319 --> 01:21:50,519
Finnish Swedish but SAA is uh the S we

2348
01:21:49,158 --> 01:21:51,839
do for I just learned something thank

2349
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:53,800
you yeah I didn't know that

2350
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:56,119
traditionally pronounced s not I didn't

2351
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:59,800
know that can do four days a week 30

2352
01:21:56,119 --> 01:22:04,039
minutes uh I I I like it hot I like it

2353
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:07,199
above like 180 MH mhm but you to yeah

2354
01:22:04,039 --> 01:22:09,158
it's like after I the saunas a lot and

2355
01:22:07,198 --> 01:22:10,678
in Tofino I'm really blessed we have a

2356
01:22:09,158 --> 01:22:12,559
couple really nice saunas that are on

2357
01:22:10,679 --> 01:22:14,000
the beach Y and then you walk across the

2358
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:15,280
beach and just lay in the ocean and

2359
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,238
that's almost torture because the waves

2360
01:22:15,279 --> 01:22:18,920
will get you like a bigger wave will hit

2361
01:22:17,238 --> 01:22:20,359
you and it go right over your head

2362
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:23,079
sometimes and it's like it's like a

2363
01:22:20,359 --> 01:22:25,279
whole different type of like flowy cold

2364
01:22:23,079 --> 01:22:27,039
and then we also have a floating sauna

2365
01:22:25,279 --> 01:22:28,840
yeah up the inlet where you it's

2366
01:22:27,039 --> 01:22:31,238
unbelievably beautiful and you can jump

2367
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:33,279
in the ocean off the floating sauna it's

2368
01:22:31,238 --> 01:22:36,279
yeah so that's funny cuz when we're in

2369
01:22:33,279 --> 01:22:38,279
Seattle they have uh hot tub boats okay

2370
01:22:36,279 --> 01:22:40,079
D it's freezing cold water on Lake Union

2371
01:22:38,279 --> 01:22:42,719
Ry yeah and then you go around in the

2372
01:22:40,079 --> 01:22:44,039
hot tub boats and HP in same sort of

2373
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:45,520
thing yeah we usually go in the real

2374
01:22:44,039 --> 01:22:47,000
boats but the hot tub boats are pretty

2375
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:48,560
cool too you see you know people

2376
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,479
partying you co plung in just the

2377
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:52,320
regular boat you can coold plunge off

2378
01:22:50,479 --> 01:22:54,559
the side of of the boat but yeah that

2379
01:22:52,319 --> 01:22:57,960
that water is super cold up there right

2380
01:22:54,560 --> 01:23:00,080
time year yeah um so as far as you do so

2381
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:02,840
how many days do you do cold plunge and

2382
01:23:00,079 --> 01:23:05,079
then how many days do you do s a week ah

2383
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:06,800
probably like only two two of each

2384
01:23:05,079 --> 01:23:09,119

fishing trips and then I switched it

2390
01:23:16,238 --> 01:23:19,919
into like a cannabis thing where we

2391
