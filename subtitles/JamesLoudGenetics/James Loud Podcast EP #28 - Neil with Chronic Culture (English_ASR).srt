00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:24,278
about it cool so chronic culture was

12
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:27,239
started about a year and a half ago um

13
00:00:24,278 --> 00:00:29,160
it's a events media and consulting

14
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:30,719
company uh we're based out of San

15
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,000
Francisco we have a cool spot in

16
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,960
downtown um we are pretty much the

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,759
producers of a few events around mainly

18
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,280
the trans Bay challenge um coming up

19
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:40,960
here the finals next week so super

20
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,600
excited about that awesome yeah you guys

21
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,079
you host all kinds of awesome events uh

22
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,600
you're like it's a multi-use space

23
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:48,878
because I've gone to three or four

24
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,480
different events now I think there and

25
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:52,238
you cook downstairs too you make these

26
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:54,640
awesome Smash Burgers maybe the best

27
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:56,519
Smash Burger I've ever had oh wow that

28
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,960
come that's big from you yeah and well I

29
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,399
think the the trick with the Smash

30
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,120
Burger is that you got to eat them

31
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,960
really hot and fresh right when they

32
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:04,878
come off when they're crispy that's what

33
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,760
you wanty Ooey and gooey you probably

34
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,520
made a couple thousand I've made a few

35
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,240

65
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:07,158
huh Let's Do It um you know I've seen a

66
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:08,639
lot of really great living soil weed I

67
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:10,080
think there's a lot of people who talk

68
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,799
different controversies against it and

69
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,440
stuff I mean for me am I saying it's

70
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,640
like the weed that I want to smoke all

71
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,239
the time I mean I enjoy it but I enjoy

72
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:18,318
smoking like you said before we were

73
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:19,680
talking you know you showed us some

74
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:21,919
stuff that was Sal based I mean it was

75
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,480
pretty good weed um to me it's kind of

76
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:25,359
just you know I I really appreciate like

77
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:26,719
the sustainable you know farming methods

78
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,040
that they use and stuff like that you

79
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,280
know kind of you know with the ecosystem

80
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,639
and you know just being kind of like

81
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,560
that pureness of the living soil but to

82
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,598
me as long as it smells good and tastes

83
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,080
good that's what really matters to me

84
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:40,799
yeah man I I agree I couldn't agree more

85
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,599
I feel like as long as it smells good

86
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,920
tastes good has a good effect that's the

87
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:46,280
most important thing to me the living

88
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:48,238
soil stuff it's great these guys going

89
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,840
no till living soil all these things

90
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,719
it's like at the end of the day as long

91
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,280
as it tastes amazing that's what counts

92
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:55,680
yeah uh I mean yeah I like eating

93
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,239
organic vegetables and I like you know

94
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,719
organic inputs sure so I mean a lot of I

95
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:02,840
think a lot of people are you know the

96
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:04,000
thing that I see with the living soil is

97
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,840
one of the stuff that I think it's

98
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,840
missing from the you know the salty weed

99
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,920
I still it's sticky it's blingy it's

100
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,719
nice I'm having a lot of TR a lot of

101
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:14,839
trouble finding sticky weed these days I

102
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:17,039
mean back in the day wears the football

103
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,920
totally you know and now it's like I I

104
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:21,679
can't really find that anywhere so the

105
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:23,359
champagne back in the day it was always

106
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,719
the stickiest of sticky that stuff you

107
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,280
could take a bud and you could stick it

108
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:27,479
I remember you to stick it on the window

109
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,239
sure you would stick it to the window

110
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:31,399
and it would stay you don't see Bud like

111
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:33,200
that anymore yeah even the best stuff

112
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,000
you really it's very rare that you would

113
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,798
find something that that's that sticky I

114
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,840
feel like once the facility started

115
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,599
going over 100 lights and getting really

116
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,120
big and obviously there's you know the

117
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:45,359
ability to have to stay costc conscious

118
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,360
I totally understand um you know I mean

119
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,799
where are you at with where the

120
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,280
nutrients are these days I mean what is

121
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:52,319
your desired

122
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,479
input again it you know I think there

123
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:56,639
there's a bunch of good stuff out there

124
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,119
I mean I think like uh Cutting Edge

125
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:01,318
makes some really good stuff I'm super

126
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,280
happy with Cutting Edge um

127
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:05,438
Frontline they they make some good

128
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,919
products I think as far as like for

129
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:09,639
salts sure and and I'm totally okay with

130
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,119
salt grown and cocoa if you do it

131
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:13,598
correctly and I think the Sanic guys

132
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,640
that are going Sanic I think that's

133
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:18,000
awesome too and I think flushing is

134
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:19,319
important sure but but there's all those

135
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,680
different things not pushing your plants

136
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:23,439
too hard to try to get a huge yield sure

137
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,720
you know I think that that takes away

138
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:27,639
from the quality well I think that was

139
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,880
The Fad that was about what two years

140
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:31,879
ago everybody started pump and pump and

141
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:33,279
pumping their stuff and youd go I'd go

142
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:35,959
into some of these facilities cuz you

143
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,478
know I've been in a lot of places and I

144
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:39,038
mean man you would see things like the

145
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:40,439
size of your arm and you'd be bring

146
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:42,159
about five pounds of light yeah and you

147
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:43,918
just look at it and you just be like

148
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,880
yeah I don't know that that just looks

149
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:48,639
really hard to sell so I mean if you do

150
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:50,719
the math you know if you get $2,000 on

151
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,720
you know pound and a half light weed

152
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,160
versus you know a th000 bucks on you

153
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,320
know 3 pounds of weed it's less weed

154
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,759
easier to sell so I kind of don't really

155
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:01,478
understand where some of these people

156
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,840
heads are but some of those facilities

157
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:04,359
that I've seen that were kind of moving

158
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:06,119
in that direction have kind of steered

159
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,240
back because I think that was kind of

160
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,600
the effect that was happening it was

161
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,639
really hard for them to sell it it was

162
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,720
just too much weed for sure and so many

163
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,680
people dropped off because they couldn't

164
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,880
grow good enough sure yeah so many

165
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,000
people yeah L and it's not just that

166
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:20,478
because there was some really great

167
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,560
facilities U gold seal they they did

168
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:24,599
good work I feel like their Congo was

169
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,120
some of the best I've ever had yeah you

170
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,639
know when we when I was over there we

171
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,600
were doing a really great job I mean the

172
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:30,680
Congo is obviously one of the favorites

173
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,080
you know we had a bunch of other

174
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,800
genetics that we were always playing

175
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:35,599
with because you know My Philosophy is

176
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,680
when you're a brand it's not obviously

177
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,800
there's some strains that Define you but

178
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,560
you know play around look you know

179
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,038
search always fenal hunting always look

180
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,560
for different things and always let the

181
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:47,159
consumers kind of give you the feedback

182
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,839
so yeah and I it's it's an interesting

183
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,680
Market because we're still in that phase

184
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:52,079
where we got the top 40s you know where

185
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,680
it's like like the music industry you

186
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:56,000
get your top 40s what's popular right

187
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,840
now and then leaning towards also having

188
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,680
some stable varieties and Staples that

189
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:01,318
you'll have forever like the guys that

190
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,360
are producing Skittles on a regular

191
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,919
basis I mean that's one that I don't see

192
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,479
that going away anytime soon I would

193
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:09,359
love to see OG become a staple again for

194
00:06:07,478 --> 00:06:11,598
a lot of people me too you know Sour

195
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,400
Diesel is another one someone Josh Josh

196
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:16,839
Freeman is doing some Sour work and I

197
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:19,038
feel like we need to get him into metric

198
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:21,038
and sure get that sour on a regular

199
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:22,680
basis I feel like the world needs things

200
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:24,519
like that yeah I mean when I was doing

201
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,000
some buying for dispensaries you know as

202
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:28,839
the 2018 kind of you know came in and

203
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,720
the switch you know there were still

204
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:32,318
those brands that had that but now it's

205
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,880
kind of like garnered over to like you

206
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,680
kind of see it consistently with a lot

207
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:37,199
of the outdoor Brands they kind of keep

208
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,000
that in their rotation and do some sort

209
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,720
of that stuff but the indoor people not

210
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,680
so much I think mainly just because of

211
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,199
the timing on it but you know you have

212
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,199
you have those select few people that I

213
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:48,199
think you know are still look are still

214
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:49,560
looking for that finding it and you know

215
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,720
trying to grow that and bring it to the

216
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,199
market because again like I just really

217
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,000
feel like you know I've been to a lot of

218
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,280
facilities and obviously when you go

219
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,800
there you have the lemon cherries and

220
00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:00,559
the runs and stuff like that to kind of

221
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,038
what keeps people going uh but for sure

222
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,079
when you're a brand you have the ability

223
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:05,478
to have variety when you go to a buyer

224
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:06,719
yo if they like your brand if they like

225
00:07:05,478 --> 00:07:08,639
what you have they're going to buy more

226
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,039
than just the two strains that you have

227
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,000
so hopefully they're not just all Lemon

228
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:13,918
Cherry gelada no and so many people just

229
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,839
rename stuff too they call it this but

230
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:18,878
it's really a Lemon Cherry gelato runs

231
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:20,239
which I get man whatever I get part of

232
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:21,840
it these days is about marketing it's

233
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,918
about what your bag looks like it's

234
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:24,719
about what your brand looks like but

235
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:26,279
it's only part of it of course part yeah

236
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,240
it's part for sure but it's it's a heavy

237
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:30,198
part for sure these days yeah what what

238
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,240
could what is marketing is one thing

239
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:35,000
it'll get people to pick up the bag but

240
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,639
will it get them to continually buy it I

241
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,160
mean time will tell with that I mean I

242
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,160
kind of have this philosophy that when

243
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,280
you're working with the dispensary you

244
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,560
kind of have three three if you can sell

245
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:45,719
it into them into the store three times

246
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,399
yeah then you're good that means you

247
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,120
know it's working if you if they don't

248
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:52,279
place a third order then hey move on go

249
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,840
to the next try to readjust try to

250
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:55,638
figure out a better path forward with

251
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:57,198
them right how did you get started with

252
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:58,319
cooking was is this just something

253
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,400
you've been passionate about did you go

254
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,960
to culinary school feel like I did not I

255
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,918
just kind of like food and like you know

256
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:06,399
experimenting I mean you know I think

257
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:08,478
it's really interesting when you look at

258
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:10,519
a lot of the the people out there that I

259
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:11,959
think are the weed celebrities I guess

260
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:13,560
you know I've had a meal with most of

261
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:15,079
them most of them are they all really

262
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,598
like doing high-end food I mean it's all

263
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:18,680
about I guess it's all about the turps

264
00:08:16,598 --> 00:08:20,478
you know what I mean and you know that's

265
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,918
definitely you know there when you have

266
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:24,079
that sort of pallette for cannabis it

267
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,878
kind of translates into food as well

268
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:28,279
what you got to have a certain amount of

269
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:30,800
money to be able to afford the yeah

270
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:32,079
Advanced pallet to exactly exactly these

271
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,200
days you know I think it's harder for

272
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,440
people I think a lot of people are

273
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,599
experim experimenting more at home than

274
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,080
they are at their restaurants but

275
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,240
occasionally it's nice to go out and

276
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,759
check out some of the new the new places

277
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,158
I definitely felt like you know growing

278
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:46,360
up in San Francisco and being there got

279
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:48,159
super spoiled not only with weed but

280
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,278
also with food and you know after a

281
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:50,958
while I was always going to all these

282
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:52,838
Michelin star restaurants and I kind of

283
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:55,159
just I felt like every time I would go

284
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,839
pay $200 to eat and I was like not

285
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:59,199
satisfied and I felt like people were

286
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:00,320
just kind of making these restaurants

287
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,600
just to kind of you know be a part of

288
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,920
the fat so well on my show we talk about

289
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,680
data points a lot and I think part of

290
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:08,199
developing a pallet is data points all

291
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:09,759
over the place whether it's a cannabis

292
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,399
pallet or whether you're a chef and

293
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:13,838
you're trying to develop a pallette for

294
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:15,600
that or wine or cigars or whatever it is

295
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,040
it's all about collecting data points

296
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,320
and it's this huge collection of

297
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:20,679
experiences that we've had since

298
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,079
childhood and so I feel like that kind

299
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:25,439
of is where the the tie comes in and the

300
00:09:23,078 --> 00:09:27,000
appreciation for Quality as well you got

301
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,839
guys that love good cannabis that also

302
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,519
love good food it's because we've

303
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:32,360
collected to these data points and we

304
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:34,240
understand what good food and bad food

305
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,000
and good flavor and bad flavor and what

306
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,839
works together because it's all these

307
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,078
combinations of different nuances that

308
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:42,360
makes make everything so special yeah we

309
00:09:41,078 --> 00:09:43,838
were talking actually about that a

310
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,079
little before we started you know on

311
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,920
like good cannabis and like you know is

312
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:49,958
there you know have you ever had really

313
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:51,639
had bad weed and I mean Me growing up in

314
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:53,759
San Francisco you know starting to smoke

315
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:55,679
at like 15 years old there's always good

316
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,078
weed around every time I mean we would

317
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,159
have a guy down the walk you go to you

318
00:09:57,078 --> 00:09:59,838
knock on the door You' be like hey I

319

want to out the pass out I was always

320
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,600
good weed so I was pretty spoiled I was

321
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,759
never like smoking hay or anything like

322
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,399
that but you were telling me definitely

323
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:09,319
since the 60s yeah yeah in San Francisco

324
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:12,039
exactly but yeah but I saw the hayweed I

325
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,360
saw the brown weed we had everything and

326
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:16,838
I I'm in the I was in the East Bay so

327
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,759
not that far away from San Francisco but

328
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,519
I saw the you know the pounds of bammer

329
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:23,919
weed that was loaded with seeds in it

330
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:27,200
from Mexico that was like hard pressed

331
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:28,759
with uh you know like soda water I

332
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,759
believe is what they used sugar and soda

333
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:31,838
water really yeah I mean I there's

334
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:33,039
different ways to do it but yeah that

335
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,240
was one of the ways they pressed that

336
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:37,519
brick weed was they put it in a tarp and

337
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,560
then pressed it and then you know they

338
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:42,039
got huge Bales you started smoking a

339
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:44,000
little bit before me I I saw I've seen

340
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:45,240
that before but never was never really

341
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,120
one to smoke and I'm like I'll just go

342
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,759
to the guy down the block $400 a pound

343
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,720
back in the day $400 a pound nice what

344
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:52,480
would it cost now probably nothing there

345
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,000
you

346
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,759
go it's pretty wild but you know cuz we

347
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,120
had outdoor that was going for less than

348
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:59,879
that a couple years ago that was

349
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,159
actually pretty good quality quality

350
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:03,480
really sad yeah I mean it'll be pretty

351
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:05,159
interesting to see you know harvest

352
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,399
season you know it's October right now

353
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:07,759
you know I think a lot less people

354
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,000
planted this year but I've definitely

355
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:10,838
been hearing the people that have

356
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,839
planted you know other people that have

357
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:14,480
stayed and kind of you know been there

358
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,800
and I think the quality is going to be

359
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,200
there yeah I think we'll have more

360
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:19,159
quality and a lot of the people that

361
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,120
didn't plant probably shouldn't have

362
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:22,600
planted anyway yeah I think a lot of

363
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,078
more people are obviously going towards

364
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,079
fresh Frozen as well you know with the

365
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:29,479
the Rosen movement and everything so the

366
00:11:27,078 --> 00:11:30,679
Rosen curs are awesome yeah

367
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,278

different ones but uh their cart I

373
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,880

388
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,240
let me

389
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:19,680
[Applause]

390
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,759
try so you just got over Co about three

391
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:23,319
weeks ago two weeks ago yeah about a

392
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:25,039
month ago about a month ago yeah and

393
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,760
then your wife just got Co a couple days

394
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:29,879
ago but she'll be okay she'll be okay

395
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:31,838
it's luckily not as bad as used to be

396
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:33,639
for the most no no no it's it's just a

397
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,000
lot of aches a lot of pains and you know

398
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:36,639
just like kind of just have to chill and

399
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,799
sit in bed so anytime that happens I

400
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,959
just stop smoking anytime I get sick I

401
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:43,120
stop smoking I have a lot of friends who

402
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:44,719
power through it and it makes them sick

403
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,959
for but it makes them sick for longer

404
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,879
yeah I'm just like they can't put it

405
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:50,439
down so you know it's like I think

406
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:54,240
they're you know obviously wheed is not

407
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,720
addictive but I definitely think it is

408
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,600
well switching over to Edibles or

409
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,680
something like that I mean I'm not

410
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,639
really into EDI it doesn't give me the

411
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:03,399
same effect it's not that I don't like

412
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:05,120
them every once in a while but it's just

413
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:07,519
not my day-to-day sort of thing like

414
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,320
Edibles do a different thing to me I

415
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,839
don't take Edibles they get me super

416
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,519
paranoid yeah they get me ripped super

417
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,199
paranoid so everybody's like Oh I'm a

418
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,278
big dude oh you could probably take like

419
00:13:15,198 --> 00:13:19,479
you know 500 milligrams of Edibles no I

420
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:22,480
know it's the small little girls that

421
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,399
that 500 M yeah me too I'm good with 10

422
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,278
like five 5 10 milligrams is fine I used

423
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,919
to we we never counted milligrams back

424
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:29,278
in the day so we'd make these super

425
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:31,479
strong brownies or

426
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:32,720
super strong whatever and they you know

427
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,399
you'd probably be eating two or 300

428
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,839
milligrams one time I ate a brownie this

429
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,360
is a great story one time I ate a

430
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:40,880
brownie you know obviously we didn't

431
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,320
know what was in it right so I'm sitting

432
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:45,240
there and I get a and I'm then I just

433
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,800
start getting super paranoid I think

434
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,278
that you know this is when I was like

435
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:50,000
selling weed and you know there I had

436
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:51,759
packs and stuff like that and I was like

437
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,720
oh [ __ ] the FBI is coming to get me this

438
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:55,159
is all bad then I get a knock on the

439
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,839
door and it was a dude that I sold a lot

440
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:59,719
of weed with right and he brings a new

441
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:02,000
guy over I never met right and the guy

442
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:06,199
starts asking me some questions and I

443
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,879
just freak out I'm just like Yo dude are

444
00:14:06,198 --> 00:14:10,519
you a cop freak out my buddy who I've

445
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:13,240
been selling me with for five years just

446
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:14,639
looking at me like dude what is going on

447
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:18,879
and then finally I tell him what's going

448
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:20,159
on super nice guy takes the guy away

449
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,838
helps me get all the weed out of the

450
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,838
house brings it over his house he's like

451
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,680
just chill out don't do anything hang

452
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,040
out it literally took me two days to

453
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:29,919
become sane wow well cuz back in I mean

454
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:31,958
you had no idea could have been A500

455
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:33,679
milligrams in it you never know totally

456
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:35,319
yeah you we just didn't know yeah I

457
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:37,758
think that's one of the great things

458
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:40,759
about legalization is the dosing and the

459
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:42,680
testing um you know awareness is so huge

460
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:44,039
now you know it's like we're so aware of

461
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:45,758
what we're putting in our bodies to a

462
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:48,319
degree especially with milligram doses

463
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,560
on Edibles well now they also have the

464
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,959
mixture of the cannaboids with the

465
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:52,758
Edibles and you know some of them can

466
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,799
really use them I mean you know even my

467
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:58,159
parents now use them for sleep and stuff

468
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:59,758
whatever yep yep totally well you know

469
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:01,600
they're getting into the the science of

470
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:03,600
all these chirpin and how they affect us

471
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,199
like linol and all these things that

472
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,159
sure that can be relaxing or sedative

473
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:09,559
and so that's pretty wild like what's

474
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:12,600
your what's your thoughts on all the

475
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:14,319
whole Delta 8 situation that's Delta 9

476
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,278
situation that's going on I think the

477
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,240
farm bill is going to change it okay and

478
00:15:16,278 --> 00:15:21,720
I I'm okay with that to a degree but

479
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,240
like I think the Delta eight is good I

480
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,759
don't think I think if you use a good

481
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:28,680
starting material and you process it

482
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:32,000
correctly I think converting a a

483
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:34,278
molecule into Delta 8 is okay from from

484
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,559
CBD I like the effects of it and that's

485
00:15:34,278 --> 00:15:37,000
why I'm saying that we haven't done

486
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:39,559
enough studies for me to actually be

487
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,120
saying that oh yeah it's okay but as far

488
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:43,039
as the effect I enjoy the effect of

489
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,720
Delta 8 for Sleep sure so I don't I

490
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:46,159
don't take it all the time but I'm not

491
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,040
going to go take ibuprofen or some

492
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:50,278
sleeping pill I'm gonna go eat a Delta

493
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:52,399
eight gummy which you know it has sugar

494
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:54,838
in it right before I go to bed but it

495
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:57,440
makes me tired I do 25 milligrams or 50

496
00:15:54,839 --> 00:16:00,279
milligrams of Delta 8 really and so for

497
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,519
me I I enjoy the Delta 8 the Delta 10

498
00:16:00,278 --> 00:16:05,360
not so much but Delta 8 I really can

499
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:07,039
relate to I have not experimented with

500
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,159
the different deltas and I'm gonna have

501
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:11,399
to now that you there's so many yeah

502
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:13,198
there's so many thco so many different

503
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:14,958
ones and I feel like uh every time they

504
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:18,000
like write something in they find a new

505
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:20,039
cannaboid to kind of move over to so I

506
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,639
don't know some of it I feel like it's

507
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:23,000
like they're trying to beat the system

508
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:25,240
by some of it I feel like is a little

509
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,519
bit of a racket but you know obviously

510
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,240
every state isn't legal and you know

511
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,959
there's Loop that people try to use so

512
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,079
yeah but I mean I think those things you

513
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,439
know like Delta 8 like we we need to be

514
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:39,359
aware because it does get people really

515
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:41,880
high so I think fully unregulated I

516
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,560
don't know um scheduled I don't think it

517
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:44,679
I don't think it should be scheduled

518
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:46,958
necessarily but I think we need to

519
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:48,599
deschedule everything anyway sure I mean

520
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:50,638
what do you you think I mean with the

521
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,159
latest you know recommendation from the

522
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,560
DEA to make it scheduled too I so the

523
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:56,198
the schedule three I think they're

524
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:57,958
talking about moving to schedule three I

525
00:16:56,198 --> 00:17:00,278
think honestly the move is to deschedule

526
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:02,078
not resle well of course you know so I

527
00:17:00,278 --> 00:17:04,480
mean rescheduling to three makes it what

528
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:06,078
medical medical right and I mean look

529
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,120
there there's so much money there's so

530
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:10,038
much there's so many people and money

531
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:12,519
that's infused in the Cannabis industry

532
00:17:10,038 --> 00:17:14,199
now that obviously I think even if it

533
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:15,879
does get descheduled it's not going to

534
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,759
like put it on a terrible path moving

535
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,520
forward I think it'll open the doors for

536
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:22,000
certain things that maybe we won't and

537
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:24,798
put a couple robu up for certain things

538
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,838
but you know I'm I'm I'm voting on just

539
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:28,918
completely descheduling I mean if that

540
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:30,440
happened it'd be I think that be pretty

541
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:33,440
interesting as well well we don't

542
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:35,558
schedule alcohol or tobacco they're

543
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,120
Controlled Substances but they're not

544
00:17:35,558 --> 00:17:39,918
scheduled sure which is where where I

545
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:42,439
think cannabis should be sure in fact

546
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,360
it's a much safer it's a lot safer than

547
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,880
tobacco it's a lot safer than alcohol

548
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:48,798
yeah as far as for health sure I mean I

549
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,840
personally you know I'll drink every now

550
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:52,759
and then have some wine if I'm GNA drink

551
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:54,359
it's because I'm GNA party and go out

552
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:57,480
but I mean cannabis is pretty much my

553
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:58,918
go-to like we we all get together uh uh

554
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,599
me and a group of friends and they

555
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:02,960
always bring wine and there's like four

556
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:03,918
of us and they always leave a glass out

557
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,079
for me because they're like they know

558
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,038
he's just going to go smoke weed yeah

559
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:10,519
what do you think about Governor Nome

560
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:12,158
vetoing the bill on

561
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:14,679
psychedelics I

562
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:16,600
mean I I believe that the way he put it

563
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:18,440
was is it it didn't have enough written

564
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:21,439
in there about you know how to properly

565
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:23,480
use it and how to properly you know I

566
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,440
hate using the word police but to manage

567
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,240
it in a certain sense and I agree with

568
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,320
that I mean he also vetoed you know the

569
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,679
Cannabis Cafe bill I mean if if you look

570
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:32,599
at that I mean I think that would be a

571
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:34,240
really great thing but you know looking

572
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:36,079
at that bill with a fine tooth com which

573
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,759
I have cuz I'm was super interested in

574
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:41,079
that you know it it there needs to be a

575
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:43,240
few things adjusted to it I think to

576
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:44,720
actually make it viable for people like

577
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,079
I don't know if people know this but you

578
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,720
know the the person who wrote it he's he

579
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:50,558
was writing it with San Francisco in

580
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,839
mind but if you actually looked at San

581
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:54,798
Francisco's laws and the way that it

582
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:57,720
that it's all put together it's actually

583
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:59,200
not possible yeah so you know I think

584
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,960
there there were a lot of things about

585
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,480
it that you know I'm I was super in

586
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,640
favor of but a few things that I think

587
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,079
the governor looked at he was like hey

588
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,880
yeah you know mainly and I agree with

589
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:10,639
him you know the smoking indoors and you

590
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:12,320
know I I completely understand uh but

591
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,320
you know we have the rights to be able

592
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:15,960
to you know the at least the cities have

593
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,839
to be able to make those decisions I

594
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,240
mean San Francisco has you know lounges

595
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:22,639
that exist I mean wi tip allow smoking

596
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,240
really because it's a private club

597
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,200
private CL it's a private club so I feel

598
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,480
like that model could be converted over

599
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,558
to cannabis very easily and if we're

600
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,880
going to allow it for tobacco why not

601
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:36,240
allow it for whatever of course so not

602
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,240
crack yeah I mean you know our spe you

603
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,319
know at at our at our office you know

604
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,640
when people come in it's a private club

605
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:43,000
that's the way that we kind of put it

606
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,200
and that's kind of the way that we're

607
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,839
going about smoking indoors I mean we

608
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,240
don't condone it definitely get super

609
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:50,720
smoky in there I've never seen nobody

610
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,640
smoke in there

611
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,558
never but um yeah I mean it'll be pretty

612
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,038
interesting you know that you know I I

613
00:19:55,558 --> 00:19:58,720
think with all the bills that are coming

614
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:00,119
up and there was the other bill you know

615
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,880
had the Cannabis packaging which I was

616
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:03,239
super happy that got vetoed I think a

617
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,400
lot of people were I think that would

618
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,558
have put some handcuffs on a lot of

619
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,798
these Brands and um you know I think the

620
00:20:07,558 --> 00:20:10,200
governor said it right it was going to

621
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:11,519
make a lot of these smaller cannabis

622
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,720
brands have to spend a lot of money to

623
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:15,798
Rebrand yeah so which would definitely

624
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:18,240
would have been you know the case but

625
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:20,200
also it's just like completely changing

626
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,519
something that's already kind of messed

627
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:27,038
up to begin with so to throw another you

628
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:28,480
know I guess coal on the fire there or I

629
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:30,839
just think it would have been terrible

630
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,159
right well let's dive into your history

631
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:33,399
man I I think everyone would love to

632
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,880
hear a little bit about your history how

633
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,798
you got involved with cannabis when did

634
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,640
you start smoking oh man I started

635
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:40,119
smoking I actually know the first time I

636
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:44,880
ever got high was Millennium midnight

637
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:47,599
New Year so 2000 in 20 23 years 23 years

638
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,840
I was what it's a good run yeah I was a

639
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:53,480
freshman in I was a freshman in high

640
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:54,720
school nice yeah so yeah I'm a little

641
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,798
older than you yeah you're a little

642
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,480
older that's okay man smoking a little

643
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:01,879
longer but um yeah I mean it's been a

644
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,640
long run I mean I definitely smoked weed

645
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:06,120
every day from probably the age of 15 to

little Urban High School to some of my

663
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,880
friends and then went to college and

664
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,159
when I went to college I brought a half

665
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,640
pound of wheed and

666
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:48,679
a jerky bag I went to Lo La Mar mount in

667
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,919
in Los Angeles oh nice yeah so you went

668
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:54,360
from San Francisco to LA San Francisco

669
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:56,038
to LA and I went there and I was uh I

670
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:57,399
was uh I brought a half pound of weed

671
00:21:56,038 --> 00:21:58,759
with me just to smoke and then I found a

672
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,519
friend and started just like selling

673
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:02,319
some weed to them and that's kind of how

674
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:03,639
it all took off so made good friends

675
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:05,119
with my friend across the hallway he

676
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:07,400
actually brought weed to sell as well so

677
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:10,158
we became friends and yeah sold weed in

678
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,840
college uh for a little bit and just

679
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,880
kind of kept in touch with it it was

680
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:16,480
something that I kind of always knew I

681
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,400
wanted to do nice yeah yeah I think it

682
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,839
just latches on to you or you latch on

683
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,600
to it or it's like the symbiotic

684
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,918
relationship that most of us have with

685
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:24,599
the plant where we just fall in love

686
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:27,159
with it it becomes a part of our life

687
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:28,399
yeah so I was uh you know living in La I

688
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:29,960
wanted to do entertainment and then

689
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,400
after college I went and I started

690
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,440
working in entertainment so I did that

691
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:36,000
for a couple years and then after the

692

693

698
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,798
pretty interesting that's pretty cool it

699
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,200

700
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:55,759
out of college was that so I literally

701

703
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,520
had got the day off to graduate and then

704
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,080
after that I went on the road to like

705
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:04,639
Atlanta and Mississippi and a couple

706

places with them so it was a pretty

707
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,200
interesting experience and I got along

708
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,000
really well with him just basically

709
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:13,400
because I had weed and I was like hey

710
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,599
was he a smoker too oh yeah big smoker I

711
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,480
mean the first day I met him I was

712
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:20,158
getting them ready for a Vanity Fair

713
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:22,120

714
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,360
the bell and couldn't get him up finally

715
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:24,479

716
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:26,759

720
00:23:30,278 --> 00:23:33,400
so I went in my card I got some

721
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:35,720
granddaddy that I actually brought from

722
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,360
the hemp center from San Francisco so I

723
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,960

726
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,240
funny because the night before he was

727
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:45,839
like we'll see how long you last it was

728
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,880
like the first time I met him and the

729
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:48,119
next day he was like you might last a

730
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,200
little longer than I thought I was like

731
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:53,158
okay cool so that's what the plant does

732
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:56,240
you know what I mean totally yeah so uh

733
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:58,720
yeah so the San Francisco dude that's

734
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,400
where Bernar start right yeah I used to

735
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,679
buy weed at the hemp Center and he was

736
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,559
the bud tender there so I always

737
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:06,440
remember seeing him behind there and get

738
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:08,119
weed from him so it's pretty interesting

739
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,519
to see where it's all come it's all

740
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:11,839
incestuous the whole industry very much

741
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:13,359
but the hemp Center dude it was one of

742
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:14,480
the one of the cool spots man it was

743
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:16,000
like a place that you could sit you

744
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,839

Edibles everything you want and you had

750
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:30,320
a place where you could say you could

751
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:31,319
smoke and you know it was no frills and

752
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:32,639
you know you would look through the

753
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:34,480
window and you see this little ray of

754
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,880

767
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:02,479
the thing you know about how it used I

768
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,038

00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:26,959
out with my friends and uh you know

808
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,200
that's what kind of was like I really

809
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,200
want to do this one

810
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,798
yeah so you know worked in entertainment

811
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:35,240
and then after entertainment on the 2008

812
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:36,480
uh crash of the market I was like living

813
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,759
on my parents cou like what do you want

814
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,159
to do I was like well I want to be in

815
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:42,000
weed and so you know I spent my last

816
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,278
little bit of cash that I had and I to

817
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
went to a lawyer and I took my parents

818
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:46,759
with me and they were like okay cool you

819
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,519
probably won't get in that much trouble

820
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:51,519
so kind of started it from there uh you

821
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:53,679
know got a warehouse with some friends

822
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:56,720
uh got a loan for my parents to start

823
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,880
the warehouse so uh did that did that

824
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:02,440
for you know growing in warehouses from

825
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,240
2009 to about I mean still to like up

826
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,798
until a few years ago when I left gold

827
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,038
seal so yeah um those were the days

828
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:10,480
though me well and you were a

829
00:27:08,038 --> 00:27:13,759
foundational part of gold seal yeah so I

830
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,839
started it uh I started it uh with uh a

831
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:17,398
couple a couple people uh me and my

832
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:18,759
buddy actually designed the logo and

833
00:27:17,398 --> 00:27:20,798
then I was like Hey weed's about to be

834
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:22,720
legal I was like I gotta get with some

835
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:25,038
people I think because I I you can't I

836
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,319
can't do this all by myself right I was

837
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:28,119
like Hey it'd be really great to have

838
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:29,200
somebody because I was selling at all

839
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:30,879
the clubs I was the one that would go

840
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,880
out and do all the sales so we I

841
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,278
partnered up with a couple people um and

842
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,960
we all kind of had different strengths

843
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:37,759
and mine was like I said going to the

844
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,000
club selling the weed we had the grower

845
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:41,640
and then we had somebody who was like

846
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,599
running the business so um you know I

847
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,159
was super proud of that you know we were

848
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:46,639
one of the first people to be uh you

849
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:49,000
know on the shelves in San Francisco

850
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,320
branded I remember I would like be super

851
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,119
insistent about it and then as 2018 came

852
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:55,839
we were one of the first people that

853
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:58,000
were licensed and ready and that's kind

854
00:27:55,839 --> 00:28:00,519
of when everything broke loose and we

855
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,720
just hit hit the ground running so we

856
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:04,319
were doing pretty well um you know there

857
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,120
were a few things that happened you know

858
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:08,278
some things happen that are act God and

859
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:10,000
you know some sometimes that happens and

860
00:28:08,278 --> 00:28:11,278
you even want to point at people to like

861
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,079
act like it's their fault even though it

862
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:14,759
was God that that made it happen right

863
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:16,639
but after a while man you know we just

864
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:18,558
weren't getting along as partners and

865
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,759
you know that happens in this industry

866
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:22,519
and in every industry and I it was it

867
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:24,200
was time for me to leave so I ended up

868
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:26,839
leaving but uh let's talk a little bit

869
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,319
about gold seal in the red Congo sure I

870
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:30,918
think that was their claimed the fame to

871
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:32,798
a degree sure um you know really put

872
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:35,240
them on the map in San Francisco because

873
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:38,398
not a lot of people wanted to grow a

874
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:41,000
long flowering you know a plant that had

875
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:43,599
a open bud structure you know type type

876
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,480
product for the market and how did that

877
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:47,719
come about as far as red Congo I would

878
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:50,120
say I have a LoveHate relationship with

879
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:51,759
that strain um look from a sales point

880
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:53,879
of view very easy to sell people really

881
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:55,398
liked it I it wasn't always my smoke cuz

882
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,559
it was a little bit more racy and

883
00:28:55,398 --> 00:28:59,119
something that I didn't really like I

884
00:28:56,558 --> 00:29:03,319
was more of like the IND smoker but um

885
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:05,158
we were me and my one partner uh we had

886
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:06,439
a a grower that we were working with and

887
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:07,919
then we parted ways with him and we

888
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,360
needed to find another person to work

889
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,960
with and so we found a gentleman who was

890
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:13,719
growing red Congo and that was kind of

891
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,480
his thing and we all decided to kind of

892
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,319
get together so we kind of took reged

893
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,798
Congo and you know put it as part of the

894
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:20,918
brand and started moving it around to

895
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:22,839
the dispensaries uh obviously super easy

896
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:24,519
to sell a lot of people really liked it

897
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:26,480
definitely had a lot of people always

898
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:28,000
just like talking to me about the strain

899
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,038
but you know like you said it's a it's a

900
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:34,440
12we strain and you know

901
00:29:30,038 --> 00:29:36,319
it's it's it's super hard uh to grow it

902
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,240
um and basically what happened was is we

903
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:40,439
were growing it in one facility and then

904
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,558
we built this spaceship facility and

905
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,640
then we brought it over there it just

906
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:47,960
didn't translate under that from like

907
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,720
the original kind of like single-ended

908
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,640
like ghetto facility that was built that

909
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,278
was super dialed just for that strain

910
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,120
right yeah well I think you guys had to

911
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:56,919
deal with you had build battle with hop

912
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:59,879
Leighton too I think that was part of

913
00:29:56,919 --> 00:30:02,120
like the issue that if if I'm pretty

914
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:04,240
sure that there was an you know that

915
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:06,319
strain had been kept by the same group

916
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,079
of people for like 10 years and

917
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:09,439
obviously you know hop Lon so prevalent

918
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:11,278
now but back in the day that's kind of

919
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,679
when it all started creeping up was

920
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:15,519
definitely the Hop Lon um you know I

921
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,399
think there were a lot of factors that

922
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:19,399
kind of came into it hop Lon for sure

923
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:21,158
being you know something that kind of

924
00:30:19,398 --> 00:30:22,719
came in but it got tissue cultured and

925
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:25,159
even after it got tissue cultured it was

926
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,519
still dirty it

927
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:29,799
no I think it was good it was just it

928
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:31,558
just again when you're you're moving

929
00:30:29,798 --> 00:30:33,720
from a certain type of facility to the

930
00:30:31,558 --> 00:30:35,278
next and you know I think it was really

931
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,200
hard for some people to make the

932
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:39,798
transition and like I said we also had a

933
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,278
lot of things happen we had uh we had

934
00:30:39,798 --> 00:30:43,519
our power go out and we were on

935
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:45,000
generators and there was just a lot of

936
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:46,359
things that happen well and genetics

937
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,880
aren't just plug-and playay it's not

938
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:49,439
like you can grow one and all you throw

939
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,840
something else in it's easy usually it

940
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,919
takes a couple times to dial it in

941
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:54,678
sometimes it takes multiple times to

942
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:57,240
really dial in something especially

943
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:59,159
something that's longer which taller

944
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:01,519
plant longer flowering requires

945
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:03,080
different light different food yeah I

946
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,319
mean when when you were we were going

947
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:08,839
from having single and like 10 foot

948
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:10,638
ceilings with single-ended bulbs to 25

949
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:14,278
foot ceilings with double-ended bulbs

950
00:31:10,638 --> 00:31:16,000
full CO2 everything feeding systems um

951
00:31:14,278 --> 00:31:17,919
you know I think it just dialing that in

952
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,839
was hard and like I said we had a few

953
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:22,120
things happen that were acts of God that

954
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:26,119
ended up you know destroying a couple

955
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:28,518
crops um but when you do the pure you

956
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:30,239
know for me it we had a good brand we

957
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:31,960
had a lot of other good strains it was

958
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,399
we were able to sell our products in the

959
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:36,038
store regardless I was of the mind we're

960
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:38,518
like Yo dude don't grow that because I

961
00:31:36,038 --> 00:31:40,079
can sell anything because like I'm we're

962
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:42,200
a brand we know what we're doing I get

963
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:44,278
people like it hey bust it out once a

964
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,679
year or let's find an outdoor grower to

965
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:47,679
grow it and we'll release it like that

966
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:49,200
that's almost the best way with

967
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:51,200
something like that anyway I would agree

968
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,080
ex yeah and but when you did the pure

969
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,399
math on it especially with how cramped

970
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:57,278
we were with how many lights we had and

971
00:31:55,398 --> 00:31:59,319
how we had to produce because when we

972
00:31:57,278 --> 00:32:00,880
went in we we went in with all our own

973
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:02,278
money yeah so we took all our own money

974
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,720
and we just had enough money to get

975
00:32:02,278 --> 00:32:06,638
across the Finish Line if everything

976
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:08,240
went well nothing always goes as planned

977
00:32:06,638 --> 00:32:09,798
totally so that's definitely a piece of

978
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,519
advice that I would give if you're GNA

979
00:32:09,798 --> 00:32:14,638
you know start a business obviously have

980
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:16,399
stuff in reserves uh ready to go have a

981
00:32:14,638 --> 00:32:18,519
couple years buffered out if you can a

982
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:20,959
couple couple years would be great but

983
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:22,519
you know accidents happened and again uh

984
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,798
you know there were certain things that

985
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:25,960
happened with that that I think were

986
00:32:23,798 --> 00:32:28,200
acts of God uh that I'll just kind of

987
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:30,558
chalk it up as that but in the end I

988
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,038
think the demise of the whole gold sale

989
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:33,519
situation was there were just three

990
00:32:32,038 --> 00:32:35,839
people that kind of weren't on the same

991
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,399
page and I think you know my advice for

992
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:38,839
people out there who are you know trying

993
00:32:37,398 --> 00:32:41,239
to start Brands trying to start

994
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:43,439
companies is find the right Partners get

995
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:47,278
on the same page with them and really

996
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,558
just have goals and you know have yeah I

997
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:50,119
I believe you should have diverse

998
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:51,678
Partners you want someone that does the

999
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:52,959
exact same thing find someone that has

1000
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,720
talents that are a little bit different

1001
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,600
than yours and work with them and

1002
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,480
combine the talents you know create the

1003
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:59,719
perfect ulton I mean if you look at if

1004
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,480
you look at the way companies are

1005
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:04,000
structures there's you know sea levels

1006
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:05,639
of many different types and that's

1007
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,278
because there has to be someone that's

1008
00:33:05,638 --> 00:33:09,079
good at many different things yeah no

1009
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:11,119
one can wear all the hats for us we were

1010
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:13,359
three Growers who got together and

1011
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:15,158
everybody kind of had to find their

1012
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:17,599
right what they were good at that wasn't

1013
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:19,399
just growing uh or at least a few of us

1014
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:21,079
yeah uh and you know sometimes that's

1015
00:33:19,398 --> 00:33:22,678
hard and it's hard to like mix together

1016
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:25,079
and you know figure it out and

1017
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:27,200
definitely you know uh Partnerships are

1018
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:29,439
tough but you know you live in your life

1019
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,798
and I learned so much and you know it

1020
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,759
really gave me a lot you know moving

1021
00:33:31,798 --> 00:33:36,200
into some of the next few things that I

1022
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:38,519
was doing so okay so if you could give

1023
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:40,440
yourself one piece of advice you know

1024
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:42,558
the young Neil that's two or three years

1025
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,919
in the industry you know from your

1026
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:47,240
advice now where you have 25 years

1027
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:49,240
behind you smoking herb and experience

1028
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:51,278
with the plant what would that advice be

1029
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:53,679
there's two pieces of advice number one

1030
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:55,798
diversify a little um and that's not

1031
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,600
only just in specifically cannabis it's

1032
00:33:55,798 --> 00:33:58,839
just for everything I mean I wish I

1033
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:00,798
would have taken some of the money that

1034
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:03,000
I had and put it into like a food truck

1035
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:05,960
or a couple other businesses that also

1036
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,960
provided but back then it was like you

1037
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:10,079
know I could take that $40,000 and put

1038
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:12,079
up 30 lights and make three times that

1039
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:13,280
amount of money that year so I think if

1040
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:15,720
I had to go back on it I would

1041
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,280
definitely recommend to diversify um the

1042
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:19,158
other thing I would recommend is get a

1043
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,399
really good bookkeeper and accountant

1044
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:23,398
it's super important especially in these

1045
00:34:21,398 --> 00:34:25,159
days you know just to make sure you're

1046
00:34:23,398 --> 00:34:27,039
keeping track of your cash and make sure

1047
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:28,440
you're paying your taxes and making sure

1048
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:30,679
that you understand where your business

1049
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:34,559
is at financially I know that's boring

1050
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:36,519
but it's important no but it's super

1051
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:38,398
important yeah yeah having your [ __ ]

1052
00:34:36,519 --> 00:34:39,398
together super important I basically

1053
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:40,960
that's what you're saying is make sure

1054
00:34:39,398 --> 00:34:42,159
you have your [ __ ] together because

1055
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,800
there's going to be a time where it's

1056
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,960
super important where you have all your

1057
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:48,480
your books all dialed in although law I

1058
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:50,480
know lawyers and you know tax advisers

1059
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,199
cost money but in the long run they'll

1060
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,480
save you so much money and heartache and

1061
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,480
all kinds of other stuff exactly so you

1062
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,639
don't have to backtrack and look later

1063
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,079
at what you signed or fig out together

1064
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:01,679
stuff after the fact is always a

1065
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,560
nightmare when we started chronic

1066
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:05,879
culture I was very adamant about having

1067
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:07,320
number one a good bookkeeper number two

1068
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,519
a really great lawyer who could help us

1069
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:11,240
with the setup and you know it's all

1070
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:13,000
been set up super well with the

1071
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:14,919
trademark and everything so feeling

1072
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,760

00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:52,079
was like based around the final weekend

1092
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:53,799
of the Grateful Dead we got like a a

1093
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,720
suite at the concert for the last day

1094
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:57,280
and uh had a bunch of really cool people

1095
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:59,078
there so we filmed like a really cool

1096
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,000
documentary on it and we're going to uh

1097
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:04,079
do a little uh a viewing party at a

1098
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,960
theater that's smoke friendly in San

1099
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,519
Francisco oh wow uh coming up here in

1100
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:10,679
November yeah I was about 20 feet from

1101
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:12,239
the stage all three days oh nice I've

1102
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:14,799
actually never been to a Grateful Dead

1103
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:15,959
show so was a super trip and uh I really

1104
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,560
company isn't quite grateful that but

1105
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:20,559
it's still as as close as you can get of

1106
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:22,759
an experience you did you have a good

1107
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:24,358
time oh yeah I had a great time I had a

1108
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:26,400
great time and we were also in a suite

1109
00:36:24,358 --> 00:36:28,000
which um helped a little so yeah Ryan

1110
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,079
are producer he he was there one of the

1111
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,519
nights we we had a great time but

1112
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:34,280
literally if you're 20 ft from the stage

1113
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:35,960
getting back there is almost near

1114
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,800
impossible so you have to stay if you

1115
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,559
get there from the time the show starts

1116
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,760
till the time that the show's over if

1117
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:44,279
you want to stay in that same spot sure

1118
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,640
so yeah lots I really like the uh the

1119
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,839
Drone show they did at the end that was

1120
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:48,480
pretty cool was pretty trippy that was

1121
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:49,799
really trippy I'm sure everybody was

1122
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,838
peeking right when that was all

1123
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,960
happening I most people have never I've

1124
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:55,358
never even seen anything like that sure

1125
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:57,838
yeah and now they're doing it all the

1126
00:36:55,358 --> 00:36:59,480
time too yeah now the GI games they have

1127
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:01,559
it and stuff like that so yeah really

1128
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:03,920
cool yeah so as far as genetics let's

1129
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:06,199
let's dive into some uh genetic talk

1130
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,079
about popular genetics and the stuff

1131
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:09,838
going around what's your opinion all all

1132
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,920
the new stuff coming out what do you

1133
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:13,960
think is going to happen with the market

1134
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:17,039
uh let let's go into like some of the do

1135
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:18,280
stuff because I'm a big fan of rs11 and

1136
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:19,880
zope and all these things I think

1137
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:21,960
they're getting bred into a lot of

1138
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:24,519
different crosses now too I'm excited to

1139
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:26,760
see that I mean you know rs11 I've seen

1140
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:28,480
a few good representations of that yeah

1141
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:31,319
I've grown it myself I think it's a

1142
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:33,039
little bit harder and more finicky the Z

1143
00:37:31,318 --> 00:37:34,838
Z's my favorite one that's actually been

1144
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:36,400
out the past couple years which is like

1145
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:38,199
if that's the where the new wave is

1146
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:42,119
going yeah I've had some incredible

1147
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:43,759
batches of Z me too um so I I really we

1148
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:45,640
were doing this I helped do a breeding

1149
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,520
project about a year and a half ago uh

1150
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:49,440
with my friend uh straight flame he did

1151
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:50,960
the the Cherry cush crosses and I was

1152
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,720
trying to find some Z to cross into it

1153
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,519
we we couldn't make it happen but I

1154
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:56,559
finally got a hold of it and you know

1155
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:58,400
just me and some some friends at a small

1156
00:37:56,559 --> 00:37:59,639
Garden are growing it and yeah uh we

1157
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,079
like it it's cool I mean I just think it

1158
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:03,239
tastes great I think it it has the look

1159
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:05,480
it has the taste uh I'm I'm super

1160
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:07,000
excited to start seeing some of those

1161
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:09,318
you know I think it's less finicky than

1162
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,119
like rs1 because yeah I'll be honest the

1163
00:38:09,318 --> 00:38:13,039
original batches of rs1 that were coming

1164
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,480
out were [ __ ] super fire some of the

1165
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:17,800
best weed I've ever seen in my whole

1166
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:20,800
life as far as they took the time to

1167
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:22,440
grade every single bud in the bags that

1168
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,960
that were going around and this is

1169
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:27,159
before like it hit the whole recck scene

1170
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,480
before they sold the Clone and now

1171
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:30,318
yeah this was way before this was when

1172
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,119
the original batches were coming out you

1173
00:38:30,318 --> 00:38:35,079
open the bag and it almost had like a

1174
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:37,838
light pink tint to it and it smelled

1175
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:39,720
like like uh you know it smelled like

1176
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:42,279
ice cream a little bit but like it

1177
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:43,719
smelled sherbety ice creamish like you

1178
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,280
were coming right out of you know like

1179
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:47,279
it smelled like a Cold Stone when you

1180
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:50,119
open the B and and the buds were a

1181
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,160
little bit gassy but like it had the

1182
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:54,039
perfect shape they grated everything it

1183
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:55,719
was the some of the most amazing stuff

1184
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:57,519
and it kind of changed I think we were

1185
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:59,919
going to we going stagnant with all the

1186
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:02,920
gelato stuff and then that popped sure

1187
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:04,720
so it was really interesting I I I only

1188
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,240
saw a few of those packs from the early

1189
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:07,480
days but then most of the stuff I saw

1190
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:08,799
was out of the commercial production

1191
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,559
facilities and they weren't the same

1192
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,240
weren't great and even the Z like I've

1193
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:16,279
seen lately some Z that's been all right

1194
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:18,358
but I you know as you know as we were

1195
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,680
talking about you know you know it's

1196
00:39:18,358 --> 00:39:21,880
it's on the cultivator you know their

1197
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:23,759
inputs how they do it I mean not every

1198
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:26,559
you know a lot of a lot of these bigger

1199
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,760
grows you know see what's been coming

1200
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:29,920
down from the culture I think you know

1201
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,319
just because you have good genetics

1202
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,639
doesn't mean it's going to come out good

1203
00:39:31,318 --> 00:39:34,039
of course not and I think a lot of you

1204
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:35,838
know it's important because it's the

1205
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:37,400
starting point right so if you don't

1206
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:39,400
have good genetics you're definitely not

1207
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,599
going to have good wheat but just

1208
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,760
because you have good genetics doesn't

1209
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:45,559
mean it doesn't guarantee anything uh

1210
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,599
but La if we talk about Z coming out of

1211
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:49,880
La I was seeing some Z coming out of La

1212
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:51,240
that was ridiculous nice you know and

1213
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:53,240
that that was sticky that was pretty

1214
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:54,879
sticky actually I saw some pretty sticky

1215
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:57,439
zap you know when it did you see like

1216
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,160
some of the wizard treat basss and stuff

1217
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,559
some of probably one of the ones that

1218
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:04,239
were looking like that good yeah yeah

1219
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:05,838
I've I I've i' I've been starting again

1220
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:09,439
again I've been starting to see a lot of

1221
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:11,838
it recently uh and some hits and misses

1222
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:14,599
but I'm super excited I've seen a few of

1223
00:40:11,838 --> 00:40:16,279
the um of the crosses uh you know from

1224
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:19,318
Dio I've seen that to start to come out

1225
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:21,000
and a friend of mine was doing some uh

1226
00:40:19,318 --> 00:40:23,279
you know runs for him and seeing some of

1227
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,639
it and some of it was they're just all

1228
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,440
different sorts of smells and things

1229
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:29,279
coming out um you know di does a really

1230
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:31,119
good job of just divers and working with

1231
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,440
the plant you know I think he's really

1232
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:35,039
passionate about it really cares about

1233
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:36,318
it and you know money money comes when

1234
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:37,920
you're passionate about things and I

1235
00:40:36,318 --> 00:40:40,159
think that's kind of how he rolls for

1236
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,920
sure yeah yeah I think that's the best

1237
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:44,000
way to approach life in general is do

1238
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,400
whatever you're passionate about sure

1239
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,920
yeah I mean what are what are I mean

1240
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,400
what are you seeing as far as like the

1241
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,119
next wave of flavors because I mean

1242
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,838
obviously there's you know the candy the

1243
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:53,760
candy which I get dude don't get me

1244
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:55,440
wrong man I like smoking that stuff hey

1245
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,920
we were looking at piff and we were

1246
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,720
looking at black Cub ha just a little

1247
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:02,920
bit ago we were and I mean I like that

1248
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:04,559
stuff I think it serves a purpose it has

1249
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:06,760
its place I don't know on a commercial

1250
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:08,400
level I don't know about it but like I

1251
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:10,079
get excited about that stuff of course I

1252
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,480
get excited about bringing back some of

1253
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,160
the old things but I I believe blending

1254
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:17,318
the old with the new I think a lot more

1255
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:19,118
of that's going to go on I mean I think

1256
00:41:17,318 --> 00:41:20,519
we need to get out of the gelato phase

1257
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:23,079
because what's happened is we've really

1258
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:25,079
bottlenecked ourselves into these gelato

1259
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:26,640
crosses and not that there's anything

1260
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:28,880
wrong with the gelato crosses it's

1261
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:30,519
what's popular right now but I think we

1262
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,119
need to break away from that a little

1263
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:34,519
bit and get into some of the other

1264
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:36,000
flavors cuz cannabis is so diverse it's

1265
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:38,159
more diverse than any other plant on the

1266
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,159
planet sure as far as cultivated plants

1267
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:42,799
but the the market isn't necessarily the

1268
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:44,480
market isn't as diverse as the the plant

1269
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,039
is and so there's all these other

1270
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,519
different directions we could go I would

1271
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:48,719
love to get into more of the Savory

1272
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:50,440
stuff a little bit even though I like

1273
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:52,039
Skittles I have no problem with the

1274
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:54,440
candy and the desserts and all that

1275
00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:57,159
stuff but I do like some of the Savory I

1276
00:41:54,440 --> 00:42:00,079
do like some of the real headyy stuff

1277
00:41:57,159 --> 00:42:02,399
too I'd love to find some good OG yeah I

1278
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:04,359
mean the only good OG that I've seen in

1279
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,720
the past few years was the I'll give it

1280
00:42:04,358 --> 00:42:07,639
to the elephant's growth although it's

1281
00:42:05,719 --> 00:42:10,719
super expensive I mean it was some

1282
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:12,960
really good svog yeah so Brian from

1283
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:14,919

feel like OG is one of those ones that

1293
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:34,159

feel about like chem 91 and Sour Diesel

and we might not see these things a lot

1298
00:42:40,838 --> 00:42:44,039
but what we will see is these

1299
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:46,039
Expressions popping up with new crosses

1300
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:48,279
and new genetics and that's kind of what

1301

bring it to the dispensaries in San

1360
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:00,598
Francisco because I think it would sell

1361
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:03,079
really well well you need the people who

1362

1365
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:11,760
I and I understand I mean again it's

1366
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,760
like with where the market is at right

1367
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,400
now it's pretty interesting I think with

1368
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,079
where everything is going it's pretty

1369
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,559
interesting I've definitely you know

1370
00:45:17,079 --> 00:45:20,240
talked to a lot of friends lately who

1371
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:21,960
are getting super discouraged I mean me

1372
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:24,399
and you were having that conversation

1373
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:26,000
but you know I I'm just like you I'm you

1374
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,760
know I'm kind of I'm feeling pretty

1375
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,440
optimistic about it and it's kind of

1376
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,040
just like let's just keep going forward

1377
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,599
and let's just I'm a fighter you're a

1378
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:35,519
fighter yeah well you know we were

1379
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:37,200
talking earlier that probably together

1380
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:39,400
if we had a restaurant we could make

1381
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:40,838
enough money to be happy yeah right but

1382
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:42,960
I I'm doing cannabis because I love

1383
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:44,480
cannabis you know I I like cooking too

1384
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,199
but it's different I feel like being

1385
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:50,039
part of this special thing that we're a

1386
00:45:47,199 --> 00:45:51,879
part of this industry yeah we're in this

1387
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:53,318
infancy and we're in this special time

1388
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:54,640
and it's never going to be like this

1389
00:45:53,318 --> 00:45:56,639
again yeah you know we've gone through

1390
00:45:54,639 --> 00:45:58,279
these phases but'll this phase it'll

1391
00:45:56,639 --> 00:45:59,400
never be quite like this again it'll be

1392
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:01,800
different there'll be different phases

1393
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:03,599
it's going to be around but being part

1394
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,079
of something so much bigger than we are

1395
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:06,800
I mean that's what's special about it

1396
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:08,119
that's that's what keeps me fighting I

1397
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,640
talked to my friend and he puts it

1398
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:11,838
pretty eloquently he says we're like in

1399
00:46:09,639 --> 00:46:14,400
the bottom of the second man still got a

1400
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:15,960
long way to go and you know obviously

1401
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,599
I've you know I've been with different

1402
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:20,039
companies I've been hit down but you

1403
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:21,480
know I always get back up and you know

1404
00:46:20,039 --> 00:46:23,039
I'm not going anywhere this is what I

1405
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:24,719
want to do this is what I'm passionate

1406
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:26,719
about hey we're Giants fans so we

1407
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:27,799
understand torture that's what all that

1408
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:29,558
you know what I mean but we had some

1409
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:30,800
good good years with the Giants like I

1410
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:32,599
mean and same thing with cannabis we've

1411
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,760
had good years and this is a bad year

1412
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:36,440
maybe for a lot of people I mean but if

1413
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:38,160
you look at coid was a really good year

1414
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:40,800
for most of the people in the industry

1415
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:43,480
so we're not so far off from that time

1416
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:45,760
and everything you know that that saying

1417
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:48,000
this two shall pass you know I was told

1418
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:50,040
that a lot by my father as a kid but he

1419
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,280
didn't tell me about the the the good

1420
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:55,239
times this two Shall Pass sure so it's a

1421
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,960
trip cuz I feel like everything goes

1422
00:46:55,239 --> 00:46:58,199
through waves and we're going to have

1423
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,800
more good times and we're going to have

1424
00:46:58,199 --> 00:47:01,598
more bad times and that's just how life

1425
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,960
is and how life works out but it's all

1426
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:05,559
about appreciating what we have in the

1427
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:07,800
moment and it's not just weed man it's

1428
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:10,079
everything it's everything it's cyclical

1429
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:12,160
man everything's cyclical and you know

1430
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:14,640

1433
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:21,200

1434
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:22,760

1435

1439
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,519
know a lot of people I think in this

1440
00:47:30,838 --> 00:47:34,159
industry to where you know like I was

1441
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:35,440
saying oh where's the OG it's like oh

1442
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:37,199
you found it you know you know where it

1443
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:39,000
is we can find it you know not

1444
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:41,078
everybody's as blessed and as fortunate

1445
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,280
enough to be able to do that so totally

1446
00:47:41,079 --> 00:47:45,880
um you know we just got to keep going so

1447
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:48,359
in five years where do you see yourself

1448
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:50,880
oh man what a loaded question in five

1449
00:47:48,358 --> 00:47:53,400
years yeah 100% so want to be here doing

1450
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,760
what I love doing sure but um you know I

1451
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:57,160
definitely see I definitely see you you

1452
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,839
know getting back into the consumer

1453
00:47:57,159 --> 00:48:02,440
package Goods area you know you know we

1454
00:47:59,838 --> 00:48:03,599
started chronic culture you know I spent

1455
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:05,480
many years you know working with the

1456
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:06,960
dispensaries getting into the stores I

1457
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:08,358
think that's something that we're in the

1458
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,599
next couple years you know going to

1459
00:48:08,358 --> 00:48:11,318
really start going back to probably

1460
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:13,039
within the next year uh really start

1461
00:48:11,318 --> 00:48:14,920
getting back into and you know I'd like

1462
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:16,440
to see you know taking it multi-state

1463
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:17,800
and being able to bring it to a couple

1464
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,240
different places being able to bring the

1465
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:21,039
events being able to bring the brands

1466
00:48:19,239 --> 00:48:22,719
into some of those places you know in

1467
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:24,199
five years you know I always never

1468
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:25,879
really thought of you know when I

1469
00:48:24,199 --> 00:48:27,199
started gold till it was like hey you

1470
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:28,480
know what's your exit plan and I'm like

1471
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:30,558
I don't really have one because I want

1472
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:32,280
to continue to do that and if you ask me

1473
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:33,920
now like you know I think a little bit

1474
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,240
more about an exit plan but in five

1475
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,800
years you know I really just want to

1476
00:48:35,239 --> 00:48:38,519
keep building this up and really just

1477
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,240
keep moving the culture and Industry

1478
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:42,039
forward I feel like you'd be such a good

1479
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:43,799
event planner for big cannabis events

1480
00:48:42,039 --> 00:48:45,880
and there's such a need for good

1481
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:47,960
cannabis events because the industry's

1482
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:49,920
grown significantly and it keeps growing

1483
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:52,039
but there's not a lot of amaz amazing

1484
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,838
events you're doing the trans Bay you

1485
00:48:52,039 --> 00:48:55,798
know I think Emerald cup is great we we

1486
00:48:53,838 --> 00:48:57,400
have a handful of really good events but

1487
00:48:55,798 --> 00:48:59,079
like there's always room for more yeah I

1488
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,920
mean I'd love to get more into that you

1489
00:48:59,079 --> 00:49:02,519
know I definitely really miss working

1490
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:05,318
with the plant though yeah I mean I'm

1491
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:07,079
not like I don't I don't have a grow um

1492
00:49:05,318 --> 00:49:08,920
which you you know makes me a little

1493
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:10,440
anxious because I've always had one

1494
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:12,680
right so you know I'm being able to I

1495
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:14,798
think work work I've I always had such a

1496
00:49:12,679 --> 00:49:16,519
love for genetics so being able to work

1497
00:49:14,798 --> 00:49:18,199
on that type of stuff with you know my

1498
00:49:16,519 --> 00:49:20,119
friends and you know my time that I had

1499
00:49:18,199 --> 00:49:21,719
with compound and working with them and

1500
00:49:20,119 --> 00:49:24,960
I learned so much that's where we met

1501
00:49:21,719 --> 00:49:26,639
that's where where met uh and you know

1502
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,960
I've just learned so much since then and

1503
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:30,639
you know I'm really I I think you know

1504
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:32,639
if I really look at it I don't think I

1505
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:34,679
want to have another license to where

1506
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:36,159
I'm like having a facility but I'd

1507
00:49:34,679 --> 00:49:38,598
really love to work with a lot of

1508
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:40,719
talented Growers and friends that I know

1509
00:49:38,599 --> 00:49:42,318
right and work with them to develop

1510
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:43,838
genetics and just kind of get together

1511
00:49:42,318 --> 00:49:46,199
to kind of grow some stuff and have a

1512
00:49:43,838 --> 00:49:48,440
good time um that's kind of what I'm

1513
00:49:46,199 --> 00:49:50,558
missing and I think where I really you

1514
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:52,920
know I'm gonna go forward towards

1515
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:54,519
genetics is fun there there's a fun side

1516
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:58,200
of it there's like the seed production

1517
00:49:54,519 --> 00:49:59,519
and the you know the production side of

1518
00:49:58,199 --> 00:50:01,159
it and then there's the fun part like

1519
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:02,599
the feno hunting if you really like weed

1520
00:50:01,159 --> 00:50:03,920
feno hunting is where it's at feno

1521
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:05,559
hunting is where it's going through

1522
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,039
different selections and then you know

1523
00:50:05,559 --> 00:50:08,640
seeing things as you grow them out

1524
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:10,880
multiple times seeing how they change

1525
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:13,318
like that's that's fun stuff oh it's

1526
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,960
great yeah and you know I got to be I've

1527
00:50:13,318 --> 00:50:17,519
been a part of so many really great

1528
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:19,159
pheno hunts in the last few years yeah

1529
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:20,719
uh you know we at Chronic culture a lot

1530
00:50:19,159 --> 00:50:22,159
of people come down bring us a bunch of

1531
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:24,078
different stuff to take a look at it too

1532
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:26,159
so super fortunate to get to look at a

1533
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:28,160
bunch of different stuff yeah um it's

1534
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:30,519
really interesting you know to see a lot

1535
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:31,879
of the Breeders that you know have been

1536
00:50:30,519 --> 00:50:34,358
coming through as well as the people

1537
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:36,640
that have been growing their gear uh you

1538
00:50:34,358 --> 00:50:38,558
know I it there's a lot more diversity

1539
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:41,159
and a lot more you know people doing

1540
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:43,319
seeds now obviously I think you know a

1541
00:50:41,159 --> 00:50:44,879
lot of them probably not in the best way

1542
00:50:43,318 --> 00:50:46,719
but some of them are really taking the

1543
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,838
time to you know work on work on the

1544
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:50,519
line and really make sure that it's you

1545
00:50:48,838 --> 00:50:53,599
know up to enough for people to be able

1546
00:50:50,519 --> 00:50:55,519
to you know work with right um but you

1547
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:57,000
know a there's definitely a lot of

1548
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:58,480
people and I've seen it I mean I'm

1549
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,119
guilty of it too I mean I've made seeds

1550
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:02,240
in you know my basement and just been

1551
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:04,160
like hey you know let's see what happens

1552
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:06,399
so but like you know you know it doesn't

1553
00:51:04,159 --> 00:51:08,440
always work out great no it doesn't

1554
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:11,880
always work out great but I

1555
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:14,079
think I'm I'm a big fan of everybody

1556
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:15,480
making seeds and and breeding and I but

1557
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:17,200
I think the first thing is learn how to

1558
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:18,358
be a good grower and learn how to grow

1559
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:20,399
properly because you need to make the

1560
00:51:18,358 --> 00:51:21,519
plant Express so if you plan on doing

1561
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,838
real breeding and you're doing real

1562
00:51:21,519 --> 00:51:24,480
pheno hunting at the end of the day you

1563
00:51:22,838 --> 00:51:26,679
got to be a good grower you know it's

1564
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:29,039
interesting I have a a friend of mine

1565
00:51:26,679 --> 00:51:31,399
that you know has asked me to learn

1566
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:32,798
they're like hey can I can can I can I

1567
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:35,519
grow in my basement you teach me how to

1568
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:36,838
do it and I'm like yeah I can but like

1569
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:38,719
you know have you spent the right money

1570
00:51:36,838 --> 00:51:41,199
to get your basement all put together

1571
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:43,358
because I was like you know I think I'll

1572
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:45,798
with growing growing is easy if you have

1573
00:51:43,358 --> 00:51:48,039
the correct setup and you know easier

1574
00:51:45,798 --> 00:51:51,079
easier pardon me it's not easy you're

1575
00:51:48,039 --> 00:51:52,400
totally right it's easier you know there

1576
00:51:51,079 --> 00:51:54,079
it's just like having good genetics if

1577
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,760
you don't have it in the beginning it

1578
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:58,760
makes it a lot harder and and you know

1579
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:00,319
there's a lot there's rules to follow by

1580
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:02,160
and the first one you do is genetics

1581
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:05,079
genetics genetics right have the right

1582
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:07,558
ones that work uh that are stable that

1583
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:09,280
work within in the environment and what

1584
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:12,319
you have because you know you might have

1585
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:14,200
a cut that works in your basement versus

1586
00:52:12,318 --> 00:52:17,079
somebody who has a cut that's in their

1587
00:52:14,199 --> 00:52:18,480
tent that doesn't work as well yeah so

1588
00:52:17,079 --> 00:52:20,240
well and I think a lot of Growers want

1589
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:22,240
to just grow a different different

1590
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:23,798
cultivar every time they grow they get

1591
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:25,479
clones of this clones of that but

1592
00:52:23,798 --> 00:52:26,639
there's something to be said for the guy

1593
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:29,000
that have been growing the same thing

1594
00:52:26,639 --> 00:52:30,920
for three years or five years and they

1595
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,920
just keep on making it better each time

1596
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:36,400
you know I'm not one of those yeah but I

1597
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:38,079
like I mean I think a lot of it is I

1598
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,559
think there are some Staples that yes we

1599
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:42,160
keep around that we do that with but I

1600
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:43,760
always am a fan of experimenting

1601
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:45,118
especially with the market everybody's

1602
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,480
always like what's new what's new what's

1603
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:50,960
new I think hence where we're looking at

1604
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:53,159
the the bag you know the crazy bag

1605
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:55,480
generation that happens

1606
00:52:53,159 --> 00:52:57,759
now yeah it's like literally just like

1607
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:59,119
Lemon Cherry aut with like the best bag

1608
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:01,480
I have friends who run dispensaries and

1609
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:03,318
they're literally like this one sold out

1610
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:05,639
I was like why they're like cuz it just

1611
00:53:03,318 --> 00:53:08,519
had the best bag so I mean that

1612
00:53:05,639 --> 00:53:10,159
definitely does say something you know

1613
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:12,079
and that's part of marketing and you

1614
00:53:10,159 --> 00:53:14,039
know part of cannabis now is not just

1615
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:15,440
you know what's in the bag personally I

1616
00:53:14,039 --> 00:53:18,159
think that's the most important thing

1617
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:20,039
yeah but you know again like I said

1618
00:53:18,159 --> 00:53:21,440
earlier if you can get people to order

1619
00:53:20,039 --> 00:53:22,759
your product three times you've

1620
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,159
succeeded because they'll just keep

1621
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:25,880
ordering it and ordering it well I think

1622
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:28,679
there's a good recipe that you have to

1623
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:30,358
have a good packaging good marketing and

1624
00:53:28,679 --> 00:53:32,118
a good product to back because we saw

1625
00:53:30,358 --> 00:53:34,039
all these celebrities I mean you got to

1626
00:53:32,119 --> 00:53:37,720
get NS in on

1627
00:53:34,039 --> 00:53:40,599
this I'm good I'm good but but I think

1628
00:53:37,719 --> 00:53:42,919
having the celebrity is one aspect of it

1629
00:53:40,599 --> 00:53:44,640
but really you know you got your

1630
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:46,039
packaging that people see on the Shelf

1631
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:47,920
but also when they open it where they

1632
00:53:46,039 --> 00:53:50,519
come back and they buy it again that's

1633
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:51,720
exactly of course right so no matter how

1634
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:52,960
good the packaging is if they're not

1635
00:53:51,719 --> 00:53:54,759
going to come back and what are you

1636
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:57,079
doing you know it's not worth it exactly

1637
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:58,720
you can get somebody to pick I mean I've

1638
00:53:57,079 --> 00:54:00,000
seen a few of these celebrity Brands

1639
00:53:58,719 --> 00:54:02,679
where they do these big launches they

1640
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,199
have a lot of PR and oh wow the product

1641
00:54:02,679 --> 00:54:07,279
sells out really quick yeah I was

1642
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:10,159
working with the company yeah not so

1643
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:12,440
long ago and we kind of quit working

1644
00:54:10,159 --> 00:54:13,879
together because they the price point

1645
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:16,039
wasn't right they were worried about

1646
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:17,358
getting the cheapest product course and

1647
00:54:16,039 --> 00:54:18,679
I didn't want to associate myself I've

1648
00:54:17,358 --> 00:54:20,440
talked to a few of them and they're

1649
00:54:18,679 --> 00:54:21,960
always like Hey we're trying to sell $30

1650
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:25,400
Ace but we're trying to buy the weed for

1651
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:26,639
,000 they wanted light for nothing and

1652
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:28,358
then just put it that because because

1653
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:30,318
the brand was going to be so big and

1654
00:54:28,358 --> 00:54:32,159
it's like that there's no and maybe

1655
00:54:30,318 --> 00:54:33,880
there is truth to the brand will be so

1656
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:35,838
big initially you might get this huge

1657
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:37,119
launch and that's great but if somebody

1658
00:54:35,838 --> 00:54:38,639
buys it and they're not going to buy it

1659
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:40,680
again you're not going to get that

1660
00:54:38,639 --> 00:54:42,318
repeat sale and well it's price right

1661
00:54:40,679 --> 00:54:43,960
now it's price point in THC content

1662
00:54:42,318 --> 00:54:45,599
unfortunately you know branding is

1663
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:47,039
obviously important but what are your

1664
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:48,480
thoughts about the THC content I mean

1665
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:49,960
it's [ __ ] I mean I think you know

1666
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,880
anybody who comes on this podcast that

1667
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:52,960
you're probably going to ask unless they

1668
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:54,599
you I don't think you're going to bring

1669
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,119
anybody on here that wouldn't say that

1670
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:58,200
right it's all it's all [ __ ] it's

1671
00:54:56,119 --> 00:55:00,798
all [ __ ] and it's and and literally

1672
00:54:58,199 --> 00:55:03,279
it it and what really sucks is I see a

1673
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:05,119
lot of extremely talented Growers who

1674
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:07,000
are growing right now and they have they

1675
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:08,440
pick their genetics and I've literally

1676
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,679
been there and I've seen their huge feno

1677
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:14,880
hunts and I've seen some amazing stuff

1678
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:17,159
that tests at 25 but this one tests at

1679
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,440
35 and automatically they have to cut

1680
00:55:17,159 --> 00:55:19,598
that one and go there and that's just

1681
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:23,039
what they have to do to save their

1682
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:26,599
business which look I understand but

1683
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:28,119
it's all about education and you know

1684
00:55:26,599 --> 00:55:30,240
this this Topic's come up many times

1685
00:55:28,119 --> 00:55:33,798
with many people yeah you know but it's

1686
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:35,279
on us to kind of educate and I think

1687
00:55:33,798 --> 00:55:36,599
it's mainly like with the more educated

1688
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,960
Market though I think that that'll

1689
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:39,838
change a little bit I mean you look at

1690
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:41,838
Skittles Skittles is super popular super

1691
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:43,639
amazing doesn't test super high test

1692
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:45,199
high enough but it doesn't test

1693
00:55:43,639 --> 00:55:46,879
typically above 30 although I've seen

1694
00:55:45,199 --> 00:55:48,679
test around yeah but I mean let's talk

1695
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,960
about the wre Market is Skittle super

1696
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:53,440
popular in the rec in the wck market I

1697
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:55,920
don't know super popular to me because I

1698
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:57,039
like it great but I mean I mean there's

1699
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,400
literally James we're talking about two

1700
00:55:57,039 --> 00:55:59,880
different things here absolutely I mean

1701
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,838
it literally something that I like as

1702
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:03,920
opposed to what the world likes on the

1703
00:56:01,838 --> 00:56:06,279
shelves dispensaries I love Skittles and

1704
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:08,000
I smoke the [ __ ] out of it but if you

1705
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:10,000
look are there a lot of people putting

1706
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,798
Skittles in a bag straight Skittles some

1707
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,039
people yeah you know Fruitland does a

1708
00:56:11,798 --> 00:56:15,960
really good job with you you introduced

1709
00:56:14,039 --> 00:56:17,240
me to them actually to yeah they do a

1710
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:18,720
really good job with their SK they do

1711
00:56:17,239 --> 00:56:21,159
and a lot of it's just I think depending

1712
00:56:18,719 --> 00:56:22,879
on how where well their's tests and how

1713
00:56:21,159 --> 00:56:24,159
well your brand is and how popular you

1714
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,680
can make it I've seen a lot of people

1715
00:56:24,159 --> 00:56:27,078
doing the Skittles es that have been

1716
00:56:25,679 --> 00:56:29,399
super good I do but I don't like Diet

1717
00:56:27,079 --> 00:56:31,960
Skittles so it's got to you know what I

1718
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:33,838
mean I go back to that but well now in

1719
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:36,358
2027 we won't even be able to get

1720
00:56:33,838 --> 00:56:39,440
Skittles right

1721
00:56:36,358 --> 00:56:42,159
a the candy now either they changed the

1722
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:43,519
name to Z luckily exactly but but you

1723
00:56:42,159 --> 00:56:45,759
know it's funny because like archive has

1724
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:47,798
some good Skittle crosses and there are

1725
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:49,839
good you know the rainbow belts 2.0 is

1726
00:56:47,798 --> 00:56:52,759
pretty good but it's not the most Skitty

1727
00:56:49,838 --> 00:56:54,038
but it's really complex it's candy it's

1728
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:57,359
it's not the most Skitty and they have

1729
00:56:54,039 --> 00:56:59,440
the 3.0 now I don't know if you is I

1730
00:56:57,358 --> 00:57:01,519
haven't had it yet my one buddy uh

1731
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:03,798

saying you love moonbo whether you know

1737
00:57:12,039 --> 00:57:17,319

1739
00:57:17,318 --> 00:57:23,239
