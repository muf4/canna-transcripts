and really how you educate the the

29
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,640
people out there it's really important

30
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,560
especially for small farmers like us and

31
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,879
so really appreciate you having us on

32
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,320
yeah you guys are just killing it up in

33
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,640
Humble and you've been winning Emerald

34
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:24,679
cups I have been but now I'm battling

35
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,640
against this guy you know so which you

36
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,320
know Emerald cup does a lot for us small

37
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,920
farms just like you having us on this

38
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,639
show you know we have to be represent

39
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,079
presented because you know we don't have

40
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,359
big advertisements and marketing and so

41
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:37,239
all this it's really important for Our

42
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,519
Brands yeah well you guys are like

43
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:41,478
forming the humble Voltron right now

44
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:45,039
combining efforts and doing some genetic

45
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:46,718
work together we are you know it's uh I

46
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,479
mean I guess we might as well get into

47
00:01:46,718 --> 00:01:51,158
now but it's just uh what we're figuring

48
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:53,519
out it's really really important to

49
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:56,359
separate ourselves from you know these

50
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:59,280
other brands and by doing that it's you

51
00:01:56,359 --> 00:02:01,200
know having our own strains right yeah

52
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,280
and and you know think just as as

53
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,159
important it is to highlight our Legacy

54
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,840
strains and um really having a partner

55
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,000
to work with that you can trust right

56
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,520
because that's key to keeping those

57
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,318
genetics in house and when I'm giving

58
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,120
you know the white Thorn Rose to Jason

59
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:19,560
who shares it with his dad to do these

60
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,400
breeding projects it's really nice to

61
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,280
not have to worry about it walking away

62
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,400
and then the world having it because

63
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,080
that's kind of what's unique to to our

64
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,200
Farms up there you know the small

65
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,160
farmers don't have a whole lot to Pivot

66
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:33,318
on but those Legacy genetics or

67
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:35,359
something special yeah and there's a

68
00:02:33,318 --> 00:02:37,119
handful of them left up there that you

69
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,200
can only get up in Humble that have been

70
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,959
around forever that haven't really made

71
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:42,679
it to the masses yeah I mean they're

72
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,479
pretty you know there's like everybody

73
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,959
asks sativa you know Indica at this

74
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:49,840
point a lot of that been mixed there's a

75
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,400
lot of hybrids but back to that strain

76
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,479
um so you know I came up you know out

77
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,239
the Lance and he has a white Thorn Rose

78
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,318
and we've been working together me and

79
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,039
Johnny you know it it's such a

80
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:01,919
complicated you know the whole whole

81
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:03,158
weed world it's it's really hard to

82
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,119
figure out so it's really nice to have

83
00:03:03,158 --> 00:03:07,479
somebody to work with through this and

84
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,439
uh you know we we cross these strains

85
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:11,158
this year and you never know what you're

86
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:13,439
going to get you know you you cross

87
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:15,598
strains there's a lottery involved yeah

88
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:18,120
there's a lottery and so far I mean we

89
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:20,439
found multiple a few that are just

90
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,959
mind-blowing yeah and so this is it's

91
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:23,639
it's just exciting for us it's like

92
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,199
we've been growing weed our whole lives

93
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:28,919
yeah and with that you know it's it's

94
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:30,158
you kind of you get not bored but yeah

95
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:31,639
you get you know certain things if

96
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:33,400
you're just growing the same ice cream

97
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:35,518
cake over and over and over OG over and

98
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,840
over and over like what we did for years

99
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,959
gets boring so now we we we actually

100
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:44,239
have the trust of the consumers to grow

101
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:46,039
our own strains you know and so anyway

102
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,799
as we put these two strains together and

103
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:49,598
now we're going to have some magic you

104
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:51,879
know for all these consumers I'm fired

105
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:54,238
up yeah the Lance is really special too

106
00:03:51,878 --> 00:03:56,318
so you want to tell us about the Lance

107
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,719
um yeah the Lance is you know it's it's

108
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:02,119
a Green Lantern was it one that you know

109
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:05,639
was the first license Emerald cup um Su

110
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:08,079
grown uh competition you know and it won

111
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:10,359
and it I I had no idea I was scared

112
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:12,200

114
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:15,759
say whatever scar shitless all of a

115
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:17,159
sudden I was up on stage you know from

116
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:19,039
an outlaw hiding to all of a sudden

117
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,560
cameras in your face right we won with

118
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,040
that Green Lantern and continued the

119
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,879
next year just you know we did pretty

120
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,360
good we got three you know three out of

121
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:29,519
the top 10 and first with the Ridgeline

122
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,919
runs so they're two really good strains

123
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:33,599
and yeah crossed them and you know I

124
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:35,680
went through a bunch of feno hunting for

125
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,360
a year or so and picked this one that

126
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,240
was just amazing and I wasn't sure until

127
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,360
I actually got to smoke it when I smoked

128
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,400
it I'm like oh my gosh this is the one

129
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,000
and and it make it even more special you

130
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:49,319
know I still do my we we we're old

131
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,478
school we aren't really using the

132
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:55,159
high-tech you know I still Cross or make

133
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:57,240
crosses with my dad up in the hills you

134
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,439
know we literally have a mail and we

135
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,120
shake the pollen on the plants and we

136
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:03,839
feed hunt and so I did this with my dad

137
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,360
and came out with this strain that is

138
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:08,000
just it's special it's good for the

139
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,080
market you know it's checking all the

140
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,279
boxes in the market which is pretty hard

141
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,719
nowadays yeah you're you're competing

142
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:16,879
with the indoor market with a sungrown

143
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,000
product yeah yeah you know and you know

144
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:21,600
it's and as I've learned it's you know

145
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,079
with the sungrown I also do mix light

146
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,919
and then you know it's like

147
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:29,918
everyone that strain tastes different in

148
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:31,918
Under the Sun and Under The Lights it's

149
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:33,560
completely different so you know it's

150
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:36,478
it's yeah it's kind of hard to come up

151
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:39,000
with better I mean honestly it gets

152
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:41,279
bigger and it's the THC is higher and

153
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,959
it's stronger Under the Sun just pure

154
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:47,038
sungrown and under the mixed light it

155
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:49,399
the flavor the TPS pop way more wow so

156
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:51,759
it's it's really strange on how you know

157
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:53,439
as you know plants work different um

158
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,919
some are more indoor plants you know

159
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:57,959
some so I'd get strains from you know

160
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:00,318
other brands that are like they're more

161
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:01,918
indoor strains and and then I I'll try

162
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,680
them outside and it's just they don't

163
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:04,799
get these tiny little popcorn buds you

164
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,800
know every once in a while you get one

165
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,478
that loves the sun right well well tell

166
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,720
us a little bit about your system so you

167
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:14,000
do it in uh what what style Greenhouse

168
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,880
are you guys doing Greenhouse in um well

169
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,759
we just have I mean the mixed light I

170
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:20,879
mean regular like my Ridgeland Farms is

171
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:23,199
I mean we pull tart by hand there's not

172
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:25,079
a fan I mean it's old school you know

173
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,280
the sun's the light and that's it you

174
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:28,758
got the one lighter in the sky totally

175
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:32,239
and you know and then other one we you

176
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:34,000
know we have we have uh know lights in

177
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,918
there and you know it's also it's it's

178
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,478
old school it's not fancy you're saying

179
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:39,598
fo lights you're doing fo lights in

180
00:06:37,478 --> 00:06:41,159
there it's those fluence lights you know

181
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:44,759
the fluence and you know like I said

182
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,919
it's it's really not fancy we are I I go

183
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:49,000
to all these facilities including yours

184
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:51,439
I look around I'm like well we are old

185
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,560
school but you know the weed doesn't

186
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:55,160
matter they don't care the weed the

187
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,360
plant doesn't care yeah at the end of

188
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,800
the day the plant doesn't care and I

189
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,598
feel like what you put into it is what

190
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,240
you get out of it 100% so and experience

191
00:07:00,598 --> 00:07:03,918
plays a key role in that too and the

192
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,240
more times you've done it the repetition

193
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:08,120
man it it's huge yeah yeah I mean this

194
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,280
is what we do it's what we know yeah and

195
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,319
when you're passionate about it makes it

196
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:13,239
even better definitely let's dive into

197
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:15,720
the white Thorn Rose and let's get into

198
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:18,240
a little bit of the history of it yeah

199
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,360
you know um I really stumbled the prawn

200
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,720
the white Thorn Rose you know I I kind

201
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:26,439
of um took a different approach to a the

202
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,680
legal industry not really you know being

203
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:31,439
in the traditional market for 40 years

204
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,120
and then you know transferring over to

205
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:36,560
the the regulated market was really

206
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,399
weird like he was saying and um you know

207
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,199
initially started growing commercial

208
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:43,839
strains and then realized for a 5,000

209
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,360
squ foot sungrown cannabis farm in

210
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:48,158
southern humble really wasn't going to

211
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,680
amount to much and wasn't going to be

212
00:07:48,158 --> 00:07:53,360
the pathway forward to allow me to

213
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,720
continue doing what I love to do and um

214
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,400
that's when we started uh really

215
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,639
breeding to Australian I used to grow

216
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:01,279
with my mom when I was 10 and that

217
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:03,280
strain was called back then it was

218
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:06,198
called Froot Loops and changed the name

219
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:08,519
to Paradise punch and so in my mother's

220
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:13,598
honor we breed all the different

221
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:15,680
genetics to the paradise punch so um we

222
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:17,959
I got a a lemon OG from a really good

223
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,918
friend of mine that I respect and and

224
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:22,439
trust a lot and we bred that to the

225
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:25,120
paradise punch and ended up with we were

226
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:27,879
growing back with seeds then um when the

227
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,918
marketplace really allowed us and and uh

228
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:31,879
you know white Thorn Rose could look a

229
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:35,079
little bit different but we found two

230
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:38,240
different phenotypes of excuse me that

231
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:41,200
same cross um one we call Mom's weed and

232
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,759
one we called White Thorn Rose and you

233
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,759
know through Bell at at Heritage mesino

234
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:49,439
um really discovered that it was a

235
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:51,519
really good washer and really uplifted

236
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,880
that strain and it really at that point

237
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:57,519
took a life of its own this is maybe

238
00:08:53,879 --> 00:09:00,120
2018 and um it just started winning

239
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,440
Awards and um then I started working

240
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:06,078
with more manufacturers like Rosen Tech

241
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:08,760
and punch and ippy and you know they all

242
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:11,000
fell in love with it and um I'm not

243
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:13,240
really familiar with the the Rosen world

244
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,919
and stuff um but you know they're

245
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,879
educating me and and really found that

246
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:20,278
um especially last year it won four out

247
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:23,919
of five first places at the emerald cup

248
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:25,519
and yeah now we can only we we we don't

249
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:27,958
even have the ability to grow enough on

250
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,560
the farm and I grow 90% of the farm is

251
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:33,239
white Thorn Rose and wow I actually have

252
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:34,838
another Farm a guy I grew up with that's

253
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,759
actually growing white Thorn Rose for us

254
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,880
too just trying to get it to as many

255
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:40,838
people as we can and I I put a limited

256
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:43,639
amount in my own jars and the rest goes

257
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:45,360
to um you know rosin or hash holes or

258
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:47,240
whatever these manufacturers want to

259
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,839
create with it and some cool stuff

260
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:52,159
coming up yeah I just think it's really

261
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,920
special there's nothing quite like it we

262
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:57,958
had a creme Ros Skittles CR Ros from

263
00:09:54,919 --> 00:10:00,599
aici Auto times Skittles that uh my

264
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:03,759
friend Tim up in Seattle or he lived in

265
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,399
squim he lives in squim now but uh can

266
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:08,360
Organics and he gave me the cut and he

267
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,559
had the cut and he had grown flour of it

268
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,639
and I'd grown some flour of it it was

269
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:15,439
rosewater turps with it was like candy

270
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:17,000
rosewater turps and the first time I T

271
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,760
tried the white Thorn

272
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,879
Rose was the first time ever that I got

273
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:22,480
something that was close to it and I

274
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:25,439
feel like the white Thorn Rose is more

275
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,759
like flower petals you get the petals

276
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:32,440
and it is just like fresh rose petals

277
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:34,399
and it's sweet and it's complex and it

278
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,000
really checks the boxes as far as if you

279
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,159
like flavor and maybe it's not for

280
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,159
everybody but it's something that I love

281
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:41,240
you know it's something that I look

282
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:43,240
forward to getting access to and being

283
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,839
able to smoke every time I've got it

284
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,000
it's like I smoke it and then I'm sad

285
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,720
that it's gone I mean in this day and

286
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,759
age it's finding something that's

287
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,839
different and unique is just amazing

288
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:57,439
because there's so many strains I'd say

289
00:10:52,839 --> 00:11:00,440
80 to 90% of a similarity

290
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,360
with that or you get the you know or or

291
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,160
you have like the lemony you know what I

292
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,600
mean it's all so when you find something

293
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:09,039
like that it's like it sets itself aside

294
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,240
and then to have the flavor like I said

295
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:13,719
you could grow most strains you could

296
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:16,480
smell a strain El you do I like putting

297
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,440
in the grinder one twist smell it and

298
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,680
it's amazing yeah then when if you taste

299
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,600
it when you smoke it that's that's the

300
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:23,958
key it's hard to find that and it smokes

301
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,440
down to the roach like that too

302
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:27,359
absolutely that's what I noticed when I

303
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,639
first smoked it was all the way down

304
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,800
even after you pick up the roach and

305
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,519
it's been sitting day it still tastes

306
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:36,359
exactly almost like the first few hits

307
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:38,000
and it it it it's truly amazing and um

308
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:41,159
yeah I'm super excited to see where it

309
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,039
goes here uh yeah we got some little

310
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:45,600
cool projects in the works that haven't

311
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:48,278
been finalized but um really just

312
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,320
ultimately at the end of the day um for

313
00:11:48,278 --> 00:11:52,759
us it's it's about touching as many

314
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,320
people as possible it's not so much

315
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:57,399
about the money and I always say this

316
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,040
that money doesn't make people happy

317
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:00,759
it's really about those consumers it's

318
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:02,879
the first time in our life that we've

319
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:06,519
ever been able to share what we do for a

320
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:08,519
living with people and so in a weird way

321
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:11,000
we've needed some kind of validation

322
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:13,240
what we have been doing for so long is

323
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,198
really special and so it's those

324
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,440
consumers that we interact with that

325
00:12:15,198 --> 00:12:18,278
really give us something that we've been

326
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,839
missing for a long time yeah it's

327
00:12:18,278 --> 00:12:23,039
amazing with cannabis it kind of brings

328
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:25,519
us all together from people from all

329
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:27,278
walks of life that love the plant it's

330
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:30,078
like they it's like food in the same

331
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:32,360
sense and wine or

332
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:34,000
you know the social aspect of it is just

333
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,399
amazing you can take people that don't

334
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,799
even speak the same language and they

335
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,679
can Bond over cannabis how many people

336
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:42,559
have met in this last eight years since

337
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:44,278
this legalization I mean we're here

338
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:46,399
right now met you you know there's so

339
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:48,480
many different people that we've come

340
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,600
together because of the weed man it's

341
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,959
amazing so many really passionate people

342
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,000
and I feel like the people that are

343
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:56,319
really passionate are just you know they

344
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,839
love the plant and it's part of the life

345
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,079
that they live and the lifestyle that

346
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,839
they live it's it's not just based

347
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:04,719
around cannabis but cannabis is a big

348
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,120
part of it and I can only imagine you

349
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,240
know I always try to put myself in

350
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,198
somebody else's shoes and being a

351
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,000
consumer that maybe isn't as familiar

352
00:13:10,198 --> 00:13:15,958
with cannabis as we are and watching all

353
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,320
of us and all the people in the industry

354
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:20,518
running around really trying to educate

355
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,199
it must be really confusing for them

356
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:24,679
like how do you know who's real and

357
00:13:22,198 --> 00:13:27,359
who's not and what's real and what's

358
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:30,479
true and what's a lie and what's Money

359
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,240
Motivated and and what's authentic it's

360
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,480
I just imagine it's pretty pretty tough

361
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,759
but I think they're starting to figure

362
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,278
out what the difference is and I think

363
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:40,240
they're resonating to a lot of small

364
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:41,399
farmers in the Emerald Triangle I've

365
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,639
been getting a lot of that lately I've

366
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:44,039
been getting hit up by a lot of

367
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,480
different dispensaries they want to

368
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:48,360
carry craft Legacy Brands and that I

369
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,759
mean it means so much because it's like

370
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,959
you know we're I'm actually take pride

371
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:55,320
that we probably have the smallest grows

372
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:57,039
in all of California yet Our Brands are

373
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,320
known and people know us and people want

374
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:01,719
to smoke our herb you know right that

375
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,240
alone is like it feels pretty good yeah

376
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,160
I mean I can't wait for interstate

377
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:09,000
commerce so people in other states will

378
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:11,759
be able to try humble flower and I feel

379
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,039
like humble is so important to the rest

380
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:15,759
of the United States I feel like a a lot

381
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:18,719
of the legalization and a lot of the

382
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:21,000
flow and a lot of the Outlaws and

383
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,639
Boundary pushers came from Humble oh

384
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,958
they've been smoking humble flow for a

385
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,240
long time everywhere everywhere

386
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:29,638
absolutely and Interstate Commerce will

387
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,399
open that back up to people y I feel

388
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:32,959
like there's only a small percentage of

389
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:34,759
the guys left we were talking about this

390
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:37,479
the other day with uh the guys from

391
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:39,680
Royal gold and I feel

392
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,639
like uh that could open back up and

393
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:42,278
there's so many people that are

394
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,120
passionate up there and like the the

395
00:14:42,278 --> 00:14:46,838
ecosystem and the economy up in Humble

396
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,639
for the longest time revolved around

397
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:50,320
cannabis oh yeah I mean that's really

398
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,919
it's like my dad right you know that

399
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,120
kind of that era this pushed them out

400
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:56,519
because they can't grow their 15 20

401
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,839
plants and make a living it's just

402
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:00,639
basically worthless for them now yeah so

403
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:02,279
that kind of era is kind of pushed back

404
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,039
and they're watching what you know he's

405
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:05,639
always tripping on what I'm doing he'll

406
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:07,439
come to my farm look around and be like

407
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:09,600
this is nuts you know even know it's not

408
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,160
that big for him he was hiding in the

409
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,720
Hills growing you know 10 20 plants

410
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:15,639
right now here we are at the field of

411
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,320
weed you know and so what you were

412
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:20,399
saying is you know it was the weed

413
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:23,240
growers that really didn't rely on the

414
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:25,799
states or the government to to to help

415
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,600
out with building the community we all

416
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:29,240
donated money and built the schools in

417
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,240
the Hills built the volun fire

418
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:34,480
departments built the technical rescue

419
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:37,639
teams it was us that built this really

420
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,839
hidden community that was really had to

421
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:42,079
rely on one another with their lives and

422
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,560
it was like a big family like when

423
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:46,799
people come to Humbolt any actually the

424
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:49,078
Emerald Triangle which is Trinity mesino

425
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:51,039
in Humble County they always say Hey you

426
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:53,399
know we came here for the weed but what

427
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:55,559
we found after being here for a while

428
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:58,000
it's the people here that are amazing

429
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:59,919
it's this family feeling that you get

430
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,879
when you're around like everybody

431
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:04,759
actually cares about one another and as

432
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:08,240
you know the price went from 5,000 a

433
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:10,079
pound to 500 a pound you know it's not

434
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,000
we're having a harder time supporting

435
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:13,638
those fire departments that we built up

436
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,120
in the technical rescue teams and the

437
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:18,159
schools and so it's really hard for us

438
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,198
to see those different facilities

439
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:23,600
starting to suffer and doors starting to

440
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:26,919
close and I don't think we have seen the

441
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:29,278
end of what's Happening um I I hope it

442
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:30,719
slows down but it's it's pretty sad

443
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:32,278
right now to see what's happening in in

444
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,560
the Emerald Triangle yeah I mean I'd

445
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:37,078
love to see the winery model where you

446
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,958
can go to the farm and you can taste the

447
00:16:37,078 --> 00:16:42,439
flower you could talk to the cultivator

448
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:44,399
or the breeder or both uh you know where

449
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,040
just like Lanas has for their Brewery

450
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,799
where you go on tour the brewery and you

451
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:50,759
get the story of how they evolved into

452
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:52,719
how they are now and oh yeah you know

453
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:54,519
then you get to sample stuff potentially

454
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,440
and you know I think watching people

455
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:58,919
harvest plants in the in the fall I mean

456
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,639
I think that would be such a beautiful

457
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:03,360
thing for places like humble and mesino

458
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:05,720
that you know really kind of put those

459
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,798
counties on the map you know in a lot of

460
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,240
ways especially for our industry yeah

461
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:11,078
yeah and then and then from there like

462
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,640
the wine model hey you know what I want

463
00:17:11,078 --> 00:17:15,678
to sign up for a once once a month gift

464
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:18,120
box and guess what I want one of can of

465
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,240
country one a hogwash one of Ridgeline

466
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:22,438
farms and maybe they intermix the

467
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,078
different jars and once a month in their

468
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:26,160
mailbox they get you know different

469
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:28,078
cultiv ours maybe they they order it or

470
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,679
maybe we just they trust the farmers to

471
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:32,599
send them what's new and exciting and

472
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:34,679
that would be super cool we're doing it

473
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:37,240
with seeds so it's the same model and I

474
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:39,480
think it's it's amazing and people love

475
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,839
monthly membership boxes you know I

476
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,279
think that's a great way for people to

477
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:45,159
try all new products and test out stuff

478
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:46,918
you know with your consumer base that

479
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,558
you know already likes the product

480
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:49,720
you're doing that with seeds yeah we're

481
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:52,200
doing that with seeds so we have a

482
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:54,200
monthly membership right sorry that's a

483
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,759
really find a way to be able to make

484
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,679
weed you know be able to have a age

485
00:17:55,759 --> 00:18:00,839
better like wine though cuz that's the

486
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,840
one problem you can't have

487
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,038
but it's not no and I think it's a

488
00:18:03,558 --> 00:18:07,200
product that needs to be consumed fresh

489
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:08,640
but I do have ways we can talk about

490
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,000
this after the show where you can

491
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,520
preserve the life of it for a lot longer

492
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,279
TPL loock bags are one of them I'm a

493
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:17,679
huge fan of Turlock I went from using

494
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:19,399
mason jars from for my whole life you

495
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,600
know we always had mason jars I have

496
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,840
tons of them still at the house but I

497
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:24,599
went from mason jars to tur block bags

498
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:27,639
because you can preserve the flower so

499
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:29,079
much longer and maintain freshness okay

500
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,840
yeah you know Farm Cut's got pretty

501
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:33,038
unique way of you know preserving some

502
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:35,079
of those Turpin and cannaboids with you

503
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:37,480
know minimal trimming they also you know

504
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:40,119
vacuum seal their jars which is a you

505
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:42,279
know a step up from you know the turkey

506
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,759
bag thing that that's over the turkey

507
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:46,119
bag thing sits in your house for a day

508
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:48,079
or two and that that flower's done well

509
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:49,519
and temperature plays such a crucial

510
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:51,720
role if you're you have temperature

511
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:53,038
swings that goes go up and down you're

512
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,480
going to have issues but if you can

513
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:58,279
maintain a cool temperature it'll stay

514
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,640
fresh a lot longer y so and now that we

515
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:02,960
have so much more access like I have 50

516
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,720
different flavors right now and what I

517
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,519
usually smoke is what's the whatever the

518
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:10,159
best is but uh yeah I just and so people

519
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:11,879
ask that all the time sorry to interrupt

520
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:13,760
people ask all the time you know you

521
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,840
know what's the best flow and and you

522
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:19,558
know I I want to say and it it's just

523
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:21,639
really my answer is what makes me feel

524
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:24,480
good might not make you feel good we're

525
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:27,320
all made up differently our endoc canabo

526
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:31,038
system is different so maybe

527
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:34,240
um maybe uh I don't know some of these

528
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:36,158
tpes will interact with you better than

529
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,679
they will me and make you feel amazing

530
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:39,840
or heal whatever ailment you have and

531
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:41,640
that's one of the funnest Parts about

532
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:43,158
making these crosses though you know

533
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,120
like I I've been doing all this this

534
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:47,400
cross making all these crosses with

535
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:49,158
Lance right now and I have all the

536
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,919
little paper bags right and every

537
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:52,520
evening I'm trying a new one yeah and

538
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:55,280
it's like I smoke these OG ones are

539
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:57,879
super potent it's you OG chem cross one

540
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:59,678
of rebel gron and across with Lance and

541
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:02,760
it's like all of a sudden and I'll work

542
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,159
I could go up pot plants till 8 at night

543
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:06,119
you know what I mean or I could smoke

544
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,679
you know the secret one that me and him

545
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:09,759
did here that's that that we'll talk

546
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,960
more about but like that one there

547
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:14,440
chills me out in the evening I go more

548
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:16,840
sedated yeah relax and go eat dinner and

549
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,120
go watch a movie you know so it's just

550
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:20,759
it's amazing what each one of these

551
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:22,199
strains will do and it's just really fun

552
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:24,000
and to be able to actually use the

553
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,080
creativity of it now you know because

554
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,240
like I said for our whole life it was

555
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:30,399
you know it was our job but we grew for

556
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,359
money you know that's I hate to say it

557
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,600
that's what it was right and so they

558
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:36,479
wanted OG East Coast want OG whoever

559
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:38,439
wants OG you're growing it for 10 years

560
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,200
straight a lot of Doc OG floating around

561
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:43,000
back in the day we killed it you know I

562
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,519
mean it was easy but now we get to you

563
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,240
know you'd have my dad you'd pop his

564
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:50,519
seeds you know and it'd be po just pot

565
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,839
what is it pot sticky kill buy it it's

566
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:54,158
you know you would sell it but that

567
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,839
that's not the deal anymore and so it's

568
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,880
just really fun to be able to actually

569
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:00,759
be creative and that's like that's kind

570
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,840
of our passion is be able to make all

571
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:05,879
these new strains now and just come up

572
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:07,639
with you know stuff that actually I know

573
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,679
what the consumers would like you know

574
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,679
because it's right well you're sugar

575
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,960
coating it a little bit too because as

576
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:17,159
James well knows and as you know and I

577
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:19,679
know for every breeding project we do

578
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:21,919
maybe you know I bred 20 different

579
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,798
strains last year and crosses and stuff

580
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:29,200
and really I think I came up with maybe

581
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:31,359
two that pass the the you know our

582
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,759
standards and the rest just went to the

583
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:35,839
Wayside and so it's hard to find the

584
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:38,319
diamond in the rough and even when you

585
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:39,759
do right what's really been helpful for

586
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:41,399
us is like the emerald you could have

587
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:44,119
the best drain in the world unless you

588
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,840
have somebody uplift that like right

589
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:48,558
like the emerald cup especially and um

590
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:50,918
there's a lot of marketing yeah a lot of

591
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:53,960
marketing and stuff but um the emerald

592
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:55,559
cup really propels that a lot best train

593
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,759
might not be the best train nobody knows

594
00:21:55,558 --> 00:21:59,639
about it you're enjoying it but you know

595
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:01,798
everybody don't give the Lance so give

596
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,919
out the Lance but at the end of the day

597
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:04,679
what would have been if I would have

598
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:06,400
just sat there and smoked it by myself

599
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:08,440
you know what I mean it's like it what

600
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:12,640
is your best what would you consider to

601
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:16,679
be your best hottest strain right now

602
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:19,600
right now today today the the hottest

603
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:22,159
thing that I've ever made yeah what what

604
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:23,959
are you most passion what am I most

605
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,880
passionate about I'm I'm most passionate

606
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,640
about some of the stuff we we're pheno

607
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,159
hunting right now but I got a blue dream

608
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,320
lcg

609
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:34,159
that we did some trials with that's

610
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:37,119
pretty special and it leans towards the

611
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:40,200
lcg but it has like this crazy

612
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:42,918
Viger Blue Dream is just a it's a Dream

613
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,798
It's a dream to grow and then you know I

614
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:46,320
got the Fort Collins cof and I cross out

615
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:48,119
with banana Skittles and we got banana

616
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:50,678
cough and it's selling on our website

617
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:52,599
but that one is really special to me now

618
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:54,360
I don't know if the whole world is going

619
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:55,798
to like it like I do and I feel like you

620
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:57,278
got to look at it from a chef's

621
00:22:55,798 --> 00:23:00,480
perspective it's not about what you love

622
00:22:57,278 --> 00:23:01,839
it's about what the customers love and

623
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,919
you can talk about the customers like

624
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:07,959
babies give the baby what the baby wants

625
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:10,320
right yeah um but I you know I've done I

626
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,880
did 300 outcrosses uh last year and

627
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:14,240
about 300 the year before a lot of

628
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,919
people understand how much work so much

629
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,679
crazy work yeah and then and that's not

630
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:20,600
even touching the autoflowers you know

631
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:24,240
and I I did a lot of Autoflower at work

632
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:25,839
as well but I go through a lot of stuff

633
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,558
and then I work with House of coltivar

634
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:28,959
in Washington and we go through a lot of

635
00:23:27,558 --> 00:23:30,678
stuff together they you know we've

636
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,159
selected 20 different

637
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:35,600
phenotypes uh over the last year and a

638
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:37,799
half of stuff that's been pheno hunted

639
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:40,599
and there's some really cool modern

640
00:23:37,798 --> 00:23:43,720
stuff I like some of the Throwbacks and

641
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:45,839
I also like some of the modern stuff

642
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,278
that's slightly different it's not your

643
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:48,599
typical run-of-the-mill I feel like you

644
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:50,480
guys are in the same category with that

645
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:52,719
it's like I don't want the same stuff as

646
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:56,079
everybody else I don't need another

647
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,600
gelato 33 or another Lemon Cherry gelato

648
00:23:56,079 --> 00:24:01,000
if it's going to be Lemon Cherry gelato

649
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:03,399
it better pop standout you know yeah um

650
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,079
some rs11 crosses that I made are really

651
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,519
standouts I think uh I did some

652
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:09,278
permanent markers I get a permanent

653
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:11,000
midnight which is the permanent marker

654
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:12,679
times Lemon Cherry gelato I think

655
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,119
there's a lot of potential in those that

656
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:16,840
we're going through uh and we go

657
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:18,519
multiple rounds of feno hunting before

658
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:20,480
we select and we test them in commercial

659
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:22,200
environments as well so see and that's

660
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,360
what when we were talking earlier just

661
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:27,038
the the highness of your it's just crazy

662
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:29,599
how you're figuring that out because for

663
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:31,679
us you know it's like multiple years

664
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:33,839
growing in all this different situations

665
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,759
from indoors to mix lights to Outdoors

666
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:38,599
try to figure out what works better at

667
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:40,240
my elevation to a Johnny's elevation and

668
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:42,599
it's just hard to come up with a strain

669
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,319
that actually loves everything so you

670
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:47,240
know like I said the Lance this The

671
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:49,359
Taste is way better and the mix light

672
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:51,679
you know but it gets stronger outside so

673
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:53,439
it's just it's using your technology

674
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,600
with some some of what we're doing would

675
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,159
probably make it like way quicker

676
00:24:55,599 --> 00:25:00,359
totally and you know I got a Mexican

677
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:03,840
gelato that's got the it's got Mexican

678
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:06,079
Haze times gelato 41 and it's pretty

679
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:07,879
special and it's not your typical sativa

680
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:08,599
and it's definitely not your gelato but

681
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,159
you

682
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:13,240
get characteristics of both of them in

683
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:15,399
it and those are what I like where

684
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,079
you're like oo this reminds me of this

685
00:25:15,398 --> 00:25:18,678
but it also reminds me of this and you

686
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:21,319
can really tell that it has both of

687
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:23,278
those things in it and so that excites

688
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:26,599
me but I'm constantly excited by new

689
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:28,480
stuff I love going through fenos but uh

690
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:30,839
you see these guys doing thousand SE

691
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,798
feno hunts and you know that's great and

692
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:33,798
all but I feel like you're really

693
00:25:31,798 --> 00:25:35,639
looking for unicorns at that point where

694
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:37,720
I like going through a handful of them I

695
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,320
like to be able to smoke them I like to

696
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:42,360
be able to go smell bags all the time or

697
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:45,079
extract you don't you just you know if I

698
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:47,398
could start you know six to eight maybe

699
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:49,278
10 seeds of each one you know you'll get

700
00:25:47,398 --> 00:25:50,918
a certain amount of females out of it

701
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:54,000
and you know try them and there's that's

702
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:55,759
plenty it's so much work and so much

703
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
money and just basically investing a lot

704
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:59,759
of time in it you know but then every

705
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,798
once in a while it's like if I smoke

706
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:03,759
like a really good gassy one it's

707
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:06,200
nostalgic to me it bring me back to my

708
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:08,599
childhood you know I love that foul gas

709
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:10,038
like that really strong dirt and you

710
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:12,759
taste it on your tongue it's something

711
00:26:10,038 --> 00:26:13,919
like resiny yeah like that Piney OG

712
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:15,640
where you get the Piney and then it's

713
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,360
real earthy and really tast bring you

714
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,399
back a little some of those ones it's

715
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:21,558
like when you're hiding the back a

716
00:26:19,398 --> 00:26:23,719
little little little pipe little Proto

717
00:26:21,558 --> 00:26:25,158
pipe or something Proto pipe from the 9s

718
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,839
you know or we had those pipes that you

719
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:29,039
could uh mix and match the different

720
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:30,879
pieces for they had the resin

721
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:32,720
we smoke the resin back in the day

722
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,480
because we were just it was it was hard

723
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,278
and and what you were saying before and

724
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,640
I I believe to be true is that you know

725
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:42,200
that flower takes on the place that it's

726
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:44,120
been it's being grown like if I grow the

727
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,519
white Thorn Rose at my place it tastes

728
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:47,479
really totally different than if you

729
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:49,158
were to grow it at ridg lines even

730
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,278
though I'm on the west side that gets a

731
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:53,320
little influence from the ocean he's on

732
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:55,640
the east side that maybe is a little

733
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:57,240
higher elevation doesn't get as much fog

734
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:00,278
it tastes a little bit different they

735
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:02,359
both taste amazing but we can tell the

736
00:27:00,278 --> 00:27:04,440
difference just in the flavor of it so

737
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:07,839
the taste of the place is I think really

738
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:10,038
important um to Brer his stuff his stuff

739
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:12,079
buds way quicker because his son goes he

740
00:27:10,038 --> 00:27:13,440
has less sun down in the valley there

741
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:15,439
and so I bring up to my house all of a

742
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,399
sudden it's a first one budding you know

743
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,840
in feno hunting we're always looking for

744
00:27:17,398 --> 00:27:21,798
not just the flavor or the the the bud

745
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:24,398
density or whatever you know we don't

746
00:27:21,798 --> 00:27:26,158
want them to get powdery mildew we we

747
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:28,199
want it to be early finisher in case a

748
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,919
big storm comes in white Thorn Rose

749
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:33,720
Harvest is usually September 15th that

750
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:35,919
was a huge Advantage back in the 80s

751
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:39,000
with the paradise punch was a September

752
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:41,240
7th it was done we could dry it cure it

753
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,919
get it into the market get a couple

754
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:45,599
before Camp comes or get it out into the

755
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,919
market place before the big harvest in

756
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:49,759
Humble and get2 or $300 more a pound

757
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:51,880
which made a big difference in the 80s

758
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:53,079
totally yeah yeah and I think one of the

759
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,480
beautiful things about the coastal

760
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:57,199
regions of humble is is there's so much

761
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:59,399
powdery mil do and petritis if you

762
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,880
really want to test for resistance

763
00:27:59,398 --> 00:28:02,558
that's the best place to do it just put

764
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,799
it out there and then select the ones

765
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:08,079
that don't have the issue

766
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:10,359
yeah and what's really to find and what

767
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:12,199
I've been finding is so Paradise punch

768
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:15,240
just will not get powdery MW I've grown

769
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:17,759
it in a room before amongst uh you know

770
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:20,000
ogs that have totally powdery mildew and

771
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:22,158
it won't get it and so anything I breed

772
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,319
that paradise punch to it really makes

773
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:27,480
that strain really resistant to the

774
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:29,720
powdery mdeo so it's cool and I utilize

775
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:32,079
it in that way a little bit and I am

776
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:35,399
finding or I'm believing I'm finding not

777
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:37,359
100% sure yet that some of those um

778
00:28:35,398 --> 00:28:41,158
purple strange really are a little bit

779
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:44,278
more resistant to bugs maybe hop late

780
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:45,960
powder mold not powder mold not your

781
00:28:44,278 --> 00:28:48,599
purple my purple's different than your

782
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:50,120
purple 100% 100 I feel like those there

783
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:51,719
there's all different levels to

784
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:53,678
resistance too so it's not just like

785
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,640
resistant or not resistant some of them

786
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:58,278
are partially resistant and and you know

787
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:01,200
we use a one to 10 scale so we have you

788
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:02,919
know completely resistant to the you

789
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,120
know the complete opposite where it's

790
00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:06,799
just super susceptible you feel the

791
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:08,119
softness on some of those plants and

792
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:09,798
those are the ones that just mold I mean

793
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:11,558
I'll put cheetah piss right next to the

794
00:29:09,798 --> 00:29:13,158
Lance yeah Lance will have some powder

795
00:29:11,558 --> 00:29:15,038
mold and will not go over onto that

796
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:17,760
cheetah piss and the leaf on the cheetah

797
00:29:15,038 --> 00:29:20,038
piss is really like oily kind of tougher

798
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:21,839
Leaf you know yeah it's I'm not a huge

799
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:24,759
fan of cheetah piss personally no it

800
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:26,959
smells good it grows amazing but the

801
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:28,599
smoke but it's not a good SM smoke for

802
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,759
sure I'm all about flavor and the thing

803
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:32,759
is is like on the vine it smells like

804
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:34,079
the ammonia but I grew up with catpiss

805
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:36,158
and so catpiss we're going for that

806
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:37,839
ammonia and you want that when that

807
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,480
translates into this smoke where it's

808
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:41,879
like strong and potent and you know that

809
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,880
that's what I'm all about but it doesn't

810
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:46,000
really remind me of that and it's all

811
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:47,880
right yeah yeah well it's a good grower

812
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,480
and and some of those are good

813
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:54,240
to yeah know whatever I mean like I said

814
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:56,558
it's fun to grow in my area because it

815
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:59,480
or my climate because it doesn't powder

816
00:29:56,558 --> 00:30:01,000
Mt it gets giant and looks amazing and I

817
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,839
hate to say it in the bag that's what a

818
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,359
lot of these a lot of the buyers want is

819
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:05,639
something that looks amazing they aren't

820
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:08,759
really they don't want powdery me do in

821
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:10,480
the bag yeah exactly something like that

822
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:13,319
has breeding potential and I talk about

823
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,960
this a lot but I feel like purple punch

824
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:18,558
Oreos they they get a bad name I mean at

825
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:21,440
least I'm not a hug they look good the

826
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:22,918
flavor is not there right you know I get

827
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,679
hated for saying I don't like apple

828
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:26,919
fritter but apple fritter I don't really

829
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:29,640
like personally but I feel like they're

830
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:31,200
all just one step away from being great

831
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,038
you have you put the right cross you put

832
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,000
the apple fritter with the purple punch

833
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:39,079
and you can find amazing stuff I AG

834
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,398
crosses there are nowadays right so many

835
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:43,519
how hard it is to pick a name for a

836
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:46,278
strain they're all taken yeah there it's

837
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:48,359
wild it's wild and you know it's like I

838
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:50,079
can put loud on the front of anything so

839
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:51,759
I'm just like whatever I I come up with

840
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:53,839
a good name and I feel like I want to do

841
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:55,480
descriptive names but we get we get

842
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:58,278
creative with stuff but I like it to

843
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,839
describe the plant a little bit yeah I

844
00:30:58,278 --> 00:31:01,599
believe you just touch on something that

845
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:04,319
I was going to mention before but you

846
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:08,359
hit on it now is you know you you put um

847
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:11,000
James louder loud on the packaging and

848
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:13,119
it maybe might not be the most amazing

849
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,440
strain or maybe it is the most amazing

850
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:17,959
strain but you've built a trust with

851
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,558
that consumer and they're starting to

852
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,038
understand who you are and your

853
00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:24,759
knowledge and so they're buying your

854
00:31:22,038 --> 00:31:26,200
flower because of who you are in the

855
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:28,638
trust that you've built with them I

856
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,960
believe yeah and same with us too think

857
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:33,638
stting to do thato so it doesn't matter

858
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,319
so much what we grow so much as the

859
00:31:33,638 --> 00:31:37,319
trust and if we're putting it into our

860
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:39,200
jars we're saying hey we're we're

861
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:41,038
verifying that this is good right and I

862
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,679
think that's a sign of a mature market

863
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:44,480
right I see that happening in Colorado

864
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:46,080
and Washington a lot more than it it's

865
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,960
been in California but we're starting to

866
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:51,398
go in that direction and

867
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,880
really you know over once the market

868
00:31:51,398 --> 00:31:54,759
stabilizes then they start you're

869
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,600
getting you're getting consumer trust

870
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:59,558
where the they trust the brand and so

871
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:01,599
then they're willing to try stuff within

872
00:31:59,558 --> 00:32:02,798
the brand because they already trust it

873
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:05,199
and they know you're going to provide

874
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:07,359
good quality products and so they're

875
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:10,639
willing to you know try a skittles that

876
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:12,359
you guys grow or what whatever it is on

877
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:14,119
top of that and you get a customer for

878
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:15,119
life then and that's the best right at

879
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:16,798
the end of the day that's what you want

880
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:18,199
to do is get more customers that

881
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:20,240
continue to buy your product well people

882
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,440
love our story too you know it's like I

883
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,798
think that's what separates us for

884
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,360
there's so many Brands and when this

885
00:32:23,798 --> 00:32:27,398
whole thing started I mean I've watched

886
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:29,678
Brands come and go left and right and

887
00:32:27,398 --> 00:32:31,239
it's like we aren't you know spending

888
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:33,399
tons I mean I guess we do spend all the

889
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,399
money we make on weed anyways goes in

890
00:32:33,398 --> 00:32:36,918
our brand but we're slow and steady

891
00:32:35,398 --> 00:32:38,879
we're just being real you know and it's

892
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:40,919
like this is who we are yeah you know

893
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,639
this is what we've done our whole life

894
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:45,278
and we should be good at growing weed

895
00:32:42,638 --> 00:32:47,278
this has been our job for our whole life

896
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:49,440
you know we are raised around weed our

897
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:51,919
parents grew weed I mean so totally so

898
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,759
yeah I think that people do they're

899
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:55,159
seeing our story they're seeing what we

900
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:57,879
do and we're getting that trust and

901
00:32:55,159 --> 00:33:00,320
that's freeing us to be able to have

902
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:03,200
have fun go outside the box and have new

903
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:04,599
strains and it's I mean for me I need

904
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,600
this right now because I was getting

905
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:08,599
kind of bored of just you know doing the

906
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:10,759
same thing over and over so this this is

907
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:12,359
fun I'm having fun with it now totally

908
00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:14,278
well it becomes an authentic experience

909
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:15,759
for you but also for the consumer right

910
00:33:14,278 --> 00:33:18,079
and they can see the

911
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:20,240
authenticity right and then they can

912
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:22,558
attach themselves to the story and and

913
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,000
relate to the story but also yeah people

914
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:25,720
love a good story especially when it's

915
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,159
authentic because anybody can tell a

916
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,480
story but an authentic story you you

917
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,799
know you start looking at it and it's

918
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,599
like wow that's amazing you know the the

919
00:33:31,798 --> 00:33:35,000
trials and tribulations that we go

920
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:36,918
through and have gone through to get to

921
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,919
this point I mean that's it we we have

922
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:41,159
to pay respect you know even like Johnny

923
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:42,880
is being a youngster and you know humble

924
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:44,519
and watching his court case and watching

925
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,360
that was the biggest thing that happened

926
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:48,120
when I was a kid you know watching him

927
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:50,918
he was the first one to you know have a

928
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:53,119
real National court case and it it

929
00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:54,759
affected all of us so it's like we got

930
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:57,398
to pay tribute to you know everybody

931
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:59,158
that PID my dad you know my uncle his

932
00:33:57,398 --> 00:34:00,518
mom you know there's so many of them and

933
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:02,840
I feel like a lot of that's getting kind

934
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:04,278
of washed down these days and you know

935
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:05,519
and forgot about but there's a lot of

936
00:34:04,278 --> 00:34:07,119
people that made it so we could do what

937
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,639
we're doing today and that's the beauty

938
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:10,039
of the show you know we talk about it

939
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,919
every show pretty much the oral history

940
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:13,320
of cannabis and the importance of it but

941
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:16,239
but like guys like Johnny the

942
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:19,159
revolutionaries that pushed the bar and

943
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:21,078
were boundary pushers that really said

944
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:22,280
this isn't right that it's illegal I

945
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:26,000
don't care that it's illegal and I'm

946
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:27,800
going to do it anyway and we need people

947
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,599
like that standing up to the government

948
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,960
standing up to people who are are trying

949
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:34,159
to argue the fact that cannabis is

950
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,918
illegal or mushrooms are bad for you or

951
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:39,119
whatever it is you know I mean there's

952
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:40,918
growing it for so much more than money

953
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,200
so much more I mean the brand I was just

954
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:45,679
trying to grow more weed than you well

955
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:47,358
it was in a weird way and as as as

956
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:51,320
ridiculous as that

957
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:53,878
sound there was a competition you know

958
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:55,838
amongst all of our friends it was like

959
00:34:53,878 --> 00:34:58,279
oh well he's doing this and he's doing

960
00:34:55,838 --> 00:34:59,960
that and the cops are over here and the

961
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,000
cops are looking on the ground so we're

962
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,720
growing in the trees now they're looking

963
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,119
in the trees so we're hollowing out

964
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:08,480
bushes and growing under the the bushes

965
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:11,920
and it was kind of a cat and mouse game

966
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:14,079
and a and a fun um game between our

967
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,880
friends of you know who could grow more

968
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,560
who could grow differently what

969
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:20,400
techniques aren't you getting busted

970
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:21,719
with and just like fishing kind of yeah

971
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,440
yeah you could be there you know you

972
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:24,919
have a clone room you know you could be

973
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,320
indoor you could be outdoor and everyone

974
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,599
kind of does their own thing and wrs

975
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,920
their own ass you know how they want to

976
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:35,359
do you remember when we went from

977
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:38,519
outdoor to indoor and what that was all

978
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:40,319
about absolutely yeah that was when you

979
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:42,880
know after Ronald Reagan had declared

980
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,519
the war on drugs and they injected all

981
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,880
this money into the different counties

982
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:48,559
to eradicate you know cannabis and

983
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:52,039
really we're going to make an example

984
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:55,000
out of people to stop cannabis Growers

985
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:58,039
and you know most of us made it through

986
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,599
that and went into indoor so most of us

987
00:35:58,039 --> 00:36:01,519
were also at the same time growing

988
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:04,440
outdoor and indoor because we were

989
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:05,920
pivoting from outdoor to indoor and we'd

990
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,480
grow outdoor in the summer we'd grow

991
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:11,920
indoor in the wintertime we'd hang

992
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,480
camouflage radar detecting infrared camo

993
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,599
Nets over there because somebody said it

994
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:17,199
would help with the infrared and whether

995
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,480
or not it did or not but like we were

996
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:22,279
burying generators under the ground it

997
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:24,079
was it was a crazy time and

998
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,720
unfortunately one thing that I don't

999
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:29,960
think any of us could really foresee or

1000
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:31,799
overcome is when somebody Rats on you

1001
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:34,440
and you know that's that's a tough one

1002
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:37,318
to swallow and it was the way I ended up

1003
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:39,559
getting in trouble and being naive being

1004
00:36:37,318 --> 00:36:41,960
a 20-year-old kid not knowing a

1005
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:43,599
difference between state and federal law

1006
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,318
didn't know I could ever be looking at

1007
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:49,039
10 years to life in prison for a first

1008
00:36:45,318 --> 00:36:51,759
time non offender W so you know did

1009
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:53,838
eight years in federal prison and had 5

1010
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,839
years probation and went to court for

1011
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:57,920
four years so it was 17 out of my life

1012
00:36:55,838 --> 00:37:00,719
17 years out of my life for this plan

1013
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:03,280
and so now I'm a permitted farm with the

1014
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:04,799
county and with the state of California

1015
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,200
and it's really

1016
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,839
surreal what I feel sitting here with

1017
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:11,199
you today being able to talk to your

1018
00:37:08,838 --> 00:37:12,838
audience about what I love to do and

1019
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:16,199
what I still love to do and feel very

1020
00:37:12,838 --> 00:37:19,799
fortunate to be able to do yeah we're an

1021
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:24,199
amazing time we're living in an amazing

1022
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:26,280
time uh and you know 20 years ago it was

1023
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:27,838
a whole different world even 10 years

1024
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:30,040
ago it was a whole different world you

1025
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:32,318
know legalization has only happened

1026
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:34,679
since 2018 and we had Medical but they

1027
00:37:32,318 --> 00:37:36,239
were still putting people in prison you

1028
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:39,639
know for cannabis for small amounts of

1029
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:42,159
cannabis even 100% yeah so yeah it's

1030
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:43,358
it's really sad and I feel like there's

1031
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:44,960
guys like yourself that have been

1032
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:47,880
pushing boundaries and we' had Richard

1033
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,920
delisi on the show he did 32 calendar

1034
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:52,318
years yeah wow you know people don't

1035
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,800
belong in prison especially for a long

1036
00:37:52,318 --> 00:37:56,639
time for a nonviolent offense you know

1037
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,880
it's like and for cannabis it's it's

1038
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:00,078
something that makes the world a better

1039
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:04,119
place yeah and to take that away from us

1040
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:06,640
is just really silly and you know my

1041
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:08,119
parents generation you know they went

1042
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:13,400
back and forth on it you know my my

1043
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:14,640
father's 74 now and so you know they

1044
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,280
they went back and forth and there was

1045
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:17,559
some people from the 60s and 70s that

1046
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:20,359
were okay with it and there was a lot of

1047
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:23,679
people hating on it and now a lot of

1048
00:38:20,358 --> 00:38:26,039
those people are okay with it and it's

1049
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:28,318
interesting how the narrative has

1050
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:30,039
changed and people realize parents okay

1051
00:38:28,318 --> 00:38:32,719
with it then I mean my dad my dad's the

1052
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:36,239
same age so yeah so my my aunt was okay

1053
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:37,719
with it and my parents were my mom was

1054
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:40,358
kind of always okay with it but my

1055
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:42,799
father was not really okay with it uhhuh

1056
00:38:40,358 --> 00:38:46,559
but yeah and so they're okay with it now

1057
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:48,960
uh there was time in maybe 2003 they

1058
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:50,799
were coming to they live in Texas so I'm

1059
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,838

1060
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,280
Bay Area I was born in Portland but my

1061
00:38:52,838 --> 00:38:57,519

1065
00:39:00,358 --> 00:39:03,679

1066
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,680
said no we're coming so I said I just

1067
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:07,960
want to let you know uh the garage is

1068
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:09,239
full of plants and he's like what do you

1069
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,838
mean the garage is full of plants like

1070
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:15,399
didn't get it right off and I'm like the

1071
00:39:10,838 --> 00:39:16,880
garage is full of plants he's like oh

1072
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,000
and I'm like so if you want to come

1073
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:21,160

1074
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,920
know in advance that the garage is full

1075
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:26,039
of plants and so they came and he was

1076
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,318
actually pretty impressed with the

1077
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:29,800
system and I think I had 200 16 Plants

1078
00:39:28,318 --> 00:39:31,559
which was you know over the federal

1079
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,079
limit at the time but I was growing in

1080
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:36,039
octagons and you guys probably remember

1081
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:38,160
the old octagons where you have a we had

1082
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:40,159
cool tubes and so you have your thousand

1083
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:42,559
watts in the cool tubes and you have 26

1084
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:44,118
plants it's four tiers so 13 plants per

1085
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:46,639
tier and the plants grow towards the

1086
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:48,880
light we got that uh my buddy got it

1087
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:50,519
from a farmer up in Humble and had the

1088
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,480
recipe and we we spent the weekend

1089
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:54,039
cutting it down and awesome it's such a

1090
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,760
different world you know you know it's

1091
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:58,759
like being a kid I was sleeping when we

1092
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,880
when we actually made Harvest and then

1093
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:02,280
get busted you know in our bedroom

1094
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,400
there'd be plants hanging we go to

1095
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:06,240
school with [ __ ] wipe wipe wipe the

1096
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,519
leaves off our back you know so just

1097
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:10,519
such a different world you know it was

1098
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:12,480
wasn't taboo where we came from it was

1099
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:15,599
just everybody grew it just be quiet

1100
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:18,440
about it you know yeah I remember uh Bob

1101
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:21,079
cork my glass teacher freshman year I

1102
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:24,079
was I was for 14 and 15 and I was a TA

1103
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:26,880
when I was 15 for him and he used to

1104
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:29,680
give me $50 at lunch go get a a of weed

1105
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,800
for 40 bucks and two cheese zombies and

1106
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:33,480
so it was the best he was the best TA or

1107
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,720
I was the best ta he was the best

1108
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:38,079
teacher ever yeah and you know really

1109
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:39,358
good stuff so you know growing up in the

1110
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:41,519
barrier there's this connection to the

1111
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:43,838
Grateful Dead as well of course so I

1112
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:45,800
think that plays a huge role you got

1113
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:48,199
companies like Lanas that I talk about

1114
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:50,880
you know and I think we're all kind of

1115
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:52,838
the evolution of the Dead to a degree

1116
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,599
and I think the Cannabis scene is part

1117
00:40:52,838 --> 00:40:57,440
of that as well yeah I'm hoping our town

1118
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,720
could just get something like that it's

1119
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,838
really quiet right now you know it's

1120
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:02,439
really sad in our town right now so it's

1121
00:41:00,838 --> 00:41:03,838
the most beautiful place ever it's like

1122
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:06,079
every time you know I saw you in San

1123
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:07,838
Francisco there on 420 woke up in the

1124
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:10,160
morning I shot home it's like I love it

1125
00:41:07,838 --> 00:41:11,599
it's beautiful you know but it's just

1126
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:13,000
right now it's just it's taking a

1127
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:15,039
beating with this you know a lot of

1128
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,920
people that have been Outlaws their

1129
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:18,480
whole life are having a hard time

1130
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,680
playing with this new system you know

1131
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,400
it's pretty Cutthroat it out there you

1132
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:26,078
know always like to be positive about

1133
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:28,240
everything and as as hard as it is right

1134
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:29,839
now I I really believe it's like a big

1135
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:31,318
puzzle on the table right and we just

1136
00:41:29,838 --> 00:41:33,880
have to kind of figure out this new

1137
00:41:31,318 --> 00:41:36,519
industry by fitting the pieces together

1138
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:38,280
and you know our Legacy genetics

1139
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:41,000
highlighting our stories have really

1140
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:42,440
given us a lot of momentum and you know

1141
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,920
I always tell people I said you know I

1142
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,800
don't I don't even want you to buy my

1143
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,680
weed what I want you to do is I want you

1144
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:50,079
to grow your own because if you're going

1145
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:52,279
to truly understand our story and why

1146
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:53,880
we're so passionate about what we do you

1147
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,960
need to grow your own you need to start

1148
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:57,720
your seed you need to grow grow it

1149
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,800
throughout the summertime and nurture it

1150
00:41:57,719 --> 00:42:03,159
and take care of it and water it and

1151
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:05,200
feed it and then Harvest it dry it cure

1152
00:42:03,159 --> 00:42:06,799
it and then share it with your buddies

1153
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:09,318
and when you look over and you see

1154
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,800
somebody smiling or laughing or healing

1155
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:15,119
some ailment that they have all because

1156
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:17,720
of what you created that's the magic

1157
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,838
that's what I need them to feel to truly

1158
00:42:17,719 --> 00:42:20,679
understand what we went through to get

1159
00:42:18,838 --> 00:42:22,199
to this point yeah and I mean there's

1160
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:24,159
there's this there's something about

1161
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:25,879
growing your own flour and going through

1162
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:27,879
the experience I mean popping seeds even

1163
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,358
but like the first time you take that

1164
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,318
plant through a life cycle even if it's

1165
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:33,639
from clone or seed whatever but you

1166
00:42:31,318 --> 00:42:36,318
you're with that plant through the veg

1167
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:38,719
and then through the 63 or 70 or however

1168
00:42:36,318 --> 00:42:40,318
many days of flour and you dry it and

1169
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:41,719
you smoke it and you think it's the best

1170
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:43,239
thing in the world at least when I was

1171
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:44,679
younger I remember that with everybody

1172
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:46,879
and sometimes it was sometimes it wasn't

1173
00:42:44,679 --> 00:42:50,118
but there's special attachment that you

1174
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:52,640
have to that flour and to be able to

1175
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:55,318
share it with other people it's really

1176
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:57,358
special and you know I think everybody

1177
00:42:55,318 --> 00:42:58,558
should have to whether it's tomatoes or

1178
00:42:57,358 --> 00:42:59,759
cannabis everybody should have their

1179
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:02,240
hands in the dirt trying to grow

1180
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,520
something and you have that fire 100%

1181
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:04,919
and I'll tell you why because when I

1182
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:06,880
walked in the door the first thing you

1183
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:08,400
did which you grabbed those bag of weeds

1184
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,240
and you shoved it in our face so we

1185
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,358
could smell it because you were proud of

1186
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:13,879
what you created and what you did and

1187
00:43:12,358 --> 00:43:15,199
that's the specialness that people

1188
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,079
really need to understand and need to

1189
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:19,118
feel I mean that's really like when they

1190
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:20,800
come to you know my farm or Johnny it's

1191
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:23,079
like look around I get I know every

1192
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,839
single plant yeah I look at every single

1193
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:26,920
plant I touch every plant you know I

1194
00:43:24,838 --> 00:43:28,838
smell every plant so the whole process

1195
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,440
to to me is amazing all the way to the

1196
00:43:28,838 --> 00:43:31,920
end I'm my worst critic I'll sit there

1197
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:34,559
and be like this tastes like [ __ ] right

1198
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,240
you'll look across across through your

1199
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:38,800
property and you see you'll see a little

1200
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:40,598
leaf wilted well there's something no

1201
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,359
it's my art you know it's my passion I

1202
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:43,599
want it to be perfect but you know like

1203
00:43:42,358 --> 00:43:44,838
I said at the end of the day when I'll

1204
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:46,240
smoke something I'm going to be the

1205
00:43:44,838 --> 00:43:48,480
first one that's the most honest about

1206
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:50,479
it if I don't like it you know it's like

1207
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,559
this one's out right you know but it's

1208
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,880
it's definitely I think that's another

1209
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:56,880
reason why you know the consumers trust

1210
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:59,200
us is because they know we we put so

1211
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,039
much into it you know we we I think it's

1212
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:03,318
Advantage of not having acres and Acres

1213
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:05,639
of weed you know and it's like maybe you

1214
00:44:03,318 --> 00:44:07,558
don't have way more but we have what we

1215
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:09,480
have is way the quality is better you

1216
00:44:07,559 --> 00:44:11,079
know we put so much energy every little

1217
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,000
project I just did this pen project with

1218
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:14,800
Arcada X and it's like we aren't going

1219
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:18,159
to make money not for a long time but

1220
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:20,519
that we had so much you know detail and

1221
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:23,039
just put the best the best Ros in into

1222
00:44:20,519 --> 00:44:25,480
the best pen and you know with amazing

1223
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:27,880
artwork and we just did everything to a

1224
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:30,039
point where the the quality is we can be

1225
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:31,880
proud of and that's kind of I think

1226
00:44:30,039 --> 00:44:33,318
what's going to separate us from a lot

1227
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:35,599
of other brands that are just pumping

1228
00:44:33,318 --> 00:44:37,119
out tons of stuff just to you know make

1229
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:39,480
make what they can make it as cheap as

1230
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,800
they can so they can make as much profit

1231
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,199
as they can and that's you know that's

1232
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,519
not really where I'm at I want the

1233
00:44:42,199 --> 00:44:47,279
highest quality yeah I me quality over

1234
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:49,079
everything you know I think quality over

1235
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,400
everything is so important I think

1236
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:53,280
quality needs to be the focal point and

1237
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,680
and the attention and yeah we have to

1238
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,440
make money right at the end of the day

1239
00:44:54,679 --> 00:45:00,838
we need to pay our bills feed our

1240
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:03,039
families and so there's that aspect but

1241
00:45:00,838 --> 00:45:05,239
trying not to sacrifice quality I think

1242
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:07,199
that's the biggest one and really what

1243
00:45:05,239 --> 00:45:08,919
I've I've been finding and I've been

1244
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:11,399
learning as these manufacturers have

1245
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:13,519
been exploring you know white Thorn Rose

1246
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:16,318
and this new Paradise Pine that we

1247
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:18,280
created was each of those

1248
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:20,119
manufacturers um are kind of like

1249
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:22,480
Growers themselves is they have their

1250
00:45:20,119 --> 00:45:24,079
own techniques and that product that

1251
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,199
they're creating comes out totally

1252
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:28,599
different there's a reason why Belle

1253
00:45:26,199 --> 00:45:31,078
from heritage is known as one of the

1254
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:32,880
best hash makers or the Brest like they

1255
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:35,079
take so much passion in what they're

1256
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,079
doing and it really transfers into that

1257
00:45:35,079 --> 00:45:40,559
product that they're creating right and

1258
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:43,200
so um you know whether or not you smoke

1259
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:46,599
that or you experience that from Punch

1260
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:48,078
or Heritage or Rosen or eyy they each

1261
00:45:46,599 --> 00:45:49,640
taste a little bit of different but it's

1262
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:51,559
a reflection of those people that

1263
00:45:49,639 --> 00:45:53,440
actually created it right and we don't

1264
00:45:51,559 --> 00:45:54,800
pretend like I remember people giving me

1265
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,000
like what you don't know about rosin

1266
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,760
it's like you know I I stay in my Lane I

1267
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,599
grow weed you know these guys have

1268
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:02,720
dedicated their life to making the best

1269
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:04,359
Ros in there is you know and I mean

1270
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:06,000
that's what that's the beauty of theal

1271
00:46:04,358 --> 00:46:07,719
Market you know that's that's the beauty

1272
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,480
of wreck and one of the beauties of the

1273
00:46:07,719 --> 00:46:11,199
direction that we've gone in CU back in

1274
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:13,559
the day we did everything we were

1275
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:16,239
electricians we were Carpenters oh yeah

1276
00:46:13,559 --> 00:46:19,559
we did extra I had Bubble Bags set up

1277
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:21,558
you know and I I did it all and I I with

1278
00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:23,000
the generator then you're a mechanic

1279
00:46:21,559 --> 00:46:24,440
exactly yeah I mean you had to do a

1280
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,719
little bit of everything back in the day

1281
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:28,159
and you didn't necessarily need to rely

1282
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:30,959
on anybody you wanted to be

1283
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:33,199
self-sufficient yeah and now we can

1284
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,800
really be Specialists of our craft and

1285
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:37,078
we can really dial in certain things I'm

1286
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,240
not one of those guys that wants to

1287
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:41,119
chase the next shiny object I don't care

1288
00:46:39,239 --> 00:46:43,318
what it is I what you're doing like your

1289
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:44,800
seed thing is it's high tech it's Way

1290
00:46:43,318 --> 00:46:46,558
Beyond what we're doing like I said over

1291
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,720
there you know rubbing this plant

1292
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:48,839
getting out the seeds you have these

1293
00:46:47,719 --> 00:46:50,519
machines and you're sitting there

1294
00:46:48,838 --> 00:46:52,759
cleaning seeds and you're making these

1295
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:55,039
you know your whole genetic Library I

1296
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:57,000
mean this is next level well the beauty

1297
00:46:55,039 --> 00:46:59,079
of that is that I can share it with

1298
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,838
other people too you know we have this

1299
00:46:59,079 --> 00:47:04,160
seed cleaning equipment that it's super

1300
00:47:01,838 --> 00:47:05,679
scalable too but like the way we have it

1301
00:47:04,159 --> 00:47:07,639
set up it's like I have so many friends

1302
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:09,159
that don't want to invest 80 grand they

1303
00:47:07,639 --> 00:47:11,118
just bring their seeds here we clean

1304
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:13,358
them we can rock it out you know and

1305
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:15,160
it's like a one- day thing rather than a

1306
00:47:13,358 --> 00:47:17,159
whole week or two weeks there was a

1307
00:47:15,159 --> 00:47:19,679
point where it took us two weeks to

1308
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:21,239
clean seeds you know 12 years ago or

1309
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:23,118
something like that look at this and we

1310
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:25,639
could do all that and like and these are

1311
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:29,519
all the the degrades right so this like

1312
00:47:25,639 --> 00:47:30,838
C and degrades don't germinate uh but

1313
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:33,159
yeah stuff that used to take us two

1314
00:47:30,838 --> 00:47:35,759
weeks now takes us a day you know with

1315
00:47:33,159 --> 00:47:37,440
Automation and tools and equipment but

1316
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,720
and it's not cheap but at the same time

1317
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:42,679
it pays for itself yeah you look at the

1318
00:47:39,719 --> 00:47:44,959
labor on a week you know this stuff this

1319
00:47:42,679 --> 00:47:46,719
stuff totally pays for itself yeah

1320
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:49,079
definitely so what do you guys see the

1321
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:52,879
future of the industry up in Humble as

1322
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:54,680
oh man let you run you with I think it's

1323
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:57,039
going to be challenging for a few years

1324
00:47:54,679 --> 00:47:59,399
and it's looking a little Bleak right

1325
00:47:57,039 --> 00:48:02,199
now but I believe it's going to find its

1326
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,880
um Open Door its pathway forward and I

1327
00:48:02,199 --> 00:48:05,960
really think that the small farmers

1328
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:08,240
really need to focus on those Legacy

1329
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:11,480
strains that nobody else in the world

1330
00:48:08,239 --> 00:48:14,118
has and then um it's about marketing and

1331
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:16,358
branding and educating the consumer and

1332
00:48:14,119 --> 00:48:19,000
hopefully that those tpine profiles

1333
00:48:16,358 --> 00:48:22,440
really resonate with them and they like

1334
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:25,880
it and then um then you're you know Off

1335
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:27,800
to the Races but um it's really about

1336
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:29,480
our story I think Federal legalization

1337
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:31,599
it's going to highlight the stories of

1338
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:34,159
the Emerald Triangle and really what

1339
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:36,559
created a multi-billion dollar industry

1340
00:48:34,159 --> 00:48:38,719
right yeah that's my opinion so where is

1341
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:40,640
it going it's going to be tough for the

1342
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:41,838
next couple years many of our friends

1343
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:46,039
aren't going to survive and that's

1344
00:48:41,838 --> 00:48:48,400
really sad to to both of us and um I

1345
00:48:46,039 --> 00:48:51,519
think one of the biggest losses that

1346
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:53,280
could occur with that is some of these

1347
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:56,798
amazing Farmers that are in the Hills

1348
00:48:53,280 --> 00:49:00,000
right now might hold the key to having

1349
00:48:56,798 --> 00:49:03,239
some cure for um autism or some kind of

1350
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,960
cancer and with them going away so might

1351
00:49:03,239 --> 00:49:07,318
their legacy genetics that might have

1352
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,960
that ability and so we could be missing

1353
00:49:07,318 --> 00:49:12,880
a big opportunity and I hope that's not

1354
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:13,960
the case yeah I mean and with with that

1355
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,599
side of it I feel like we're just

1356
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,960
scratching the surface and understanding

1357
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:19,680
it you know they're further ahead in

1358
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,679
Israel they've been doing uh trials for

1359
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:24,318
years you know curing

1360
00:49:21,679 --> 00:49:26,838
ailments uh working working with the

1361
00:49:24,318 --> 00:49:30,039
plant uh for stuff like olster of

1362
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:31,838
colitis and GI issues you know I think

1363
00:49:30,039 --> 00:49:35,358
they've cured something like 80% of the

1364
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:37,719
cases of ulcer of colitis and Crohn's

1365
00:49:35,358 --> 00:49:39,519
with cannabis with cannabinoids you know

1366
00:49:37,719 --> 00:49:41,399
Jason always has stomach issues and

1367
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:45,199
stuff and he was just you know talking

1368
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:47,240
the other day how can country farms good

1369
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:50,239
friend of ours up in in humo county has

1370
00:49:47,239 --> 00:49:52,000
a a unique award-winning cult ofar can

1371
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:53,838
country 26 he just names all his

1372
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,719
strengths just right because he has all

1373
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:59,759
these genetics and um this is a

1374
00:49:56,719 --> 00:50:03,239
generally a lower THC super high in

1375
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:04,760
osine and Jason was making tea out of it

1376
00:50:03,239 --> 00:50:07,239
and it was really helping his stomach

1377
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:09,160
and and him sleeping at night so nice

1378
00:50:07,239 --> 00:50:11,598
yeah yeah I mean I think you know we do

1379
00:50:09,159 --> 00:50:14,039
have a big uphill battle um in our area

1380
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:16,519
I think a lot of it is you know a lot of

1381
00:50:14,039 --> 00:50:19,358
us we don't like change you know in our

1382
00:50:16,519 --> 00:50:20,679
area it's just been it's old school and

1383
00:50:19,358 --> 00:50:22,159
so it's like the stuff that me and

1384
00:50:20,679 --> 00:50:24,358
Johnny have had to go through to get to

1385
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:26,399
this point is a lot of change we've had

1386
00:50:24,358 --> 00:50:28,199
to deal with and you know we try to get

1387
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,559
a lot of our friends you know come to

1388
00:50:28,199 --> 00:50:32,000
podcast to get interviews you know and a

1389
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:33,319
lot of people they're pissed you know

1390
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,079
they put their whole life into this and

1391
00:50:33,318 --> 00:50:37,400
they're kind of watching their you know

1392
00:50:35,079 --> 00:50:39,280
their culture slip away from them so

1393
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:41,880
right you know I think you know it's

1394
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:44,079
it's going to take a while but if people

1395
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:45,599
stick with it and just don't try to

1396
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:47,160
expand to the point where you're growing

1397
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:49,200
a bunch of crap because there is no room

1398
00:50:47,159 --> 00:50:51,239
for crap on the market anymore yeah I

1399
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:52,639
mean you so if you still grow really

1400
00:50:51,239 --> 00:50:54,679
really good weed you're going to be able

1401
00:50:52,639 --> 00:50:56,679
to sell it you know it's just you have

1402
00:50:54,679 --> 00:50:59,358
to change a little you can't you can't

1403
00:50:56,679 --> 00:51:01,039
just sit back and and and wait watch it

1404
00:50:59,358 --> 00:51:02,598
anymore because it's happening you know

1405
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:05,358
this is this movement's happening with

1406
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:07,280
or without you yeah so what was the

1407
00:51:05,358 --> 00:51:09,159
first genetic that you remember from

1408
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,760
Humble when when you were up there what

1409
00:51:09,159 --> 00:51:12,759
was the name genetic were you guys

1410
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:14,720
growing Colombian gold or we were

1411
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:16,280
growing this strain I just remember

1412
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:19,118
growing with my mom a strain called

1413
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:21,519
Froot Loops which was the blueberry cush

1414
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:24,599
and we crossed it with my mom's best

1415
00:51:21,519 --> 00:51:27,280
friend um to a lavender cush and we

1416
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:29,480
created the Froot Loops yeah and you

1417
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:31,680
know that's a weird name I heard that

1418
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:34,838
name to that was in the 80s or that was

1419
00:51:31,679 --> 00:51:37,798
in the early early 80s

1420
00:51:34,838 --> 00:51:39,239
late still a little obsolete Allan

1421
00:51:37,798 --> 00:51:40,880
obsolete I believe was talking about

1422
00:51:39,239 --> 00:51:43,199
Froot Loops as well it's interesting

1423
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,680
yeah um so yeah I don't know if it was

1424
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:46,318
the best strain in the world but like I

1425
00:51:44,679 --> 00:51:48,399
said it had its benefits where it was

1426
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:50,279
super early we harvested it early and

1427
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,200
sold it early and it was just about the

1428
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:54,798
weight you know like orange crush you

1429
00:51:52,199 --> 00:51:57,118
know the crinkle we had you know it's

1430
00:51:54,798 --> 00:51:58,759
then we went to the Head headband

1431
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:00,960
the white widows and you s like white

1432
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:04,119
widows still somewhere around there but

1433
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:05,760
you know my favorite was thek hardest

1434
00:52:04,119 --> 00:52:08,318
one to grow and that was the beginning

1435
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:10,920
of yielding yeah it was just tiny it was

1436
00:52:08,318 --> 00:52:13,079
but we found oursel you know putting ice

1437
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:15,200
in the water icing out the beds watering

1438
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:16,798
it with raspberry juice turned purple

1439
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:18,639
turn purple and it was hard back then

1440
00:52:16,798 --> 00:52:20,318
there wasn't really many purple strains

1441
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:22,039
yeah and that's that's why I was

1442
00:52:20,318 --> 00:52:24,599
actually the most excited with the Lance

1443
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:26,239
is cuz I have a hint of that Urkle taste

1444
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:28,960
nice and that's that's pretty much one

1445
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:31,279
of my favorite flavors you know but yeah

1446
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,838
there was I'm thinking these old strains

1447
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,880
there's there was a lot Granddaddy

1448
00:52:32,838 --> 00:52:38,519
Purple granddaddy was in there was like

1449
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:39,720
the your dad what Supergirl yeah yeah

1450
00:52:38,519 --> 00:52:42,480
well that's that's his that's the one

1451
00:52:39,719 --> 00:52:44,358
he's been he bred so it actually Harvest

1452
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,119
early basically before the rains but

1453
00:52:44,358 --> 00:52:47,519
yeah I think it's like this big right

1454
00:52:46,119 --> 00:52:50,079
yeah it doesn't really work on the

1455
00:52:47,519 --> 00:52:51,400
market anymore that in a jar yeah it

1456
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:53,280
doesn't work to the market like I said

1457
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:55,200
You' go to every one of my you know

1458
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:58,000
friends parents house and everybody

1459
00:52:55,199 --> 00:53:00,159
would have a big bud in aass too is what

1460
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,400
I was going to say gra AP definitely

1461
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:04,759
grae ape and GDP and I don't they're

1462
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:06,680
both purple but I don't think they're

1463
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:07,880
really related we hear stories about

1464
00:53:06,679 --> 00:53:10,519
them being you know I mean they're

1465
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:12,358
probably related to URL yeah but uh I

1466
00:53:10,519 --> 00:53:14,719
mean even Jack you know or you know it's

1467
00:53:12,358 --> 00:53:18,039
like Jack the old so the old school Jack

1468
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:19,719
was [ __ ] amazing yeah it was it's not

1469
00:53:18,039 --> 00:53:22,838
like the new Jack that we really see

1470
00:53:19,719 --> 00:53:25,118
very often uh the last time I've saw

1471
00:53:22,838 --> 00:53:27,599
real Jack was in LA uh Brett from

1472
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:30,318
terraform gen was growing some old

1473
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:33,599
school Jack that was like really pungent

1474
00:53:30,318 --> 00:53:37,159
and strong and very like very layered in

1475
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:39,480
in tpin and flavors and you smoke it and

1476
00:53:37,159 --> 00:53:43,558
it's not just linear it there was a lot

1477
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:45,318
of depth to it and it was strong and and

1478
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:47,359
really really strong yeah that's

1479
00:53:45,318 --> 00:53:49,558
terpinolene right is that that tpine

1480
00:53:47,358 --> 00:53:52,119
yeah tpine yeah it' be kind of fun to

1481
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:54,079
grab and not just lanine right so it'd

1482
00:53:52,119 --> 00:53:56,119
be kind of fun just to grab you know we

1483
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:58,920
know so many old schoolers have been

1484
00:53:56,119 --> 00:54:00,720
holding seeds for 30 plus years just to

1485
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:02,358
grab little packs and like do a little

1486
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:04,598
thing that's what I really wanted to ask

1487
00:54:02,358 --> 00:54:07,159
you I had this one that I remember

1488
00:54:04,599 --> 00:54:10,640
getting out of a a little stash box that

1489
00:54:07,159 --> 00:54:12,920
we used to grow I have maybe 12 or 15

1490
00:54:10,639 --> 00:54:14,440
seeds left a friend of mine found it and

1491
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:16,480
he was remodeling his house it was

1492
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:18,480
behind the sheetrock and he gave them

1493
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,838
back to me but it was like one of my

1494
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:23,559
favorite strains ever but they're like

1495
00:54:20,838 --> 00:54:25,679
40 years old I mean it I've tried all

1496
00:54:23,559 --> 00:54:29,599
the techniques and you know the internet

1497
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:31,639
stuff definitely need some Advanced help

1498
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:33,359
but they they were amazing as far as I

1499
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:35,039
could remember I was I wanted to ask you

1500
00:54:33,358 --> 00:54:37,719
about that so we had mixed results with

1501
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:39,480
embryo rescue uh there's a you get past

1502
00:54:37,719 --> 00:54:42,558
a certain point and there's too much

1503
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:45,679
temperature too many temperature swings

1504
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:47,640
and it doesn't work hourse sometimes it

1505
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:49,838
does sometimes it doesn't it's not a for

1506
00:54:47,639 --> 00:54:51,279
sure thing I was hoping that it was

1507
00:54:49,838 --> 00:54:53,159
because we had some 20 plus year old

1508
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:55,880
seeds that we couldn't get to germinate

1509
00:54:53,159 --> 00:54:59,480
cannabis Brothers my partner Justin DSG

1510
00:54:55,880 --> 00:55:01,240
labs a apical biotech he did some embryo

1511
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:04,240
rescue tried to do with them and their

1512
00:55:01,239 --> 00:55:06,719
seeds just didn't pop and so and Josh

1513
00:55:04,239 --> 00:55:08,078
Freeman uh he had some seeds they tried

1514
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:10,719
to do embryo rescue it doesn't always

1515
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:12,798
work but sometimes I what Lu yeah I know

1516
00:55:10,719 --> 00:55:15,078
what if we just had a little batch from

1517
00:55:12,798 --> 00:55:16,880
you know 20 that's like Time Capsule

1518
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:19,280
yeah if you have enough seeds a lot of

1519
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:20,880
times you might find one it seemed like

1520
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:23,119
they cracked in that maybe there was a

1521
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:25,039
little tail but it just mushed out I

1522
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:26,358
even tried to help it you know like

1523
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:28,640
that's the one where if you can get a

1524
00:55:26,358 --> 00:55:30,880
tail you really need some sort of embryo

1525
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:33,920
rescue to try to do it and it needs to

1526
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:36,200
be in a controlled environment uh yeah I

1527
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:38,280
think they need to do it in agar and a

1528
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:40,639
petri dish and be able to add hormones

1529
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:42,359
to it to try to boost the life of it

1530
00:55:40,639 --> 00:55:43,960
yeah but yeah I had blue dream seeds

1531
00:55:42,358 --> 00:55:46,358
that were really old too and I love them

1532
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:49,000
that like the most stable plant ever the

1533
00:55:46,358 --> 00:55:50,798
s1's uh you would get four phenotypes

1534
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,079
you get one that was spot on Blue Dream

1535
00:55:50,798 --> 00:55:54,639
and then one that lead lean towards the

1536
00:55:53,079 --> 00:55:57,599
blueberry side and one that lean towards

1537
00:55:54,639 --> 00:55:59,519
the silver side and and uh one that was

1538
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:01,000
just not quite as good as blue dream

1539
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:04,038
that wasn't as big of a yielder and

1540
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:07,039
wasn't as vigorous of a plant but like

1541
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:08,720
those four uh you you don't see s1's

1542
00:56:07,039 --> 00:56:10,920
like that anymore you don't see plants

1543
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:12,639
like that very often that are so stable

1544
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:14,760
I know I kind of feel like you know the

1545
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:17,118
market has turned into just the Classic

1546
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:19,640
purple bud right you know and there's so

1547
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:20,960
many similarities so I do feel that if

1548
00:56:19,639 --> 00:56:23,000
you could find something that's

1549
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,920
different right now it's gonna help you

1550
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,960
know and I mean I swear the cross that

1551
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:29,200
we did together is

1552
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:32,240
it seemed like like the green crack and

1553
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:34,639
the the blue dreams and the sour Dees

1554
00:56:32,239 --> 00:56:36,439
tried to make a comeback last year yeah

1555
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:38,199
like I don't know if if they will

1556
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:40,798
eventually I think they I think

1557
00:56:38,199 --> 00:56:43,000
everything comes full circle I think you

1558
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:44,599
know whether it's fashion or whatever H

1559
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:47,000
you know I think there's always going to

1560
00:56:44,599 --> 00:56:49,240
be a place especially in my heart for OG

1561
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:52,400
Kush and for sour diesel you just don't

1562
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:53,919
really see the same Sour Diesel uh skunk

1563
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,760
you know we talk about it a lot but

1564
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:57,519
skunk is like another one where I feel

1565
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,599
like I haven't seen it in a really long

1566
00:56:57,519 --> 00:57:03,239
time and I was talking the other day

1567
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:05,200
with uh Mike and Rick about it and Mike

1568
00:57:03,239 --> 00:57:06,879
was saying he believes maybe that it was

1569
00:57:05,199 --> 00:57:08,199
because everybody was growing from seed

1570
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,599
and that's why we were getting a lot of

1571
00:57:08,199 --> 00:57:11,639
those skunk expressions and now that

1572
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:13,359
we're doing the Clones more you're not

1573
00:57:11,639 --> 00:57:14,920
really seeing it but I have yet to see

1574
00:57:13,358 --> 00:57:17,719
it I'm gonna see it one of these days

1575
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:19,400
and you know that we didn't even call it

1576
00:57:17,719 --> 00:57:21,199
skunk back in the day it was like we' go

1577
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:23,519
to Santa Cruz and pick up the strawberry

1578
00:57:21,199 --> 00:57:26,159
Bud because it was strawberry shaped

1579
00:57:23,519 --> 00:57:27,759
nuggets so there was like green bud and

1580
00:57:26,159 --> 00:57:30,519
round bud and then people kind of threw

1581
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:32,440
in some names this is early 90s yeah I

1582
00:57:30,519 --> 00:57:34,719
mean just the the technology in this

1583
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:36,559
last five years yeah I mean like I said

1584
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:37,919
when I talk with you and you know your

1585
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:41,240
book you're showing me and what you're

1586
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:42,639
saying it's just it's crazy to me know

1587
00:57:41,239 --> 00:57:44,078
just getting more advaned and more

1588
00:57:42,639 --> 00:57:45,400
advanced I know like I said eventually

1589
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:47,318
there will be that Library where you

1590
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:49,599
could just pick exactly how you want

1591
00:57:47,318 --> 00:57:50,639
your strain to be and pop it out but

1592
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:52,599
it's like I'm going to stick with the

1593
00:57:50,639 --> 00:57:55,558
old school style yeah and you know it's

1594
00:57:52,599 --> 00:57:57,440
like for me it's hard it takes more time

1595
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:59,599
but it's just rewarding you know I love

1596
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:01,280
it taking lots of notes I think is great

1597
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:02,880
and then from year to year CU that's the

1598
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:04,920
thing is is like it's like wine from

1599
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,559
year to year you can grow the same thing

1600
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:08,960
and then because of the

1601
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:10,839
environmental uh differences from year

1602
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:12,280
to year it can come out not completely

1603
00:58:10,838 --> 00:58:15,239
different but it can definitely come out

1604
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:16,960
different let me ask you this how long

1605
00:58:15,239 --> 00:58:19,679
Okay so if you

1606
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:22,280
you uh crack a seed you you create a

1607
00:58:19,679 --> 00:58:24,679
mother you love that plant you make a

1608
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:26,519
clone mother out of that how long do you

1609
00:58:24,679 --> 00:58:29,719
think you can continue to cut off off

1610
00:58:26,519 --> 00:58:32,280
that one cultivar before those genetics

1611
00:58:29,719 --> 00:58:33,838
really start to deteriorate I don't know

1612
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:36,640
I mean the genetics are in the plant

1613
00:58:33,838 --> 00:58:38,519
right so that's eded that's a code I

1614
00:58:36,639 --> 00:58:41,078
think that you can restore it through

1615
00:58:38,519 --> 00:58:42,679
tissue culture I can you know so DJ

1616
00:58:41,079 --> 00:58:44,880
Short told me a cool thing back in the

1617
00:58:42,679 --> 00:58:48,159
day he's told me some wild stuff but uh

1618
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:50,440
DJ Short told me a cool thing a long

1619
00:58:48,159 --> 00:58:52,639
time ago when I was super excited about

1620
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:55,240
tissue culture in maybe

1621
00:58:52,639 --> 00:58:56,598
2010 I bumped into him and I was like

1622
00:58:55,239 --> 00:58:58,598
talking about

1623
00:58:56,599 --> 00:59:00,079
these maybe it was 2012 but I was

1624
00:58:58,599 --> 00:59:01,599
talking about Bill Graham kits and

1625
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:03,760
tissue culture and how I think it's the

1626
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:05,760
future and all this stuff and he's like

1627
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:07,760
you know in the Hills we don't use

1628
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:10,960
tissue culture what we do is we put it

1629
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:13,200
in the sun and we put it in the soil you

1630
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:15,039
know in the real soil in the dirt in the

1631
00:59:13,199 --> 00:59:17,078
earth we let it go it gets the

1632
00:59:15,039 --> 00:59:19,440
vibrations of the earth you grow and

1633
00:59:17,079 --> 00:59:21,119
then you take new cuts and so every year

1634
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,798
you you regenerate that plant and you're

1635
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:25,318
taking it from the fastest growing part

1636
00:59:22,798 --> 00:59:28,079
of the plant and I think there's a lot

1637
00:59:25,318 --> 00:59:30,920
of Truth to that I think what happens is

1638
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:34,920
they deteriorate over time from viral

1639
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:36,559
load bacterial load uh stress you know

1640
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:38,480
and then there's epigenetic changes that

1641
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:40,960
we're just now discovering because I

1642
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:43,199
think gelato 33 plays a huge role in

1643
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:44,358
that because there's 10 different things

1644
00:59:43,199 --> 00:59:48,759
named 10 different things and they're

1645
00:59:44,358 --> 00:59:50,279
all either gelato 33 or lcg OG's another

1646
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:52,359
one that where like phos I think they

1647
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:53,920
tested there's like 90 some different

1648
00:59:52,358 --> 00:59:57,199
things with different names but they're

1649
00:59:53,920 --> 01:00:00,079
all OG kush yeah train game the name

1650
00:59:57,199 --> 01:00:03,358
game yeah I mean that that rename game

1651
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:04,960
is just it's silly yeah but yeah I

1652
01:00:03,358 --> 01:00:06,400
wanted to talk about Gorilla Glue

1653
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:08,838
because that's a really special one my

1654
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:11,798
favorite yeah and so they did something

1655
01:00:08,838 --> 01:00:14,159
special which was the exact opposite and

1656
01:00:11,798 --> 01:00:15,639
very counterintuitive to the way I

1657
01:00:14,159 --> 01:00:18,239
thought because we didn't share genetics

1658
01:00:15,639 --> 01:00:19,838
we didn't want genetics to get out you

1659
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:21,239
wouldn't get my sour cut back in the day

1660
01:00:19,838 --> 01:00:23,318
unless you were a part of the family

1661
01:00:21,239 --> 01:00:24,558
right same thing with the OG absolutely

1662
01:00:23,318 --> 01:00:25,679
right and then when we were breeding

1663
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:28,240
back in the day we didn't want to give

1664
01:00:25,679 --> 01:00:29,919
our cuts out at all and then I went to

1665
01:00:28,239 --> 01:00:33,719
The Cup in

1666
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:36,240
2013 in La when Gorilla Glue won and

1667
01:00:33,719 --> 01:00:39,679
they were at the cup giving out clones

1668
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:42,279
of Gorilla Glue and that was the year

1669
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:44,480
Gorilla Glue just changed the CH changed

1670
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:47,160
the world that's one my favorite flavors

1671
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:49,760
almost like a peanut butter choc yeah so

1672
01:00:47,159 --> 01:00:52,038
gorilla was like chocolatey it had the

1673
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:53,720
gas and yeah the real glue glue from

1674
01:00:52,039 --> 01:00:56,520
back in the day was amazing but they

1675
01:00:53,719 --> 01:00:58,639
gave it out of the cup and so so

1676
01:00:56,519 --> 01:01:00,519
everybody had access to it and what

1677
01:00:58,639 --> 01:01:02,239
happened was Sour Diesel was having

1678
01:01:00,519 --> 01:01:03,759
problems plus it was longer flowering

1679
01:01:02,239 --> 01:01:05,838
and people didn't want to have to wait

1680
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:08,720
ugly too unless you have the right one

1681
01:01:05,838 --> 01:01:10,400
and so Gorilla Glue yielded it yielded

1682
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:11,399
really good maybe not as good as sour

1683
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:14,160
but it yielded really good but it

1684
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:17,318
finished faster and so all the growers

1685
01:01:14,159 --> 01:01:19,679
in somoma Menda humble they switched

1686
01:01:17,318 --> 01:01:22,519
from growing sour over to grow Gorilla

1687
01:01:19,679 --> 01:01:25,199
Glue and by giving it out they made the

1688
01:01:22,519 --> 01:01:27,719
strain extremely extremely popular

1689
01:01:25,199 --> 01:01:29,480
extremely well known and it changed kind

1690
01:01:27,719 --> 01:01:30,959
of the map of what was going on

1691
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:32,280
especially with sour diesel back then

1692
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:34,760
and I think Sour Diesel was like one of

1693
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:37,640
the early vectors of hopl and verid we

1694
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:40,039
had we had a time we had where literally

1695
01:01:37,639 --> 01:01:42,118
it ruined people with that the vroid or

1696
01:01:40,039 --> 01:01:43,280
what we didn't know what it was right

1697
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:44,240
yeah what's the other one the stock

1698
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:46,519
it'ss

1699
01:01:44,239 --> 01:01:48,358
Brown yeah I mean we had people they

1700
01:01:46,519 --> 01:01:50,358
were burning down their full indoors

1701
01:01:48,358 --> 01:01:52,400
just ruining everybody's [ __ ] was dying

1702
01:01:50,358 --> 01:01:54,358
and it cost people a lot of money that

1703
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:56,519
kind of made everybody sick of Sour

1704
01:01:54,358 --> 01:01:59,598
Diesel right then you know totally

1705
01:01:56,519 --> 01:02:02,480
yeah I mean Sour Diesel was a it was the

1706
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:04,160
cash crop that was the one for you know

1707
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:05,960
people would come in years straight at

1708
01:02:04,159 --> 01:02:08,960
least you know 4,800 a pound it was

1709
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:11,119
amazing yeah 4,800 a pound 4,500 a pound

1710
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:13,079
and for for outdoor I remember when

1711
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:14,798
outdoor used to go for that much and the

1712
01:02:13,079 --> 01:02:16,119
the sour diesel back in the day you used

1713
01:02:14,798 --> 01:02:18,000
to open up the bag and it would punch

1714
01:02:16,119 --> 01:02:20,559
you in the face with sour diesel smell

1715
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,519
it was it was strong isn't it kind of

1716
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:24,920
funny too is like our Market depended on

1717
01:02:22,519 --> 01:02:26,679
what the East Coast loved yeah it's the

1718
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:28,079
funniest thing that work like well

1719
01:02:26,679 --> 01:02:29,838
that's where you know there was

1720
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:31,480
interstate commerce back then it wasn't

1721
01:02:29,838 --> 01:02:33,159
legal interstate commerce but you know

1722
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:36,599
that Sour Diesel was all going to New

1723
01:02:33,159 --> 01:02:38,960
York too I me 90% of it yeah for sure

1724
01:02:36,599 --> 01:02:40,798
and the OG yeah for sure and OG's gone

1725
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:42,240
through Renditions of different ogs and

1726
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:45,239
headband and you know there was OG

1727
01:02:42,239 --> 01:02:47,598
headband and then more recent years yeah

1728
01:02:45,239 --> 01:02:49,159
and so many renames of stuff the

1729
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:51,599
Skywalker and the

1730
01:02:49,159 --> 01:02:53,239
sfv and you know we had doc OG going

1731
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:54,720
around humbo for a long time that was

1732
01:02:53,239 --> 01:02:56,598
really popular and I think that was a

1733
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:58,919
bigger yielder

1734
01:02:56,599 --> 01:03:00,519
uh and a lot of renames of stuff

1735
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:01,599
definitely you know you touched on

1736
01:03:00,519 --> 01:03:03,519
something that I think is really

1737
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:06,318
important to talk about um a little bit

1738
01:03:03,519 --> 01:03:09,798
at least is that you know the way we

1739
01:03:06,318 --> 01:03:12,358
grow or the way we plan the season

1740
01:03:09,798 --> 01:03:15,759
really for for my farm and for a lot of

1741
01:03:12,358 --> 01:03:17,798
the small farmers um has changed a

1742
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:20,079
little bit like we're really trying to

1743
01:03:17,798 --> 01:03:22,880
hedge our bet and take the least amount

1744
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:25,278
of risk possible too right like growing

1745
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:27,680
a string that you've never grown before

1746
01:03:25,278 --> 01:03:29,639
there's some inherent wrist in that if

1747
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:31,759
you don't know how to grow it growing a

1748
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:35,440
sour diesel that

1749
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:38,160
really harvest in late October or mid

1750
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:40,240
October you know adds an extra month and

1751
01:03:38,159 --> 01:03:42,038
a half to your season especially in the

1752
01:03:40,239 --> 01:03:43,919
Emerald Triangle where you can get those

1753
01:03:42,039 --> 01:03:45,480
early storms that's what happened with a

1754
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:48,200
lot of people that stopped them from

1755
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:50,400
growing outdoor Sour Diesel was some of

1756
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:52,038
those big storms came in early like they

1757
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:54,358
used to do in the 80s and just wiped

1758
01:03:52,039 --> 01:03:56,400
them out ruined their whole crop so you

1759
01:03:54,358 --> 01:03:58,880
know growing a white thorn or some of

1760
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:01,760
these earlier harvesting strains and not

1761
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:05,318
really putting them in ground until mid

1762
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:08,480
June really shortens your season really

1763
01:04:05,318 --> 01:04:10,358
um it kind of there's a lot less risk

1764
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:12,719
when you have a shorter season with

1765
01:04:10,358 --> 01:04:14,480
getting bugs or getting whatever you do

1766
01:04:12,719 --> 01:04:16,118
and well the climate too I mean the

1767
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:18,519
climate I had times I was doing three

1768
01:04:16,119 --> 01:04:20,079
runs right outside pulling pulling tar

1769
01:04:18,519 --> 01:04:22,559
for three runs and now it's like two

1770
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:24,240
barely works by the last two years the

1771
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:25,480
weather was freezing the first rounds

1772
01:04:24,239 --> 01:04:27,639
and you know we're coming out with these

1773
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:29,159
time tiny buds yeah and what do you do

1774
01:04:27,639 --> 01:04:30,719
with that now four or five years ago

1775
01:04:29,159 --> 01:04:32,719
they were like started the Summer

1776
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:34,798
started super early and and it went on

1777
01:04:32,719 --> 01:04:36,519
forever it kind of feel I hate to say

1778
01:04:34,798 --> 01:04:38,278
this but it's starting to feel like the

1779
01:04:36,519 --> 01:04:40,038
depth and the outdoor are the same you

1780
01:04:38,278 --> 01:04:41,559
know what I mean like the pricewise the

1781
01:04:40,039 --> 01:04:42,960
people they're all calling them deps

1782
01:04:41,559 --> 01:04:46,480
that's what I see is like everybody

1783
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:49,240
calls everything dep and it's like dude

1784
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:51,119
whatever starting to call it indoor I me

1785
01:04:49,239 --> 01:04:53,519
honestly it looks like indoor if you do

1786
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:56,880
really good better than indoor I think

1787
01:04:53,519 --> 01:04:58,599
it is the best hands out now with faven

1788
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:00,160
and these under canopies I don't know if

1789
01:04:58,599 --> 01:05:01,960
you guys have trialed under canopies yet

1790
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:04,399
seen them but uh yeah I'll hook you up

1791
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:06,278
with Bobby bags uh to get some under

1792
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:09,400
canopies but man I think they're a big

1793
01:05:06,278 --> 01:05:11,000
game changer for the smalls especially

1794
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:13,039
but also winter runs to be able to do

1795
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,440
winter runs successfully now we've got

1796
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:16,359
these under canopies and your flower

1797
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:18,278
gets purple the ones we I think we

1798
01:05:16,358 --> 01:05:19,598
harvested I don't know a few weeks ago

1799
01:05:18,278 --> 01:05:21,559
so they went through the you know tail

1800
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:23,880
end of the winter I mean Those runs are

1801
01:05:21,559 --> 01:05:25,960
amazing the flower the turps you know

1802
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:28,160
they aren't huge buds but they just

1803
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:29,960
they're different right and so something

1804
01:05:28,159 --> 01:05:32,719
about that mixed light is giving it The

1805
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:34,679
Best of Both Worlds it's hard it's it

1806
01:05:32,719 --> 01:05:36,038
harder than indoor and harder than

1807
01:05:34,679 --> 01:05:38,199
outdoor because you're sitting there

1808
01:05:36,039 --> 01:05:40,200
playing with the full temperatures we

1809
01:05:38,199 --> 01:05:42,038
have we have to have propane you have a

1810
01:05:40,199 --> 01:05:44,278
lot of humidity so you know there's tons

1811
01:05:42,039 --> 01:05:46,240
of De humidifier I mean it's hard and

1812
01:05:44,278 --> 01:05:48,519
it's expensive but the quality of the

1813
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:51,399
product is just insane and I do think

1814
01:05:48,519 --> 01:05:52,759
it's should be more valuable than indoor

1815
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:55,039
and I think we're making a little bit of

1816
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:56,880
Mistake by you know putting them all in

1817
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:58,920
the same thing thing I think what we

1818
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:01,318
really need to be educating the consumer

1819
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:04,079
about is that they're all different

1820
01:06:01,318 --> 01:06:06,038
unique to themselves the mixed light my

1821
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:10,278
mixed light are testing at like you know

1822
01:06:06,039 --> 01:06:13,119
from 24s to 28 my sunr that is garbage

1823
01:06:10,278 --> 01:06:15,039
exactly see my sunr are test they're

1824
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:17,278
they're up in the 30 pluses constantly

1825
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:19,680
I'm kiding I'm kid I'm just saying that

1826
01:06:17,278 --> 01:06:23,079
outdoor is unique to itself and it's a

1827
01:06:19,679 --> 01:06:26,598
little different than mix light and and

1828
01:06:23,079 --> 01:06:29,359
I just don't have mix light I'm jealous

1829
01:06:26,599 --> 01:06:32,000
that the tests alone are are showing you

1830
01:06:29,358 --> 01:06:33,960
know way higher THC with just the the

1831
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:37,000
sunr yeah I mean I've been noticed I

1832
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:38,920
could see it well so growing up I I love

1833
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:41,838
ugly weed too just as much as I love

1834
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:44,400
good-looking weed and I almost feel like

1835
01:06:41,838 --> 01:06:45,798
the consumer if they like it they don't

1836
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:47,880
necessarily need to see it it should be

1837
01:06:45,798 --> 01:06:49,400
about the flavor and the effect and so

1838
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:51,480
many people are focused on the way it

1839
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:53,680
looks be great to I think that'll ever

1840
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:56,159
happen no but it'd be great to be I mean

1841
01:06:53,679 --> 01:06:58,239
you have pre-rolls here right yeah

1842
01:06:56,159 --> 01:07:00,358
it would be great to have the consumer

1843
01:06:58,239 --> 01:07:01,679
trust your brand enough to where they

1844
01:07:00,358 --> 01:07:03,119
didn't care what it looked like because

1845
01:07:01,679 --> 01:07:04,598
they're buying pre-rolls and they love

1846
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:07,599
pre-rolls because of the convenience of

1847
01:07:04,599 --> 01:07:09,278
it but there's consistency with it and

1848
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:10,599
at the end of the day some of the best

1849
01:07:09,278 --> 01:07:13,400
stuff some of the best stuff that we

1850
01:07:10,599 --> 01:07:15,559
don't necessarily pick as winners don't

1851
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:17,400
even have to look at it yeah I mean the

1852
01:07:15,559 --> 01:07:19,559
smell and so even with feno hunting I

1853
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:20,960
give out joints now I don't really let I

1854
01:07:19,559 --> 01:07:22,960
mean I know what good stuff looks like

1855
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:24,318
so I don't really need to share that

1856
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:26,199
with everybody I give them pre-rolls

1857
01:07:24,318 --> 01:07:29,199
then it puts everybody on the same field

1858
01:07:26,199 --> 01:07:31,358
like even playing field so that you can

1859
01:07:29,199 --> 01:07:33,879
get I mean I agree with that even the

1860
01:07:31,358 --> 01:07:36,078
THC if it didn't even say the THC it was

1861
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:37,920
in a black jar you couldn't even see it

1862
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:40,119
what it looks like or in a pre-roll just

1863
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:41,720
let them taste it and test it see they

1864
01:07:40,119 --> 01:07:44,480
like see how they feel I mean like I

1865
01:07:41,719 --> 01:07:46,558
said like the 26 is what 16% I can smoke

1866
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:50,318
it and get super high yeah you know it's

1867
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:54,200
like CBD actually no 20 to1 on hogwash

1868
01:07:50,318 --> 01:07:55,838
is gummies it's like it gets me looed

1869
01:07:54,199 --> 01:07:59,278
well and I think we were referring to it

1870
01:07:55,838 --> 01:08:02,400
being good because back in the days we

1871
01:07:59,278 --> 01:08:04,199
were looking for that rock hard OG

1872
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:06,000
looking Bud because it was easy for the

1873
01:08:04,199 --> 01:08:07,278
trimmers so that made it good because

1874
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,719
they were all super happy and they

1875
01:08:07,278 --> 01:08:11,358
weren't really mad at you um it weighed

1876
01:08:09,719 --> 01:08:12,919
heavy so the pounds weren't like the

1877
01:08:11,358 --> 01:08:14,920
whitethorn rose that are like I can

1878
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:17,239
barely get it in the turkey bag you know

1879
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:19,039
it's this big and so it was good for the

1880
01:08:17,238 --> 01:08:21,158
grower because you had you got more

1881
01:08:19,039 --> 01:08:23,920
weight um there those were some of the

1882
01:08:21,158 --> 01:08:26,879
things why I referred to back in the day

1883
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:29,359
that made it good was an amazing flavor

1884
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:31,560
it got you really stoned but having

1885
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:34,480
those other few little traits to it

1886
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:37,120
really made it good yeah people are

1887
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:38,639
picky these days people are super picky

1888
01:08:37,119 --> 01:08:41,238
and they're not picky about the stuff

1889
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:43,920
that truly matters smoking it most the

1890
01:08:41,238 --> 01:08:45,278
buyers are not smoking the product yeah

1891
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:46,560
they're looking at it they're smelling

1892
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:48,359
it they're looking at it they're basing

1893
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:50,440
it off of looks probably just looks

1894
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:51,798
looks 90% probably price a little bit I

1895
01:08:50,439 --> 01:08:54,000
think price is good but those are two

1896
01:08:51,798 --> 01:08:56,679
different uh customers right I feel like

1897
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,039
there's the guys that don't care they

1898
01:08:56,679 --> 01:08:59,600
just want the cheapest the cheap and

1899
01:08:58,039 --> 01:09:01,399
they smoke a lot those are like the real

1900
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:03,079
smokers too the guys that smoke a lot

1901
01:09:01,399 --> 01:09:05,238
and there's the guys that don't care

1902
01:09:03,079 --> 01:09:07,039
what the price is they want the best

1903
01:09:05,238 --> 01:09:09,039
[ __ ] possible yeah and there are two

1904
01:09:07,039 --> 01:09:10,519
totally different I feel like I feel

1905
01:09:09,039 --> 01:09:13,158
like there's a movement happening though

1906
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:15,679
because I said this earlier I have been

1907
01:09:13,158 --> 01:09:17,358
hit up more probably than ever in this

1908
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:20,719
last few months about you know people

1909
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:23,838
wanting that craft Farm herb on their

1910
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:25,759
shelves and I I just I think it's going

1911
01:09:23,838 --> 01:09:28,000
to work and I always have you know try

1912
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:29,920
not to push it and just sit back and let

1913
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,119
it happen and if it happens it it does

1914
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:32,560
if it doesn't it doesn't you know what I

1915
01:09:31,119 --> 01:09:34,599
mean I've been doing this my whole life

1916
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:36,520
so it's not the end of the world if it

1917
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:38,798
doesn't but I think people are starting

1918
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:42,040
to get it yeah and they're starting to

1919
01:09:38,798 --> 01:09:44,158
understand there is 99% of the weed is

1920
01:09:42,039 --> 01:09:46,399
just it's weed you know and then there's

1921
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:49,079
the special stuff where it's actually

1922
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:51,479
put you know the great you put great

1923
01:09:49,079 --> 01:09:53,640
stuff into the soil you know you feed it

1924
01:09:51,479 --> 01:09:55,439
correctly um you know it's just it's a

1925
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:57,760
unique strain it's not one that you're

1926
01:09:55,439 --> 01:09:59,759
going to get and it's just the same it's

1927
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:01,719
it'll make you feel different it'll feel

1928
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:03,880
better I think one of the problems is

1929
01:10:01,719 --> 01:10:06,239
the distribution model that needs work

1930
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:07,960
right so like cuz oh we need a fresh

1931
01:10:06,238 --> 01:10:09,479
product that's a whole another podcast

1932
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:11,399
right we could do a whole another

1933
01:10:09,479 --> 01:10:14,639
podcast on the distribution model right

1934
01:10:11,399 --> 01:10:15,960
in California because I feel like it

1935
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:17,520
doesn't matter how good it is if they

1936
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:19,119
don't get to it for six months and it's

1937
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:21,199
not stored correctly it's going to be

1938
01:10:19,119 --> 01:10:23,800
trash marketing marketing marketing

1939
01:10:21,198 --> 01:10:25,960
marketing but also being able to get to

1940
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:27,760
a store where people buy enough of it to

1941
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:30,039
where it stays fresh where you can just

1942
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:31,560
constantly be restocking and to where

1943
01:10:30,039 --> 01:10:33,319
they get that after it's been harvested

1944
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:35,640
they're getting it within 6 eight weeks

1945
01:10:33,319 --> 01:10:38,719
at the very most how are we you know as

1946
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:40,480
as being you know small small Brands not

1947
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:42,439
being able to have tons of marketing or

1948
01:10:40,479 --> 01:10:44,238
marketers it's really hard for us to get

1949
01:10:42,439 --> 01:10:45,879
on these shelves and we're going against

1950
01:10:44,238 --> 01:10:47,599
these companies that are just they're

1951
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:50,480
buying shelf space they're they're

1952
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:52,320
filling the shelves you know so for us

1953
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:53,879
I'm scared to actually package a bunch

1954
01:10:52,319 --> 01:10:55,960
of my sungrown because I don't want to

1955
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:57,760
take a giant hit it costs so much to put

1956
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:59,600
it in the packaging to do the artwork

1957
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:02,440
the whole line yeah and so you know to

1958
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:04,600
be able to get more product on the

1959
01:11:02,439 --> 01:11:06,198
shelves and actually be paid on time

1960
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:08,600
then it's like I would actually package

1961
01:11:06,198 --> 01:11:10,879
way more of my herb right you know it's

1962
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:11,960
it's it's a battle it's a battle and

1963
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:13,199
it's something we need to work on

1964
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:14,960
there's so many things we need to work

1965
01:11:13,198 --> 01:11:16,678
on in California you know I think the

1966
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:19,359
over taxation has killed a lot of

1967
01:11:16,679 --> 01:11:22,239
businesses boy yeah um I think there's

1968
01:11:19,359 --> 01:11:24,599
some kind of a lure to um having a

1969
01:11:22,238 --> 01:11:26,759
limited batch you know maybe numbering

1970
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:29,520
your jars saying look I'm going to put

1971
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:31,640
25 lbs this year of the Lance or the

1972
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:33,159
white Thorn Rose in my jars and that's

1973
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:34,600
going to be the only amount that's going

1974
01:11:33,158 --> 01:11:37,158
to be in this year and if you're lucky

1975
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:38,480
enough to get it you do and if not then

1976
01:11:37,158 --> 01:11:42,158
maybe you have to wait till the next

1977
01:11:38,479 --> 01:11:43,839
year but um you know I don't know it's

1978
01:11:42,158 --> 01:11:45,638
been it's there's a big section in my

1979
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:47,360
book about it too and I I believe what

1980
01:11:45,639 --> 01:11:49,159
what I believe the distribution model

1981
01:11:47,359 --> 01:11:50,439
should be with refrigerated trucks and

1982
01:11:49,158 --> 01:11:53,079
there's some people doing it now but

1983
01:11:50,439 --> 01:11:55,319
like dispensaries with refrigeration to

1984
01:11:53,079 --> 01:11:57,119
where they store it correctly trucks

1985
01:11:55,319 --> 01:11:59,719
that bring it to those dispensaries that

1986
01:11:57,119 --> 01:12:01,158
store it correctly and you know if you

1987
01:11:59,719 --> 01:12:02,439
control it right from the farm and it

1988
01:12:01,158 --> 01:12:04,119
goes all the way to the consumer where

1989
01:12:02,439 --> 01:12:05,759
it's stored correctly that's half the

1990
01:12:04,119 --> 01:12:08,079
battle that's a great point because once

1991
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:11,400
it really people need to understand is

1992
01:12:08,079 --> 01:12:13,719
once it leaves our farm we we transport

1993
01:12:11,399 --> 01:12:17,198
it to our manufacturer who puts it in a

1994
01:12:13,719 --> 01:12:19,319
jar then trans it's out of our hands if

1995
01:12:17,198 --> 01:12:22,479
they leave it in the sun or however they

1996
01:12:19,319 --> 01:12:26,399
end up Trea rosin is like rosin too it's

1997
01:12:22,479 --> 01:12:28,279
got be the the maybe more so as far as I

1998
01:12:26,399 --> 01:12:29,920
understand but you know sometimes I

1999
01:12:28,279 --> 01:12:31,719
think people could end up with something

2000
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:33,319
that's you're like oh wow this isn't

2001
01:12:31,719 --> 01:12:35,679
cured that good or it wasn't taken care

2002
01:12:33,319 --> 01:12:37,759
very good but they need to understand it

2003
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:40,079
it it was it was amazing until it left

2004
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:41,920
our hands and so we're trying to find

2005
01:12:40,079 --> 01:12:44,079
Partners all the way down the supply

2006
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:46,880
chain that treat it like you said

2007
01:12:44,079 --> 01:12:48,600
Refrigeration trucks and delivered to

2008
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:51,400
and just putting our brand out there you

2009
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:52,920
know it's like people look down you know

2010
01:12:51,399 --> 01:12:55,399
yeah I work with cookies but look at how

2011
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:57,800
many people they've got you know that

2012
01:12:55,399 --> 01:12:59,479
trust cookies that won't trust our small

2013
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:01,760
Brands you know and they'll actually buy

2014
01:12:59,479 --> 01:13:05,000
my product for that and then they love

2015
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:06,880
it you know what I mean so it's like you

2016
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:08,679
sometimes you have to just you work with

2017
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:11,039
people and they they have amazing

2018
01:13:08,679 --> 01:13:12,480
marketing and they help basically what

2019
01:13:11,039 --> 01:13:14,238
I'm saying is all you have to do is get

2020
01:13:12,479 --> 01:13:16,638
our product into people's hands that

2021
01:13:14,238 --> 01:13:18,638
would never have smoked our weed before

2022
01:13:16,639 --> 01:13:20,279
yeah and they smoke it and they love it

2023
01:13:18,639 --> 01:13:22,760
so that it's it's just a battle for us

2024
01:13:20,279 --> 01:13:25,319
to be able to get to that point right

2025
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:27,639
you know marketing we need help that's

2026

2041
01:13:55,639 --> 01:13:59,960
evolutionaries we're all revolutionaries

2042
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:01,880
in some way you know but I think just

2043
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:04,560
just working with the plant makes us

2044
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:06,079
special um we appreciate it man because

2045
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:08,120
it's like I said this is how we could

2046
01:14:06,079 --> 01:14:10,920
get our story get our name you know well

2047
01:14:08,119 --> 01:14:12,719
you guys deserve the platform it's it's

2048
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:14,199
it's for you our whole area deserves it

2049
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:16,198
though that's that's a funny thing is me

2050
01:14:14,198 --> 01:14:18,279
and Johnny we're doing our best to

2051
01:14:16,198 --> 01:14:20,479
represent but it's like gosh there's so

2052
01:14:18,279 --> 01:14:22,960
many good people so many amazing farmers

2053
01:14:20,479 --> 01:14:25,599
in our area that they deserve just as

2054
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:27,039
much credit as we do if not more they

2055
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:28,560
haven't had that point they haven't had

2056
01:14:27,039 --> 01:14:30,158
the call from James you know what I mean

2057
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:32,159
because you don't know him yeah but I

2058
01:14:30,158 --> 01:14:34,158
will or or there's a possibility and

2059
01:14:32,158 --> 01:14:35,719
then the Next Generation the Next upand

2060
01:14:34,158 --> 01:14:38,719
cominging Generation man we got to set

2061
01:14:35,719 --> 01:14:40,639
an example for the kids that are coming

2062
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:43,039
behind us you know because I feel like

2063
01:14:40,639 --> 01:14:44,400
we're on the shoulders especially us you

2064
01:14:43,039 --> 01:14:46,920
know we're on the shoulders of giants

2065
01:14:44,399 --> 01:14:48,638
like yourself guys that did it and I I

2066
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:50,560
think there's a responsibility that we

2067
01:14:48,639 --> 01:14:55,319
have to the plant and to the people that

2068
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:58,480
came before us uh to really tell the

2069
01:14:55,319 --> 01:15:00,359
true story be authentic with what we do

2070
01:14:58,479 --> 01:15:02,599
and to be able to pass the plant on in

2071
01:15:00,359 --> 01:15:03,359
the way that it was given to us you know

2072
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:05,440
and I

2073
01:15:03,359 --> 01:15:06,920
think it's not always the case with

2074
01:15:05,439 --> 01:15:09,759
people sometimes it's a focus about

2075
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:12,119
money sometimes it's a focus about ego

2076
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:14,840
but if you can take that out of it and

2077
01:15:12,119 --> 01:15:16,399
and share the passion for the plant yes

2078
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:19,000
you know I think that is that's super

2079
01:15:16,399 --> 01:15:21,319
contagious and then the beauty of this

2080
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:23,479
stuff like white Thorn Rose and Skittles

2081
01:15:21,319 --> 01:15:25,479
and some of these things that maybe some

2082
01:15:23,479 --> 01:15:27,039
of the Diehard guys they're like I like

2083
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:29,079
gas or I like this stuff that's super

2084
01:15:27,039 --> 01:15:30,639
strong but the beauty of that stuff is I

2085
01:15:29,079 --> 01:15:32,760
feel like like white Thorn Rose you can

2086
01:15:30,639 --> 01:15:34,840
give a rosin pen to anybody in the world

2087
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:36,360
that it smokes cannabis or not they

2088
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:38,440
could taste it and they could appreciate

2089
01:15:36,359 --> 01:15:40,238
the flavor it's very relatable

2090
01:15:38,439 --> 01:15:43,039
especially when you get stuff like roses

2091
01:15:40,238 --> 01:15:44,399
or candy or some of these other things

2092
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:45,880
like I mean I feel like the Ridgeline

2093
01:15:44,399 --> 01:15:48,279
runs when I first tasted it the same

2094
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:50,400
thing it was like you get this there

2095
01:15:48,279 --> 01:15:52,800
there's candy you know in the front and

2096
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:54,359
then there's complexity with it mhm but

2097
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:56,679
uh and then the Lance is another one but

2098
01:15:54,359 --> 01:15:59,519
the rid line r i first tasted that up in

2099
01:15:56,679 --> 01:16:01,000
humbled I think about three years ago uh

2100
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:04,719
before you won the cup and then you guys

2101
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:06,439
had won the cup right after and uh you

2102
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:08,960
know it's there's something to to be

2103
01:16:06,439 --> 01:16:10,238
said about special genetics like that

2104
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:11,760
whether you like them whether you don't

2105
01:16:10,238 --> 01:16:13,678
like them but they're something that

2106
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:15,159
could be appreciated by everybody

2107
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:16,920
exactly and they're unique you know it's

2108
01:16:15,158 --> 01:16:19,238
like the Green Lantern that one there is

2109
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:22,279
completely different yeah and it's it's

2110
01:16:19,238 --> 01:16:24,000
just so strong the high of it is just a

2111
01:16:22,279 --> 01:16:26,158
whole different level what it does to

2112
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:28,158
your body literally makes you feel like

2113
01:16:26,158 --> 01:16:30,119
you're almost on mushrooms yeah you know

2114
01:16:28,158 --> 01:16:33,079
but it goes away quick you know so it's

2115
01:16:30,119 --> 01:16:34,719
like everything these unique strains you

2116
01:16:33,079 --> 01:16:37,279
know I think we shouldn't let them get

2117
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:40,158
lost and just everybody's so focused on

2118
01:16:37,279 --> 01:16:41,880
the same same strains the same candy

2119
01:16:40,158 --> 01:16:43,599
flavors but there's so much more out

2120
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:45,279
there you know yeah well I mean people

2121
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:47,360
get fixated on stuff and it happened

2122
01:16:45,279 --> 01:16:49,960
with Hayes in the you know the early

2123
01:16:47,359 --> 01:16:51,799
2000s late 90s I heard the Lemon Cherry

2124
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:53,319
J Lemon Cherry J I kept hearing it over

2125
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:55,760
and over I didn't never even smoked it

2126
01:16:53,319 --> 01:16:58,198
you know finally started SM some I mean

2127
01:16:55,760 --> 01:17:00,320
it's fine it's just I was expecting

2128
01:16:58,198 --> 01:17:03,599
something so great because everybody

2129
01:17:00,319 --> 01:17:06,599
it's hype this game is 99% hype it seems

2130
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:08,520
like you know and well it's consumed by

2131
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:11,239
people that aren't connoisseurs

2132
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:13,000
necessarily and it's also the Instagram

2133
01:17:11,238 --> 01:17:14,519
world you don't get to smell it on

2134
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,880
Instagram so you're you're looking at

2135
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:18,280
the phone and you're like man that

2136
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:19,679
stuff's amazing but it's like maybe it's

2137
01:17:18,279 --> 01:17:22,279
amazing everybody's like you grow the

2138
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:24,520
best okay we grow some amazing weed but

2139
01:17:22,279 --> 01:17:27,319
my weed's not always perfect I deal with

2140
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:29,080
you know shitty ass weed here but if you

2141
01:17:27,319 --> 01:17:31,079
take a picture of it from the right not

2142
01:17:29,079 --> 01:17:33,198
take dire of shitty weed though you know

2143
01:17:31,079 --> 01:17:34,439
what I mean it's like we're just we're

2144
01:17:33,198 --> 01:17:36,359
being a grower you're never going to

2145
01:17:34,439 --> 01:17:38,119
grow all good weed that's it's

2146
01:17:36,359 --> 01:17:40,158
impossible especially you go to my

2147
01:17:38,119 --> 01:17:42,158
little farm and there's 25 different

2148
01:17:40,158 --> 01:17:44,519
strains that I have no idea what they're

2149
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:48,039
going to do you know I sacrifice a lot

2150
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:50,080
of my f to new strains because I enjoy

2151
01:17:48,039 --> 01:17:52,039
it it's I'm going to lose my ass I'm not

2152
01:17:50,079 --> 01:17:53,600
going to make money on it but I'm seeing

2153
01:17:52,039 --> 01:17:55,840
what what a new strain's going to do

2154
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:57,760
you're growing it you you have no idea

2155
01:17:55,840 --> 01:18:00,520
in watching it what it creates and it's

2156
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:03,079
exciting and sometimes it's really

2157
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:05,199
depressing because it turns into [ __ ]

2158
01:18:03,079 --> 01:18:06,600
right but there's those unicorns you get

2159
01:18:05,198 --> 01:18:09,198
where all of a sudden you're like oh my

2160
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:11,159
God I call it Johnny Johnny we got one

2161
01:18:09,198 --> 01:18:12,759
you know he gets excited oh geez and all

2162
01:18:11,158 --> 01:18:14,198
of a sudden we're back and forth and

2163
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:16,320
that's what's happening with our strain

2164
01:18:14,198 --> 01:18:18,039
together I mean we have we have a few we

2165
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:20,639
have multiple I had smoked one of the

2166
01:18:18,039 --> 01:18:23,279
fenos the other day that actually threw

2167
01:18:20,639 --> 01:18:25,119
out prior because it didn't look as good

2168
01:18:23,279 --> 01:18:26,960
he's trying to go dig it up in the it's

2169
01:18:25,119 --> 01:18:29,319
in the compost

2170
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:30,639
pile I'm smoking this thing and it's

2171
01:18:29,319 --> 01:18:33,399
like you break it up it has like a

2172
01:18:30,639 --> 01:18:36,039
lavender look but it tastes like a

2173
01:18:33,399 --> 01:18:38,198
grapefruit yeah I'm just like oh my God

2174
01:18:36,039 --> 01:18:39,639
and and I threw it out already yeah but

2175
01:18:38,198 --> 01:18:40,919
we have other seeds of it we can find it

2176
01:18:39,639 --> 01:18:42,800
again we have other but that I mean

2177
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:44,920
that's the beauty I mean this is this is

2178
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:47,880
the actual art this is what's this is

2179
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:49,920
what's sparking my you know the flame

2180
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:51,199
again is is this is the breeding to me

2181
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:53,880
you know I'd rather do that than just

2182
01:18:51,198 --> 01:18:55,519
grow a field of weed any day of the week

2183
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:56,880
well it gets superc with breeding

2184
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:58,159
because you never know really what

2185
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:00,760
you're going to end up with you know

2186
01:18:58,158 --> 01:19:02,479
your lines at a certain point you you

2187
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:04,800
really start understanding your lines

2188
01:19:02,479 --> 01:19:06,000
and what your uh genetics are going to

2189
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:07,480
contribute but then you start putting

2190
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,560
them on other things and you don't

2191
01:19:07,479 --> 01:19:11,718
really know what's going to come out uh

2192
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:13,239
you can guess but it's not always

2193
01:19:11,719 --> 01:19:15,198
exactly what you think and so there's

2194
01:19:13,238 --> 01:19:17,519
that element of surprise where you have

2195
01:19:15,198 --> 01:19:19,319
to wait three months after you've made

2196
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:21,159
the seeds and made the cross it could be

2197
01:19:19,319 --> 01:19:22,840
six months from the time you decided or

2198
01:19:21,158 --> 01:19:24,960
a year from the time that you decided to

2199
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:26,920
make the cross before you actually see a

2200
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:28,880
finished product and so there's

2201
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:30,679
something to be said about patience and

2202
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:32,840
waiting and to be able to see something

2203
01:19:30,679 --> 01:19:35,600
special and magical and sometimes it's

2204
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:37,360
not but looking for those opport lots of

2205
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:39,400
times it's not lots of times you think

2206
01:19:37,359 --> 01:19:41,319
it's going to be a way a certain way and

2207
01:19:39,399 --> 01:19:43,759
it's counterintuitive and it ends up

2208
01:19:41,319 --> 01:19:45,119
being the opposite or you might find

2209
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:46,440
something that's completely different

2210
01:19:45,119 --> 01:19:48,079
where you're like I don't even know

2211
01:19:46,439 --> 01:19:50,599
where this came from you know some of

2212
01:19:48,079 --> 01:19:52,960
these amazing how certain strains are so

2213
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:55,440
I mean I crossed into like gushman yeah

2214
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:56,319
certain strains just hold their stra you

2215
01:19:55,439 --> 01:19:59,719
know

2216
01:19:56,319 --> 01:20:01,799
they I mean it's amazing producer yeah

2217
01:19:59,719 --> 01:20:03,760
and it's it's the bag appe peel is fine

2218
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:05,840
I it doesn't smoke good it's like ice

2219
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:07,880
cream cake 2.0 yeah I mean it's a

2220
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:10,719
producer and so at the end of the day

2221
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:13,079
sad to say it's like okay it could be a

2222
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:15,039
couple points less than Lance but if

2223
01:20:13,079 --> 01:20:16,679
you're going to grow 30% more a lot of

2224
01:20:15,039 --> 01:20:18,039
people will just go that route and

2225
01:20:16,679 --> 01:20:19,520
that's fine you know like I said that's

2226
01:20:18,039 --> 01:20:21,800
a difference of just growing to make

2227
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:24,320
money which we all have to make a living

2228
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:26,159
or or me wasting a whole Greenhouse with

2229
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:28,119
a bunch of different strains that I'm

2230
01:20:26,158 --> 01:20:29,599
that I'm searching for and I like ice

2231
01:20:28,119 --> 01:20:31,319
cream cake don't get me wrong especially

2232
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:33,520
the extract I think is amazing but I

2233
01:20:31,319 --> 01:20:34,799
feel like gush Min is another one where

2234
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:37,600
too many people got a hold of it and

2235
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:39,560
they just blew it out then there was Ice

2236
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:41,639
flavor though either if it was it's more

2237
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:43,679
linear and more subtle but it's okay

2238
01:20:41,639 --> 01:20:45,920
it's like a redwood tree then you can

2239
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:47,880
knock somebody out with it I mean you

2240
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:50,079
know and that's so that's why I wanted

2241
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:51,840
to cross with that with Lance just you

2242
01:20:50,079 --> 01:20:53,439
know for the weight and you know how

2243
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:55,719
strong it is and there's some purple

2244
01:20:53,439 --> 01:20:57,638
ones I did I did find some that actually

2245
01:20:55,719 --> 01:20:59,439
have some really good flavor right but I

2246
01:20:57,639 --> 01:21:02,119
mean that's really it's really fun to

2247
01:20:59,439 --> 01:21:04,279
find strains like that double OG chem I

2248
01:21:02,119 --> 01:21:07,079
mean how many awards has Rebel grown won

2249
01:21:04,279 --> 01:21:09,039
with that tons and so Crossing that I

2250
01:21:07,079 --> 01:21:11,920
have I have multiple that look just like

2251
01:21:09,039 --> 01:21:13,560
it but then I have one that's purple and

2252
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:15,039
has a little more candy to it and that

2253
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:16,639
one I'm going oh my gosh you know what I

2254
01:21:15,039 --> 01:21:20,279
mean even the cheetah piss that we're

2255
01:21:16,639 --> 01:21:22,119
talking about that you know smells okay

2256
01:21:20,279 --> 01:21:24,198
whatever but it's one of it grows

2257
01:21:22,119 --> 01:21:26,359
amazing in my climate it doesn't get

2258
01:21:24,198 --> 01:21:27,919
powder mold so I cross it with the Lance

2259
01:21:26,359 --> 01:21:30,359
and all of a sudden I'm finding one with

2260
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:31,840
flavor nice and so that's I mean that's

2261
01:21:30,359 --> 01:21:33,719
that's kind of the cool thing is being

2262
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:36,039
able to pick a grouping of strains that

2263
01:21:33,719 --> 01:21:38,399
you know you like a little bit of a

2264
01:21:36,039 --> 01:21:40,679
piece of and put it you know put yours

2265
01:21:38,399 --> 01:21:42,679
into there and see what happens right so

2266
01:21:40,679 --> 01:21:45,239
what's nostalgic for you like if you if

2267
01:21:42,679 --> 01:21:48,119
we talk about different oh OG is the

2268
01:21:45,238 --> 01:21:50,359
most nostalgic say OG like a real gassy

2269
01:21:48,119 --> 01:21:53,719
one like I said like tastes like dirt it

2270
01:21:50,359 --> 01:21:55,719
takes you back I mean a lot of times you

2271
01:21:53,719 --> 01:21:57,198
know I still go and smoke with my dad

2272
01:21:55,719 --> 01:21:59,319
and he has some of these old school ones

2273
01:21:57,198 --> 01:22:01,559
that have that krody yeah really carrot

2274
01:21:59,319 --> 01:22:03,439
flavor and that'll bring me back to my

2275
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:05,760
childhood for sure nice you know but

2276
01:22:03,439 --> 01:22:07,839
yeah the OG that the Jack and like a

2277
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:09,520
lemon hay you know something like that

2278
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:11,600
yeah those areon ha you know I think

2279
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:13,920
before we we skip over I think it's

2280
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:16,360
really important for people to to

2281
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:18,639
recognize how many women grower out

2282
01:22:16,359 --> 01:22:20,439
Growers there are out there and the

2283
01:22:18,639 --> 01:22:22,719
excellent job they're doing they they

2284
01:22:20,439 --> 01:22:25,919
were when I was growing up you know the

2285
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:28,880
women always helped and supported the

2286
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:31,399
men and kind of we overlooked is really

2287
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:34,159
playing a significant part in the

2288
01:22:31,399 --> 01:22:37,439
success of your crop and really they

2289
01:22:34,158 --> 01:22:39,479
played just as much of a a role as we

2290
01:22:37,439 --> 01:22:42,799
did and you know now you got people like

2291
01:22:39,479 --> 01:22:45,799
moonmaid Farms Tina and you got uh Soul

2292
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:48,719
Spirit Farms Judy and Walter and Hannah

2293
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:51,000
and Riley at Emerald Queen farms and

2294
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:53,000
like there's some amazing women grower

2295
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:55,600
out there that deserve a lot of credit

2296
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:57,399
and um you know they have a bond I think

2297
01:22:55,600 --> 01:23:00,320
with the plant that is a little bit

2298
01:22:57,399 --> 01:23:01,960
different than ours and um yeah super

2299
01:23:00,319 --> 01:23:03,799
excited to be working with those people

2300
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:06,679
and and really want to acknowledge you

2301
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:09,600
know their their role in the industry

2302
01:23:06,679 --> 01:23:11,679
yeah my mentor was a female her name is

2303
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:15,400
Gypsy and I feel like she kind of put me

2304
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:17,000
on the right path and you know so I have

2305
01:23:15,399 --> 01:23:18,920
an appreciate my mother I have an

2306
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:22,119
appreciation for that and my mother was

2307
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:24,158
a strong female uh she she work she was

2308
01:23:22,119 --> 01:23:25,639
the first female officer at the Bank of

2309
01:23:24,158 --> 01:23:28,479
California back in

2310
01:23:25,639 --> 01:23:31,159
1969 W you know when women weren't

2311
01:23:28,479 --> 01:23:32,959
officers at the bank and so I've always

2312
01:23:31,158 --> 01:23:35,479
had a lot of respect for women and I

2313
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:36,920
feel like cannabis is no different but

2314
01:23:35,479 --> 01:23:38,198
women have a special relationship with

2315
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:42,039
the plant I've

2316
01:23:38,198 --> 01:23:44,359
seen uh Gypsy grow alongside a you know

2317
01:23:42,039 --> 01:23:47,479
a guy and they had houses next to each

2318
01:23:44,359 --> 01:23:50,279
other and her flower the same genetics

2319
01:23:47,479 --> 01:23:52,638
from the same clones hers came out

2320
01:23:50,279 --> 01:23:54,639
better and they did the same thing they

2321
01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:56,359
fed they fed the same they used the same

2322
01:23:54,639 --> 01:23:58,800
soil and there's just a different

2323
01:23:56,359 --> 01:24:00,799
relationship sometimes that people have

2324
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:02,480
with the plant and I feel like you know

2325
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:04,840
we can talk about vibrations and a lot

2326
01:24:02,479 --> 01:24:06,439
of hippie stuff but sometimes there's

2327
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:08,119
just something special that gets passed

2328
01:24:06,439 --> 01:24:09,839
on and that that happens from person to

2329
01:24:08,119 --> 01:24:12,399
person yeah my girlfriend's out there

2330
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:15,480
right now actually while I'm down here

2331
01:24:12,399 --> 01:24:17,238
working Rose my girlfriend you know and

2332
01:24:15,479 --> 01:24:19,079
you know the hippie stuff she she does a

2333
01:24:17,238 --> 01:24:20,839
lot of sound healing and she walks

2334
01:24:19,079 --> 01:24:23,158
around with the gong and does her little

2335
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:25,440
thing and I let her have you know let

2336
01:24:23,158 --> 01:24:27,319
her do her thing and stuff and you know

2337
01:24:25,439 --> 01:24:29,479
I think uh when you're when you're

2338
01:24:27,319 --> 01:24:31,799
spending time with the plant whatever it

2339
01:24:29,479 --> 01:24:33,839
is I think it uh it really responds to

2340
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:37,000
it so plant responds to stress it

2341
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:38,800
responds to people it responds to and

2342
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:40,800
it's one of those things that what you

2343
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:43,880
put into it you get out of it it it

2344
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:47,119
directly correlates and uh you know the

2345
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:48,560
more passion the better 100% yeah that I

2346
01:24:47,118 --> 01:24:50,599
feel like you know we knew the people

2347
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:52,239
that always leave their their stereo

2348
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:54,039
going in the room for the and it's like

2349
01:24:52,238 --> 01:24:56,079
I don't know about that personally for

2350
01:24:54,039 --> 01:24:58,279
me it's just the more energy you put

2351
01:24:56,079 --> 01:25:01,559
into a plant you know more you take care

2352
01:24:58,279 --> 01:25:03,599
of food sure so I I you know I've heard

2353
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:04,960
stories and and some of my friends I

2354
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:07,679
think have experimented around

2355
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:11,118
especially with light dep um really

2356
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:12,719
adding a a Red Spectrum to some of those

2357
01:25:11,118 --> 01:25:14,439
earlier light depths do you have a

2358
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:16,600
feeling on that have you experimented

2359
01:25:14,439 --> 01:25:19,879
around with that at all or I'm a big fan

2360
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:22,679
of far red uh for finishing the plant

2361
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:24,440
for sure in flour and I feel like that

2362
01:25:22,679 --> 01:25:26,039
far red is going to bring out color if

2363
01:25:24,439 --> 01:25:28,479
you're looking for purple that's where a

2364
01:25:26,039 --> 01:25:31,039
lot of the LEDs you know have done good

2365
01:25:28,479 --> 01:25:33,439
HPS you get better color with HPS from

2366
01:25:31,039 --> 01:25:34,760
that and uh the LEDs with the far red

2367
01:25:33,439 --> 01:25:37,439
like we have the adjustable Spectrum

2368
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:39,480
LEDs that far red is important those

2369
01:25:37,439 --> 01:25:41,039
lights you got are off the chart yeah we

2370
01:25:39,479 --> 01:25:42,919
can totally program those they're

2371
01:25:41,039 --> 01:25:45,719
science Dragon Alphas big shout out to

2372
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:47,679
science for the lights uh they're fully

2373
01:25:45,719 --> 01:25:50,600
programmable and you can do multiple

2374
01:25:47,679 --> 01:25:53,000
spectrums you can mimic an HPS and a CMH

2375
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:54,760
and you can add far red and you can you

2376
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:57,279
know mimic the

2377
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:59,760
Samsung uh chip if if that's what you're

2378
01:25:57,279 --> 01:26:01,359
going for uh and so the beauty of it is

2379
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:03,560
like doing trials and figuring out

2380
01:26:01,359 --> 01:26:05,960
what's best I'm a big AB tester I'm

2381
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:08,239
always traling stuff I'm like okay well

2382
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:11,359
what's better is under canopy better

2383
01:26:08,238 --> 01:26:13,839
than uh light lifts

2384
01:26:11,359 --> 01:26:15,359
or seems like it's a new deal right now

2385
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:18,719
yeah and we just had so we had Tim on

2386
01:26:15,359 --> 01:26:20,759
the show uh Bobby bags recently and I'm

2387
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:21,960
a huge fan because I see the results

2388
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:23,920
that my friends are getting that's why

2389
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:26,719
I'm a fan okay I'm when I first heard

2390
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:28,319
about I was like yeah a little skeptical

2391
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:31,118
but I guys's power is a little cheaper

2392
01:26:28,319 --> 01:26:32,439
than our power though here you know yeah

2393
01:26:31,118 --> 01:26:34,198
and well the thing is is like when I

2394
01:26:32,439 --> 01:26:35,399
heard about it five years ago I knew I

2395
01:26:34,198 --> 01:26:37,039
my buddy was telling me about it I'm

2396
01:26:35,399 --> 01:26:39,238
like [ __ ] well that's it's a it's

2397
01:26:37,039 --> 01:26:40,960
Uncharted Territory yeah but what I was

2398
01:26:39,238 --> 01:26:43,759
thinking all this time and and he

2399
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:45,158
confirmed it is that the real benefit

2400
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:47,480
where you're going to see the most

2401
01:26:45,158 --> 01:26:49,238
benefit is from greenhous right because

2402
01:26:47,479 --> 01:26:51,559
I feel especially winter runs right like

2403
01:26:49,238 --> 01:26:53,479
winter runs are always a struggle but

2404
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:54,920
you put that under canopy light in and

2405
01:26:53,479 --> 01:26:56,359
you're going to benefit benefit from it

2406
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:59,719
and they're not that expensive so the

2407
01:26:56,359 --> 01:27:02,238
lights are actually $200 a piece so and

2408
01:26:59,719 --> 01:27:04,039
you use one light on a 4x4 if you want

2409
01:27:02,238 --> 01:27:05,439
changing pretty quick like technology

2410
01:27:04,039 --> 01:27:07,118
does right from the right when they

2411
01:27:05,439 --> 01:27:08,638
first came out to now and they put a

2412
01:27:07,118 --> 01:27:11,118
bunch of far red in there well they

2413
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:12,199
actually did a lot of Trials to get to

2414
01:27:11,118 --> 01:27:14,519
the point where they're at so their

2415
01:27:12,198 --> 01:27:16,879
lights are fully tested you know I can't

2416
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:18,320
say that about everybody else's but I

2417
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:20,520
feel like their lights are good and I've

2418
01:27:18,319 --> 01:27:22,880
seen it firsthand the results that you

2419
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:24,440
get and the benefit and you know the

2420
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:27,719
other thing I'm testing right now doing

2421
01:27:24,439 --> 01:27:29,279
trials with uh Horizon light lifts and

2422
01:27:27,719 --> 01:27:31,039
you know I've heard about that so

2423
01:27:29,279 --> 01:27:32,359
they're actually uh lifts that bring

2424
01:27:31,039 --> 01:27:34,960
your lights closer to the plant and

2425
01:27:32,359 --> 01:27:36,880
further up and you can really dial it in

2426
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:39,840
it does it automatically yeah you can

2427
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:41,880
dial in your your par so you know it's I

2428
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:43,880
think it's a interesting concept and

2429
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:45,679
we're going to try with the Horizon and

2430
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:47,199
then we're doing with the faven we're

2431
01:27:45,679 --> 01:27:49,399
doing without and then we're doing with

2432
01:27:47,198 --> 01:27:50,839
both and so I have four rows and we're

2433
01:27:49,399 --> 01:27:52,679
going to do on each row something

2434
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:53,880
slightly different so we're breeding and

2435
01:27:52,679 --> 01:27:55,760
trying to figure out all these things

2436
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:57,079
and breeding and trying to figure out

2437
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:58,600
all these different light things at the

2438
01:27:57,079 --> 01:28:00,800
same I'm trying to figure out a lot of

2439
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:02,400
different things to figure out well and

2440
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:03,719
what I'm doing is I'm trying to see

2441
01:28:02,399 --> 01:28:05,399
what's going to create the most amount

2442
01:28:03,719 --> 01:28:06,760
of seeds for me quality seeds right

2443
01:28:05,399 --> 01:28:08,439
because you know when you're doing seed

2444
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:10,400
production the bottoms that don't get as

2445
01:28:08,439 --> 01:28:13,638
much light you don't get you get white

2446
01:28:10,399 --> 01:28:15,920
seeds right and so now what if I can get

2447
01:28:13,639 --> 01:28:17,639
rid of that and where I'm I'm I do a lot

2448
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:19,880
of you know I do thinning on the under

2449
01:28:17,639 --> 01:28:21,000
canopy with my indoor and so we're going

2450
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:22,600
to get rid of that we're going to try

2451
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:24,560
the favin and see what happens if we

2452
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:26,079
don't thin and we only or if we only

2453
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:28,000
thin and we don't completely strip the

2454
01:28:26,079 --> 01:28:30,238
under canopy and what are your thoughts

2455
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:32,039
on I didn't hear you mention um

2456
01:28:30,238 --> 01:28:34,718
feminized seeds what are your thoughts

2457
01:28:32,039 --> 01:28:36,319
on that I like femin seeds I think

2458
01:28:34,719 --> 01:28:38,520
feminized seeds at scale I think

2459
01:28:36,319 --> 01:28:40,679
feminized seeds are okay I think you can

2460
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:43,440
have interex traits you can have interex

2461
01:28:40,679 --> 01:28:45,239
traits that are recessive and that that

2462
01:28:43,439 --> 01:28:46,719
don't express until you put them on

2463
01:28:45,238 --> 01:28:48,799
something else with interex traits and

2464
01:28:46,719 --> 01:28:51,600
then everything's got intersect traits

2465
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:53,400
all of a sudden and you can find stuff

2466
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:55,800
that's stable that's genetically stable

2467
01:28:53,399 --> 01:28:57,479
that doesn't have interex traits and

2468
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:59,600
breed with that and I think through

2469
01:28:57,479 --> 01:29:02,238
selection and putting the time in and

2470
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:05,480
energy you can find stuff with feminized

2471
01:29:02,238 --> 01:29:07,359
just as easily as you can um I think

2472
01:29:05,479 --> 01:29:08,759
genetic depression is a real thing and I

2473
01:29:07,359 --> 01:29:11,118
think a lot of people don't understand

2474
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:13,520
that Crossing gelato with something that

2475
01:29:11,118 --> 01:29:15,479
has gelato in it again with something

2476
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:18,119
that has gelato and over and over and

2477
01:29:15,479 --> 01:29:19,559
over you get genetic depression and then

2478
01:29:18,118 --> 01:29:21,759
your genetics get weaker more

2479
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:23,600
susceptible they lose their Vigor then

2480
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:25,840
you need to cross that with something

2481
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:28,480
that's completely different to get that

2482
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:31,159
Vigor back and making mother plants out

2483
01:29:28,479 --> 01:29:32,759
of from a feminized seed plant there's

2484
01:29:31,158 --> 01:29:34,479
nothing wrong with that okay there's

2485
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:36,800
nothing wrong with that and I think

2486
01:29:34,479 --> 01:29:38,559
there's a lot of misconceptions because

2487
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:40,840
I made a few I did a few this year and

2488
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:42,719
then somebody said oh be careful and I

2489
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:44,600
was like you know hesitant but they

2490
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:47,719
looked okay I was going to you know not

2491
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:49,960
go all in but yeah and I think uh trust

2492
01:29:47,719 --> 01:29:52,399
but verify with everything right in life

2493
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:54,118
in everyone's opinion and trust but

2494
01:29:52,399 --> 01:29:56,279
verify with genetics I think there's a a

2495
01:29:54,118 --> 01:29:57,479
lot of the rename games people think

2496
01:29:56,279 --> 01:29:58,800
they have something because it was

2497
01:29:57,479 --> 01:30:01,519
called that but maybe it's something

2498
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:02,880
different abely but femin seeds I don't

2499
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:04,080
personally think there's anything wrong

2500
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:07,199
with femin seeds and I think if you're

2501
01:30:04,079 --> 01:30:09,399
growing an acre of cannabis or an acre

2502
01:30:07,198 --> 01:30:11,399
of hemp you're going to want femin seeds

2503
01:30:09,399 --> 01:30:13,039
yeah I think that's the most that's

2504
01:30:11,399 --> 01:30:15,559
that's the cheapest way to do it and to

2505
01:30:13,039 --> 01:30:16,840
get the best results now clones and all

2506
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:19,679
these other things you can do it that

2507
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:21,679
way but I feel like seeds is the most

2508
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:24,359
economical and if you can get very

2509
01:30:21,679 --> 01:30:27,719
stable seeds you can get as good if not

2510
01:30:24,359 --> 01:30:29,359
better quality than clones yeah so you

2511
01:30:27,719 --> 01:30:33,000
know and I think for the longest time I

2512
01:30:29,359 --> 01:30:35,158
was scared of femin seeds in the 90s and

2513
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:36,319
early 2000s and I think there was much

2514
01:30:35,158 --> 01:30:38,519
different back then while we were

2515
01:30:36,319 --> 01:30:40,118
figuring it out but uh there's nothing

2516
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:41,360
wrong with making femin seeds there's

2517
01:30:40,118 --> 01:30:43,238
nothing wrong with breeding with

2518
01:30:41,359 --> 01:30:45,559
feminized seeds you hear that a lot and

2519
01:30:43,238 --> 01:30:47,799
I think there are some reasons you would

2520
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:51,400
want to breed with regular seeds and

2521
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:54,079
have regular seed stock but I personally

2522
01:30:51,399 --> 01:30:56,799
don't think that that is a reason to not

2523
01:30:54,079 --> 01:30:59,039
do it yeah no we we make those too and

2524
01:30:56,800 --> 01:31:00,840
you know we we share them with people

2525
01:30:59,039 --> 01:31:02,760
just because it makes that step a little

2526
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:04,440
bit easier for them right right and

2527
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:06,079
another thing I'd like to tell people

2528
01:31:04,439 --> 01:31:07,678
about is reciprocal breeding now

2529
01:31:06,079 --> 01:31:10,319
reciprocal breeding would be taking the

2530
01:31:07,679 --> 01:31:11,719
Lance putting it on the white Thorn Rose

2531
01:31:10,319 --> 01:31:13,439
and then also taking the white Thorn

2532
01:31:11,719 --> 01:31:15,239
Rose and putting on the Lance to see

2533
01:31:13,439 --> 01:31:16,919
what kind of results you get you do

2534
01:31:15,238 --> 01:31:18,839
reciprocal breeding from both sides and

2535
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:20,760
then potentially you can breathe those

2536
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:23,480
in together and find some stuff but I

2537
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:25,360
think really doing it both ways seeing

2538
01:31:23,479 --> 01:31:26,638
what you get you start understanding

2539
01:31:25,359 --> 01:31:29,079
your lines and seeing what gets

2540
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:31,039
inherited by each each plant do you

2541
01:31:29,079 --> 01:31:32,760
think the that new cross we did do you

2542
01:31:31,039 --> 01:31:35,600
think it took on be careful with your

2543
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:37,800
answer do you think that it took on more

2544
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:40,760
of the white Thorn Rose flavor or

2545
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:43,119
Expressions than the Lance or vice versa

2546
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:45,400
the male Lance and we we bred it to the

2547
01:31:43,118 --> 01:31:48,039
female me definitely took more white

2548
01:31:45,399 --> 01:31:50,198
Thor Rose expression I think it got some

2549
01:31:48,039 --> 01:31:52,920
more of the Lance structure maybe a

2550
01:31:50,198 --> 01:31:55,319
little Lance flavor isy yeah for sure

2551
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:57,158
but I mean it's white Thorn Rose is

2552
01:31:55,319 --> 01:32:00,519
powerful it kind it's hard it's one of

2553
01:31:57,158 --> 01:32:03,039
those strains it's you know it's hard to

2554
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:05,080
overtake that and so I do think like

2555
01:32:03,039 --> 01:32:06,560
it's everyone we've had so far

2556
01:32:05,079 --> 01:32:08,840
definitely I could see that white Thorn

2557
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:10,119
Rose in it but white Thorn Rose has

2558
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:12,639
definitely a different structure it's

2559
01:32:10,118 --> 01:32:14,439
more of that outdoor structure shitty

2560
01:32:12,639 --> 01:32:16,639
structure it's the

2561
01:32:14,439 --> 01:32:18,399
alternating call it how it's the

2562
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:19,800
alternating no matter how far you break

2563
01:32:18,399 --> 01:32:24,920
it down there's always that little piece

2564
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:26,760
of stem well a lot of times Aroma in

2565
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:29,440
you know we can call it TPS or whatever

2566
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:31,760
you want but that profile the flavor

2567
01:32:29,439 --> 01:32:34,759
profile is directly correlated to the

2568
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:36,800
structure Skittles is a great example A

2569
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:40,119
lot of times the most Skitty thing that

2570
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:42,159
has the most z in it is actually you has

2571
01:32:40,118 --> 01:32:43,880
that same Z structure so you breed it to

2572
01:32:42,158 --> 01:32:46,879
something amazing and you're going to

2573
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:48,480
try to find Z crosses that are Z the

2574
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:49,760
ones that are the best are the ones that

2575
01:32:48,479 --> 01:32:51,839
have the worst structure and I can

2576
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:54,880
usually pick out the Z ones like we do

2577
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:57,960
crosses with Z it's like in the

2578
01:32:54,880 --> 01:33:00,199
corner the little smaller ones and I

2579
01:32:57,960 --> 01:33:02,158
cross Lance multiple times we had the

2580
01:33:00,198 --> 01:33:06,039
candy Lance and I think white Thorn

2581
01:33:02,158 --> 01:33:08,000
needs to be crossed with Z it did we did

2582
01:33:06,039 --> 01:33:11,760
we call it riddles it won the ego clash

2583
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:14,960
in 2022 amazing from Heritage certain

2584
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:17,039
strains like you're crossing Skittles

2585
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:18,639
but that Skittle flavor is so damn good

2586
01:33:17,039 --> 01:33:20,118
it's like what are you looking for I

2587
01:33:18,639 --> 01:33:22,639
know and then you get diet Skittles and

2588
01:33:20,118 --> 01:33:24,359
diet Skittles yeah Skittles overtook the

2589
01:33:22,639 --> 01:33:27,279
white Thorn Rose it was

2590
01:33:24,359 --> 01:33:29,039
like cool this is this is it smells like

2591
01:33:27,279 --> 01:33:30,639
Skittles so why are you trying to cross

2592
01:33:29,039 --> 01:33:32,519
it if you're trying to have the skittle

2593
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:33,960
so in that situation what you would do

2594
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:35,600
is you would back cross it to the white

2595
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:37,039
Thorn rose again right so you have the

2596
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:38,440
Skittles in there you cross it with the

2597
01:33:37,039 --> 01:33:40,519
white Thorn then you're selecting for

2598
01:33:38,439 --> 01:33:43,198
something in the middle or trying to see

2599
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:45,480
what you get and then you're looking for

2600
01:33:43,198 --> 01:33:47,118
some decent structure because that with

2601
01:33:45,479 --> 01:33:49,118
both of them they're struggling in

2602
01:33:47,118 --> 01:33:51,079
structure so it's not really the most

2603
01:33:49,118 --> 01:33:53,000
commercially viable strain to put in

2604
01:33:51,079 --> 01:33:54,719
like an indoor that doesn't mean it

2605
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:56,198
can't be used for Ros and and other

2606
01:33:54,719 --> 01:33:57,880
things and then even pre-rolls where

2607
01:33:56,198 --> 01:34:00,279
people don't look at it cuz if you give

2608
01:33:57,880 --> 01:34:02,560
someone a pre-roll of it or a pre-roll

2609
01:34:00,279 --> 01:34:03,719
of Skittles EXC and they never see it

2610
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:05,080
they smoke it they're like oh my God

2611
01:34:03,719 --> 01:34:07,359
this is amazing but if they look at the

2612
01:34:05,079 --> 01:34:08,719
bud they're like eh I don't know but

2613
01:34:07,359 --> 01:34:10,279
that's the problem with Instagram and

2614
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:12,079
the problem with Skittles and maybe it

2615
01:34:10,279 --> 01:34:14,840
was just the Skittles that I had that I

2616
01:34:12,079 --> 01:34:18,118
stole from him was that when you dried

2617
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:20,920
it kind of discolored it was more turned

2618
01:34:18,118 --> 01:34:23,679
not brown it was just a little it's not

2619
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:25,639
the flavor was amazing it just it turned

2620
01:34:23,679 --> 01:34:27,039
turned a little off color I've had well

2621
01:34:25,639 --> 01:34:29,679
the thing is Skittles you have to

2622
01:34:27,039 --> 01:34:31,519
harvest it early yeah you can't over

2623
01:34:29,679 --> 01:34:32,840
yeah may I over rped it yeah it's not

2624
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:35,040
one of those ones who wait for the hairs

2625
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:36,600
to turn brown because it turns brown I

2626
01:34:35,039 --> 01:34:38,880
would guess that white Thorn Rose and

2627
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:39,960
Skittles are you know the Z is very much

2628
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:42,639
like that like if you're doing it

2629
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:44,560
indoors on day 53 to day 56 is really

2630
01:34:42,639 --> 01:34:47,880
when you want to harvest it you go to

2631
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:50,639
day 63 Mountain yeah if you go to day 63

2632
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:52,960
with Skittles indoor with that ztp you

2633
01:34:50,639 --> 01:34:55,359
don't it's it's stronger flower but you

2634
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:57,520
definitely lose something as far as like

2635
01:34:55,359 --> 01:34:59,599
flavor and the high even the highest

2636
01:34:57,520 --> 01:35:01,320
Skittles it gets it's dimmed down you

2637
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:04,679
get more of like a Stony High instead

2638
01:35:01,319 --> 01:35:06,319
ofly more of a bright High 100% a lot of

2639
01:35:04,679 --> 01:35:08,920
these strains too it's you let it get

2640
01:35:06,319 --> 01:35:11,279
over that time a l of times all a sudden

2641
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:12,960
waiting for a photo shoot I got to leave

2642
01:35:11,279 --> 01:35:15,840
these plants for an extra week or

2643
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:17,439
something know my God just killing me we

2644
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:19,440
Harvest it and it's just you could tell

2645
01:35:17,439 --> 01:35:21,000
it's just it smokes a little different

2646
01:35:19,439 --> 01:35:22,399
yeah you know the turps kind of go away

2647
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:24,520
especially Under the Sun cuz the sun's

2648
01:35:22,399 --> 01:35:27,638
so powerful especially that first

2649
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:29,239
harvest so Harvest all that so crucial

2650
01:35:27,639 --> 01:35:30,880
so are you guys thinking about releasing

2651
01:35:29,238 --> 01:35:32,359
seeds in the near future I think it

2652
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:33,840
would be a good move I have a problem

2653
01:35:32,359 --> 01:35:35,559
with that I feel like I probably what

2654
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:37,760
you mean you are releasing seeds well

2655
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:39,719
some but seed it's like I probably could

2656
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:42,199
have be tired on the seed game honestly

2657
01:35:39,719 --> 01:35:44,039
but I've I hate giving up like I want to

2658
01:35:42,198 --> 01:35:45,919
try them first I want to grow them first

2659
01:35:44,039 --> 01:35:48,679
and I feel like seeds are so important

2660
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:50,440
and valuable certain ones yeah they're

2661
01:35:48,679 --> 01:35:52,399
you know if I'm not really attached to

2662
01:35:50,439 --> 01:35:53,919
that cross I'm just going to you know

2663
01:35:52,399 --> 01:35:55,319
drop them but it's like the ones really

2664
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:57,960
attached to you I feel like seeds are

2665
01:35:55,319 --> 01:35:59,679
like that's that's it that's the genetic

2666
01:35:57,960 --> 01:36:01,359
that charge a lot for them so it makes

2667
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:03,158
it worth your for sure but just like

2668
01:36:01,359 --> 01:36:04,439
anything once it goes out it's gone it's

2669
01:36:03,158 --> 01:36:06,638
out there and I mean that's just how

2670
01:36:04,439 --> 01:36:08,158
this thing is right now but they're all

2671
01:36:06,639 --> 01:36:10,560
different I don't have the feminized

2672
01:36:08,158 --> 01:36:12,399
ones so yeah I'm selling some you know

2673
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:13,760
and it's it's like you know like the

2674
01:36:12,399 --> 01:36:15,719
Green Lantern it's been there for a

2675
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:17,360
while it's time for people to get it and

2676
01:36:15,719 --> 01:36:19,198
you know it's like I don't need a hoorde

2677
01:36:17,359 --> 01:36:21,039
if you hoard a strain forever it's not

2678
01:36:19,198 --> 01:36:23,638
going to get better you I want people to

2679
01:36:21,039 --> 01:36:26,679
enjoy it right but I gotta get I think

2680
01:36:23,639 --> 01:36:28,400
more comfortable of just okay I'm not

2681
01:36:26,679 --> 01:36:29,760
going to find the Unicorn every time and

2682
01:36:28,399 --> 01:36:31,559
and let other people find I think

2683
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:33,159
planning it out and going for this I I

2684
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:35,280
think that that's just an untapped

2685
01:36:33,158 --> 01:36:37,158
market for you you have the name and I

2686
01:36:35,279 --> 01:36:39,559
feel like if you go to Emerald cup with

2687
01:36:37,158 --> 01:36:41,719
seeds you're GNA sell seeds oh blows my

2688
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:43,400
mind I see these lines of people over

2689
01:36:41,719 --> 01:36:45,800
there jungle boys buying a clone for a

2690
01:36:43,399 --> 01:36:47,799
thousand bucks and I'm just like well

2691
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:50,239
it's probably not jungle Bo but one of

2692
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:52,440
those ones uhhuh we don't even need to

2693
01:36:50,238 --> 01:36:54,759
name one of those ones but they're

2694
01:36:52,439 --> 01:36:57,359
buying like clones for

2695
01:36:54,760 --> 01:36:59,159
I'm just like holy [ __ ] or seeds Pack

2696
01:36:57,359 --> 01:37:00,559
seeds for three 400 bucks I'm like I

2697
01:36:59,158 --> 01:37:02,479
have so many seeds what the hell we

2698
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:05,400
crossed the white rose into the back

2699
01:37:02,479 --> 01:37:07,439
into the paradise punch and we called it

2700
01:37:05,399 --> 01:37:10,799
Paradise Pine and we released that you

2701

mean it's it's special so there there's

2713
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:37,199
some but just I I think selectively

2714
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:39,679
letting a little out at a time is safe

2715
01:37:37,198 --> 01:37:41,039
way I me you got enough time each year

2716

and you're entering the emerald cup

2717
01:37:41,039 --> 01:37:44,800
you're going to be winning and I feel

2718
01:37:42,479 --> 01:37:47,678
like having seeds along the lines with

2719
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:49,039
maybe crosses from the winners yeah dude

2720

people are all into it people love I

2721
01:37:49,039 --> 01:37:52,519
mean that's a great way to share it with

2722
01:37:50,359 --> 01:37:54,399
the world too y yep I agree and like you

2723

2724
01:37:54,399 --> 01:37:57,359
people to experience that yeah you know

2725
01:37:56,238 --> 01:37:58,759
then they know what we go through

2726
01:37:57,359 --> 01:38:01,118
because a lot of people think it's

2727
01:37:58,760 --> 01:38:02,679
really easy you know a lot of people

2728
01:38:01,118 --> 01:38:04,639
think it's really like Instagram oh you

2729
01:38:02,679 --> 01:38:07,118
grow all perfect weed it's like anybody

2730
01:38:04,639 --> 01:38:09,000
can do it that's how it is anybody can

2731
01:38:07,118 --> 01:38:11,000
do a podcast you know and it's it's like

2732
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:12,479
anybody can do a podcast you know but

2733
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:15,960
you got to put forth the effort and

2734
01:38:12,479 --> 01:38:19,000
there has to be uh dedication and so

2735
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:21,198
many other things and I mean 30 40 Years

2736
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:22,800
of doing it makes it a lot easier than

2737
01:38:21,198 --> 01:38:24,519
if you're just doing it for your first

2738
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:27,239
year I mean is all we've done our whole

2739
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:28,719
life so it put yeah people want to you

2740
01:38:27,238 --> 01:38:31,439
they want to do it yeah go ahead and do

2741
01:38:28,719 --> 01:38:33,158
it put the time in and I think people

2742
01:38:31,439 --> 01:38:34,598
are capable of doing anything you want

2743
01:38:33,158 --> 01:38:35,759
to be successful and you're passionate

2744
01:38:34,599 --> 01:38:37,960
about it you can do anything you want to

2745
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:39,320
learn how to grow good you see people

2746
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:41,679
that you like and you want to be like

2747
01:38:39,319 --> 01:38:43,319
them you can be like them always a hard

2748
01:38:41,679 --> 01:38:45,440
thing is watching somebody grab your

2749
01:38:43,319 --> 01:38:47,519
pound that you work so hard on and like

2750
01:38:45,439 --> 01:38:49,598
oh yeah we'll take this one not this one

2751
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:51,560
grabt out of yeah they just smash it

2752
01:38:49,599 --> 01:38:52,840
they look it we don't like it or or sure

2753
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:54,560
we like these throw them in the bag and

2754
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:56,440
take off you're like you know how much

2755
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:57,960
time and energy I put into that we they

2756
01:38:56,439 --> 01:39:02,399
try to bust your balls in the price

2757
01:38:57,960 --> 01:39:04,000
they're like I don't know $400 I I mean

2758
01:39:02,399 --> 01:39:06,158
throw yeah I mean these are sad times

2759
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:08,359
for those you know we talk about three

2760
01:39:06,158 --> 01:39:10,399
or $400 a pound and you know what that

2761
01:39:08,359 --> 01:39:13,039
does to the economy especially up in

2762
01:39:10,399 --> 01:39:15,519
Humble and so that that really that's a

2763
01:39:13,039 --> 01:39:18,198
you know something that bothers me and

2764
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:19,880
makes me sad is that you know people are

2765
01:39:18,198 --> 01:39:22,960
trying to get over on other people with

2766
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:25,000
for 300 or $400 pounds and at the end of

2767
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:28,239
the day I feel like the streets aren't

2768
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:29,840
seeing the benefit from that as much but

2769
01:39:28,238 --> 01:39:30,919
the farmers are the ones that get hurt

2770
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:33,679
they're taking advantage of the

2771
01:39:30,920 --> 01:39:35,800
situation for 40 50 years so that jar

2772
01:39:33,679 --> 01:39:38,920
you have of the white Thorn Rose is a

2773
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:43,480
quarter um you know after I broke it

2774
01:39:38,920 --> 01:39:45,920
down really it's um the farmer or I get

2775
01:39:43,479 --> 01:39:49,279
$3 to four dollars for that jar they

2776
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:51,359
sell it for $65 in the store yeah and so

2777
01:39:49,279 --> 01:39:52,920
there's that much money in between me

2778
01:39:51,359 --> 01:39:54,839
and the consumer I would love to give it

2779
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:56,800
to the consumer for five bucks or 10

2780
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:58,560
bucks and just get it into more people's

2781
01:39:56,800 --> 01:40:00,599
hands would be ideal and hopefully the

2782
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:02,719
state can figure it out I mean that

2783
01:40:00,599 --> 01:40:04,840
would make all the difference yeah right

2784
01:40:02,719 --> 01:40:06,118
there I mean why would people go right

2785
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:07,920
in the store and buy all their product

2786
01:40:06,118 --> 01:40:09,719
but it's like you know we aren't making

2787
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:11,319
money one these pre-rolls we lose money

2788
01:40:09,719 --> 01:40:14,039
on all these pre-rolls yeah the end of

2789
01:40:11,319 --> 01:40:16,719
the day but it's like you know it's just

2790
01:40:14,039 --> 01:40:19,439
taxes taxes and taxes and so many people

2791
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:21,079
put trash into pre-rolls you know it's

2792
01:40:19,439 --> 01:40:22,678
like there's not a lot of good pre-roll

2793
01:40:21,079 --> 01:40:24,279
out my own pre-rolls I'll sit there and

2794
01:40:22,679 --> 01:40:26,118
just don't feel like roll in a joint pop

2795
01:40:24,279 --> 01:40:27,679
open a pre-roll and smoke it and we take

2796
01:40:26,118 --> 01:40:29,439
the exact same pound that we put in our

2797
01:40:27,679 --> 01:40:31,000
jars and we give it to the guy that

2798
01:40:29,439 --> 01:40:34,039
manufactured to put in our pre-rolls

2799
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:37,198
it's a same exact weed yeah I mean

2800
01:40:34,039 --> 01:40:40,158
Smalls are kind of even better you

2801
01:40:37,198 --> 01:40:41,598
know I think so Smalls are great Smalls

2802
01:40:40,158 --> 01:40:42,839
are great for that but then you use the

2803
01:40:41,599 --> 01:40:44,279
under canopy lights and you lose all

2804
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:46,239
your

2805
01:40:44,279 --> 01:40:49,118
smalls so maybe you don't want to use

2806
01:40:46,238 --> 01:40:51,000
under canop lights you know that's funny

2807
01:40:49,118 --> 01:40:53,359
yeah yeah it's a trip that that's like

2808
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:55,079
one of the benefits but and the Smalls

2809
01:40:53,359 --> 01:40:57,079
Market's so huge like the smallest

2810
01:40:55,079 --> 01:40:58,760
Market is bigger than it's ever been I

2811
01:40:57,079 --> 01:41:01,559
don't remember a smallest Market back in

2812
01:40:58,760 --> 01:41:02,679
the day like trim is too you know like

2813
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:04,159
there's just you know that people are

2814
01:41:02,679 --> 01:41:06,079
being able to make so many other

2815
01:41:04,158 --> 01:41:07,238
products I'm so old I remember the days

2816
01:41:06,079 --> 01:41:08,479
where they didn't charge for trim

2817
01:41:07,238 --> 01:41:10,759
everyone used to give it to people for

2818
01:41:08,479 --> 01:41:12,359
free it was all free all free we'd throw

2819
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:14,440
it over a bank and all a sudden realized

2820
01:41:12,359 --> 01:41:15,719
we could make cash out of it and I had

2821
01:41:14,439 --> 01:41:17,759
the hardest time getting people to

2822
01:41:15,719 --> 01:41:19,679
separate it so that I could have the the

2823
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:21,079
sugar leaves oh yeah you know nobody

2824
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:23,319
wanted to separate but they give you

2825
01:41:21,079 --> 01:41:24,960
their trim then it went boom The 100

2826
01:41:23,319 --> 01:41:27,079
plus you dollars a pound there for a

2827
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:29,679
while you know and it's it's it's a

2828
