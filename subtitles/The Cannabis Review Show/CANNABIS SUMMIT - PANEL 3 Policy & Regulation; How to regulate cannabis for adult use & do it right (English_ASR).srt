1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,700
so I just got to very briefly introduce

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:09,539
the panel I'm going to go from over

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:13,259
there this gentleman is Sean Carney now

4
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:15,198
Sean I have worked alongside I is the

5
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:18,839
former director

6
00:00:15,198 --> 00:00:22,859
for European business development for

7
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:24,500
Tulare Europe and along with Pavel

8
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,179
Europe check

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:31,559
obtained the first license now this is

10
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:34,259
before mcap to import a cannabis-based

11
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:38,640
medical product into Ireland that was

12
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:41,479
the 1010 uh two-way oral solution I then

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,239
go to Shane Morris over here

14
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:46,859
Shane uh was I always get this right you

15
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:49,339
have to tell me what precisely the role

16
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:51,738
was where

17
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:54,660
so there was a little bit of competition

18
00:00:51,738 --> 00:00:58,378
when the MCAT program was first starting

19
00:00:54,659 --> 00:01:00,959
up between two Ray and Aurora and well

20
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:02,579
Shane was leading the charge there not

21
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,460
just in Ireland but in other countries

22
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:08,939
in Europe and Shane won that around and

23
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:11,519
got the first official M Camp

24
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:13,139
um cannabis based medical product on

25
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,420
Marx there's an enormous privacy he's

26
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,260
traveled from Canada to be here today

27
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,759
Sean came in from the Czech Republic

28
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:23,400
John has come in from the state of Maine

29
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:27,140
where he's now regulator in charge of

30
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:30,900
policy at our very own Mike Sikorski

31
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:34,680

where he's part of this very interesting

33
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:42,000

thank you to all for the kind words like

50
00:02:17,098 --> 00:02:19,919
what everything else the team is what

51
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:21,539
Norby brings an event to get herself the

52
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,299
two was there I've managed to bring this

53
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:26,519
event and to everybody so this

54
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,080
discussion was about policy and as we

55
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,060
know the policy framework across the

56
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,219
world is nuanced in every single

57
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,500
territory so what better way to explain

58
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:36,300
to everybody than somebody from Canadian

59
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,639
expertise American expertise and

60
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,860
European expertise to bestow what they

61
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,419
think is going right in policy and what

62
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,940
we could hopefully in Ireland and Europe

63
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:47,399
learn about designing a new policy so

64
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:49,019
I'm going to start off with John can you

65
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,719
basically give everybody an overview of

66
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:53,580
what is going right in America what are

67
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:55,859
the main states that are doing it

68
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,599
correctly and what are the let's say top

69
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,760
two three lessons that Europe can learn

70
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:00,598
from what's Happening over with you guys

71
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:02,699
okay

72
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:04,679
well thank you for the invitation

73
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:06,839
um this is an exciting panel um I'm here

74
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,519
with some esteemed colleagues and I'm

75
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,219
excited to hear their conversation as

76
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:13,560
well in terms of talking about America I

77
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:17,280
think it's important to talk about a

78
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:20,640
couple of really Stark failures uh that

79
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,560
exist that set the stage uh or set the

80
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:24,839
table for uh what we're going to talk

81
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,699
about the first big policy failure was

82
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,860
Prohibition in the first place

83
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:30,780
um it's a failed policy it's a failed

84
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,040
policy that the United States exported

85
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,598
across the world

86
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:34,919
um it's a failed policy in every country

87
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:36,658
that it touches

88
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:38,399
um and it's created the types of policy

89
00:03:36,658 --> 00:03:40,500
challenges that we're experiencing with

90
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,680
today whether they're policy challenges

91
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,299
around weather to legalize or not or

92
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,459
whether they are policy challenges

93
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:49,680
around what legalization should look

94
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:52,680
like once a jurisdiction has decided to

95
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,680
take that step the second big policy

96
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:59,159
failure in the United States uh has been

97
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,260
a failure by Congress to act on what has

98
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:03,000
been an experimentation in the

99
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:05,759
individual states around medical and

100
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,519
adult use cannabis that disjuncture

101
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,620
between federal and state law creates

102
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:12,000
numerous problems that really handcuff

103
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,860
the states

104
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,419
um uh in the introduction it was noted

105
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,579
I've recently been appointed to take

106
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:19,500
over as the chief regulator and chief

107
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,299
enforcement officer for cannabis for

108
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,579
medical and adult use cannabis in the

109
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:25,859
state of Maine I have licensees coming

110
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:28,680
to me constantly asking what we're going

111
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,300
to do about banking policy for instance

112
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,860
I'm not going to do a damn thing about

113
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,478
banking policy because as a state

114
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,819
regulator I don't have any jurisdiction

115
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:39,060
over banking policy that's an inherently

116
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:41,939
Federal power uh in the U.S and so uh

117
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:44,040
that lack of banking creates a variety

118
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:45,600
of problems uh within the state in terms

119
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,240
of access to Capital in terms of the

120
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,000
ability to stabilize a business uh in

121
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,240
terms of picking the winners and losers

122
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,279
and so those those types of those types

123
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,900
of challenges like I said because of

124
00:04:56,279 --> 00:05:00,959
differences between federal and state

125
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:03,239
law are numerous they're complicated and

126
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:04,560
as I noted they're handcuffing of First

127
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,960
State regulators

128
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,560
but in terms of what is uh going well

129
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:12,719
within the United States we've taken a

130
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,459
fairly new experiment uh the

131
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,040
legalization of cannabis either for

132
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:19,560
medical or adult use without much of a

133
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:22,680
road map and put together for better or

134
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,800
worse uh systems uh you know Private

135
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:29,038
Industry that is regulated uh systems

136
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:32,360
that have done uh in part the intention

137
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:35,639
of those policies which was to deliver

138
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:38,819
on cannabis demand and to deliver

139
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:41,160
regulated and in many cases a tested

140
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:44,219
product to those who want to purchase it

141
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:46,199
it has not been as I said it's not been

142
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,880
perfect there is still a thriving

143
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:49,740
illicit Market in the United States

144
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:52,439
particularly in states that have chosen

145
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,000
not to reform their laws particularly in

146
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:56,759
states that have reformed their laws

147
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,939
poorly or states that have not taken

148
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:02,220
into account the Legacy markets the

149
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:06,120
existing illicit markets that exist

150
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:08,220
within those States but ultimately we

151
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,538
have Private Industry thriving as the

152
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,880
first panel noted this is a

153
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:14,339
multi-billion dollar industry in the

154
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:16,620
United States and growing it is

155
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:19,319
something that is employing um Bo you're

156
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:21,959
here still right yeah Bo um he noted his

157
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:23,819
job support uh that it that he does is

158
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:26,339
every year every two years

159
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:28,620
every year that's a great resource

160
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:31,019
hundreds of thousands of individuals

161
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:33,780
directly employed in the Cannabis

162
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:36,359
industry in the United States and many

163
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:38,698
more employed indirectly the the

164
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,740
non-plant touching aspects that serve

165
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:43,439
the existing industry

166
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,840
we've set up a regulatory system uh in

167
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:47,939
the U.S that make in individual states

168
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:51,119
in the US that attempts to track and

169
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:52,560
Trace product uh so that uh the phrase

170
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,959
we would use is you don't have product

171
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,360
falling off the backs of trucks uh so

172
00:06:54,959 --> 00:07:00,060
we're trying to prevent diversion uh

173
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,280
that is a product grown in the legal

174
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:05,220
Market making its way into the illicit

175
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:07,318
Market or inversion that is product that

176
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:10,620
is illicitly produced making its way

177
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:13,139
into the legal Market those are

178
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,639
imperfect solutions that we have but

179
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:17,220
ultimately it's a hell of a lot better

180
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,079
than the illicit Market in the illicit

181
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,819
Market you have untested product you

182
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:22,379
have product that's grown with

183
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:24,419
pesticides you have product that's

184
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:27,180
processed with a variety of other

185
00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:29,519
adulterants and there are significant

186
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,680
efforts in individual states to take

187
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:34,799
those steps and at the same time there's

188
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:38,459
expertise being applied to cannabis uh

189
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,860
growth production and uh distribution

190
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:42,418
from a regulatory perspective that isn't

191
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,580
there in the illicit market and so let

192
00:07:42,418 --> 00:07:47,219
me give you an example of one of these

193
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:49,560
things that we've dealt with in Maine uh

194
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,900
pretty significantly uh and and I think

195
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,399
and a lot of states have as well so

196
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:54,839
there are a variety of different

197
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:57,359
pesticides that you can use in

198
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:59,758
agriculture and pesticides are rated or

199
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,740
classed based on how those products are

200
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,419
going to be used and there are certain

201
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,918
products there are certain pesticides

202
00:08:03,418 --> 00:08:07,079
that are used on food products for

203
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:09,060
instance because if you use something on

204
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:11,159
tomatoes or apples and you wash the

205
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,800
tomato or apple you're probably going to

206
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:16,500
be fine there's a pesticide that's used

207
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:19,379
widely in illicit the illicit production

208
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:22,139
of cannabis called Eagle 20. uh now

209
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:23,639
Eagle 20 generally if you eat it it's

210
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:26,579
not going to cause a lot of problems for

211
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:29,098
you uh in a lot of cases it's used uh in

212
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:32,038
agriculture produced for food if you

213
00:08:29,098 --> 00:08:34,139
combust Eagle 20 so you packable

214
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:36,179
um and you light it um Eagle 20 is

215
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:39,120
byproduct when you uh when you burn it

216
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:41,699
is cyanide gas and so you have

217
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,679
individuals who are thinking well we use

218
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:46,740
Eagle 20 on tomatoes so we can use Eagle

219
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:49,620
20 on cannabis and the lack of Federal

220
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,839
Regulation around cannabis in the United

221
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:54,240
States does not allow our EPA our

222
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,060
Environmental Protection Agency which

223
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,159
tends to regulate pesticides to say

224
00:08:57,059 --> 00:09:03,119
don't grow cannabis with this because

225
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:04,919
you can be inhaling cyanide gas and that

226
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,839
is something that for States we're able

227
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:08,399
to take that type of expertise that

228
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,260
understanding of what happens with a

229
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,360
pesticide like that and put out warnings

230
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:15,120
to put out regulations to make sure that

231
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:18,060
even if you don't think that cannabis is

232
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,100
safe you can at least know that legal

233
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:22,319
regulated cannabis is safer than the

234
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,480
alternative now we've heard a lot

235
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,040
earlier about the stigma around cannabis

236
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,500
and I'm a huge supporter of the

237
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:30,120
destigmatization of cannabis the

238
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,980
stigmatization of cannabis in the United

239
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:36,060
States and around the world is steeped

240
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:39,120
in racism and ethnocentrism in keeping

241
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:40,259
down people of color and poor people in

242
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,120
the United States and throughout the

243
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:44,278
world and so destigmatizing this is

244
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:47,820
critically important but at the same

245
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:49,799
time making sure that people are

246
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,300
managing risk when they're thinking

247
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:53,879
about cannabis understanding what

248
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:55,919
cannabis can do to to their bodies I

249
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:58,259
think the United States has a

250
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:59,759
long-storied history of doing all the

251
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:02,159
wrong things when it comes to talking

252
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:04,139
about cannabis but there's an over

253
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:06,000
correction there sometimes in cannabis

254
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:08,458
industry and advocacy where you hear

255
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,480
things like cannabis is not addictive it

256
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:11,239
can be

257
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,940
um cannabis is safe

258
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,740
it can be when it's used properly when

259
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,839
people are using responsibly and when

260
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:21,600
it's grown and cultivated and processed

261
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:23,760
properly the idea that no one's ever

262
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,259
died as a result of cannabis yeah that's

263
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:27,778
probably true no one's ever died of a

264
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:29,700
cannabis overdose but the idea of

265
00:10:27,778 --> 00:10:31,200
suggesting that no one's ever died

266
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,240
because they've used cannabis and

267
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,399
operated a motor vehicle or had some

268
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,740
other sort of accident two two very

269
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:39,600
common ways to die from the use of

270
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:42,360
alcohol we count those deaths and

271
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,300
injuries when we talk about alcohol but

272
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,100
the idea that we are

273
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:49,319
overly destigmatizing cannabis in a way

274
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,420
that people are not willing to accept

275
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,339
that there are risks with it still like

276
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:56,399
there are risks with a lot of behaviors

277
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:57,779
I think is an important part of the

278
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,940
challenge that we have in the United

279
00:10:57,778 --> 00:11:01,679
States and around the world we shouldn't

280
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,420
think of cannabis as bad in every way we

281
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:05,578
shouldn't think of cannabis users as bad

282
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:07,439
people uh or people who are inherently

283
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:09,179
trying to do bad things

284
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,720
um but we also have to recognize that

285
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:15,599
cannabis use disorder is a reality and

286
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,180
that if we are going to have a cannabis

287
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,220
industry that is effective uh and

288
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:21,899
effective to in protecting Public Health

289
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,519
that we're willing to talk about the

290
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:24,958
risks at the same time we're willing to

291
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,459
talk about the rewards and we have a

292
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,078
long way to go in the United States to

293
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:29,759
do that we have a long way to go in a

294
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:32,219
lot of countries to do that but

295
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:34,620
ultimately that for me is the goal where

296
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:37,019
we can think about can a cannabis user

297
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:39,060
as just a regular individual who likes

298
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:41,459
to use responsibly and enjoy on the

299
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:43,559
weekends or in the evenings but that

300
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:45,659
also there are some health concerns for

301
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:48,119
individuals who over indulge like either

302
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:49,860
in an acute way or in a chronic way and

303
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,240
so I think it makes it exciting because

304
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,919
we have a lot like I said we have a lot

305
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,959
of work to do but I think the United

306
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:56,338
States so far has at least laid a

307
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,379
groundwork

308
00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:00,060
um toward working uh working toward

309
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:01,559
those types of goals and those types of

310
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:04,379
achievements

311
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:06,000
thank you very much John and next to you

312
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:07,980
Shane you've got a wealth of experience

313
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,240
your own very successful consulting firm

314
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:11,278
in Canada and I've been around since

315
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,899
pretty much the industry started we

316
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:15,419
obviously know Canada has their issues

317
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:18,179
as well is there a comparison for USA

318
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:19,919
versus Canada which is better or is same

319
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:21,719
question for John is there anything we

320
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:24,179
can take from the Canadian Market to see

321
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:27,000
what we can utilize in Europe

322
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:28,859
yeah there could be a very long and

323
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,399
boring thesis from a policy perspective

324
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:35,278
on that but uh look

325
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:38,100
um from my vantage point I work for a

326
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:41,879
federal government for the queen in

327
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:44,159
Canada for uh maybe 16 years and then I

328
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:47,039
did startup cannabis

329
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:49,019
um I think what we were all shocked for

330
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:50,819
in Canada and that you know the number

331
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:53,100
one key difference I think between the

332
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:56,459
US and Canadian systems is that in

333
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:58,440
Canada it's a federal effort right it's

334
00:12:56,458 --> 00:13:01,559
a hundred percent federal government

335
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:05,100
Parliament the whole nine yards and as a

336
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:08,219
result you get a very coherent

337
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:10,440
um you know policy uh platform to be

338
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:12,480
able to move forward as opposed to in

339
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:15,000
the US you've got you know MSO state by

340
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,100
state it's a patchwork uh the beautiful

341
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,379
thing about Canada the way they did it

342
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:22,379
and I've got lots to say about the bad

343
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:24,360
side of things uh is that at least they

344
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:27,778
they've been able to come from a federal

345
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:30,180
perspective it's a it's a national coast

346
00:13:27,778 --> 00:13:32,278
to coast to coast approach uh the

347
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:34,379
banking system you don't have the same

348
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:36,659
impact because it's a federally approved

349
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:39,179
uh there's listings on a stock exchange

350
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:41,458
and it's uh you know and that has a huge

351
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:44,338
impact for stigmatization across a value

352
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:46,199
chain and it's not just the users the uh

353
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:49,260
you know you know where stigma has been

354
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:51,000
used in Social is issues but it's all

355
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:52,439
the way across it's me being able to

356
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,019
come home to Dublin and tell my mother

357
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,060
that I'm working in Canada some Excel

358
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:58,560
cannabis some probably the Irish person

359
00:13:57,059 --> 00:14:01,859
who sold most legal candidates on the

360
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:03,719
planet uh and her not to like vanish me

361
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:06,360
I'd never talk to me again because

362
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,100
that's that's stigma so that I think the

363
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,778
number one key element is that Federal

364
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,940
piece that I can get into a bit more

365
00:14:09,778 --> 00:14:15,059
detail as we speak I want to speak for

366
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:16,380
too long uh second thing I think uh from

367
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:17,518
Canadian perspective that's really good

368
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:19,139
is the

369
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,639
um and it's linked to the first one is

370
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:23,759
the export side of things on the medical

371
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:26,820
side I think the opportunity to have

372
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:30,419
those Congress uh to those exports and

373
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:33,180
leads to a really key component that I I

374
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:36,838
know a lot of the Canadians uh really

375
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:39,059
take as a uh something quite serious is

376
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:40,920
they we have the ability in Canada to go

377
00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:42,599
across the world and explain our system

378
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:45,419
and be able to talk and Export and

379
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,879
there's Canadian products coming in to

380
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:51,719
um you know Germany Australia

381
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:54,899
um you know France uh so it's uh you

382
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:57,420
know people are hungry to hear about the

383
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:58,919
products Had It produced and it you know

384
00:14:57,419 --> 00:15:01,439
one of my favorite things is when I come

385
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:03,599
to jurisdictions and I say I'm the most

386
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,040
boring person in cannabis I literally am

387
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,139
one of the most very I'm not your

388
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:09,120
typical accounts person and so you know

389
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:12,180
to come you know like to come to Dublin

390
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,980
and sit with officials and say look you

391
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:15,359
know I can show you what the solution

392
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,480
looks like from a federal regulator

393
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,639
perspective it is not horrendous it is

394
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,899
disguise not going to fall we've done it

395
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,299
and we're exporting into your

396
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:27,179
jurisdiction as a result and that is a

397
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:29,099
huge uh you know positive uh from both

398
00:15:27,179 --> 00:15:31,078
uh the product I'm from the stigma

399
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,519
perspective what we did wrong on the

400
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:34,399
Move very quickly through this because

401
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:38,179
I've got a long list

402
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:41,220
the Canadian system was very quick

403
00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:43,439
I worked in medical science you know my

404
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,519
Approach my company's Approach at the

405
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,839
time was we're going to do medical

406
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,980
cannabis it's going to be interesting

407
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,620
it's going to be you know small

408
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:51,959
percentage literally overnight and no

409
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:53,578
one knew and I I work in the bowels of

410
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:56,159
Ottawa which is the Washington DC of

411
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:59,039
Canada it was a surprise that it ended

412
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:01,198
up an election mandate uh election

413
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:03,778
um uh promise for the current government

414
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:05,578
the the Trudeau government we were like

415
00:16:03,778 --> 00:16:09,120
oh yeah it's just not going to happen

416
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:11,338
then boom and I know very well the

417
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,320
bureaucrats that have to turn that

418
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:16,139
election promise into a federally

419
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:18,778
regulated uh industry that now worked

420
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:21,959
today 4.2 billion dollars in retail

421
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:23,698
sales on recreational only and there was

422
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:26,399
tears there was cry like they did

423
00:16:23,698 --> 00:16:28,559
amazing work but as a result it was

424
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,480
there's lots of Errors there's lots of

425
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:32,159
problems uh the regulations are

426
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,539
inconsistent they're now trying to

427
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:37,860
Patchwork and fix it there's a review

428
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:39,838
that can Act uh CBD got left behind uh

429
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:42,360
you know it's completely differently

430
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:45,120
managed in Canada and us it's you know

431
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:50,220
it basically managed in the same way uh

432
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:53,039
as THC we have Ace

433
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:56,399
people often forget Ontario in which the

434
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:58,078
biggest state province in Canada has a

435
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,958
very strange relationship with alcohol

436
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:02,819
very you know up to very recently uh

437
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:04,678
there was only alcohol storage you could

438
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:07,980
go to run by the province room by the

439
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:10,380
state it was like I don't know it's very

440
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:13,860
white Anglo-Saxon Protestant approach to

441
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:15,660
alcohol is all I could say uh and uh so

442
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:17,879
unfortunately they took that model and

443
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:20,640
they really applied uh

444
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,740
um in several provinces across Canada

445
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,079
that same thing so in Quebec now you're

446
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:27,919
being run by stars what happened in

447
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:31,019
Ontario which is basically half the

448
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,759
market is that there was a last minute

449
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:33,960
change where the province said no we're

450
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:35,160
not going to run the stores because the

451
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,919
conservative came in and want to be

452
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,779
pro-business and now it's a mess so it's

453
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,340
a it's a real big problem

454
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:43,079
as a result people are still going to

455
00:17:41,339 --> 00:17:45,178
the black market but you know I can go

456
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:45,899
on and on and on nauseam but I want to I

457
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:47,880
think

458
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,798
conversations I think will yeah the

459
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,380
point is a lot to be learned from a lot

460
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:55,200
of jurisdictions from where others are

461
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,880
and I'm quite happy to talk about my

462
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,860
mistakes everyone's mistakes in the

463
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,900
system so no one else repeats them

464
00:17:58,859 --> 00:18:03,139
thank you very much just a quick one for

465
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:05,120
the boat do you think that the American

466
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:07,080
unregulated model of the Canadian

467
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:09,178
regulator model is better for an

468
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:10,918
entrepreneur does it seem to be that the

469
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:12,840
Canadian model allows for more dominance

470
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:14,460
by a bigger player and America allows

471
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:16,678
for more entrepreneurs to pop up in

472
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,880
different states and or how do you see

473
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:20,820
that there's different types of

474
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:23,640
entrepreneurs I think uh look I'm a

475
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:26,399
hardcore boring policy guy who does

476
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,919
regulatory policy uh that you know it's

477
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,780
good to have a predictable regulatory

478
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:32,520
system that everyone knows that it's

479
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:34,619
been applied equally across the board

480
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:36,599
that you try to understand that that's

481
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:38,159
number one for any business whether it's

482
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:40,319
telecommunications whether it's farmer

483
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,179
whether it's food and agriculture you

484
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,279
know having a predictable regulatory

485
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:46,860
system by complementarity Across the

486
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:49,379
jurisdiction is huge uh so I would argue

487
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:52,079
that's a real strong point

488
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:54,539
um I think uh

489
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:58,439
I don't know my I've seen a lot of U.S

490
00:18:54,538 --> 00:19:00,240
operations at it's

491
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,100
if you're a certain type of entrepreneur

492
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,200
it could be very profitable

493
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:07,079
there is quite a bit that falls off

494
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,660
blocks of trucks there's uh you know I

495
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:12,000
I've seen some interesting situations uh

496
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:15,000
the case of microbutanol and pesticide

497
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,798
management is a huge issue uh and I

498
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,919
think uh personally I prefer the

499
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:20,879
Canadian model as an entrepreneur but

500
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:22,919
adds to that with the stock exchange

501
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,840
listing possibilities but I I don't know

502
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:27,299
what you think

503
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:29,038
so what I'll say is that in the U.S

504
00:19:27,298 --> 00:19:30,298
there are some I'm not going to take the

505
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:32,339
bait and say one is better than the

506
00:19:30,298 --> 00:19:33,779
other but what I'll say in the U.S I

507
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:35,159
agree it depends on the type of business

508
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:37,918
that you are about whether you're going

509
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:40,740
to be successful and so uh if you are

510
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:43,320
operating within one state

511
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:45,179
um you can be a small business and be

512
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:47,220
reasonably successful if you're managing

513
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:49,259
your business well and uh you're well

514
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,940
capitalized Etc

515
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:53,519
um not having banking presents a

516
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:55,740
challenge uh in some states regulations

517
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:58,019
change very quickly quickly and very

518
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:00,000
frequently uh and so if you're not an

519
00:19:58,019 --> 00:20:02,579
agile business that makes it more

520
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,380
difficult but what I will say is in a

521
00:20:02,579 --> 00:20:05,939
lot of States regular if you're not used

522
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:09,179
to operating in a heavily highly

523
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:11,400
regulated market or you don't have the

524
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:14,059
resources to hire the appropriate

525
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:17,220
compliance and enforcement staff

526
00:20:14,058 --> 00:20:20,639
compliance and Regulatory staff uh you

527
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:22,079
are going to likely be left behind or

528
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,360
face a business environment that's

529
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:26,339
challenging if you are a large

530
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:28,740
multi-state operator you're going to

531
00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:30,599
have those types of individuals working

532
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:32,819
for you and that allows you to navigate

533
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:35,519
the patchwork that is the American

534
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:37,859
cannabis industry so the ability to

535
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:39,960
understand that when you're operating in

536
00:20:37,859 --> 00:20:42,779
Maine if you drive a couple of hours

537
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,819
down the road to Massachusetts you are

538
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:47,279
likely operating in a very different

539
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:49,139
regulatory environment with a variety of

540
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,819
different rules and if you drive 30

541
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:53,160
minutes down the road from there and you

542
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:55,980
end up in Rhode Island that's an even

543
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:57,538
different uh version and Rhode Island is

544
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:00,720
just getting off the ground it's the

545
00:20:57,538 --> 00:21:02,339
latest state to legalize and so when you

546
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,839
think about what those regulatory

547
00:21:02,339 --> 00:21:05,759
changes will be like over the coming

548
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:07,558
years as they get up and running that's

549
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:09,179
going to be very dramatic if you're a

550
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:11,879
small guy trying to operate in a couple

551
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:13,559
of States it's costly the compliance

552
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:17,160
understanding compliance and regulation

553
00:21:13,558 --> 00:21:19,500
is costly and so I I agree completely

554
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:22,380
depending on what type of business you

555
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:24,779
are you can be very successful in the

556
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:26,340
United States and for some people they

557
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:27,839
just end up fighting off way more than

558
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:29,519
they can chew because either they're

559
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:31,619
really good at growing cannabis and

560
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:33,240
really bad at business or they're really

561
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:35,038
good at business and they're really bad

562
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,960
at growing cannabis and they don't know

563
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:40,079
what they don't know and they don't or

564
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,159
can't staff up accordingly based on what

565
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:43,798
they don't know

566
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:45,600
thank you very much John chain and Sean

567
00:21:43,798 --> 00:21:47,759
at the end you have a wealth of

568
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:49,500
experience bringing products into the

569
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:51,179
European market and have dealt with a

570
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,279
number of countries policy and legal

571
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:55,019
framework what was your experience

572
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:56,399
getting these products listed in Europe

573
00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:58,500
and what was the pushback from

574
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,380
governmental forces or was it a more

575
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:03,960
amenable uh from them

576
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:05,400
uh things on and thanks everybody for

577
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,579
the time and the opportunity to be here

578
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:13,798
this is a great forum and a lot of good

579
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:16,259
ideas uh so generally the kind of

580
00:22:13,798 --> 00:22:18,240
it's what I will speak about on this

581
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:21,538
question just medical cannabis and

582
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,819
access uh they

583
00:22:21,538 --> 00:22:27,359
the general kind of position in state

584
00:22:23,819 --> 00:22:28,798
Administration is uh I think like in any

585
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:30,359
other industry they don't want to do

586
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:32,158
something that's new

587
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:33,119
uh they're just they just don't they

588
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,020
don't want to do something that they

589
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:35,038
don't know and they're going to have to

590
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:37,440
learn and they're gonna have to do extra

591
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:39,179
work so that's generally uh you have to

592
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:44,720
understand that as the Baseline

593
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:44,720
and so what uh there was a a general

594
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:51,380
unwillingness to devote time at one's

595
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,640
professional time and and it requires

596
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:57,059
the stakeholders to actually in their

597
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:59,340
free time get educated uh and so this is

598
00:22:57,058 --> 00:23:02,339
this is something that uh there's

599
00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:03,899
there's no way around it but the uh what

600
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:05,699
worked and I believe it will work

601
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:08,720
continuing going forward even in other

602
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:12,120
models is uh

603
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,279
cooperation uh with the you know State

604
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:16,558
Administration and just kind of treating

605
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:19,619
them like humans that they have feelings

606
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:21,058
and that they have some misconceptions

607
00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:23,038
or they might understand something

608
00:23:21,058 --> 00:23:26,099
appropriately and we have to kind of

609
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:30,058
align on a few Baseline points

610
00:23:26,099 --> 00:23:32,219
and once you've reach that point uh then

611
00:23:30,058 --> 00:23:34,139
you can start making progress but in my

612
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:35,519
experience it took in in most countries

613
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,840
just to reach a point where they're

614
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:38,179
starting to be cooperative it took

615
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:40,798
several years

616
00:23:38,179 --> 00:23:43,798
and then once we finally can start

617
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:46,918
getting products into countries uh

618
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:50,339
because we've let's say demonstrated on

619
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:52,140
the uh regulatory technical level that

620
00:23:50,339 --> 00:23:55,079
this is this is compliant we're not

621
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:57,240
doing anything uh out of bounds here uh

622
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:59,158
then then State Administration starts

623
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:03,359
coming on board but then because it's

624
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:05,700
the whole medical uh realm here it's the

625
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:07,979
prescribers in Europe are really against

626
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:11,580
cannabis and there's just no other way

627
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:14,880
to describe it and uh it's a Pity but

628
00:24:11,579 --> 00:24:19,139
that's how it is uh and so

629
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:21,120
it and also we're pushing like uh herbal

630
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:22,380
cannabis into the pharmaceutical

631
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:24,899
framework

632
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:26,880
it's kind of unfortunate because it's

633
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:29,519
it's preventing a lot of people who

634
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,659
could benefit from like therapeutic

635
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:32,759
cannabis that's what they used to call

636
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:34,080
it in Italy in the past therapeutic

637
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:36,538
cannabis and that means using just

638
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:38,339
herbal cannabis uh without direct

639
00:24:36,538 --> 00:24:41,700
supervision from your doctor maybe just

640
00:24:38,339 --> 00:24:43,558
generally checking in uh and that has a

641
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:45,840
lot of benefits for a lot of people but

642
00:24:43,558 --> 00:24:47,220
it's it's it's not encouraged so

643
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:50,699
everything's being pushed in this

644
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:53,640
pharmaceutical route uh which uh for the

645
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:55,500
general population is uh it's not going

646
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:58,200
to be that helpful but for people with

647
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:00,480
specific indications it's great you know

648
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,819
the Pediatric epilepsy I'm here in

649
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,980
Ireland you know that's something

650
00:25:02,819 --> 00:25:07,079
everyone's familiar with that's those

651
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:09,120
stories and so that that's really good

652
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:12,779
in palliative care you know end of life

653
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:14,939
uh uh uh situations uh you know

654
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:17,158
cannabinoids are really effective and

655
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:20,400
helpful and and they they bring people

656
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:22,440
dignity uh but this is actually these

657
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,860
are like Niche markets within the

658
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:29,278
overall health care system and so

659
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:33,058
uh where we are now is there's a lot of

660
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:35,579
medical access theoretically uh around

661
00:25:33,058 --> 00:25:38,158
Europe or even globally now but the

662
00:25:35,579 --> 00:25:41,278
actual patient patient access is still

663
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:45,299
really limited and that's mostly because

664
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:47,038
of the doctors uh and because also they

665
00:25:45,298 --> 00:25:49,740
aren't educated and they have enough on

666
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:51,960
their plate already and to to get uh you

667
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:54,240
know educated in a whole new realm and

668
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,038
the endocannabinoid system doctors don't

669
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,599
even know that this exists quite often

670
00:25:56,038 --> 00:25:59,460
which is a you know it's a terrible pity

671
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:01,259
because it's a it's a really good

672
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:05,159
critical to our overall functioning as

673
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:07,919
you know as mammals so uh there's uh we

674
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:09,900
have to work with people take us take

675
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:14,100
our time but I think what going forward

676
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:16,798
as regards medical uh I think we will be

677
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:18,778
helpful if we can distinguish between

678
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:21,538
people who have really specific needs

679
00:26:18,778 --> 00:26:24,839
that need really specific formulations

680
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:26,940
with really specific uh dosage forms

681
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:29,519
etc etc and make it available to them

682
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:31,440
without all these uh hurdles to jump

683
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:33,720
through and then people who have like

684
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,840
more General conditions which can be

685
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:40,679
helped by cannabis if we can kind of not

686
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:42,720
lump them on to one uh bucket

687
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:44,278
okay interesting so more like breaking

688
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,700
up the medical sphere into two or three

689
00:26:44,278 --> 00:26:49,919
or four different patient categories

690
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:51,778
what is Europe doing correctly in terms

691
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,640
of we've heard about flower or kind of

692
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:55,259
has fallen off the back of trucks what

693
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,880
are you guys at the rest of Europe doing

694
00:26:55,259 --> 00:26:58,798
to ensure that we've got a fully

695
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,260
regulated industry across the European

696
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:02,759
Union that we can make sure we don't

697
00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:05,038
coaches some of the pitfalls that we've

698
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:06,240
seen our neighbors go to and also I

699
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:08,519
think that thank you very much for

700
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,839
inviting us today and we are coming from

701
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:11,579
a technology and traceability

702
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:13,859
perspective okay so I think that

703
00:27:11,579 --> 00:27:16,259
technology is the way to kind of

704
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:18,119
actually remove that problems with

705
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:20,819
access building the confidence of

706
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:23,000
doctors so like like focusing on quality

707
00:27:20,819 --> 00:27:25,619
actually proving that the sauce

708
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,480
compliance of qualities then for the

709
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:29,399
product and treating it as a medicine

710
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,259
not on an alternative medicine right

711
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:33,538
that's from the medical point of view

712
00:27:31,259 --> 00:27:35,879
from falling off the tracks okay like

713
00:27:33,538 --> 00:27:38,759
before with the traceability in States

714
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:40,919
we were focusing a lot we they were

715
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:43,319
because we are in Europe but what we can

716
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:46,200
learn they're not a focus retraceability

717
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:48,000
was around the version but I think a lot

718
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,460
of focus should be starting to be on a

719
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,558
quality with the traceability okay so we

720
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:55,200
should not only know if the product is

721
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:57,480
legal If the product is produced to the

722
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,480
to the certain compliance standards but

723
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:02,819
also trace the quality of that product

724
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,860
from the production to the patient or to

725
00:28:02,819 --> 00:28:06,899
the customer because I think that's the

726
00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:08,879
biggest challenge being in States for

727
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,919
the last week and listening to other

728
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,840
entrepreneurs and people who are working

729
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:14,940
in the industry not specifically

730
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:17,339
producers only but also people who are

731
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:19,679
providing ancillary Services technology

732
00:28:17,339 --> 00:28:20,819
to those producers you look at the

733
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,278
biggest challenge with business

734
00:28:20,819 --> 00:28:25,079
efficiencies that grows the market is

735
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:27,720
the fact that physical power they don't

736
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:29,699
have the data they don't know how to use

737
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,579
the data they don't know how to utilize

738
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:34,500
it the data is not only different and

739
00:28:32,579 --> 00:28:36,599
all of that impacts the quality of the

740
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:40,140
product that ends up the customer and

741
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:41,939
all of that here in Europe impacts the

742
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:43,799
quality of product that ends up the

743
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:45,600
patient because today our legislative

744
00:28:43,798 --> 00:28:49,079
framework is about the patient it's not

745
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:52,259
about recreational yet but through that

746
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:54,058
patient access to creating removing the

747
00:28:52,259 --> 00:28:56,038
stigma from the doctors and the patients

748
00:28:54,058 --> 00:28:58,079
through technology through traceability

749
00:28:56,038 --> 00:29:01,500
through proving the quality compliance

750
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:03,658
and the source we can provide removing

751
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,579
more stigma and move into the

752
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:07,320
recreational market right and in that

753
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:08,939
recreational Market the technology will

754
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:11,038
be even more important because we need

755
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:13,320
to look at more things okay that

756
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:15,778
legality of a product the devotion which

757
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:16,619
is important but at one point we need to

758
00:29:15,778 --> 00:29:18,778
remember

759
00:29:16,619 --> 00:29:20,939
in Europe we're looking at the legal

760
00:29:18,778 --> 00:29:23,579
framework of for example homegrown

761
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:25,620
that's a huge impact on quality so what

762
00:29:23,579 --> 00:29:27,720
are we going to do with the excess of

763
00:29:25,619 --> 00:29:29,759
congruent products how are we going to

764
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,919
improve the quality of congruent

765
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:34,259
products okay all those things impact

766
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:37,500
different like or in all those things

767
00:29:34,259 --> 00:29:39,419
the technology can actually improve the

768
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,819
confidence both the Legacy legislators

769
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:44,100
but also the access and the quality that

770
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:46,558
is being concerned of the products

771
00:29:44,099 --> 00:29:48,418
okay thank you very much I'd be

772
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:50,038
remission if I didn't ask you we've got

773
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:52,080
a lot of movement on Prague and Czech

774
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:53,579
Republic being let's say in unison with

775
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:56,278
Germany about design and policy and

776
00:29:53,579 --> 00:29:57,778
legislation do you think Germany and the

777
00:29:56,278 --> 00:30:00,000
Czech Republic are going to end up

778
00:29:57,778 --> 00:30:01,740
coming to the same conclusion at the

779
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
same time or is Germany going to beat

780
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,460
Czech Republic or is Czech Republic

781
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,099
going to be Germany to legislation I

782
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:10,200
think that they already are in uh in in

783
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:12,719
alignment uh that there's already

784
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:16,140
they're working together they're sharing

785
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,819
drafts back and forth of the uh uh you

786
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:21,179
know their Frameworks their their

787
00:30:17,819 --> 00:30:23,819
Concepts their their end goals uh

788
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:26,159
there's you know differences in uh you

789
00:30:23,819 --> 00:30:29,038
know some of the specifics uh they're

790
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:32,100
working though uh diligently I I really

791
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:34,079
can say uh on both sides and

792
00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:36,178
specifically in the Czech Republic I

793
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:37,678
live in the Czech Republic so uh you

794
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:38,460
know disclosure

795
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,340
um

796
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:45,120
there is a unique

797
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:48,000
situation happening right now where in

798
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:49,739
most countries as we're trying to figure

799
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,319
out what is the role of cannabis in

800
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:54,298
society uh there's different like groups

801
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:56,158
in everybody traditionally in most

802
00:30:54,298 --> 00:30:58,319
countries is fighting for their own

803
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,740
interests and that's how it was in the

804
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:04,619
Czech Republic as long as I can remember

805
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:05,880
but recently everybody has gotten on on

806
00:31:04,619 --> 00:31:08,538
board

807
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:11,159
fighting for the for one cause together

808
00:31:08,538 --> 00:31:12,960
to do what's right for society as a

809
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:15,539
whole I know that might kind of sound a

810
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:19,259
highfalutin but it's really true uh the

811
00:31:15,538 --> 00:31:21,679
uh really Divergent stakeholder groups

812
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:24,259
are now coming together

813
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:27,120
asking how can we work together

814
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:30,179
synergize to push us over the Finish

815
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:31,979
Line because really now what uh at least

816
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:35,519
in the Czech Republic it's similar to

817
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:39,960
what's happening in Switzerland but um

818
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:42,898
from a more uh kind of salt of the earth

819
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:44,759
approach uh is that the checks are

820
00:31:42,898 --> 00:31:46,558
coming together and they say look we

821
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:49,619
want to do something that helps people

822
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:51,359
we've uh that even kind of maybe let me

823
00:31:49,619 --> 00:31:53,158
dispel one myth that any checks are all

824
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:55,619
crazy Stoners they're not they're just

825
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:58,620
very normal uh people like you like you

826
00:31:55,619 --> 00:32:00,359
and me and they but they're kind of

827
00:31:58,619 --> 00:32:02,879
pragmatic you know they've been at the

828
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:04,319
crossroads of Europe for history so

829
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,360
they've been kind of they've had

830
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:08,519
everything forced down the throat from

831
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:11,219
religion and politics and the different

832
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:13,139
systems so they they've reached this

833
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:17,220
kind of point and I think they're like

834
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:20,278
uh national identity that they're going

835
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:23,159
to make a decision based on their own ex

836
00:32:20,278 --> 00:32:25,500
direct experience and what that is is

837
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:29,700
that cannabis is it needs to be

838
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:32,159
controlled it has risks uh but at the

839
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:34,860
same time it has benefits and when used

840
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:38,940
responsibly if there's education and and

841
00:32:34,859 --> 00:32:42,538
fair information the and that is it can

842
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:44,519
be a normal healthy part of uh of your

843
00:32:42,538 --> 00:32:46,679
kind of social uh cohesion that it's

844
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:50,940
it's not something that is is abstract

845
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:54,000
and so the checks versus the Germans

846
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:55,500
there's uh it's I don't want to play say

847
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,140
one or the other because they're

848
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:01,440
generally moving uh in lockstep which is

849
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:05,220
really great uh and it's it shows that

850
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:09,058
there is this uh potential for kind of a

851
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:11,339
a European solution uh and historically

852
00:33:09,058 --> 00:33:13,500
the Czechs and Germans did this about

853
00:33:11,339 --> 00:33:17,220
150 years ago most people don't know it

854
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:20,398
but uh in the in the world of Brewing uh

855
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:22,980
The Lager beer or pills whatever you

856
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:25,139
want to call it uh there was many people

857
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:26,278
in the 1800s Brewing beers and trying to

858
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:28,259
figure out how to do it and the

859
00:33:26,278 --> 00:33:30,720
Bohemians what grade and the bavarians

860
00:33:28,259 --> 00:33:32,759
were great but and then what happened

861
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,200
was the bavarians in the Bohemians it's

862
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:37,500
like the Czechs and Germans they came

863
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:39,720
together in the city of Pilsen and they

864
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:42,240
created what was at the time unique it

865
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,980
was a brewery in which there was Czech

866
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,278
speakers and German speakers working

867
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:50,278
together to come with up with the right

868
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:51,960
recipe for the best product and then the

869
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:54,419
result was Pils and earthquake which is

870
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:57,538
now the it's like the the best beer in

871
00:33:54,419 --> 00:33:58,860
the world frankly but uh and now what

872
00:33:57,538 --> 00:34:00,480
the Germans and checks are doing the

873
00:33:58,859 --> 00:34:03,058
same thing

874
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,240
very interesting so virtue of that work

875
00:34:03,058 --> 00:34:05,240
away

876
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:09,659
you know I think that was a really great

877
00:34:07,558 --> 00:34:11,338
point that was made about these sort of

878
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:13,858
Divisions and then putting divisions

879
00:34:11,338 --> 00:34:16,559
aside uh to to come together to advance

880
00:34:13,858 --> 00:34:18,659
a goal this happens this has happened uh

881
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:20,579
repeatedly in the American context at

882
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:22,200
least uh the problems not so much the

883
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:24,598
coming together and that well that's

884
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:26,579
true in our politics generally but

885
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:28,260
um certainly in cannabis and so early on

886
00:34:26,579 --> 00:34:29,398
in in the Cannabis fight especially

887
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:32,760
around

888
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:35,219
um adult use uh there was a lot of uh

889
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,919
people coming together and speaking in a

890
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:40,799
similar voice and having some wins in

891
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:42,960
Colorado and Washington early on very

892
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,780
shortly thereafter the the fissures

893
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:48,059
within the movement really emerged uh

894
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:50,460
and so you had groups of people who knew

895
00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:51,838
that that who knew that their approach

896
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:54,418
was the right approach and that their

897
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:57,179
approach was the only approach uh and so

898
00:34:54,418 --> 00:34:59,579
that created some real

899
00:34:57,179 --> 00:35:01,618
um challenges within the movement and

900
00:34:59,579 --> 00:35:03,420
also some failures within the movement

901
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:05,880
we saw some ballot initiatives fail

902
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:08,099
because uh multiple groups were trying

903
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:10,200
to put initiatives on ballots in States

904
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:12,480
and uh when one got on and the other

905
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:14,819
didn't they opposed the other side and

906
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,159
so infighting has really held back

907
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:19,260
cannabis reform uh in the United States

908
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:21,420
and so uh and and certainly around the

909
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:23,339
world and when you think about the

910
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:24,960
broader perspective if you're a cannabis

911
00:35:23,338 --> 00:35:27,539
reform Advocate

912
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,699
um your question should not be is my

913
00:35:27,539 --> 00:35:31,800
idea better than that other cannabis

914
00:35:29,699 --> 00:35:34,739
reform Advocate uh your perspective

915
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:37,619
should be are our ideas better than

916
00:35:34,739 --> 00:35:39,838
prohibitionists ideas uh and until you

917
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:42,539
approach it from that perspective you're

918
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:44,759
going to keep screwing yourself and so

919
00:35:42,539 --> 00:35:46,380
when you are in that fight especially

920
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,240
the initial fight once you pass

921
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:49,980
legalization and you're in regulatory

922
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:52,500
fights you're going to have that that

923
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:55,139
sort of mudslinging and in the trenches

924
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:57,539
kind of bitter fights over very small

925
00:35:55,139 --> 00:36:00,420
parts of policy but in terms of the

926
00:35:57,539 --> 00:36:02,880
broader question uh the biggest threat

927
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:05,280
to cannabis advocacy to cannabis

928
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,680
Advocates is oftentimes other cannabis

929
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:10,320
Advocates and so being able to put those

930
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:11,179
uh differences down whether it's within

931
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,800
a country

932
00:36:11,179 --> 00:36:16,139
or whether it's across countries trying

933
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,780
to fight for the same thing taking that

934
00:36:16,139 --> 00:36:20,578
deep breath understanding that the other

935
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:22,740
cannabis Advocate with a different idea

936
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:25,140
isn't your enemy but just a friend with

937
00:36:22,739 --> 00:36:27,659
a different perspective is the best way

938
00:36:25,139 --> 00:36:30,118
to move through those but I've seen far

939
00:36:27,659 --> 00:36:31,858
too often on people groups shoot

940
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:34,140
themselves in the foot because they're

941
00:36:31,858 --> 00:36:37,799
too proud to compromise or they're too

942
00:36:34,139 --> 00:36:39,838
proud uh to us understand that maybe

943
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,820
they're that the small parts that

944
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:44,400
they're fighting for is not worth

945
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:47,579
throwing the entire battle away

946
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,680
okay thank you very much yeah I just

947
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:52,440
want to add two quick things to that uh

948
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:54,179
first of all in relation to the split

949
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:56,039
um you know in different types of

950
00:36:54,179 --> 00:36:58,799
medical counters I would like to go up a

951
00:36:56,039 --> 00:37:00,000
policy level and you know let's deal

952
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,160
with the elephant in the room where

953
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,159
there's a lot of policy a lot of

954
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:08,879
political fear that oh medical cannabis

955
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:11,219
is just a gateway to uh legalization and

956
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:14,460
it's bad that's a huge issue when you're

957
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:16,980
having conversations uh around trying to

958
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:19,199
move the needle uh in a jurisdiction on

959
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:21,358
cannabis taking the concept of splitting

960
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:23,159
it one thing that you can see from the

961
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:26,039
Canadian regulations they've actually

962
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:27,480
got a segment in their regulations that

963
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:29,539
talk about

964
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:32,159
products called a section called

965
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:33,659
cannabis with drugs

966
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:35,879
and if you stand back and go hang on a

967
00:37:33,659 --> 00:37:37,259
minute what's that even mean well what

968
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:40,380
it means is kind of has seen something

969
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:42,359
different than what a traditional FDA

970
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:44,820
drug is Right An approved drug and

971
00:37:42,358 --> 00:37:46,799
there's actually a third way in the kind

972
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:48,720
of in the Canadian regulations to say

973
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,339
okay were you predicted in the future

974
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:52,019
there will be medical cannabis there

975
00:37:50,338 --> 00:37:54,119
will always be medical Council utility

976
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:55,559
but it's more than likely going to be a

977
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:58,260
combination of formulations with

978
00:37:55,559 --> 00:37:59,460
different already existing drugs and you

979
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:02,640
know whether it's

980
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:04,920
CBN and melatonin whether it's yeah I I

981
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:06,480
can go down so there is a way to protect

982
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,760
that I'm I think it's very important

983
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,199
that we protect the medical piece the

984
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:14,400
second element that I'd like to touch on

985
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:16,379
is 100 on you know your your Advocates

986
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,420
your Advocates shoulder shoulders should

987
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:20,039
be shoulder shoulder in Canada we saw

988
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:22,920
this through well you're only a business

989
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:24,539
guy or you're IMAX government so I don't

990
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:27,180
understand the fight that I've had for

991
00:38:24,539 --> 00:38:29,219
40 years uh with you know you know

992
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:32,460
trying to my civil rights and smoking

993
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:34,559
cannabis like a fair uh but we need to

994
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,940
work together and you know some of the

995
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:39,358
companies actually the companies that

996
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:41,940
did really well is or those who actually

997
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:44,578
brought together people who were

998
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:45,960
hardcore and campaigns that did really

999
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:49,760
well brought people together who were

1000
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:52,500
hardcore I would say traditional Legacy

1001
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:56,160
Advocates that you know went back 40

1002
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:58,440
years and combine it with those who uh

1003
00:38:56,159 --> 00:39:00,899
understood you know modern lobbying

1004
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:03,300
business approaches and that was huge

1005
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,559
and certainly you know the company one

1006
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,599
of the companies I worked with I work

1007
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:09,358
shoulder and shoulder in you know every

1008
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:12,180
day with a guy who his last paycheck

1009
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:14,039
before he works uh and before we took

1010
00:39:12,179 --> 00:39:17,460
him from the grave Market into the White

1011
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:20,820
Market was he was paid from a bag that

1012
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:23,039
fell from a helicopter uh so but now

1013
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:25,380
he's paid in a proper job and a proper

1014
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:28,920
working he is from it was fantastic guy

1015
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:30,599
super smart and it was a real honor to

1016
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:32,099
be able to learn from him so I think

1017
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:34,680
there's a lot to be done both on the

1018
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:37,859
split on making sure we don't infight

1019
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:39,539
for either the medical or direct uh

1020
00:39:37,858 --> 00:39:41,400
campaign that's on billing

1021
00:39:39,539 --> 00:39:42,480
okay thank you very much for somewhere

1022
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,160
like Ireland let's say we have an

1023
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,199
archaic medical cannabis program at the

1024
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:47,940
moment what in year two experience as

1025
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:50,338
well what was the Catalyst for the

1026
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:52,740
legalization or a full medical program

1027
00:39:50,338 --> 00:39:54,599
happening in America and Canada was was

1028
00:39:52,739 --> 00:39:56,098
it lobbying was IT consulting firms was

1029
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:57,660
it a mixture as you said or a

1030
00:39:56,099 --> 00:39:59,519
combination of everything

1031
00:39:57,659 --> 00:40:01,858
yeah so really quick on medical in

1032
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:03,780
Canada it always the crown losing court

1033
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:05,279
case Ultra court case after court case

1034
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:07,859
so

1035
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,660
um you know the Canadian government is

1036
00:40:07,858 --> 00:40:12,299
terrible losing two types of court cases

1037
00:40:09,659 --> 00:40:14,399
number one is indigenous court cases uh

1038
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:15,560
because unlike the US

1039
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,940
um there are

1040
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:20,460
very complicated indigenous Affairs

1041
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:23,579
issues where uh you know there was no

1042
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:26,699
people defeated in in uh in Canada like

1043
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:28,680
the US so uh they're uh they have a

1044
00:40:26,699 --> 00:40:30,539
whole different bunch of Rights and they

1045
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:32,338
they you know the crown loses all the

1046
00:40:30,539 --> 00:40:35,400
time the second group were medical

1047
00:40:32,338 --> 00:40:37,559
cannabis access where they were just

1048
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,780
took the government to court over and

1049
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:41,719
over and over again and you saw you

1050
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:44,880
could trace back to um

1051
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:46,919
1998 the first called cannabis regime

1052
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,300
what they were forced to do it and you

1053
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,460
know when I went into medical cannabis

1054
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:52,560
it was a conservative government and

1055
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:54,240
they actually the approach and I'm not

1056
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:55,920
saying anything out of school is is that

1057
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:58,199
their approach was they came into

1058
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,720
government and they someone realized

1059
00:40:58,199 --> 00:41:02,578
that there's a government-run medical

1060
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:05,279
cannabis Supply system because they were

1061
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:07,920
forced to do it added court cases and

1062
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,540
someone said to these conservatives who

1063
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,760
are very pro-business making money said

1064
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:15,300
yeah we're losing five million dollars a

1065
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:17,280
year selling weed and they went what

1066
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:20,400
and they said we're going to hand this

1067
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:22,019
entire program over to corporations let

1068
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,358
them lose the five million dollars or

1069
00:41:22,019 --> 00:41:28,500
make five million we we shouldn't be

1070
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:32,219
growing in federal facility Supply

1071
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:34,559
Federal patients so I think to answer

1072
00:41:32,219 --> 00:41:37,980
your question it's a combination of uh

1073
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:39,539
court cases and really good solutions

1074
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:41,519
that you can bring to the government to

1075
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:43,800
have a problem like you should never be

1076
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:45,719
just apt to government it's all about

1077
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:48,060
Solutions and it's all you never just

1078
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:50,159
[ __ ] at the governments or officials

1079
00:41:48,059 --> 00:41:52,380
you always come with Solutions and ideas

1080
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:54,239
and Concepts and work with them it's

1081
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:56,519
fancy

1082
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:57,779
so we had a very different experience in

1083
00:41:56,519 --> 00:41:59,820
the United States

1084
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:01,980
um it also gives me an opportunity to

1085
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:03,960
shingly pled my book marijuana Short

1086
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:05,880
history that describes this in uh

1087
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,440
significant detail but it was a

1088
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,900
Grassroots effort in the United States

1089
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,240
uh that that allowed the first medical

1090
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:14,880
cannabis program in California to happen

1091
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:16,799
that was a decades-long fight uh the

1092
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,800
true Catalyst was the AIDS epidemic the

1093
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:22,260
HIV aids crisis uh and so the use of

1094
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:26,880
cannabis uh particularly in Los Angeles

1095
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:28,859
and San Francisco to help ameliorate the

1096
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,599
side effects of early HIV

1097
00:42:28,858 --> 00:42:34,319
Pharmaceuticals

1098
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:37,619
um was shown to uh benefit communities

1099
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:39,780
uh that were oftentimes Left Behind

1100
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:42,480
um again lesbian communities poorer

1101
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:45,720
communities during the HIV aids crisis

1102
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:47,820
and so uh in those cities in bigger

1103
00:42:45,719 --> 00:42:49,259
cities in California what grew to be

1104
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:50,660
palliative care

1105
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:53,040
um for dying AIDS patients

1106
00:42:50,659 --> 00:42:55,920
disproportionately gay men um at that

1107
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:57,480
time as well as cancer patients and

1108
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:00,300
other people dealing with end-of-life

1109
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:02,039
issues really caught fire and while it

1110
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,839
began as a Grassroots effort in

1111
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:05,818
California

1112
00:43:02,838 --> 00:43:08,759
there were some political professionals

1113
00:43:05,818 --> 00:43:10,739
who sort of parachuted in toward the end

1114
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:13,200
of the ballot initiative fire during the

1115
00:43:10,739 --> 00:43:15,179
ballot initiative fight uh to get that

1116
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:16,559
initiative across the Finish Finish Line

1117
00:43:15,179 --> 00:43:19,199
in terms of getting the signatures

1118
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:21,838
necessary to make the ballot um and then

1119
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:25,019
ultimately uh to to pass the initiative

1120
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:26,940
on Election Day in 1996 and one of one

1121
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:29,880
of my favorite bits of trivia is

1122
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:32,460
California approved a medical cannabis

1123
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:34,740
on the same night that Bill Clinton was

1124
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:36,720
re-elected president and cannabis beat

1125
00:43:34,739 --> 00:43:39,118
him by several hundred thousand votes in

1126
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:41,219
a state that he won't handle it

1127
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:45,480
okay very good

1128
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:47,039
um is there a let's say A Line in the

1129
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,599
Sand that North American companies are

1130
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:50,818
going to see Europe as an actual viable

1131
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:53,220
market and start to pump Capital into

1132
00:43:50,818 --> 00:43:54,659
the industry or is are we still playing

1133
00:43:53,219 --> 00:43:56,399
a waiting game and see what happens with

1134
00:43:54,659 --> 00:43:58,679
legislation is Germany going to be what

1135
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,300
everybody's looking at or is let's say

1136
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:03,000
the medical program that gets launched

1137
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:04,500
in Spain if that becomes very accessible

1138
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,519
is that something that has enough to

1139
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:08,300
bring in the North American countries

1140
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:08,300
from American Canada

1141
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:12,180
yeah

1142
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:15,119
or first

1143
00:44:12,179 --> 00:44:17,480
very quickly I think the question is are

1144
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:20,039
they going to put more money more money

1145
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:22,920
someone who saw a lot of money going to

1146
00:44:20,039 --> 00:44:25,199
Germany Italy uh and for free in France

1147
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:29,519
right now to supply a product

1148
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:33,179
um I I can tell you it's more money uh

1149
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:36,539
i s i I am always hesitant to say

1150
00:44:33,179 --> 00:44:38,879
anything about Germany because it's uh

1151
00:44:36,539 --> 00:44:40,559
as every Irish person who's ever worked

1152
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:43,079
in agriculture will tell you and I used

1153
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:46,019
to work in agriculture uh it's a very

1154
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:48,240
strange uh you know process to German

1155
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:51,059
protests you know to approve anything

1156
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:53,939
and the regulatory Frameworks uh all I

1157
00:44:51,059 --> 00:44:55,318
can tell you is that in 2016 I sat in a

1158
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:58,980
small kitchen with the minister of State

1159
00:44:55,318 --> 00:45:02,338
for health for Germany at the time uh he

1160
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:03,838
back then was super adamant that it was

1161
00:45:02,338 --> 00:45:06,299
going to be German produced German

1162
00:45:03,838 --> 00:45:07,858
developed and you're seeing already even

1163
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:11,640
Canada that subscript they don't allow

1164
00:45:07,858 --> 00:45:13,619
Imports so certainly in my perspective

1165
00:45:11,639 --> 00:45:15,960
whether it's you know more advanced

1166
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:17,519
Medical or even recreational I you know

1167
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,740
I know they're going to have gaps in it

1168
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:21,838
uh but Canada had gaps as well we didn't

1169
00:45:19,739 --> 00:45:25,379
feel the need to import recreational

1170
00:45:21,838 --> 00:45:27,679
cannabis for anybody else uh for example

1171
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:30,358
you know at Uruguay or elsewhere

1172
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:32,039
certainly I think it's going to be a

1173
00:45:30,358 --> 00:45:34,858
pretty close shop and if you're not in

1174
00:45:32,039 --> 00:45:36,960
behind the German border uh after a

1175
00:45:34,858 --> 00:45:39,119
while that's it it's going to be a

1176
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:43,079
German operation

1177
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:45,539
script what I'll say is I think one of

1178
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:48,300
one of the benefits of a Nation like

1179
00:45:45,539 --> 00:45:51,000
Germany legalizing in terms of uh

1180
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:52,800
capital from the United States is it

1181
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,239
cuts down dramatically on uncertainty

1182
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,500
the worst thing for a business and the

1183
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:57,838
worst thing for an investor is

1184
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:59,400
significant uncertainty there's a lot of

1185
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:01,318
uncertainty in the United States right

1186
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:04,460
now in American um Capital markets

1187
00:46:01,318 --> 00:46:06,960
around cannabis uh and in in American

1188
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:09,420
cannabis industry and I think a big part

1189
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:12,358
of that is not whether you know a state

1190
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:14,159
is going to reverse uh its decision to

1191
00:46:12,358 --> 00:46:16,318
legalize cannabis or whether an entire

1192
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:17,460
Market in the United States is going to

1193
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:18,900
go under

1194
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:20,818
um but what the shock of federal

1195
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:22,559
legalization is going to look like and

1196
00:46:20,818 --> 00:46:24,480
so uh you know there are going to be

1197
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:26,460
states in the U.S that end up being net

1198
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,900
exporter States and states that will be

1199
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:29,880
net importers States when Federal

1200
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:31,740
legalization happens so if you're

1201
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,960
investing in a company that's growing

1202
00:46:31,739 --> 00:46:35,098
that has cultivation facilities in

1203
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,900
Alaska

1204
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:38,460
you're probably going to lose a lot of

1205
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:41,220
money if you invest in those companies

1206
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:44,039
when Federal legalization happens and

1207
00:46:41,219 --> 00:46:46,139
cheaper to be produced cannabis flows

1208
00:46:44,039 --> 00:46:47,579
into that state and so I think there's a

1209
00:46:46,139 --> 00:46:50,519
lot of money on the sidelines in the

1210
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:53,400
United States right now looking for a

1211
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:55,559
safer bet uh and as soon as um you know

1212
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:57,300
Canada is an example American Capital

1213
00:46:55,559 --> 00:46:59,159
flowed into Canada

1214
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:01,980
um uh before uh during and after

1215
00:46:59,159 --> 00:47:03,960
legalization happened uh because it was

1216
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:06,240
seen as a safer bet and I think Germany

1217
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:09,420
and other European nations are going to

1218
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:11,338
provide that type of uh sort of zone of

1219
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:13,079
safety or zone of certainty around

1220
00:47:11,338 --> 00:47:15,719
cannabis that the United States just

1221
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:18,000
just does not have right now uh until

1222
00:47:15,719 --> 00:47:19,980
until legalization happens now some

1223
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,199
uncertainty and some risk

1224
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:24,179
um you know you'll you'll see investors

1225
00:47:22,199 --> 00:47:26,699
going after but the amount of

1226
00:47:24,179 --> 00:47:28,078
uncertainty in U.S markets right now is

1227
00:47:26,699 --> 00:47:30,960
pretty profound

1228
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:32,519
thank you very much so for Sean and Sean

1229
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,800
you want to work late yeah of course

1230
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:37,318
work way just one small comment on on

1231
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:39,960
this kind of this topic uh essentially

1232
00:47:37,318 --> 00:47:41,759
is what we're getting where we're moving

1233
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:43,920
now is you know cannabis poly

1234
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,599
discussions in Europe is if uh European

1235
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,400
uh competition laws are going to apply

1236
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:49,500
or not and I think it's really important

1237
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:51,660
that we hold a firm that

1238
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:53,880
that's the whole basis of the Common

1239
00:47:51,659 --> 00:47:55,858
Market uh so any of these National

1240
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:58,680
fortresses I think should be really

1241
00:47:55,858 --> 00:48:00,659
discouraged and not encouraged at all

1242
00:47:58,679 --> 00:48:02,818
okay I actually went to the Jungle into

1243
00:48:00,659 --> 00:48:04,500
our two European experts what do you

1244
00:48:02,818 --> 00:48:05,940
think is going to be the Catalyst in

1245
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:07,559
Europe you just mentioned there they're

1246
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:09,599
protecting our own businesses and our

1247
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:11,818
own regulations can you maybe both

1248
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:13,380
elaborate on what you think Europe is

1249
00:48:11,818 --> 00:48:15,239
going to be the inflection pointers well

1250
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:19,858
I think we're getting very close to it

1251
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:21,618
now and that generally uh amongst the

1252
00:48:19,858 --> 00:48:24,719
general public

1253
00:48:21,619 --> 00:48:26,579
policy makers essentially everybody it's

1254
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:29,818
pretty clear that prohibition doesn't

1255
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:31,680
work uh really nobody's denying that

1256
00:48:29,818 --> 00:48:33,599
anymore right so we all know prohibition

1257
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:37,559
doesn't work so something needs to give

1258
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:40,920
the question is what will it be uh they

1259
00:48:37,559 --> 00:48:43,259
like here uh in in the dial if I

1260
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:45,480
pronounce it right Gino Kenny has a

1261
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:47,880
another bill for decriminalization which

1262
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:52,260
is great uh and Geno Kennedy he's a

1263
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:55,260
Irish parliamentarian uh who's fighting

1264
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:56,880
for his uh you know constituency uh and

1265
00:48:55,260 --> 00:49:01,680
and it's great that he's doing something

1266
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:03,119
but uh the decriminalization efforts uh

1267
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:05,098
fail they don't they don't solve

1268
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,980
anything so that's being like floated as

1269
00:49:05,099 --> 00:49:09,420
Plan B in Germany but it's it's a total

1270
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:10,800
waste of time like don't even go there

1271
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:12,900
uh

1272
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,519
Portugal decriminalized like 20 years

1273
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:16,440
ago the Netherlands the Czech Republic

1274
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:17,880
also but people are still getting locked

1275
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,858
up all the time the product is still

1276
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:22,920
illegal you can't do business with it

1277
00:49:19,858 --> 00:49:25,259
you it's just don't do decriminalization

1278
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:27,539
there's one country where it makes sense

1279
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:29,220
maybe maybe possibly France but in the

1280
00:49:27,539 --> 00:49:30,838
United States decriminalization makes a

1281
00:49:29,219 --> 00:49:33,118
lot of sense because of the racial

1282
00:49:30,838 --> 00:49:35,400
disparities locking up African-American

1283
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:38,519
African-Americans in for-profit prisons

1284
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:40,500
uh so the United States needs to

1285
00:49:38,519 --> 00:49:42,300
decriminalize it's completely separate

1286
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:44,880
from the American today like cannabis

1287
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:47,039
consumption question uh but in Europe I

1288
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:50,039
believe that right now we are at that

1289
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:52,980
that moment in 2023 is really important

1290
00:49:50,039 --> 00:49:55,980
as as Kai said this morning uh you know

1291
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:57,240
we're expecting stuff next month uh the

1292
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:58,260
there's gonna be stuff from Germany

1293
00:49:57,239 --> 00:50:01,799
there's gonna be stuff from the Czech

1294
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:05,280
Republic uh the the European commission

1295
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:07,380
you know is coming up uh and so where we

1296
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,579
really need I believe at this point to

1297
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:10,700
say

1298
00:50:08,579 --> 00:50:13,680
prohibition doesn't work

1299
00:50:10,699 --> 00:50:16,460
we don't want kids having access to

1300
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:20,460
cannabis freely being offered in schools

1301
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:24,420
and there's now uh the new wave is this

1302
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:26,760
hhc uh products uh this is just like the

1303
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:28,680
new spice and you know if someone thinks

1304
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:31,079
that this is because of uh people don't

1305
00:50:28,679 --> 00:50:33,118
want to get so high I mean I I disagree

1306
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:34,920
I think this is just a loophole and

1307
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:35,940
people are just using it because THC is

1308
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:39,000
illegal and so they're going to get

1309
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:41,400
people high through through back

1310
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,199
channels through some loophole and the

1311
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:46,318
easiest way really the most pragmatic

1312
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:48,179
way to solve this is to say we need to

1313
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:49,920
legalize cannabis so it's not illicit

1314
00:50:48,179 --> 00:50:53,279
because then we can trade and then we

1315
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:55,858
overcome the uh these like national uh

1316
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:58,079
Champion kind of Concepts uh but then we

1317
00:50:55,858 --> 00:51:02,400
need to so Legalize It And do smart

1318
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:04,380
regulation where THC is simply accepted

1319
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,780
as something that's that's been with us

1320
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:09,119
it's with us and will be and then we can

1321
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:11,940
essentially do away with all these like

1322
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:13,980
kind of Frankenstein Creations that are

1323
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:16,200
just filling a gap so I think we're at

1324
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:19,260
that moment right now Owen

1325
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:21,000
you know I I agree with that it's 100

1326
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:22,920
you know like becoming to the moment

1327
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,539
like obviously that Catalyst will be

1328
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:27,539
possibly German young or Czech Republic

1329
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:28,460
that is a race right so we see who wins

1330
00:51:27,539 --> 00:51:30,480
but

1331
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:33,240
decriminalization doesn't work because

1332
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:35,940
it cannot create a legal regulated

1333
00:51:33,239 --> 00:51:37,500
system in which we can know exactly what

1334
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:39,838
happens all right so like we're trying

1335
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:41,460
to find this like that's nice work

1336
00:51:39,838 --> 00:51:43,858
practice time kind of like in

1337
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:46,079
legislation framework that will not

1338
00:51:43,858 --> 00:51:48,480
improve public health will not reduce

1339
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:50,940
the reduce harm they're going to

1340
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:54,119
introduce the

1341
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:56,159
low quality products into the market and

1342
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:58,019
which which we cannot control the other

1343
00:51:56,159 --> 00:51:59,879
thing is like you ask about the American

1344
00:51:58,019 --> 00:52:01,739
companies coming to Europe right like

1345
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:03,539
there's a high excitement from a

1346
00:52:01,739 --> 00:52:06,419
technology American companies to come to

1347
00:52:03,539 --> 00:52:08,279
Europe but they don't know how to move

1348
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:09,838
around that Market at all right like I

1349
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:11,700
think that there is a lot of Education

1350
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:13,920
that needs to happen in States as well

1351
00:52:11,699 --> 00:52:16,139
what we do like you get the questions in

1352
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,720
America night can you study recreational

1353
00:52:16,139 --> 00:52:21,838
Cannabis you all right like they don't

1354
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:24,000
know anything and I think that islet can

1355
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:25,858
play this role that it's always played

1356
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,858
for years of becoming that bridge

1357
00:52:25,858 --> 00:52:30,779
between Europe and America and United

1358
00:52:28,858 --> 00:52:32,639
States especially about from a

1359
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:34,440
technology perspective where we can

1360
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:37,558
provide a bit of knowledge about Europe

1361
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:40,380
and on the other defense provides to

1362
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:42,599
American companies and that Gateway

1363
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:45,358
provided to Europe and to kind of bring

1364
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:47,220
that market faster so we can remove the

1365
00:52:45,358 --> 00:52:49,199
problems that American Market had you

1366
00:52:47,219 --> 00:52:51,419
know Canadian America

1367
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:53,639
thank you very much I think sorry go on

1368
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:55,858
workway John uh one item I want to add

1369
00:52:53,639 --> 00:52:57,480
to that to build on that I I agree at

1370
00:52:55,858 --> 00:52:58,920
the point about decriminalization and

1371
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:01,920
anti-criminalization in the United

1372
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:04,139
States we found even still racial

1373
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:06,119
inequities and biases

1374
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:08,699
um uh post-state decriminalization

1375
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:10,260
efforts one of the arguments that I

1376
00:53:08,699 --> 00:53:12,179
rarely hear in a legalization

1377
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:15,359
conversation that I think is something

1378
00:53:12,179 --> 00:53:17,519
that is applicable in a not just in the

1379
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:20,279
U.S but but in countries around the

1380
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:22,199
world uh surrounds public health and so

1381
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:24,240
a lot of people in a legalization fight

1382
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:25,799
are concerned about well what's going to

1383
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:27,779
happen with public health are there

1384
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:30,119
going to be drug drivers on the roads or

1385
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:32,579
children uh going to be uh getting

1386
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:34,260
greater access to it uh what is cannabis

1387
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:37,559
use disorder and mental health issues

1388
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:40,980
going to be like all valid concerns

1389
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:42,119
um but I think what is wrong is we think

1390
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:43,980
about

1391
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:46,260
um uh you know those public health

1392
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:48,780
issues a as if they don't already exist

1393
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:51,000
in our society that uses cannabis as the

1394
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:55,079
most commonly used illicit drug in the

1395
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:57,960
world but the comparison should not just

1396
00:53:55,079 --> 00:54:00,839
be will legalization have this effect or

1397
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:03,059
not but the alternative is if we are

1398
00:54:00,838 --> 00:54:05,159
throwing a lot of people in jail

1399
00:54:03,059 --> 00:54:06,839
um for cannabis let's think about what

1400
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:09,179
the public health consequences of

1401
00:54:06,838 --> 00:54:10,799
jailing people is we know what those

1402
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:12,299
Public Health consequences are and

1403
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,818
they're severe whether it's around

1404
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:17,099
recidivism whether it's around drug

1405
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:19,858
addiction whether it is around the

1406
00:54:17,099 --> 00:54:21,480
variety of other health outcomes that we

1407
00:54:19,858 --> 00:54:22,920
can point to the individuals who are

1408
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:25,440
incarcerated and the formerly

1409
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:27,480
incarcerated um deal with not just

1410
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,280
during their time in prison

1411
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:32,280
um but over the arch of their lifetime

1412
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:33,900
and so really in the legalization fights

1413
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:37,619
that needs to be the public health

1414
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:39,960
comparison what is worse locking up in

1415
00:54:37,619 --> 00:54:42,900
the United States hundreds of thousands

1416
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:44,760
of people every year which we still do

1417
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:47,400
um and dealing with those Public Health

1418
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:49,980
crises or the public health challenges

1419
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:51,539
that are represented by legalization and

1420
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:53,280
that is a public health argument I don't

1421
00:54:51,539 --> 00:54:55,259
hear made often enough and it's

1422
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:57,180
something that is not difficult for the

1423
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:59,400
average citizen of the United States

1424
00:54:57,179 --> 00:55:01,739
where the average citizen of countries

1425
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:03,900
across the world to understand everyone

1426
00:55:01,739 --> 00:55:05,879
knows that the incarcerated informally

1427
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:10,500
incarcerated deal with a variety of

1428
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:13,079
problems and those two most people

1429
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:15,358
far outweigh the potential public health

1430
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:19,260
risks of legalization

1431
00:55:15,358 --> 00:55:22,019
very much John you whatever word yeah I

1432
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:24,300
agree with everything you say uh on the

1433
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:26,699
decrim piece uh

1434
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:29,460
I think if you have to step back and

1435
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:33,000
understand from a public policy

1436
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:35,880
regulatory policy uh P stop something

1437
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,858
about for example that's Gino's doing is

1438
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:39,838
he's trying to oh there's there's a

1439
00:55:37,858 --> 00:55:42,000
theory in regulatory policy and I could

1440
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:43,619
bore you all for a long time uh that

1441
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,358
about opening Windows before you open

1442
00:55:43,619 --> 00:55:47,760
doors

1443
00:55:45,358 --> 00:55:49,318
um very rare this punctuated equally

1444
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:51,660
room there's chances for policy change

1445
00:55:49,318 --> 00:55:53,519
that occur over time and the best way to

1446
00:55:51,659 --> 00:55:54,858
do it is push open a window before you

1447
00:55:53,519 --> 00:55:58,079
open the door

1448
00:55:54,858 --> 00:56:01,920
and the cream is sometimes seen as that

1449
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:04,980
window and like Geno's bill is tiny tiny

1450
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:07,200
it's really small and it's smart from a

1451
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:09,300
political perspective but the only

1452
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:13,019
concern I have it and it's what my other

1453
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:15,900
speakers it's great I support it 100 but

1454
00:56:13,019 --> 00:56:17,940
you could end up being a situation where

1455
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:20,099
you have decream and then you've got

1456
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:22,338
cannabis and it's not track properly

1457
00:56:20,099 --> 00:56:25,079
there's no real regulations there's no

1458
00:56:22,338 --> 00:56:26,940
it's a bit of a mess and you've got

1459
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:28,920
something but what you actually have to

1460
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:31,858
do is step back and go okay we need a

1461
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:35,838
proper coherent regulatory policy

1462
00:56:31,858 --> 00:56:38,940
framework not just decrimp look it is

1463
00:56:35,838 --> 00:56:41,159
atrocious that there's you know 17 18

1464
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:43,619
year old kids that are going up into

1465
00:56:41,159 --> 00:56:45,598
courts here in Ireland and you know

1466
00:56:43,619 --> 00:56:49,559
they're you know they've been given life

1467
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:52,079
sentences uh for no immigration uh or

1468
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:55,200
immigration you know that no jobs no

1469
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:57,720
nothing basically criminal uh

1470
00:56:55,199 --> 00:56:59,879
complete criminal uh record for

1471
00:56:57,719 --> 00:57:01,558
something that's so ridiculous right I

1472
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:03,300
mean you have to get a vote on and

1473
00:57:01,559 --> 00:57:05,099
that's the conversation and it's a

1474
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:07,140
little bit it's you know it's for me

1475
00:57:05,099 --> 00:57:09,838
it's not public help per se but it's

1476
00:57:07,139 --> 00:57:12,480
public social health because

1477
00:57:09,838 --> 00:57:14,219
there's no there's no reason to destroy

1478
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:15,780
these lives because those lives once

1479
00:57:14,219 --> 00:57:17,759
they start getting destroyed to that

1480
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:19,559
degree they can't get jobs in a new

1481
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:22,920
unemployment and then you're into

1482
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:25,019
Community impact issues and uh it it

1483
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:26,818
makes no sense um Canada at least Canada

1484
00:57:25,019 --> 00:57:29,159
has shown that as uh you know they've

1485
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:31,739
actually gone as far as to revoke the

1486
00:57:29,159 --> 00:57:33,779
criminal records and to give uh

1487
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:36,419
um you know a whole review of that

1488
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:37,800
process once legalizations occurs and

1489
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:40,260
then in New York for example they've

1490
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:41,519
even gone as far as to uh I don't know

1491
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:44,040
how to say this properly but to

1492
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:46,619
compensate those social segments that

1493
00:57:44,039 --> 00:57:49,800
would have been impacted by the War on

1494
00:57:46,619 --> 00:57:52,619
Drugs by allowing for example uh only

1495
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:55,318
certain people of color I think or to

1496
00:57:52,619 --> 00:57:56,700
get the first licenses now I know for

1497
00:57:55,318 --> 00:58:00,420
regulatory policy that's a bit of my

1498
00:57:56,699 --> 00:58:02,639
rare uh but uh but it shows the intent

1499
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:04,380
is the right intent and that's the

1500
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:08,460
conversation that we have to have so

1501
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:10,740
what are your left-wing Geno or uh you

1502
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:13,500
know Luke or Eddie you're gonna have to

1503
00:58:10,739 --> 00:58:16,439
have those conversations with the

1504
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:18,239
hardcore finagle Fina followers on the

1505
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:20,400
other side those conversations are

1506
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:23,759
happening and they you know it's up to

1507
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,660
us to as activists to facilitate that

1508
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,119
cross

1509
00:58:24,659 --> 00:58:28,799
party conversation that's open it does

1510
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:29,640
go too well when it does it that

1511
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,200
everyone

1512
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:33,659
there's no risk for anybody anymore

1513
00:58:31,199 --> 00:58:35,159
they're you're giving them it's a

1514
00:58:33,659 --> 00:58:38,338
win-win-win for everybody in the

1515
00:58:35,159 --> 00:58:40,618
stakeholder uh Network and the equation

1516
00:58:38,338 --> 00:58:42,179
thank you very much Shane we're going to

1517
00:58:40,619 --> 00:58:43,619
open up the questions now in a couple of

1518
00:58:42,179 --> 00:58:46,919
minutes just one thing I wanted to

1519
00:58:43,619 --> 00:58:48,660
finish on do we all agree that Europe is

1520
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:50,280
going to have a stronger pharmaceutical

1521
00:58:48,659 --> 00:58:52,318
Market than it is going to have an adult

1522
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:53,700
use Market just with the infrastructure

1523
00:58:52,318 --> 00:58:57,019
that's already here and the potential

1524
00:58:53,699 --> 00:58:57,019
for IEP in that industry

1525
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:02,819
for time being yes yeah and so like for

1526
00:59:01,139 --> 00:59:04,679
time being you have that that's the only

1527
00:59:02,818 --> 00:59:07,019
framework we

1528
00:59:04,679 --> 00:59:09,058
exists okay but in the future obviously

1529
00:59:07,019 --> 00:59:10,199
the recreational will be bigger but

1530
00:59:09,059 --> 00:59:12,540
again we can take from the

1531
00:59:10,199 --> 00:59:14,399
pharmaceutical industry from the quality

1532
00:59:12,539 --> 00:59:16,380
perspective and build on that as well

1533
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,298
okay so like I'm not saying let's do

1534
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:20,280
recreational like pharmaceutical but the

1535
00:59:18,298 --> 00:59:21,358
quality elements can be in there you

1536
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:23,420
know and just adding to the

1537
00:59:21,358 --> 00:59:25,739
decriminalization thing okay like

1538
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:27,599
decriminalization works from that

1539
00:59:25,739 --> 00:59:29,939
perspective of that 17 year old not

1540
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:32,099
going to jail but it creates an awful

1541
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:34,559
lot of other problems right that policy

1542
00:59:32,099 --> 00:59:37,200
makers later on look at it and say oh we

1543
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:39,720
made the mistakes okay so the only way

1544
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:41,460
for us is to really regulate and really

1545
00:59:39,719 --> 00:59:43,259
regulate it well and I think that

1546
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:45,119
technology can help with that a lot you

1547
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:46,740
know give that confidence to the policy

1548
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:48,000
makers as well perfect thank you very

1549
00:59:46,739 --> 00:59:49,379
much Mike for that answer we're going to

1550
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,358
open up the questions you know to

1551
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:53,160
anybody who may have some for our panel

1552
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:56,239
if you could raise your hand we'll go

1553
00:59:53,159 --> 00:59:56,239
around to you with the microphone

1554
01:00:02,159 --> 01:00:07,440
thank you

1555
01:00:04,318 --> 01:00:11,699
um so what do you think about the

1556
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:14,400
implementation of public tenders by the

1557
01:00:11,699 --> 01:00:17,699
government in order to motivate the

1558
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:21,900
pharmaceutical industry to invest more

1559
01:00:17,699 --> 01:00:25,759
in clinical research and to frighten

1560
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:28,858
more for for sanitary Registries

1561
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:31,500
about cannabis drugs do you think this

1562
01:00:28,858 --> 01:00:35,119
could be a good strategy Hand by hand

1563
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:38,639
with a educational campaign about

1564
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:41,420
teaching people educating people about

1565
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:41,420
this

1566
01:00:42,059 --> 01:00:44,599
all right

1567
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:53,579
so as someone who was uh intimately

1568
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:57,240
involved in tendering for Italian uh

1569
01:00:53,579 --> 01:01:01,140
contracts uh and I I'm looking at my ex

1570
01:00:57,239 --> 01:01:04,558
call the collaborator until right uh I'm

1571
01:01:01,139 --> 01:01:07,019
very such I'm not a big fan of tenders

1572
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:08,819
per se I think there's better ways to do

1573
01:01:07,019 --> 01:01:13,519
it with a grants and contribution system

1574
01:01:08,818 --> 01:01:16,619
uh the tender system I think uh you know

1575
01:01:13,519 --> 01:01:19,440
you know unless you're building very

1576
01:01:16,619 --> 01:01:21,780
large ships of military bases or uh I

1577
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:23,460
that's real you know I think that's what

1578
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:26,640
pharmaceutical tendering unless you're

1579
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:28,798
supplying into uh you know you know

1580
01:01:26,639 --> 01:01:31,920
products into armies or into you know

1581
01:01:28,798 --> 01:01:34,079
that's fine but for a you know tendering

1582
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:36,298
process that you know for something like

1583
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:38,760
cannabis really there shouldn't be a

1584
01:01:36,298 --> 01:01:41,099
government involved in that basic

1585
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:43,920
wholesaling concept in my mind right

1586
01:01:41,099 --> 01:01:46,559
like uh so I think there's ideas about

1587
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:49,139
grants and contributions setting up uh

1588
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:52,140
you know research and helping them along

1589
01:01:49,139 --> 01:01:55,019
the Innovation process for getting data

1590
01:01:52,139 --> 01:01:58,019
for safety and for efficacy a hundred

1591
01:01:55,019 --> 01:01:59,940
percent but actual the tender process I

1592
01:01:58,019 --> 01:02:02,099
know what happens I know it's a default

1593
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:04,858
way for many governments to operate but

1594
01:02:02,099 --> 01:02:06,480
it I haven't had I haven't seen much

1595
01:02:04,858 --> 01:02:09,239
success in the Cannabis tendering

1596
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:12,000
process I'm I'm happy to

1597
01:02:09,239 --> 01:02:14,338
so I am asking this this is not my

1598
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,500
personal question this was a question of

1599
01:02:14,338 --> 01:02:20,639
a representative of the pharmaceutical

1600
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:23,338
industry in Mexico and I was asking him

1601
01:02:20,639 --> 01:02:25,739
a space for start talking about

1602
01:02:23,338 --> 01:02:30,019
medicinal cannabis because in Mexico is

1603
01:02:25,739 --> 01:02:34,679
100 legal and uh his question was

1604
01:02:30,019 --> 01:02:37,318
why you guys still speaking and trying

1605
01:02:34,679 --> 01:02:41,358
to push that the pharmaceutical industry

1606
01:02:37,318 --> 01:02:44,880
invest in cannabis drugs instead of

1607
01:02:41,358 --> 01:02:47,880
asking the government to be the one who

1608
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:50,880
motivated the industry and to ask these

1609
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:54,780
these drugs like I don't know like THC

1610
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:57,180
oil for palliatives treatments in uh in

1611
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:59,640
the palliative area of the hospitals

1612
01:02:57,179 --> 01:03:02,539
public hospitals you know what about if

1613
01:02:59,639 --> 01:03:05,519
the government started this kind of uh

1614
01:03:02,539 --> 01:03:07,798
tenders public tenders then the

1615
01:03:05,519 --> 01:03:11,460
pharmaceutical company will say oh okay

1616
01:03:07,798 --> 01:03:14,099
there is money so I I want to invest in

1617
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:16,798
this in order to be the provider for the

1618
01:03:14,099 --> 01:03:19,500
government and the government give this

1619
01:03:16,798 --> 01:03:20,880
access to to to the candidates for the

1620
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:24,119
people

1621
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:26,039
yes so uh having spent the last 15 years

1622
01:03:24,119 --> 01:03:29,338
in Canada where we have a very robust

1623
01:03:26,039 --> 01:03:30,539
and relatively good Public Health System

1624
01:03:29,338 --> 01:03:32,639
um

1625
01:03:30,539 --> 01:03:35,338
the government pays for my drugs anyway

1626
01:03:32,639 --> 01:03:39,358
so

1627
01:03:35,338 --> 01:03:42,179
um you know whether I get a uh a drug

1628
01:03:39,358 --> 01:03:45,058
with a din number uh or whether I get

1629
01:03:42,179 --> 01:03:49,199
medical cannabis once it's you know on

1630
01:03:45,059 --> 01:03:51,180
the uh reimbursement program from

1631
01:03:49,199 --> 01:03:52,798
federal provincial perspective it

1632
01:03:51,179 --> 01:03:55,139
doesn't make a difference but I know not

1633
01:03:52,798 --> 01:03:58,079
every jurisdictions like that

1634
01:03:55,139 --> 01:03:59,639
um I think certainly the issue here you

1635
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:03,298
in the pharmaceutical industry is that

1636
01:03:59,639 --> 01:04:03,960
there's no IP protection on

1637
01:04:03,298 --> 01:04:06,539
um

1638
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:09,059
a lot of the counter aside so like we're

1639
01:04:06,539 --> 01:04:10,858
seeing now in psychedelics uh why the

1640
01:04:09,059 --> 01:04:12,359
pharmaceutical companies not involved

1641
01:04:10,858 --> 01:04:15,598
because the patterns ran out on for

1642
01:04:12,358 --> 01:04:18,000
example MDMA in 1969 and bear it's very

1643
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:20,640
hard to make to justify a pharmaceutical

1644
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:23,460
uh business case without IP protection

1645
01:04:20,639 --> 01:04:25,920
and that's a huge issue so I think uh

1646
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:29,280
you know look there's a lot in Canada

1647
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:30,900
every you know there's no tendering but

1648
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:33,119
we just pay for the drugs anyway right

1649
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:35,280
so let the wholesalers the private

1650
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:37,920
wholesalers do what they do get into

1651
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:40,200
pharmacies but at the end of the day we

1652
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:42,059
reimburse the citizen so that's Canada

1653
01:04:40,199 --> 01:04:43,980
that's very different and I know in the

1654
01:04:42,059 --> 01:04:45,900
U.S it's good if you've got your own

1655
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:49,500
private Health Care

1656
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:51,298
um but I think I think it depends just

1657
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:53,579
my answer to you it really depends but

1658
01:04:51,298 --> 01:04:55,619
personally what I've seen work better is

1659
01:04:53,579 --> 01:04:58,260
the investment in Innovation to support

1660
01:04:55,619 --> 01:05:00,298
those companies who can get the data to

1661
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:01,680
get it listed with the government and

1662
01:05:00,298 --> 01:05:03,900
then whoever pays for it whether it's

1663
01:05:01,679 --> 01:05:05,118
government or Private health insurance I

1664
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:08,298
think that's

1665
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:11,039
more preferable in my opinion thank you

1666
01:05:08,298 --> 01:05:14,880
just a quick follow-up in the United

1667
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:16,619
States I could not imagine a move that

1668
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:19,318
would unite the Cannabis industry and

1669
01:05:16,619 --> 01:05:23,039
advocacy Community more against the

1670
01:05:19,318 --> 01:05:25,199
policy than to do something to

1671
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:26,880
incentivize Pharmaceuticals to enter the

1672
01:05:25,199 --> 01:05:30,779
pharmaceutical companies to enter this

1673
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:33,838
space uh there is such such a an

1674
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:37,140
aversion to what big Pharma has done in

1675
01:05:33,838 --> 01:05:38,940
the United States and there are uh

1676
01:05:37,139 --> 01:05:42,539
theories I would say some of them

1677
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:44,579
conspiratorial um about uh the

1678
01:05:42,539 --> 01:05:48,179
pharmaceutical industry blocking

1679
01:05:44,579 --> 01:05:50,519
advances in uh cannabis reform uh that

1680
01:05:48,179 --> 01:05:53,219
any Whisper of that by the government

1681
01:05:50,519 --> 01:05:56,280
without first addressing the Myriad

1682
01:05:53,219 --> 01:06:00,179
issues that exist in other parts of our

1683
01:05:56,280 --> 01:06:02,040
cannabis laws would become a massive

1684
01:06:00,179 --> 01:06:03,598
political Scandal for for any government

1685
01:06:02,039 --> 01:06:06,420
actor who tried to do something like

1686
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:09,960
that yeah yeah yeah I understand only

1687
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:12,838
only was thinking ways for trying to

1688
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:15,900
push the pharmaceutical industry in

1689
01:06:12,838 --> 01:06:19,019
order to give us access it was only and

1690
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:21,180
well an idea of this person and then I

1691
01:06:19,019 --> 01:06:22,079
come and I want to share with you thank

1692
01:06:21,179 --> 01:06:24,118
you

1693
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:26,460
yeah anybody else got any questions for

1694
01:06:24,119 --> 01:06:29,099
our steam panel yeah

1695
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:30,599
thank you hi how's it going my name is

1696
01:06:29,099 --> 01:06:33,240
Rob Leonard I've been researching

1697
01:06:30,599 --> 01:06:34,740
industrial hemp and I'm just curious um

1698
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:38,038
so Ireland actually has one of the

1699
01:06:34,739 --> 01:06:40,558
oldest hemp sectors in the EU and people

1700
01:06:38,039 --> 01:06:41,819
have been growing it for decades but in

1701
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:43,380
the last four years or so there's

1702
01:06:41,818 --> 01:06:46,380
misunderstanding and a change of

1703
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:49,039
Regulation around hemp and

1704
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:51,180
the fsai released airport in 2018

1705
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:53,940
meaning that if it was containing any

1706
01:06:51,179 --> 01:06:56,038
THC at all it would be regulated and

1707
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:58,980
since then Farmers have been cut off

1708
01:06:56,039 --> 01:07:00,480
from supports and grants and didn't

1709
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:01,619
receive covert support unless they were

1710
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:04,679
selling fairly to pharmaceutical

1711
01:07:01,619 --> 01:07:07,019
companies so the amount of farmers were

1712
01:07:04,679 --> 01:07:09,118
getting licenses to grow has been really

1713
01:07:07,019 --> 01:07:11,280
set back in the last few years and

1714
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:13,559
although since then at an EU and a un

1715
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:15,599
level it's been clarified that growing

1716
01:07:13,559 --> 01:07:18,359
is completely legal there's still a big

1717
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:21,180
gap in the market to revitalize the

1718
01:07:18,358 --> 01:07:24,119
industry and process it in Ireland how

1719
01:07:21,179 --> 01:07:25,460
can we help the government to take on

1720
01:07:24,119 --> 01:07:28,079
the EU

1721
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:29,760
legislation and really get a better

1722
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:33,260
understanding to help grow the market in

1723
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:33,260
Ireland for an industrial hemp

1724
01:07:34,199 --> 01:07:36,739
up

1725
01:07:37,739 --> 01:07:41,038
um

1726
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:44,400
full transparency I had lunch yesterday

1727
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:46,980
with the FSA a guy who is the main guy

1728
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:49,619
on this uh I know from years and years

1729
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:51,298
ago because uh we used to deal work

1730
01:07:49,619 --> 01:07:54,539
together on a different stigmatized

1731
01:07:51,298 --> 01:07:57,239
plant issue I used to be the GMO guy in

1732
01:07:54,539 --> 01:07:59,160
Ireland so genetic engineering and uh

1733
01:07:57,239 --> 01:08:01,979
anyway if you remember back late 90s

1734
01:07:59,159 --> 01:08:05,759
early 2000s was a big issue and FSI were

1735
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:08,099
Harry belt so the same individual is now

1736
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:10,819
working uh he's not dealing with the gym

1737
01:08:08,099 --> 01:08:13,798
oh she was dating with the CBD issue

1738
01:08:10,818 --> 01:08:15,000
so all I can say in up front is that I

1739
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:17,359
think your problem lies with the

1740
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:20,899
Department of Health and some

1741
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:23,400
issues around some

1742
01:08:20,899 --> 01:08:25,559
policy positions that they're advocating

1743
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:27,719
uh into the Department of Health not

1744
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:30,980
necessarily the FSI

1745
01:08:27,719 --> 01:08:30,980
um I think you're also

1746
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:37,439
sewing the value chain of hemp uh

1747
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:39,719
certainly I think you know you're uh

1748
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:42,778
some people have tried some very uh

1749
01:08:39,719 --> 01:08:44,880
smart ways around uh not doing

1750
01:08:42,779 --> 01:08:46,980
extraction in Ireland and the press and

1751
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:50,100
then you know maybe there's some more

1752
01:08:46,979 --> 01:08:52,979
CBD isolate mixed in uh after your press

1753
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:54,480
and you know there's some the industry

1754
01:08:52,979 --> 01:08:57,659
needs to You're only as good as your

1755
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:58,919
weakest link in an industry and uh I

1756
01:08:57,659 --> 01:09:00,778
certainly think that there's some

1757
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:03,420
questions some uh some issues around

1758
01:09:00,779 --> 01:09:06,239
that front uh in Ireland that make the

1759
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:08,100
regulator uh and then the policy owner

1760
01:09:06,238 --> 01:09:10,919
or that regular so help Department of

1761
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:12,900
Health versus fsai uh somewhat nervous

1762
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:14,579
uh so certainly I think there's a lot to

1763
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:15,838
be done and I think I've seen in Ireland

1764
01:09:14,579 --> 01:09:17,219
obviously there's a there's a lot of

1765
01:09:15,838 --> 01:09:19,679
work coming together with you know

1766
01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:22,020
there's two different groups of hemp uh

1767
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:23,579
Representatives that's Co-op and uh and

1768
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:25,199
I know they don't always see the eye to

1769
01:09:23,579 --> 01:09:27,659
eye I'm down to that level of

1770
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:29,159
understanding the stakeholders what I

1771
01:09:27,659 --> 01:09:31,139
think you need to bring together and

1772
01:09:29,159 --> 01:09:34,559
have those realistic conversations uh

1773
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:37,739
with the industry and you know drag

1774
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:39,839
kicking screaming fsai and Department

1775
01:09:37,738 --> 01:09:41,338
health and then your friends and Chagas

1776
01:09:39,838 --> 01:09:43,500
um you've got other friends in

1777
01:09:41,338 --> 01:09:46,439
Enterprise Ireland and you know I've had

1778
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:48,960
Ford Ramona out to Canada at one point

1779
01:09:46,439 --> 01:09:50,338
so you know that you have friends in the

1780
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:52,380
system so I don't know if that answers

1781
01:09:50,338 --> 01:09:55,198
the question but you've got a bit of

1782
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:57,179
work to do and uh certainly uh you've

1783
01:09:55,198 --> 01:09:59,819
got to keep going hard and making sure

1784
01:09:57,179 --> 01:10:02,460
that they understand their situation and

1785
01:09:59,819 --> 01:10:05,279
uh like the conversation earlier today

1786
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:07,679
around the Canon vape and the uh the the

1787
01:10:05,279 --> 01:10:09,539
court decision was uh fascinating for me

1788
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:11,159
and shocking to hear that all at the

1789
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:14,060
same time so I think you've got a long

1790
01:10:11,159 --> 01:10:14,059
hike ahead of you

1791
01:10:15,238 --> 01:10:19,859
um early on in the U.S market there

1792
01:10:18,238 --> 01:10:22,319
wasn't any data

1793
01:10:19,859 --> 01:10:23,819
um because it was federally illegal and

1794
01:10:22,319 --> 01:10:26,639
there were no systems in place at the

1795
01:10:23,819 --> 01:10:28,979
federal level to gather data and

1796
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:32,280
harmonize data and like

1797
01:10:28,979 --> 01:10:35,579
um as regulators and operators

1798
01:10:32,279 --> 01:10:38,519
um what Data Systems are you trying to

1799
01:10:35,579 --> 01:10:39,800
implement to standardize data so that

1800
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:42,780
you can make better

1801
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:46,320
regulatory decisions and make better

1802
01:10:42,779 --> 01:10:49,319
business decisions and how what efforts

1803
01:10:46,319 --> 01:10:52,139
are you making to standardize that data

1804
01:10:49,319 --> 01:10:54,119
collection so that other folks in the

1805
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:56,960
industry and outside of the industry can

1806
01:10:54,119 --> 01:11:00,059
can leverage that

1807
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:02,279
so one of the one of the approaches that

1808
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:04,500
I've had that drives my director of data

1809
01:11:02,279 --> 01:11:06,840
analytics absolutely crazy

1810
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:09,060
um is to always collect more data right

1811
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:11,340
if you have a question uh should we

1812
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:13,080
collect these three or four variables or

1813
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:15,239
should we only collect one I always say

1814
01:11:13,079 --> 01:11:16,198
collect more even if we don't need it

1815
01:11:15,238 --> 01:11:18,419
later

1816
01:11:16,198 --> 01:11:21,960
um I'd rather have it than not and one

1817
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:24,420
of the Staggering things for me has been

1818
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:26,520
um uh and not just in Maine but in

1819
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:28,260
States across the U.S where

1820
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:30,000
um I've worked with States or testified

1821
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:32,640
before legislatures

1822
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:35,520
um is just ultimately how little data

1823
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:38,940
they end up collecting on a variety of

1824
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:41,100
uh of topics whether it's on industry

1825
01:11:38,939 --> 01:11:43,500
whether it's on the internal regulatory

1826
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:46,920
processes when when I took over

1827
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:49,020
um I instituted a policy of uh of

1828
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:51,300
collecting more internal data to make

1829
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:52,860
sure that my the agency that I run is

1830
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:55,020
running as efficiently and effectively

1831
01:11:52,859 --> 01:11:56,519
as possible around compliance checks

1832
01:11:55,020 --> 01:12:00,780
around licensing

1833
01:11:56,520 --> 01:12:03,719
um around broader policy Etc in terms of

1834
01:12:00,779 --> 01:12:06,179
standardization in the United States uh

1835
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:07,500
and and in conjunction with Canada

1836
01:12:06,179 --> 01:12:09,600
um we have an organization called the

1837
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:11,399
Cannabis Regulators Association canra

1838
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:12,780
c-a-n-n-r-a

1839
01:12:11,399 --> 01:12:15,539
um it is something that I would

1840
01:12:12,779 --> 01:12:18,179
encourage individuals from any country

1841
01:12:15,539 --> 01:12:21,000
um to to engage with uh and I'm happy to

1842
01:12:18,179 --> 01:12:23,880
provide contact information for them uh

1843
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:26,219
there are uh committees within canra

1844
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:27,960
that are working hard to address those

1845
01:12:26,219 --> 01:12:30,600
standardization issues

1846
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:32,239
um as you as you noted because it's

1847
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:34,140
federally illegal the types of

1848
01:12:32,238 --> 01:12:35,939
standardized data collection and

1849
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:38,579
mandatory data reporting that we are

1850
01:12:35,939 --> 01:12:41,639
used to uh in a variety of areas of

1851
01:12:38,579 --> 01:12:43,859
policy just don't exist in cannabis and

1852
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:46,140
so it's up to individual states to try

1853
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:47,639
to work with other states uh to

1854
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:49,440
standardize it but that's a hell of a

1855
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:51,900
lot of work I mean as a regulator in

1856
01:12:49,439 --> 01:12:54,719
Maine I have a lot of things on my plate

1857
01:12:51,899 --> 01:12:57,599
and calling you know the 20 other states

1858
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:59,520
uh with adult use cannabis so the 37

1859
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:02,039
other states with medical cannabis to

1860
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:04,500
try to get our our data aligned is just

1861
01:13:02,039 --> 01:13:06,359
not a a terribly high priority and so

1862
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:10,319
having a central organization like canra

1863
01:13:06,359 --> 01:13:12,899
work on that is really effective but I'm

1864
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:15,420
short of federal legalization we have

1865
01:13:12,899 --> 01:13:18,599
this Patchwork uh that just isn't great

1866
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:20,460
and uh in you know having worked at

1867
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:22,679
Brookings before and trying to do data

1868
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:24,420
analysis across States it's a nightmare

1869
01:13:22,679 --> 01:13:25,920
and you're comparing apples and oranges

1870
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:28,020
people are collecting data differently

1871
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:30,239
one of the one of the big examples and

1872
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:32,040
I'll wrap up on this

1873
01:13:30,238 --> 01:13:34,259
um is looking at public health and

1874
01:13:32,039 --> 01:13:38,158
Public Safety and looking at the number

1875
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:40,320
of uh cannabis related uh uh driving

1876
01:13:38,158 --> 01:13:42,719
Under the Influence uh charges or

1877
01:13:40,319 --> 01:13:46,439
cannabis uh involved uh traffic

1878
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:49,140
fatalities uh the problem is States tend

1879
01:13:46,439 --> 01:13:51,238
not to collect those data until after

1880
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:53,699
they legalize so what they'll do is if

1881
01:13:51,238 --> 01:13:56,579
if there's a fatality in a in a car

1882
01:13:53,698 --> 01:13:58,559
accident uh they'll test for alcohol and

1883
01:13:56,579 --> 01:13:59,939
if alcohol is negative they'll do a full

1884
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:01,920
drug screen

1885
01:13:59,939 --> 01:14:03,779
um and if something popped whether it's

1886
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:06,179
cocaine or Methamphetamine or cannabis

1887
01:14:03,779 --> 01:14:08,698
or whatever if something pops it was

1888
01:14:06,179 --> 01:14:11,340
previously coded as a drug involved

1889
01:14:08,698 --> 01:14:12,839
death not a cannabis involved death and

1890
01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:14,880
then they start collecting for cannabis

1891
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:16,380
specifically and lo and behold there's a

1892
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:19,380
huge spike in the number of cannabis

1893
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:21,719
involved deaths and so it's not just

1894
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:24,480
standardizing data within jurisdictions

1895
01:14:21,719 --> 01:14:26,698
but within jurisdictions over time as

1896
01:14:24,479 --> 01:14:29,158
well and it's it's a frustration of mine

1897
01:14:26,698 --> 01:14:30,359
I I know it's definitely a frustration

1898
01:14:29,158 --> 01:14:32,158
of yours

1899
01:14:30,359 --> 01:14:34,439
um and so my advice to any jurisdiction

1900
01:14:32,158 --> 01:14:35,939
is always the data that you'll be

1901
01:14:34,439 --> 01:14:38,039
interested in collecting post

1902
01:14:35,939 --> 01:14:40,079
legalization start collecting it

1903
01:14:38,039 --> 01:14:41,880
immediately so that you have that

1904
01:14:40,079 --> 01:14:43,920
Baseline and that Benchmark and then the

1905
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:46,880
natural experiment of what happens when

1906
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:46,880
legalization happens

1907
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:53,480
any other questions from Jess

1908
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:53,480
yeah sorry David

1909
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:02,460
following her if this ain't bad I topped

1910
01:15:00,779 --> 01:15:04,800
it they'll call on and pick theaters and

1911
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:07,800
Martin played around

1912
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:10,020
and I did let's not see how it sounds

1913
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:11,279
flooded because into the data loves me

1914
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:13,560
he says

1915
01:15:11,279 --> 01:15:15,679
that should have a group beat back oh my

1916
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:15,679
Lord

1917
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:22,320
just about the data all right so like

1918
01:15:20,939 --> 01:15:24,119
what happens in the United States as

1919
01:15:22,319 --> 01:15:26,519
well we have a lot a lot of data being

1920
01:15:24,119 --> 01:15:28,079
collected I know you know like there's a

1921
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:31,080
lot of data I'm using and like I agree

1922
01:15:28,079 --> 01:15:32,698
100 if you can collect from four four

1923
01:15:31,079 --> 01:15:34,198
data points you know collect four you

1924
01:15:32,698 --> 01:15:36,059
know instead of one because more data

1925
01:15:34,198 --> 01:15:38,219
you can start using afterwards but what

1926
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:40,020
happens in the United States is there's

1927
01:15:38,219 --> 01:15:42,179
data for example collected with metric

1928
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:44,219
which is not being analyzed or validated

1929
01:15:42,179 --> 01:15:47,219
at all right let's talk a little about

1930
01:15:44,219 --> 01:15:48,840
uniformity Fields but then what we

1931
01:15:47,219 --> 01:15:51,480
actually do with the data okay you have

1932
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:53,400
number of entrepreneurs startups

1933
01:15:51,479 --> 01:15:55,379
companies working with the data around

1934
01:15:53,399 --> 01:15:58,738
metric and it's not accessible to

1935
01:15:55,380 --> 01:16:00,960
regulator it's not accessible to uh to

1936
01:15:58,738 --> 01:16:04,198
to the community to the to the industry

1937
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:06,840
Etc like so they the establishment of

1938
01:16:04,198 --> 01:16:08,579
data collection system this one source

1939
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:10,520
of data okay which is metric or

1940
01:16:08,579 --> 01:16:12,960
biotractivity depending on the state

1941
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:15,179
what's happened is it was created

1942
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:18,239
without any consultation with industrial

1943
01:16:15,179 --> 01:16:21,359
right so it was imposed on the industry

1944
01:16:18,238 --> 01:16:24,178
regulator and listen the companies want

1945
01:16:21,359 --> 01:16:25,799
their their tenders and that resulted in

1946
01:16:24,179 --> 01:16:27,899
something that is unusable by the

1947
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:29,699
industry at all right so that data

1948
01:16:27,899 --> 01:16:31,979
collection is super important but also

1949
01:16:29,698 --> 01:16:34,319
how those companies are going to use the

1950
01:16:31,979 --> 01:16:37,319
data what insights is gifts to

1951
01:16:34,319 --> 01:16:39,719
Regulators can Regulators can do actions

1952
01:16:37,319 --> 01:16:41,819
on that data very very quickly not have

1953
01:16:39,719 --> 01:16:43,500
another company in five years time

1954
01:16:41,819 --> 01:16:45,599
preaching you know 10 years time in

1955
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:47,939
California or somewhere pitching them

1956
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:50,699
now you can actually analyze and

1957
01:16:47,939 --> 01:16:53,399
validate or predict a compliance problem

1958
01:16:50,698 --> 01:16:54,899
with that a particular company although

1959
01:16:53,399 --> 01:16:57,299
it's sitting there for the last five

1960
01:16:54,899 --> 01:16:58,859
years you know so now we we need to

1961
01:16:57,300 --> 01:17:01,079
think about it in Europe how we're going

1962
01:16:58,859 --> 01:17:03,119
to implement those data collections that

1963
01:17:01,079 --> 01:17:06,859
drive actionable insights as well both

1964
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:06,859
for regulators and the industry

1965
01:17:10,079 --> 01:17:13,319
um I know we've talked obviously a lot

1966
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:14,698
about Europe but I just like to get your

1967
01:17:13,319 --> 01:17:16,019
opinion on kind of some of your larger

1968
01:17:14,698 --> 01:17:17,759
Americans like obviously Asian and

1969
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:20,159
Middle East and Thailand and obviously

1970
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:21,119
just went legal so do you think once I

1971
01:17:20,158 --> 01:17:22,439
suppose some of the other Asian

1972
01:17:21,119 --> 01:17:24,899
countries actually started to see the

1973
01:17:22,439 --> 01:17:26,579
tax revenue and the export opportunities

1974
01:17:24,899 --> 01:17:27,960
in the job Creations do you think

1975
01:17:26,579 --> 01:17:31,460
they'll follow suit or do you think

1976
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:31,460
they're going to kind of sit in ways

1977
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:38,760
um that's a great question I spent well

1978
01:17:36,479 --> 01:17:41,879
quite a bit of time in Thailand

1979
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:44,760
um at one point in late in 2019 working

1980
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:46,980
with the MTA working through their uh

1981
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:47,579
regulatory proposals

1982
01:17:46,979 --> 01:17:50,279
um

1983
01:17:47,579 --> 01:17:52,019
I so I think the opportunities are

1984
01:17:50,279 --> 01:17:55,198
coming uh

1985
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:57,000
the problem is that there is and I can

1986
01:17:55,198 --> 01:17:59,939
only talk from a commercial perspective

1987
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:02,219
there's a quite a bit of nervousness uh

1988
01:17:59,939 --> 01:18:04,039
in I would say North American companies

1989
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:07,260
uh

1990
01:18:04,039 --> 01:18:09,539
to try to do business in this these

1991
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:10,380
areas because

1992
01:18:09,539 --> 01:18:12,539
um

1993
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:15,359
how do I put this politically correct

1994
01:18:12,539 --> 01:18:18,658
even in North America

1995
01:18:15,359 --> 01:18:19,799
it you have to be very cautious of who

1996
01:18:18,658 --> 01:18:22,139
you're doing business with what you're

1997
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:24,960
doing business uh especially in in the

1998
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:26,579
US in Canada like yeah like there's the

1999
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:29,279
government looks very carefully who gets

2000
01:18:26,579 --> 01:18:31,559
licenses uh every board every every

2001
01:18:29,279 --> 01:18:34,439
board member every influencer on the on

2002
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:36,360
the company there's a lot of uh security

2003
01:18:34,439 --> 01:18:38,039
issues they're not worried about for say

2004
01:18:36,359 --> 01:18:40,799
diversion they're more worried about

2005
01:18:38,039 --> 01:18:43,640
proceeds of crime being whitewashed

2006
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:47,159
through a newly legalized system

2007
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:50,340
so um I think your simple answer is that

2008
01:18:47,158 --> 01:18:52,139
yes they're great markets uh two points

2009
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:53,340
on Simplicity is I think you're gonna

2010
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:54,900
have to mature a little bit before

2011
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:57,480
people get comfortable going into those

2012
01:18:54,899 --> 01:18:59,639
space and second of all

2013
01:18:57,479 --> 01:19:01,859
um I think there's just uh cultural

2014
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:04,079
issues around uh you know trying to do

2015
01:19:01,859 --> 01:19:06,299
business in these places that uh that

2016
01:19:04,079 --> 01:19:09,000
could come back and hit you hard on your

2017
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:10,800
NASDAQ listing or your Toronto Stock

2018
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:13,340
Exchange list and it's just not worth

2019
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:13,340
the risk

2020
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:18,659
and to pick up on that I agree with all

2021
01:19:15,479 --> 01:19:20,639
of that and uh an additional layer in

2022
01:19:18,658 --> 01:19:23,579
the U.S is are people on State

2023
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:25,800
Department sanctions lists are they on

2024
01:19:23,579 --> 01:19:28,140
um uh State Department or Homeland

2025
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:31,079
Security Department terrorist lists and

2026
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:33,360
so the the concern about uh essentially

2027
01:19:31,079 --> 01:19:35,519
washing money in some of these uh

2028
01:19:33,359 --> 01:19:37,920
non-demo non-democracies emerging

2029
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:39,600
democracies and pseudo-democracies the

2030
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:42,539
financial tracking in those countries

2031
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:45,539
and in those markets is just not up to

2032
01:19:42,539 --> 01:19:47,100
what Western countries are are needing

2033
01:19:45,539 --> 01:19:48,119
and so that's true for institutional

2034
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:49,500
investors

2035
01:19:48,119 --> 01:19:50,819
um but it's also true for Savvy

2036
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:53,219
investors too and we're seeing this play

2037
01:19:50,819 --> 01:19:55,139
out in the United States right now with

2038
01:19:53,219 --> 01:19:58,140
Russian oligarchs I'm getting involved

2039
01:19:55,140 --> 01:20:00,179
in uh larger American cannabis companies

2040
01:19:58,140 --> 01:20:03,539
uh and probably smaller American

2041
01:20:00,179 --> 01:20:06,600
cannabis companies and so uh there's uh

2042
01:20:03,539 --> 01:20:10,079
that's creating some real Market shocks

2043
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:12,000
for some uh individuals and I think if

2044
01:20:10,079 --> 01:20:14,460
if you're an investor and you look out

2045
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:16,679
at it and you say well I'm investing in

2046
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:18,600
the United States in this company and

2047
01:20:16,679 --> 01:20:21,480
this company might be having oligarch

2048
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:23,400
Russian oligarchs um involved I'm going

2049
01:20:21,479 --> 01:20:26,158
to think twice about going to a market

2050
01:20:23,399 --> 01:20:28,439
like Thailand where I am dramatically

2051
01:20:26,158 --> 01:20:32,039
less certain uh that I know what's going

2052
01:20:28,439 --> 01:20:34,198
on behind the curtain in those companies

2053
01:20:32,039 --> 01:20:35,579
okay thank you very much to our panel if

2054
