to hear about can you maybe give

16
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:38,479
everybody a quick little overview of how

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,640
you found yourself in the medical

18
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:42,319
cannabis industry

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,280
yo it's quite an interesting story so i

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,200
was actually

21
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,840
from the vaccine background i was

22
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,399
working at vets um health consortium and

23
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,640
i was involved in the hiv vaccine study

24
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,239
and very reputable clinical trials and

25
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,320
then i thought you know there must be

26
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:57,839
some other information about you know

27
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,159
what's about plant medicines instead of

28
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,160
pharmaceuticals and then i was invited

29
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:03,919
to some information on medical cannabis

30
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,319
and then i just fell in love it was my

31
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,079
passion i saw about the healing i've

32
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:09,438
learned so much more about the plants

33
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:11,200
and the benefits and you know what i

34
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:12,478
love about it you never stop learning

35
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,920
you know like every day

36
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:15,519
there's something about the plan that

37
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,719
you learn with the different cannabinoid

38
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:20,959
profiles the apis uh the terpenes um

39
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,640
helping and treating patients so since

40
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,319
then i've left um you know the

41
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,280
pharmaceutical side from the vaccine

42
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:27,679
industry

43
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,359
uh and dial straight into the clinical

44
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,240
trials with regards to medical cannabis

45
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:33,840
and other natural plans as well

46
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:36,000
okay amazing yeah i was going through

47
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,680
your resume it was pretty much i was

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,118
like right even this interview i'm not

49
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,799
going to be able to mention every single

50
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:41,920
thing that you've been a part of doesn't

51
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,600
seem very

52
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,159
very accomplished so what i'm going to

53
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:47,919
do is break it into two topics the first

54
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,399
topic i want to talk about was patient

55
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,159
access in south africa now we know

56
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,040
medical cannabis access programs

57
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,118
worldwide start off

58
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,118
with splutters very few countries have

59
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:00,959
been able to implement one successfully

60
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:02,799
can you maybe tell the audience of what

61
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:05,280
the patient access looks like in south

62
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,319
africa who prescribes it where they

63
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,318
obtain the bed the the products from and

64
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:11,759
uh yeah thank you okay awesome so

65
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,839
there's two parts i'll start with the

66
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,519
first part uh so the south african

67
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,598
government actually decriminalized

68
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,840
medical cannabis so what that means is

69
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:21,839
they allowed private use so patients are

70
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,520
allowed to grow it into the in their own

71
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,280
yards in a private space and make their

72
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,120
own medicines or oils but they're not

73
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,199
allowed to sell it i think they allowed

74
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,120
about 1.2 kgs per household um so 600

75
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:34,639
grams per person i think so that is what

76
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,759
you know the first access that happened

77
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:40,799
in about 2018. then the medical cannabis

78
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:42,598
was introduced and it was legislated

79
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,959
as a schedule six for uh

80
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:46,639
tetrahydrocannabinol your thc and then

81
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,120
your cbd is a schedule for the

82
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:51,518
cannabidiol so the access right now or

83
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,200
currently is there uh the only way we

84
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,759
can access it for patients is a section

85
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:58,479
21. what that means ian is there's a

86
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:00,399
basically a the patient has to go to a

87
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:02,399
doctor and the doctor will have to apply

88
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,280
for the section 21 which means it's

89
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,640
unregistered medicine so once that

90
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,560
application goes through you will have

91
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:11,039
to make a motivation why are you

92
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,318
prescribing this for the patients um you

93
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,318
know i'll give you some examples the

94
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:16,238
patient has you know palliative care and

95
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:18,000
the the morphine or opioids are not

96
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,360
working then you can say this is the

97
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,199
reason why

98
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,040
it goes through sapra which stands for

99
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:25,598
african health products regulatory

100
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:26,878
authority they would then approve it and

101
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:28,479
then that patient will then get that

102
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:29,840
medicine to spend so it is quite a lot

103
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,318
of work for the doctor to do because

104
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,080
it's a lot of paperwork um and that is

105
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:36,000
how the process is so the access is very

106
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,519
limited but they are going to be um

107
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,120
medicines that are going to be rolled

108
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,439
out very soon i have actually put in

109
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,000
dossiers three years ago for the first

110
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:45,919
medical cannabis medicines to be um you

111
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,519
know registered in south africa we quite

112
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:50,079
far down the line with separate with the

113
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,920
dossiers what will happen then um or

114
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,959
when once that

115
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,719
medicine gets registered then any doctor

116
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,239
then can then prescribe these medicines

117
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:00,959
it doesn't have to go under the section

118
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,080
21 process which is very time consuming

119
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,640
so yeah

120
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,959
as it stands uh access limits it from a

121
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:09,518
doctor perspective to patients but they

122
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,479
are allowed to grow it uh and have

123
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,480
access to it privately

124
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:17,358
okay very interesting and are products

125
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:20,478
like epidemics available for patients in

126
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:23,120
south africa or is their own uh brand

127
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:25,360
version nothing nothing as yet epidialex

128
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,360
is not even uh yeah not available in

129
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,120
south africa as yet so there isn't

130
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,960
actually any uh the ones that we

131
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,439
currently using on the section 21 are

132
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:36,239
from canada uh things like your or your

133
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:38,160
hexo or your tgod so those are the ones

134
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,680
that are currently the section 21.

135
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,280
what's also happening is some of the

136
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,040
separate license facilities are also

137
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,198
registering their product be it the

138
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,199
flower uh because they have licenses

139
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,120
under a section 21 so we can also have

140
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,960
access with the south african-based uh

141
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,879
medicine but that's what the flower for

142
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,560
the oils are we still working on how are

143
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:56,560
we going to get those dossiers submitted

144
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,120
that is why the clinical trials are key

145
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,959
because what separate requires is

146
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,879
you have to prove data on the medicines

147
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:05,120
that you want to actually register you

148
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,199
know so when you're submitting a dossier

149
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,639
for registration you have to actually

150
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,720
show that

151
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,319
this is the clinical data that the safe

152
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,600
for the patient and this is what we

153
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,079
looking at and this is what we have

154
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,160
treated the patient with

155
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:20,000
very interesting and we're in the middle

156
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,919
of uh trying to over get our medical

157
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,600
cannabis access program in ireland here

158
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:25,839
expanded it's very very limited at the

159
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,400
moment what's the one thing that you

160
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:30,239
think is the biggest failing for most

161
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:32,000
medical cannabis access programs

162
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,079
worldwide what's the biggest hurdle that

163
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,399
everybody needs to get over

164
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,079
look the biggest hurdle is the stigma

165
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:39,679
you know the stigma attached is still

166
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:41,359
very huge a lot of people are

167
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,439
indoctrinated by the old school

168
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,879
pharmaceutical type practices and what

169
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:46,719
people don't understand you can actually

170
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:48,478
use bulk you don't have to have this one

171
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,240
or that one you can actually use

172
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:51,918
cannabis and eventually wean patients

173
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,079
off the pharmaceutical meds to the most

174
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:55,918
safe effects of medicine so the stigma

175
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:57,680
attached for me is really huge the lack

176
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:00,079
of knowledge by medical professionals

177
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,800
especially africa is really huge the

178
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:05,279
resistance to actually change into to uh

179
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,600
you know to to have patients

180
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:09,599
use medical cannabis that for me is huge

181
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,759
i see it here in oncology

182
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,080
we deal with a lot of cancer patients

183
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,759
normally palliative care and the doctors

184
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,359
most of the doctors oncologists are dead

185
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,038
against cannabis you know and i don't

186
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,280
understand why and what i what i

187
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:23,839
realized that it's the lack of knowledge

188
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:26,079
or education and i feel once we can

189
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:28,000
educate the medical professionals and

190
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:29,599
say this is the benefit this is the

191
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,918
endocannabinoid system this is how the

192
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,759
cannabinoids work this is all science

193
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:36,000
it's not just snake oil then i think

194
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,720
they will be more you know um receptive

195
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,839
to actually having their patients on it

196
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:45,120
okay do you think biosynthesis

197
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:46,638
is the future of cannabinoid medicines

198
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,560
or do you think there'll always be a

199
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,639
place for extracted cannabinoids from

200
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,360
flour it seems that biosynthesis is

201
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,759
going to be much more uh regulated much

202
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,639
more pure a much more superior price

203
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,479
point and there seems to be a lot of the

204
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,000
positives that move in that direction

205
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:04,240
and it's something that you might get

206
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,240
clinical boards and let's say old-school

207
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,319
indoctrinated doctors as you said

208
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,319
they'll be more palatable to to uh

209
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,039
prescribe something that's already

210
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,240
capsule and and in pill form as opposed

211
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:17,279
to trying to learn about blends and

212
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,439
formulations of carbon oils and terpenes

213
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:21,119
no 100 i think that is the way to go

214
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,680
that is why that medicine you know i

215
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,519
think there's a place for both um but in

216
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,038
our context in our country i feel with

217
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:29,359
the doctors what will make it easier for

218
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:30,959
them if you have a set of formula that

219
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,360
is why the dossier is that i brought in

220
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:36,000
it's a two to one ratio for example uh

221
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,520
with the cbd 20 milligram of the thc 10

222
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,839
milligram the others are one to one

223
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:41,519
ratio so that's already in that format

224
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:43,119
where we just then teach the doctors how

225
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:45,758
to douse it so it's already in a you

226
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,840
know a bioavailable format there's also

227
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,360
sprays now you know with the tincture so

228
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:51,119
i feel definitely there's you know there

229
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,400
is place for both but the doctors you

230
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,000
also want to make their lives easier you

231
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:55,359
want to say here's a product like

232
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,240
similar to how you have your opioids

233
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,919
this is the recommended dosage this is

234
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,240
how we would recommend you prescribe but

235
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:03,758
the other problem that we have owen

236
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,079
that i've actually noticed with patients

237
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,800
and other doctors i'm working with is

238
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:10,240
cannabis is different because it's an

239
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,598
individualized treatment plan

240
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,680
so you know you can have the same

241
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:15,199
disease as somebody else but your dose

242
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,879
may be a little bit different from the

243
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,199
other dose that is why we always say you

244
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,439
know with dosing we always start

245
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,520
low go slow until we build up those

246
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:25,199
cannabinoids so that's the thing once we

247
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:26,560
teach the medical professionals i mean

248
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,800
i've trained over

249
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,240
um over 100 medical professionals at one

250
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,759
of the events but it was very short

251
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,278
training and you know they just opened

252
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,560
up their minds to so much more but i

253
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:37,120
agree with you that you need to give

254
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,718
them something don't expect them to mix

255
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,879
and formulate and teach them about the

256
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,800
terpenes just say here's the formulation

257
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:44,799
this is how we suggest you dose and that

258
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:47,199
will definitely work if it's in capsules

259
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:49,199
or oils or sprays

260
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,399
very good yeah i completely agree with

261
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,560
you there i'm going to move on to the

262
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,159
last topic now and it's basically the

263
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:56,399
first medical cannabis study that's

264
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:58,000
happening in south africa now you're one

265
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,320
of the lead investigators in that can

266
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,559
you tell us basically how far you are

267
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,160
along in this study what is the main

268
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:06,079
objective that you're looking to get out

269
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:07,838
of the study and the duration that you

270
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,519
hope it will

271
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,279
okay awesome so it's a very interesting

272
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,240
study what we're actually looking at is

273
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:15,679
how we can actually replace um opioids

274
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,720
using a medical

275
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:21,120
cannabis for chronic uh pain management

276
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,040
uh so we we had to renew the study for

277
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,799
another year yeah initially we had you

278
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:26,399
know a few issues with regards to a

279
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:28,799
recruitment of patients and all of that

280
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,240
a lot of teething issues uh look it was

281
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:32,879
the first study so we've learned from

282
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,799
them so we renewed the study um and

283
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,639
we're looking to recruit

284
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:38,079
patients it was a thousand samples so so

285
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:39,439
we're looking to see how many we

286
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,959
actually do get and what type of

287
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,440
evidence that we get

288
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:45,518
so yeah we're looking to see um how do

289
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,480
the patients actually respond to these

290
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,919
um

291
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,159
the various formulations that the

292
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:52,159
doctors will prescribe can we actually

293
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:54,319
get them off the opioids you know uh

294
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:56,000
with the you know what can cannabinoids

295
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,080
you know the mechanism of analgesia is

296
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,080
opioid spearing effect and we do know

297
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,600
that cannabinoids work synergistically

298
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,600
with opioids and pain relief so we're

299
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,079
looking at the more association with the

300
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,839
opiate spiriting effect looking at how

301
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:08,958
cannabis could actually help prevent

302
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,800
tolerance

303
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,559
to and withdraw from the opiates and

304
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:15,039
also looking at how we can rekindle the

305
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:16,479
opiates analgesia after prior dosage has

306
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:18,480
worn off and we're going to then

307
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,000
document all of that besides just

308
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,839
looking at that we're also going to be

309
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,759
looking at the quality of life of those

310
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,760
patients um

311
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:27,919
what that means has the quality of life

312
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:30,000
improved um you know after changing from

313
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:31,120
the cannabinoids to the cannabis

314
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,639
um

315
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,720
the pain management we're gonna use the

316
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,319
brief pain inventory uh you know which

317
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,800
is the world health organization should

318
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,879
manage to look at the pain before and

319
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,639
after while they were on the opioids and

320
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:45,600
while we were weaning them off and the

321
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:47,919
pilot study results really looked good

322
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,120
because we had about 98 of the patients

323
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:52,799
that had pain relief um from the medical

324
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,039
cannabis we were able to wean all of

325
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,799
those patients off the opioids with some

326
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:58,879
patients it took much longer but some

327
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:00,559
patients was much easier

328
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:01,838
but the cancer patients it also took

329
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,679
much longer

330
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,600
as well so it will also depend on the

331
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:07,759
specific diagnosis on that patient so

332
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,360
although we working with chronic pain

333
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:12,240
we're going to have patients with

334
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,759
various ailments various diagnosis from

335
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,759
be it's um cancer oncology patients or

336
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:19,360
be its patients with migraines or

337
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:22,159
patients with autoimmune disease like

338
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,839
your multiple sclerosis fibromyalgia so

339
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:25,838
you know we still also you know learning

340
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,440
a lot but the pilot study was showed

341
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,440
great results so we're really excited to

342
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,959
see you know what will be the outcome

343
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,279
can we actually

344
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:35,359
get the patients weaned off the opioids

345
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:37,519
can cannabinoids actually be a

346
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,839
replacement for opioids is it two miles

347
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,759
it's too strong what will be the exact

348
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,120
dosages that we will need for patients

349
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:44,559
because patients will differ as i

350
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,879
mentioned earlier individualized

351
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:49,039
treatments and lastly

352
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:51,360
does cannabis actually help to improve

353
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:52,719
the quality of life of those patients

354
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,240
because we know with opioids you know

355
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,160
the quality of life the patients is not

356
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,000
really good you know the effect it has

357
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:00,639
on the organs the liver and all of that

358
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,120
besides the toxicity you know the

359
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,039
overdose and the um

360
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,360
is also the great concern and also the

361
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:09,120
opioid deaths or mortality rates that

362
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,200
we've been having so we're going to get

363
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,679
a lot of data out of it so we're really

364
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,639
excited to see uh you know where we can

365
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:17,199
we're going to head we're going to run

366
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:20,000
it for a year so we expecting to publish

367
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,440
and finish everything within a year

368
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,480
okay incredible i look forward to seeing

369
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,600
the results of that because i don't

370
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,200
think there's a country in the world

371
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,040
that doesn't somebody doesn't know

372
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,720
somebody who's been addicted to opioids

373
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:30,958
at some stage whether it started off as

374
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,879
back pain or whatever it may be so even

375
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,479
if you can turn those into blends with

376
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:35,919
cannabinoids and blend the bones

377
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,560
together so it's not as addictive would

378
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:40,479
be the the primary objective for sure

379
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,958
tell me this of all the places around

380
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,759
the world what country or what state or

381
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:49,119
what city implemented the best medical

382
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:51,278
cannabis access program that you know of

383
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,278
look uh are working very closely with

384
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:56,078
canada you know canada has been many

385
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:58,480
years ahead i have partners there as

386
00:12:56,078 --> 00:12:59,919
well who have helped us as well here in

387
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,399
south africa with a lot of things i'm

388
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:03,360
working with a lot of clinics in canada

389
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,679
as well

390
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,879
so um i really see canada you know with

391
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:09,120
the way that they're going with the

392
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:11,439
medical way forward um

393
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,440
i think it allows access to patients

394
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,959
it's still managed everything is still

395
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,959
controlled according to your standards

396
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:19,359
so i think it was they actually did

397
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:20,879
really well i'm also part of the society

398
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,039
of cannabis clinicians i'm one of the

399
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:25,278
board of directors in the us and the uk

400
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:26,719
so with the united states also you know

401
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:28,559
with the clinicians i'm working what

402
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,320
they really you know really really

403
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:31,838
forward thinking understand it really

404
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,519
good with the patients the access

405
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,200
unfortunately it depends on the

406
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,959
different states and the legislation

407
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,160
across states so that is the one issue

408
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:42,319
with the us um but for me i think canada

409
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:44,078
is still really uh maybe i'm a bit

410
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,399
biased because i'm working very closely

411
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:48,559
with the canadians but i've been to

412
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,839
germany now recently for icbc the

413
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:52,239
international cannabis business

414
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,079
conference

415
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,278
yeah so that was also awesome i've met a

416
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:57,278
lot of um

417
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:58,480
interesting people as well and i see

418
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:00,159
germany's trying you know to get the

419
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,199
medical moving forward and also trying

420
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:02,559
to see how they're going to work with

421
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:03,919
the recreational but there's still a lot

422
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:05,359
of stumbling blocks and things they're

423
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:06,879
looking at and then i just want to

424
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,959
mention one more country i'm working

425
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:11,198
with as well with thailand i mean

426
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:12,958
thailand's just opened up now um you

427
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:14,240
know they they obviously trying to find

428
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:15,759
their feet but i think they're allowing

429
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,519
a lot more access with regards to

430
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:18,879
patients and all of that so it's

431
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,480
interesting to watch and see you know

432
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,799
netherlands switzerland also you know

433
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,360
coming into play um

434
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:26,559
to see well you know what the medical

435
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,199
side as well

436
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:30,479
uh but i think canada for me because

437
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:32,479
i've been working closely with the

438
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,079
doctors and the clinics seem to be you

439
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,800
don't have a lot of patients have access

440
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:38,719
there's not too many restrictions

441
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,799
yeah for a lot of a lot of stick that

442
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,320
the canadian industry takes i think

443
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:43,919
they've gotten a lot of things better

444
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,079
than most other territories that have

445
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:47,679
legalized it's been an absolute pleasure

446
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:48,799
