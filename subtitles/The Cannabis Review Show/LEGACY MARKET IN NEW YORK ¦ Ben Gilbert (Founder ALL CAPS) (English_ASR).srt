00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,539
that means fall has officially started

13
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,520

hot but I've been I've been better on

28
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:05,039
all caps absolutely yeah I spent the

29
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:07,259
last 13 years or so in in New York media

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,420
uh I worked for Believe It or Not AOL

31
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,760
for many years for a website named

32
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,900
Engadget uh Tech website and prior to

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,640
that I worked for a video game

34
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,140
publication uh and then eventually a

35
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,319
Business Insider was that for the last

36
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,719
seven or so years uh and decided

37
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:23,519
approximately across the last year Well

38
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:25,438
doing a little coverage of the Cannabis

39
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,500
Market here and you know legalization

40
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:31,139
happened here in in March of 2021 uh so

41
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,359
ever since then really I mean to be

42
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,478
totally Frank going way back I've been a

43
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:40,739
cannabis user for 20 plus years uh daily

44
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:43,259
user I I've been a big fan of uh using

45
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:44,519
uh cannabis as a part of vacation where

46
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,560
like I go to California I go to

47
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:48,780
Amsterdam or whatever like I I have a

48
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,359
lot of love for the the culture of

49
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,799
cannabis personally uh and so I've been

50
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:54,118
I was watching it a little bit as a

51
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,159
journalist covering a little bit as a

52
00:01:54,118 --> 00:01:57,718
journalist uh I covered cookies a little

53
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,579
bit I covered some of the local growers

54
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:00,780
in New York and it really just seemed

55
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:03,239
like

56
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,618
a great moment to jump in like if there

57
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:05,938
was ever going to be a moment that I was

58
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:07,978
going to switch careers from journalism

59
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:09,840
into something else something else I was

60
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:12,539
really passionate about uh this was the

61
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,400
moment um so that's really been uh the

62
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:15,959
driving force for me uh I stopped

63
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,800
working as a journalist in June I

64
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:21,719
started my company in mid-july uh and we

65
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,640
launched the New York Growers cup soon

66
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:27,598
afterwards me and a couple of local

67
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:29,699
Growers uh in Late July so uh it's

68
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:31,318
really been you know out of The Frying

69
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:34,079
Pan into the fryer

70
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:36,839
Happy Days yeah a long time consumer and

71
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,280
use it myself as I said uh I love the

72
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,598
part that you use to go on holidays

73
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,180
that's one of the things I was over in

74
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:44,219
New York in June and I went over with my

75
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,420
wife and another couple friends and we

76
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:46,859
couldn't believe him me and my buddy

77
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:48,719
were like seeing weed trucks everywhere

78
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,459
and we were like a kid in candy store

79
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:53,340
you know and now that's been taken away

80
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:56,039
because the parking fines and the the

81
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,840
the different policy unions that happen

82
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:59,878
in Manhattan to be able to take care of

83
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,319
business but uh I can't wait until the

84
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:02,399
days now I go back over there towards

85
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:04,500
the end of the year I started next year

86
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,860
and there's real proper dispensaries

87
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,658
that I can go in and get a a full-scale

88
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,120
consumer experience

89
00:03:09,658 --> 00:03:14,399
for sure sure I I would say even right

90
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,379
now uh there are a lot of dispensaries

91
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,900
operating in the gray Mark it's called

92
00:03:16,378 --> 00:03:21,359
the gray Market I I to be totally honest

93
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,980
it's it's frankly like illegal so it's

94
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,260
not necessarily the gray Market it's

95
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:27,179
definitely just straight up illegal uh

96
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:28,318
that said there's levels of discretion

97
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,580
there's some places that are just

98
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:31,259
operating in storefronts that are

99
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,480
straight up operating a dispensary like

100
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:34,439
you would see in a legal State uh and

101
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,939
then there's some places that are

102
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:37,560
operating like social clubs or

103
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:39,658
consumption lounges where they also have

104
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,920
a dispensary within them and those are a

105
00:03:39,658 --> 00:03:44,098
little bit more discreet a lot of times

106
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:45,539
uh and so there's really like a very I

107
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:47,818
think that it's referred to often as the

108
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:49,079
gray Market here right now because

109
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:51,598
there's

110
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,280
there's some level of the state looking

111
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,560
the other way the city looking the other

112
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,299
way uh you know you you mentioned

113
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,340
briefly that that some of the trucks had

114
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:01,019
been had been towed have been fined uh

115
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,000
receiving pardon fines there was another

116
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:05,039
number of trucks that were fined for

117
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,840
having uh edible sales so they were

118
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,780
fined for essentially selling like food

119
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,819
without a license uh and so that that

120
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,860
did happen there's been some enforcement

121
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:16,500
measures on that but the city is still

122
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:18,180
Rife with trucks and people literally

123
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,819
setting up tables and selling it off

124
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,079
tables on the street so uh not a problem

125
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:24,120
if you want to visit New York City

126
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,939
there's still plenty of options for you

127
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,439
yeah we learned from my 420 jurors the

128
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:30,478
difference between a license and a

129
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:31,860
permit when it comes to New York is a

130
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,139
big difference between keeping your

131
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,460
business and not let's jump on to the

132
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:36,960
first topic that I kind of wanted to

133
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:39,000
talk to you about and it's the Legacy

134
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:42,239
Market in New York now I have a couple

135
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,339
of questions one is there a good Legacy

136
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,699
Market product in New York that's going

137
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:51,478
to be able to survive legalization and

138
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:54,180
two do you see let's say uh brand names

139
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:55,860
that used to be big in the Legacy in

140
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,900
Market in New York coming back to the

141
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,639
fore now because like what now you Gotti

142
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:02,279
does McDonald's the brand name is what

143
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:03,538
the consumer generally will uh move

144
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:05,579
towards

145
00:05:03,538 --> 00:05:07,199
definitely it's it's New York is a very

146
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:08,279
particular place and I I'm speaking

147
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,199
specifically in New York City of course

148
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:11,579
New York is a very large State there's a

149
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:13,919
very different Market Upstate than there

150
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:15,839
is downstate uh New York City though has

151
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:17,819
traditionally been a distributor market

152
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:20,279
so uh cannabis comes in from other

153
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:23,038
states and it gets sold here usually at

154
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:24,599
a markup uh largely from California

155
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:26,038
um and that's still the case for the

156
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,560
most part there's still a ton of

157
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:30,719
California product here uh that's being

158
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,600
sold and a lot of brand League uh

159
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,720
loyalty from the most hardcore the the

160
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,520
biggest uh biggest weed nerds in New

161
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,560
York City there's still a lot of loyalty

162
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:42,120
to large California Brands right you

163
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,240
still you still see a lot of that stuff

164
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,459
and a lot of that being sold and uh used

165
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,860
for Cloud online and whatever

166
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:52,138
um that said uh in terms of Legacy

167
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,060
growers in New York there's certainly a

168
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:55,560
number of those and they are just now

169
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,660
having a chance to really rise to the

170
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,538
Forefront uh and they're in varying

171
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:02,699
levels of uh Readiness for the

172
00:06:00,538 --> 00:06:04,800
legalization when they are able to apply

173
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:06,478
for cultivation license and stuff um

174
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,340
just because New York legalized in March

175
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:10,079
2021 does not mean that a lot of the

176
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:12,299
licenses are available yet as as you

177
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:13,680
mentioned so if you're a cultivator in

178
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,240
New York state if you've been growing as

179
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,939
part of the Legacy Market indoors

180
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,560
there's no real way to legally apply for

181
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:22,079
a cultivation license yet because the

182
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,180
state hasn't uh started that process yet

183
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:25,918
so uh there are a number of people

184
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,959
though who are long-time cultivators who

185
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:29,519
are part of the Legacy Market uh some of

186
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:32,339
which I'm working with on the New York

187
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:34,740
Growers Cup who are really really ready

188
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:37,019
uh who have investors who have

189
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,600
blueprints who have facilities that they

190
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:42,538
are in the process of starting leases on

191
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,580
and really ready to go and uh ready to

192
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:47,159
jump into the legal Market in a legit

193
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:48,779
way the moment that they are able to

194
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,880
um so I definitely see a lot of

195
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:53,098
opportunity for especially for Growers

196
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,918
here uh it's a lot harder though if

197
00:06:53,098 --> 00:06:57,418
you're if your business is being uh you

198
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:59,339
know a delivery service for the last 20

199
00:06:57,418 --> 00:07:01,620
years and your product is largely based

200
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:04,500
on California Brands it is still illegal

201
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:06,120
for you as a company to bring cannabis

202
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,579
from one state to another in the United

203
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,620
States and so there's it's it's hard to

204
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:12,538
know what the legal path is forward for

205
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,978
a big distributor in New York and that's

206
00:07:12,538 --> 00:07:17,098
certainly some of the biggest brands in

207
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:18,180
New York are Distributors so uh yeah one

208
00:07:17,098 --> 00:07:19,918
of the one of the things I'm looking

209
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,019
forward to most in New York that we talk

210
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:23,758
to other guests is that uh the Melting

211
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:26,279
Pot of culture is over there and ideas

212
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,479
uh in New York is like getting nowhere

213
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,459
else in the world as far as I'm

214
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:31,079
concerned and as he said I'm sure there

215
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:32,939
has to be some guy who's been growing

216
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:35,038
weed and in Brooklyn or something for

217
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:38,038
the last 15 years that's like the

218
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:39,598
greatest weed in the state and it hasn't

219
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:43,379
been able to expand that into a business

220
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:46,019
until now do you see a scenario with

221
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:48,060
they're going to use let's say ECS and

222
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:49,378
HVAC systems and it's all indoor or is

223
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:51,240
it going to be greenhouse because

224
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:52,800
obviously the climate doesn't allow for

225
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,780
more than one or two cultivations I'm

226
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,478
sure during the summer in New York

227
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:58,859
yeah there's been some so the first

228
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:00,719
licenses that were given out in New York

229
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,759
were all for outdoor Growers there were

230
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,039
hemp Farmers that were allowed to

231
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:06,479
essentially have like a turnkey solution

232
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:09,538
where they turned their Farm directly

233
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:12,000
into a cannabis farm from a hemp Farm uh

234
00:08:09,538 --> 00:08:13,620
because the hemp Market had uh uh the

235
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,220
bottom fell out for the most part on

236
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,959
prices uh so part of the New York

237
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,419
State's process of legalizing cannabis

238
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:24,180
has been to enable these outdoor Growers

239
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:26,698
to convert and as you say the climate

240
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:29,519
here is difficult uh it's humid it's

241
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:31,919
Mercurial uh right now it's raining and

242
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:34,918
very humid yesterday it was 95 degrees

243
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:36,360
three days ago 75 degrees it's very

244
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:38,519
tough if you're a grower and you're

245
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,320
growing Outdoors here uh humidity is a

246
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:42,179
notoriously huge problem with cannabis

247
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,680
growth as well where mold becomes a real

248
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:46,319
problem if you're dealing with high

249
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:49,859
levels of humidity on an ongoing basis

250
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,600
um so I would predict that the biggest

251
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,180
cultivators in New York state will

252
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,980
eventually be indoor grows just because

253
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:57,719
they're able to produce all year that's

254
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,339
that's really critical for the market is

255
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,540
being able to produce I mean in February

256
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,800
in New York there's nowhere you're

257
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:04,379
growing anything whether you're talking

258
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:05,879
about tomatoes or cannabis so you really

259
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:08,220
need to have a facility that's indoors

260
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:09,838
that enables you to work year-round uh

261
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,100
if you want to continue to satisfy the

262
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,680
market and the way that the market

263
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,120
demands uh so yeah I mean in the long

264
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,439
term I think that we'll still we'll have

265
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,940
some outdoor Growers there'll be some

266
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,620
seasonal outdoor Growers there's

267
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,600
certainly there's a lot of benefits to

268
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,919
going Outdoors all plants are outdoor

269
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,100
plants there's no such thing as an

270
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:28,019
outdoor plant so uh it's it's certainly

271
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,580
not a bad thing to want to prioritize

272
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:31,560
outdoor growing it's just that yeah New

273
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,660
York is a pretty terrible climate for

274
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:34,919
growing a lot of cannabis uh so I think

275
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:36,838
the long term will definitely see more

276
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:38,278
indoor but it's going to be a minute

277
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:40,500
before those those places come online

278
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:41,939
because the licensing again it just

279
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,778
hasn't started yet for for indoor

280
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,920
cultivation yeah I think the the

281
00:09:44,778 --> 00:09:48,480
Cannabis Taurus is going to be a big

282
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:50,219
huge Market in New York City anyway

283
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,200
obviously we know the state is so big

284
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,580
and I think that that consumer is going

285
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,500
to want the specific looking and

286
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,080
smelling type of flower which is pretty

287
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,399
much going to be indoor because you can

288
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:01,680
monitor pest control and so many other

289
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,778
different variables so

290
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:05,519
um tell me this do you is there a strain

291
00:10:03,778 --> 00:10:06,720
in New York that's individual well

292
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,399
obviously there must be that's

293
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,579
individual to New York that you haven't

294
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,799
seen anywhere else in in America and if

295
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:15,419
so is it on a par what's the stuff that

296
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:17,338
you see in California because over in

297
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:19,500
Europe you hear California weed is the

298
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:20,700
best you very rarely hear Colorado being

299
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,200
mentioned at all it seems to be

300
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:25,560
California you've gotten the marketing

301
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:28,140
campaign out uh done properly

302
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:30,719
all respect to California California has

303
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:34,019
some tremendous tremendous weed growth

304
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,540
grow Growers some tremendous weed uh

305
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:38,278
huge shout outs to to Doja exclusive

306
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:40,500
they they do some incredible stuff with

307
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:42,778
with the folks at wizard trees DB's like

308
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:45,120
I have a ton of respect for for the the

309
00:10:42,778 --> 00:10:46,379
cultivation World in California uh some

310
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,480
of the biggest breeders the the

311
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:49,740
foundation of the the current cannabis

312
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,079
Market the people who create the

313
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,519
genetics that become the hot strains

314
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:55,559
those are a lot of those are in

315
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,778
California uh so I want to start with a

316
00:10:55,559 --> 00:11:00,000
lot of respect for California uh but

317
00:10:57,778 --> 00:11:02,399
also it's really important that we

318
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,578
understand that a lot of a lot of

319
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:08,278
cannabis uh taste is regional so there's

320
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:10,799
for instance in La there's a lot of OG

321
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:12,958
being smoked uh there's a ton of of

322
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:15,059
that's like a thought of as a Southern

323
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:17,159
California strain right and in New York

324
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:20,458
you see a lot of different strains like

325
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:23,639
pif is is a huge name here sours are a

326
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:26,159
big thing here uh some really uh like

327
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:28,379
like specific New York strains that we

328
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:30,958
think of are New York Sour Diesel we

329
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:34,019
think of Cuban black Haze which is pif

330
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:36,359
uh hazes generally are very popular in

331
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:39,120
the Northeast and in New York

332
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:41,579
um it would be a misnomer to say that

333
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,039
literally any of these strains are from

334
00:11:41,578 --> 00:11:45,958
California are from New York are from

335
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:48,480
any of these places because truly

336
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:51,419
cannabis is not from it's not native to

337
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:55,019
the United States uh it's all of these

338
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:56,819
are derivatives of land raises from much

339
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:58,980
uh different places in the world that

340
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,240
have very different climates so the

341
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,240
current strains that we think of are

342
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,039
really these like manufactured designer

343
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,539
strains uh and so in terms of ones that

344
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:08,219
we associate with New York though like

345
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:10,319
New York City Sour Diesel is certainly

346
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:12,480
one of the like classic New York strains

347
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,579
that we think of and and pif is

348
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,920
definitely another huge one and we're

349
00:12:14,578 --> 00:12:19,739
seeing this amazing Resurgence in those

350
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:22,019
um recently uh from if I can just very

351
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,879
briefly give a shout out to uh the folks

352
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:25,200
at pithcoast farms they they have some

353
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:27,179
incredibly good pith they've been

354
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,160
growing they've been creating new

355
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:30,778
strains and there's really been some

356
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:32,578
amazing stuff coming out of the folks at

357
00:12:30,778 --> 00:12:34,860
The Collector The Collector stash they

358
00:12:32,578 --> 00:12:36,778
have some really great GMO they have

359
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,459
some really great chem dogs some strains

360
00:12:36,778 --> 00:12:40,919
that are like thought of traditionally

361
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:43,018
as associated with the Northeast and

362
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:44,159
that regionality is it's really great to

363
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:45,778
see those folks standing up and

364
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:48,360
representing the strains that we love

365
00:12:45,778 --> 00:12:51,000
here versus just seeing in a more gelato

366
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,220
or more uh of the strains that are

367
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,839
delicious and wonderful but are truly

368
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,120
California strains

369
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:58,980
amazing yeah I'm intrigued so when are

370
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,480
you hosting your Growers competition is

371
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:03,180
this going to be an annual thing is it

372
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,519
going to be like the emerald culpr how

373
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:07,199
are you formatting the whole competition

374
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:08,278
definitely definitely I I would love to

375
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,720
tell you it's going to be an annual

376
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:12,720
thing I don't want to ever get ahead of

377
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,160
myself uh ideally it will be this is

378
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,200
certainly the first annual New York

379
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:18,179
Growers cup and we've seen a lot of

380
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,440
success so far so I'm confident that

381
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:21,778
we'll have a second year and a third

382
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,279
year and so on and so forth uh I don't

383
00:13:21,778 --> 00:13:25,500
want to necessarily directly compare it

384
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:27,539
to something like the emerald cup or

385
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,919
many of the other excellent cannabis

386
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:31,500
competitions that happen all over

387
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:33,719
America and the world uh the New York

388
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:36,000
rose cup is really intended to highlight

389
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,920
New York Growers and so it's a

390
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,720
competition specifically among New York

391
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:41,939
Growers rather than a lot of

392
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,800
competitions you see allowing anybody to

393
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,660
enter from all over the United States or

394
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:47,519
even all over the world and that's

395
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:49,620
wonderful but given that we are

396
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,060
currently in the very beginnings of the

397
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,919
New York Market the New York Growers cup

398
00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:55,979
is intended to be like a foundational

399
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:57,539
event a means of highlighting the best

400
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:59,459
Growers here and connecting them

401
00:13:57,539 --> 00:14:01,679
directly to Capital directly to business

402
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:03,119
opportunities and enabling major

403
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:05,039
companies that want to enter the New

404
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,899
York Market to connect with New York's

405
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:08,759
best Growers because currently the way

406
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:10,860
the Opera the laws operate in the U.S in

407
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:13,799
terms of legalization is if you want to

408
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:16,199
sell weed in New York state legally you

409
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:17,819
have to grow that weed here and so if

410
00:14:16,198 --> 00:14:19,620
you're a big company if you're cookies

411
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,600
or you're the jungle boys or any other

412
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:23,399
of these big California brands that we

413
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,440
love if they want to really enter the

414
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:27,240
New York Market they need New Yorkers to

415
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,579
do that and so this is a means of

416
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,019
connecting companies like that with New

417
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:34,319
York's best Growers

418
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:36,060
incredible yeah it's uh it's amazing to

419
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,560
see I wish you all the best with

420
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:38,819
everything in the future lasting before

421
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:40,198
I go we've had a couple of comments

422
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,420
actually in previous episodes if

423
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:44,099
somebody wanted to get into working in

424
00:14:42,419 --> 00:14:45,778
the Cannabis industry in New York is

425
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:48,659
there specific sites where they can view

426
00:14:45,778 --> 00:14:50,698
jobs and they can peruse more details of

427
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:52,860
what positions might be available

428
00:14:50,698 --> 00:14:55,559
I think

429
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:57,720
there probably are you know there's

430
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:59,759
almost certainly a website or a

431
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,459
connection board for that kind of thing

432
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,259
I would not do that the way that I

433
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:06,059
entered the Cannabis Market in New York

434
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:09,778
the way that I entered the journalism

435
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:11,458
Market in New York is by starting just

436
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:14,338
start doing the thing you want to be

437
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:16,439
doing and and do that as as fast as

438
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:18,839
possible uh the only difference between

439
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,160
a journalist and a civilian is doing

440
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:21,779
journalism and the only difference

441
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,419
between being a part of the Cannabis

442
00:15:21,778 --> 00:15:25,620
industry and not is participating if you

443
00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:27,778
want to be a grower you should start

444
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,278
learning how to grow if you want to be a

445
00:15:27,778 --> 00:15:31,320
distributor you should start talking to

446
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:32,698
Distributors and figure out how to how

447
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,920
to work with them if you want to process

448
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:37,439
hash you should go work with hash

449
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:39,719
processors and figure out how to do that

450
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,279
um but the the very Baseline I would say

451
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,440
without having to invest a lot of money

452
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:45,299
without having to take a bunch of

453
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,639
classes or whatever is get on social

454
00:15:45,299 --> 00:15:49,439
media especially Instagram the Cannabis

455
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:51,539
media is largely the Cannabis World

456
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,639
excuse me is largely on Instagram and

457
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:55,980
reach out to people I'm know a lot of

458
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:57,720
very small Growers who have huge

459
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,920
connections just because they were

460
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,360
passionate and they reached out on

461
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:02,458
Instagram they reached out through

462
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:05,220
social media and they got in touch and

463
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:07,799
you know your passion comes through your

464
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:09,600
passion means a lot in any industry and

465
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:11,399
it's especially so I think in cannabis

466
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,320
where so much of the industry is driven

467
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:15,120
by people who are genuinely passionate

468
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,980
about the plant passionate about

469
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,740
creating this industry from the ground

470
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:21,060
up uh so I think that yeah I would start

471
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,740
with Instagram I would start with

472
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:24,239
YouTube look for Growers on YouTube look

473
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,740
for for the people who are doing stuff

474
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,940
there and just get involved with the

475
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,220
community as much as possible go to

476
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:31,920
